           FADE IN:

           A HUMAN FACE

           comes into SOFT FOCUS before us.  A man's ghostly silhouette,
           viewed through an otherworldly blue GLOW.  We can barely
           discern his features.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        My name is Alexander Valterovich
                        Litvinenko.  Call me Sasha.  

           We PULL BACK to reveal that he is not alone.  He is seated
           at a table with three other seeming ghosts.  

           We view the scene through a high-powered radiation sensor: a
           spectrograph.  The effect is akin to a night-vision scope. 

           The ghosts are drinking, toasting one another, laughing, but
           their words are as indistinct as their faces.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        One sunny afternoon in London, while
                        drinking cup of tea with some very
                        good friends of mine, I swallowed 
                        tiny nuclear bomb. 

           One of the men reaches offscreen and brings back a TEAPOT.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        This was not accident. 

           The teapot is GLOWING from within, phosphorescent, nearly
           burning a hole in the screen. 

           The ghost pours a cup of this phosphorescent liquid into
           Sasha's teacup, then pushes it across the table toward him.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I was given radioactive dose twice
                        that absorbed by persons standing at
                        center of Chernobyl nuclear meltdown.  

           Sasha takes the teacup and drinks from it. 

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I was given radioactive dose great
                        enough, if placed in city's water
                        system, to kill one million people.  

           Sasha looks at the cup quizzically.  The tea tastes odd.  

           The other ghosts' blurred faces are like masks: all we see
           are their smiles.  
           Finally, they rise from the table, shake hands, embrace, say
           goodbyes.  As they part, Sasha walks outside --

           EXT. GROSVENOR SQUARE -- SPECTROGRAPH IMAGE -- DAY

           -- into the crowded street, dense with pedestrians.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        And yet -- I am alive. 

           Now, as he moves through the crowd, we see that he too has
           begun to take on a phosphorescent glow.

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But as I lie here I can distinctly
                        hear the wings of the Angel of Death. 

           His hands are stained with phosphorescence from the teapot. 
           He emits faint traces of it as he walks.

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I may be able to give him the slip,
                        but I have to say my legs do not run
                        as fast as I would like.  

           His steps falter.  He feels unwell.  He stops.  Something is
           terribly wrong.  

           He stands utterly still, glowing from within as oblivious
           pedestrians stream around him.

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I think, therefore, that this may be
                        the time to say one or two things to
                        the person responsible for this act --

           He looks directly at us, and we

                                                                 CUT TO:

           HEADLIGHTS

           on a taxicab streaming through the rainy London night. 

           INT. TAXICAB -- NIGHT

           CLOSE on ALEXANDER "SASHA" LITVINENKO as he lies in the back
           seat of the Hackney carriage.  

           As the passing streetlights play over his face, he comes
           into sharp focus for the first time.  He is forty-three years
           old, blond, handsome, and profoundly sick.  He whispers:

                                 SASHA
                        Marusya.  Devotchka moya...
           He opens his eyes and gazes at his wife, MARINA, as she wipes
           the sweat from his face with a handkerchief.

                                 MARINA (O.S.)
                        Tiho, Sasha.  Tiho. 

           She is delicate, graceful, and afraid.  Sasha smiles sadly:

                                 SASHA
                        They finally got me. 

           INT. BARNET HOSPITAL -- EMERGENCY ROOM -- NIGHT

           The waiting area is standing-room-only.  We FOLLOW Sasha and
           Marina as she helps him through the crowd to the front
           reception area.   

                                 MARINA
                        Please.  My husband needs a doctor. 

           The ORDERLY doesn't look up from her computer.  

                                 ORDERLY
                        National Health card, please.   
                            (taking it from her)
                        Alan Carter?

                                 SASHA
                        No. 

                                 MARINA
                        Yes.  That's his name.  

           The ORDERLY looks at them.  Then:

                                 SASHA
                        I've been poisoned. 

                                 ORDERLY
                        Your symptoms are consistent with
                        food poisoning, Mr. Carter, but we'll
                        have to wait for the doctor to make --

                                 SASHA
                        Not food poisoning.  Poison poisoning.   
                            (off her look)
                        Murder.  Someone is trying to murder
                        me. 

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

           The ORDERLY leads a visitor through the fluorescent maze:
           BRENT HYATT (33) wears a cheap rainmac to protect his flash
           suit from the rain.  
                                 HYATT
                            (on mobile phone)
                        Right.  Take-away.  Tikka, Chicken. 
                        Naan.  Basmati.  Chutney.  Kingfisher,
                        the big one.  

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT

           Hyatt points to a man in one of the beds as he enters.  

                                 HYATT
                        That him?  No?
                            (to mobile)
                        Right.  English spicy, not Indian
                        spicy.  Now read that back to me.    

           He pulls back the curtain of the other bed -- it's empty.  

                                 HYATT (CONT'D)
                        Where is he?

           We hear a GROAN from O.S. 

           INT. BATHROOM -- MORNING

           Sasha lies propped against the bleached bathroom tiles,
           clutching his abdomen like a stab wound.  Marina crouches
           beside him, wringing out the rag she's using to clean him up. 

                                 HYATT
                        Alan Carter?  I'm with the
                        Metropolitan Police. 

                                 SASHA
                        This is not my name. 

                                 ORDERLY
                            (off Hyatt's look)
                        It's what's on his passport, his NHS
                        card, all his identification --  

                                 SASHA
                        They took away my name.  They gave
                        me new identity when I came here.  

           Hyatt looks right through him.  

                                 HYATT
                            (to mobile)
                        Right.  Twenty minutes.  Cheers. 

           Hyatt closes his phone.  He watches Sasha as he struggles to
           lift himself up.  Finally, he offers a hand. 
                                 SASHA
                        I don't need your help. 

           With enormous will, Sasha manages to rise to his feet.  

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        You don't believe me.  Do I sound
                        like someone named Alan Carter? 

           He pushes past Hyatt and staggers to the hospital bed. 

                                 HYATT
                        Right.  As a matter of policy, this
                        hospital notifies Scotland Yard when
                        a patient claims to have been a victim
                        of a crime.  A report must be filed. 

                                 SASHA
                        Of course.  Nothing must get in the
                        way of reports being filed. 

                                 HYATT
                        I'm told you're experiencing symptoms
                        of food poisoning.  Can you tell me
                        what you had for lunch, Mr. Carter?

           Sasha looks annoyed.  Then: 

                                 SASHA
                        Sushi. 

                                 HYATT
                        Right.  

                                 SASHA
                        I know what is food poisoning.  This
                        is not food poisoning.  This burns. 
                        This burns in my veins. 

                                 HYATT
                        Perhaps you can tell me who poisoned
                        you, Mr. Carter.  Do you have a name? 

                                 SASHA
                        I do.  

           Hyatt flips out his mobile to transcribe the name. 

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        Komityet Gosudarstvyennoi
                        Biezopasnosti. 
                                 HYATT
                            (typing furiously)
                        Crikey.  Spell that out for me, will
                        you?  Slowly this time. 

                                 SASHA
                        Is OK.  You just have to remember
                        the initials.  

           Hyatt looks down at his mobile's screen.  The name is a
           misspelled jumble, but the initials are clear enough: 

                                 HYATT
                        K-G-B. 
                            (looking at Sasha)
                        You're saying you were poisoned by
                        the KGB.

           Sasha nods slowly.  

                                 HYATT (CONT'D)
                        Right. 

           Hyatt SNAPS his mobile closed and walks out. 

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- MORNING

           Hyatt calls out over his shoulder to the orderly as he leaves: 

                                 HYATT
                        Next time run this through in-house
                        social services and save us all a
                        bit of time, yeah? 

                                 MARINA (O.S.)
                        They already did. 

           Hyatt turns.  Marina is standing in the corridor.  

                                 HYATT
                        What did they say?

                                 MARINA
                        I don't know.  Maybe they believe
                        him.  

           Hyatt laughs.  Looks at her. 

                                 HYATT
                        What do you think -- ?

                                 MARINA
                        I am Marina.  
                                 HYATT
                        What do you think, Marina?  

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

           CLOSE on SASHA as he watches from his bed.  Listening. 

                                 HYATT (O.S.)
                        Do you believe he was poisoned by
                        the KGB?

           Marina looks at Hyatt pleadingly.

                                 MARINA
                        He's my husband.  

           Sasha closes his eyes.  Hyatt glances at his watch. 

                                 HYATT
                        I don't have time.  My caseload --

                                 MARINA
                        Please. 

           Hyatt looks away.  He nods grudgingly.  He walks into the
           hospital room, where Sasha lies in bed with his eyes closed.  

                                 HYATT
                        Mr. Carter. 

                                 SASHA
                        Sasha. 

                                 HYATT
                        Sasha.  You do understand that there's
                        no such thing as the KGB anymore. 

           Sasha opens his eyes.

                                 SASHA
                        Is that what you think?

                                 HYATT
                        All that ended twenty years ago. 

           Sasha shakes his head.  

                                 SASHA
                        No.  That's when it began.

           He begins to drift away, losing consciousness, and we 

                                                                 CUT TO:
           ANOTHER WORLD

           Of ice and snow and jagged black granite as we SOAR overhead. 
           A herd of migrating caribou thunders below.  

           TITLE UP: NOVOSIBIRSK, SIBERIA -- 1984 

           Set against this uninhabitable landscape is a concrete
           APARTMENT COMPLEX.  A LONE MAN walks down its only street. 

           EXT. STREET -- NOVOSIBIRSK, SIBERIA -- DAY

           He is a shadow against the blinding whiteness, clutching his
           too-thin wool coat around him.  It's Sasha.   

           He pulls back his glove, checks his watch.  He's late.  Then
           he sees it -- a lamppost with an "X" marked in spraypaint. 

           He walks into the adjacent alley.  He pries back the plywood
           that covers a broken window.  Finally it comes loose.

           EXT. ROOFTOP -- HOUSING COMPLEX -- DAY

           Up here, there is no shelter from the piercing wind.  Sasha
           looks around, spots it: the chimney.  

           He kneels.  Reaches down.  Gropes around.  Finds it.  A rope. 
           He reels it in like an ice-fisherman.  Finally he lands it --

           -- it's a Kalashnikov rifle.  He turns and walks to the
           rooftop's edge.  Far below us, a black ZIL 119 sedan on
           chained tires rumbles down the street.

           Sasha crouches at the rooftop's edge as the ZIL pulls up to
           an empty storefront.  He can't fit his gloved finger through
           the trigger guard, so he pulls off his glove with his teeth.  

           A driver emerges from the ZIL as Sasha takes aim.  Another
           man -- a visiting dignitary?  -- emerges.

                                 SASHA
                        Zhdat', zhdat'... 

           Now another man emerges from the storefront.  They embrace.  

           Sasha hesitates -- the men turn to re-enter the storefront. 
           He's losing the target.  He pulls the trigger, FIRES --

           -- and a plume of BLOOD flashes amidst the snow.  Sasha looks
           at what he's done.  A moment's silence, then we hear it --

           -- the ALARM, like an air-raid siren.  Sasha rises, stunned. 
           He tries to throw the rifle down the chimney --
           -- but it won't leave his hand.  In the half-minute it took
           to pull the trigger, the gunmetal has frozen to Sasha's skin.  

           As the sirens HOWL, he tears the rifle from his hand and
           throws it down the chimney.  His hand is turning blue, the
           skin bleeding.  He looks for his glove, realizes, turns --

           -- to see it blowing off the edge of the rooftop, borne aloft
           on the wind, threatening to give away his location.  He turns
           and runs down the stairwell. 

           EXT. ALLEY -- DAY

           He races through the labyrinth of concrete alleyways,
           clutching his bleeding, freezing hand.  Then he sees it --

           -- a Lada Samara idling in the alley, waiting for him.  He
           climbs inside --

                                 SASHA
                        PoÃ©khali!  Itdi idti idti -- !  

           The driver, MISHA, is not much older than Sasha.  He puts
           the Lada into gear -- and we hear a loud GRINDING noise.  

           He tries again.  The car lurches forward.  Stalls.  Now,
           through the rear window, we see them --

           -- two SHADOWS approaching in the background.  Misha keeps
           turning over the engine, their desperation growing, and then --

           -- a great gloved hand SLAMS down on the roof of the car.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Get out.

           They cannot disobey.  They climb out to face COLONEL EGOROV,
           a stone-faced man in a leather coat.  He sniffs at the air. 

                                 EGOROV
                        Do you know what that smell is?

                                 MISHA
                        No, sir. 

                                 EGOROV
                            (to his partner)
                        You see, Kostya?  I told you.  Country
                        boys can be taught to kill.  They
                        slaughter pigs from the day they
                        learn to walk.  But put them behind
                        the wheel of a car -- ?
                            (to Misha)
                        What you smell is the clutch.  You
                        burnt it out.
           Egorov walks away.  In the distance we see the "visiting
           dignitary" cleaning the red paint from his neck.  As we pull
           back, we realize the entire town is a KGB training complex. 

                                 SASHA
                        Colonel Egorov?  What happens now?

                                 EGOROV
                        Exercise is finished.

                                 SASHA
                        But -- what happens to us?  

                                 EGOROV
                        You go back to the dormitory. 
                            (looks at his watch)
                        You completed your assignment.  Your
                        time was best in class, not counting
                        the business with the car.  You
                        continue in the program.  
                            (off Sasha's look)
                        You'll need this.

           He throws something at Sasha -- it's his lost glove.  We
           PUSH IN on the two young men: they can't help smiling.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        In 1984, if you were a young Russian,
                        there was no greater dream than to
                        become a member of the KGB. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A SECRET AGENT

           in a scratchy black and white movie: "THE SWORD AND THE
           SHIELD".  Soviet movie hero ALEXSANDR BELOV is confronted at
           gunpoint, Dr. No-style, by the evil Nazi General SCHWARTZKOPF.

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        These were the men who single-handedly
                        defeated the Nazis during the Great
                        Patriotic War.  

                                 BELOV
                        Do what you will to me, General.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER

           We PULL BACK, taking in the audience.  Entire families share
           meals in the aisles; old people sleep or drink vodka; young
           couples grope; and the young Sasha sits alone, rapt, reciting
           every word of dialogue along with Belov...
                                 BELOV/SASHA
                        Soon my comrades will overtake this
                        city, and your Nazi flag will come
                        down forever.  

           Belov pulls out a hidden revolver -- Schwartzkopf FIRES -- 

           -- and the battered, re-spliced B&W print JUMPS, clattering
           sprocket holes in the projector.  The re-spliced action
           sequence makes no sense, but Sasha is spellbound nonetheless. 

           We abruptly cut to the aftermath: a Soviet soldier atop a
           parapet, waving a Soviet flag over Berlin as Belov looks on.

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        These were heroes.

           INT. SOVIET YOUTH TRAINING CENTER -- DAY

           Two FENCERS square off, epees flashing in a furious flÃ©che
           attack.  We are in a large gymnasium, with a mural depicting
           idealized Soviet athletes with Olympic medals on their chests. 

           One of the fencers mounts a continuous riposte, risking a
           corps-a-corps collision -- and then he scores the hit.  The
           BUZZER sounds, and the fencer pulls off his mask.  It's Sasha.

                                 SASHA
                            (breathless)
                        The epee is mine.  If I can take the
                        pistol and riding events, there's
                        still a chance I can qualify --

           Sasha's coach, BUNIN, throws him a towel.  

                                 BUNIN
                        Rest now.  Don't talk so much.  Rest
                        for the next event.  

           Bunin gently takes Sasha aside. 

                                 BUNIN (CONT'D)
                        Sasha.  Time has come to think about
                        what you want.  

                                 SASHA
                        I want what everyone here wants.  

                                 BUNIN
                        The medal.  But why.  

           Sasha looks at him.  Is this a test? 

                                 SASHA
                        For Russia.  I want it for Russia. 
                                 BUNIN
                        There's someone I want you to meet.  

           In the distance stands an observer.  We can't see his face,
           but his suit gives him away as an official of the state.

                                 SASHA
                        Is he from the Olympic Committee?

                                 BUNIN
                        I don't think that's in your future. 

                                 SASHA
                        My times were improving.  

                                 BUNIN
                        You're getting older.  I have to
                        think of the team. 

           Sasha is crushed, but tries to hide it.

                                 BUNIN (CONT'D)
                        But in a way, for you, this is even
                        better.  

           Sasha doesn't understand.

                                 BUNIN (CONT'D)
                        The Company comes to me from time to
                        time.  I told them about you. 

                                 SASHA
                        What company?

           Bunin smiles.  

                                 BUNIN
                        In all the Worker's Paradise, there's
                        only one company.  The KGB.  That's
                        what they call themselves: Kontora.

           Bunin turns, and the observer approaches.  We recognize him
           at once: it's Colonel Egorov.  He extends his hand. 

                                 EGOROV
                        Hello, Sasha.

           INT. RED BANNER ACADEMY -- CLASSROOM -- DAY

           Sasha wears the uniform of a KGB corporal as he sits in a
           classroom taking a test. 
                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        At Novosibirsk we learned counter-
                        intelligence, KGB's Spetznaz hand-to-
                        hand combat system, codebreaking.

           We push in over his shoulder to see what he's working on -- 

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But there were other things we had
                        to learn about, things we had to
                        know in order to survive in America,
                        things we'd never even heard of --

           -- it's an ordinary bank check.  Sasha fills it out carefully,
           as if he were deciphering an exotic code.

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        -- things like banks, and credit
                        cards, and mortgages, and rent... in
                        a word: money. 

           Sasha is almost finished with the check.  He turns -- his
           friend Misha sits at the desk next to his.  Sasha watches
           his friend struggle helplessly with a credit-card application.

                                 MISHA
                            (whispering)
                        Credit reference?  Sasha, what is
                        this again?

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        You see, in the Soviet Union, money
                        didn't matter.  Money could even
                        attract the wrong kind of attention
                        if you had too much of it.  

           Sasha surreptitiously passes his own paperwork to Misha while
           the proctor isn't looking.

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        What was important was power.

           EXT. GORKY STREET, MOSCOW -- DAY

           Sasha and Misha walk Moscow's main thoroughfare, provincial
           kids in the big city for the first time.  They gaze up at
           19th-century Palladian mansions and apartment buildings.

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        If you had power and you saw an
                        apartment you wanted, it was yours. 
                        It didn't matter if someone was already
                        living there.  You just took it.
           A GAZ Chaika sedan with curtained rear windows pulls up to
           the curb.  A GRAY MAN climbs inside.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        There was a word for these men. 
                        They were Siloviki.  It means, simply,
                        "Men of Force".  

           The limo pulls away.  Sasha and Misha descend into a subway.

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        The Siloviki lived in a different
                        world from everybody else.

           INT. GORKY SUBWAY STATION

           The platform is packed with sweaty proles packed five-deep. 
           Sasha tentatively approaches a ticket-taker --

           -- and he flashes his provisional KGB badge.  The ticket taker
           shows him to a turnstile which leads to a separate platform.

           INT. KGB SUBWAY CAR

           Sasha and Misha walk into a well-appointed subway car that
           is empty but for four Siloviki in comfortable seats.

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        They had their own special subway,
                        which couldn't be found on any maps.

           The two boys do their best to look like they belong.  It
           doesn't work.  They step off the train and onto an escalator --

           INT. "THE WOODS" -- DEPARTMENT STORE -- DAY

           -- which unfurls into a mall-like complex sequestered from
           the rest of the city.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        They had their own private compound,
                        with a private spa and its own
                        department store, where you could
                        buy things that were only available
                        in the West.  

           They sweep past endless rows of Italian suits, French
           perfumes, blue jeans, Japanese hi-fi equipment.  Sasha
           approaches a microwave oven.  He opens and closes its door.

                                 MISHA
                        I've seen these before, Sasha.  It's
                        a breadbox.  It keeps the bread fresh.
                                 SASHA
                        Stupid.  Who needs this? 

           Sasha turns -- and then he sees them: ORANGES arranged in a
           small pyramid on a platform.

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        Misha, look -- !

           They approach the little pyramid of oranges.  

                                 SHOPGIRL
                        From Cuba.

           Sasha picks one up and smells it.  He reaches into his pocket
           and pulls out a wad of ruble notes.  The girl smiles.

                                 SHOPGIRL (CONT'D)
                        Take it.  It's yours.  Just take it.

           EXT. RED SQUARE -- DAY

           Sasha's thumbs dig into the orange and tear it in two.  He
           hands half to Misha, who walks beside him.  Sasha glances up --

           -- the other pedestrians on the street are staring at them. 
           Amidst the grey of Moscow's winter, the orange is the orangest
           orange on earth.  It's almost indecent. 

           Sasha pops a slice in his mouth.  He walks taller with every
           step, drawing energy from the orange, from the attention it
           attracts.  Then they round a corner, and they see it --

           -- a huge BRICK FORTRESS that spans several blocks.  They
           gaze up at it in awe.

                                 MISHA
                        That's it.

           They turn and embrace one another out of sheer excitement.   

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        Lubyanka Center.  In all of human
                        history, no single building has meant
                        death to so many people as this one.
                            (a beat)
                        But back then we didn't know that. 
                        We thought it was fucking Valhalla.  

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        Let's go.   
           INT. LUBYANKA CENTER -- GREAT HALL -- DAY

           A sea of crimson flowing banners and Soviet flags and
           triumphant MARTIAL MUSIC.  Young KGB officers in uniform
           stand in parade formation as a grey, featureless man, KOMMISAR
           VIKTOR KOVALEV pins KGB shields to their chests. 

                                 KOVALEV
                        Andrey Andreevich Vostoy, you will
                        be joining Fifth Directorate.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        The Fifth Directorate were charged
                        with enforcing Ideological Purity. 
                        They were the most feared men in
                        Russia.  The KGB of the KGB. 

           Kovalev moves down the line, until he arrives at Misha. 

                                 KOVALEV
                        Mikhail Georgeivich Brodsky, you
                        will be joining the First Directorate
                        of the KGB.  Well done.  

           Misha seems shocked at his own good fortune.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        The First Directorate was the KGB'S
                        elite: the men who went to America
                        as agents.  We'd made it. 

           Finally he reaches Sasha. 

                                 KOVALEV
                        Alexander Valterovich Litvinenko,
                        you will be joining the Third
                        Directorate of the KGB.  

           Sasha looks stunned.  Kovalev has already moved on. 

           INT. LUBYANKA CENTER -- GREAT HALL -- NIGHT

           Music, dancing, and lots of drinking.  Sasha stands at the
           edge of the circle, watching.  Careful not to attract too
           much attention, he picks up a glass from one of the tables...

           INT. LUBYANKA CENTER -- MEN'S ROOM

           ...and rinses it out.  He fills it with cold water, then
           heads back toward the party. 

                                 EGOROV (V.O.)
                        Litvinenko. 
           Sasha turns.  Colonel Egorov stands in the hallway, smoking
           a cigarette.  He holds his liquor well.  

                                 SASHA
                        Colonel.  

           The Colonel embraces him. 

                                 EGOROV
                        Serdechnye pozdravleniya.  

           Sasha bows his head in thanks and turns to go.  Then he stops. 

                                 SASHA
                        Colonel.

                                 EGOROV
                        Yes, Alexander Valterovich.  

                                 SASHA
                        Why Misha and not me?  I was smarter
                        than the rest.  I was faster than
                        the rest, stronger -- 

                                 EGOROV
                        You were. 

                                 SASHA
                        Then why wasn't I chosen for the
                        First Directorate? 

                                 EGOROV
                        You talk too much.  
                            (a beat)
                        You were too smart.  Too fast.  You
                        wanted to be the best, to get
                        attention.  It's a bad trait in this
                        profession.  The Kontora man never
                        stands out.  Never attracts attention.   

           Egorov admires a portrait of Yuri Andropov on the wall. 

                                 EGOROV (CONT'D)
                        You know, it's been said that our
                        own Chairman Andropov had no
                        distinguishing qualities at all.  
                            (a beat)
                        Counterintelligence is the place for
                        you.  You'll fit in there. 

                                 SASHA
                        I see.  Thank you, Colonel.  
                                 EGOROV
                        Wait a minute.  Come here.  What's
                        that in your glass?

           Sasha gives it to him.  Egorov sniffs it.  

                                 EGOROV (CONT'D)
                        Water.  

                                 SASHA
                        I don't drink, sir.  

                                 EGOROV
                        Why not?

                                 SASHA
                        I don't like to lose control. 

                                 EGOROV
                        You've never been in control.  

           He dumps the water on the floor, then hands Sasha the glass. 

                                 EGOROV (CONT'D)
                        No one trusts a man who drinks water. 

           Sasha turns and walks back inside. 

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        The Colonel was right. 

           EXT. MOSCOW STREETS -- NIGHT

           Sasha walks home from work, laughing with two comrades.  

           TITLE UP: MOSCOW, 1987

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        I was happy in Moscow.  It was good
                        to be KGB. 

           They approach an unmarked, windowless building, knock on the
           door, and show their badges.  The door opens and we enter

           INT. CLUB DZHERZINSKY -- NIGHT

           A nightclub wallpapered in red velvet, packed with Siloviki
           in booths, tended to by gorgeous Siberian girls. 

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        KGB had everything.  They even had
                        their own nightclub, named after
                        Felix Dzherzinsky, founder of the
                        KGB, with the most beautiful girls
                        shipped in from all over USSR. 
           A bust of Felix Dzherzinsky watches over it all. 

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        They didn't give us all this out of
                        kindness.  They gave us everything
                        to keep us from temptation.  And for
                        some, it still wasn't enough.  

           Sasha turns -- and spots Misha across the crowded room. 
           Sasha calls out to him.  He presses through the crowd --

           -- when suddenly there's a hand in his chest.  A Fifth
           Directorate agent gently takes him aside. 

                                 5TH AGENT
                        Major Brodsky is not available. 

           Sasha pushes the man's hand from his chest. 

                                 SASHA
                        So Misha doesn't want to be seen
                        with his old friends?  Then fuck
                        him, and fuck you too --

                                 5TH AGENT
                            (sotto voce)
                        Comrade.  It's you that doesn't want
                        to be seen with him.  

           Sasha looks at him, uncomprehending.  The agent walks back
           to the table, where Misha is very drunk.  

                                 EGOROV (V.O.)
                        You're friends with Misha Brodsky,
                        yes? 

           INT. SASHA'S APARTMENT -- BEDROOM -- DAY

           Sasha sits on his bed, talking on the phone as his first
           wife, NATASHA, looks on with keen interest. 

                                 EGOROV (V.O.)
                        He's back from the USA.  

                                 SASHA
                        Yes.  I know.  

                                 EGOROV (V.O.)
                        How do you know?

                                 SASHA
                        I saw him at Club Dzherzinsky.  

                                 EGOROV
                        You should invite him for a drink. 
                                 SASHA
                        Yes sir.  

                                 EGOROV
                        Tell him you're bringing two friends. 

                                 SASHA
                        What friends?

                                 EGOROV
                        You don't know them.  You just invite
                        him for a drink.  That shouldn't be
                        too hard. 

                                 SASHA
                        No.  It's not a problem. 

                                 EGOROV
                        Horosho'.  

                                 SASHA
                        Colonel.  Why are you asking me to
                        do this?

                                 EGOROV
                        Because you're his friend.  

           DIAL TONE. 

                                 NATASHA
                        What do they want?  

           Sasha gently puts down the receiver.  

                                 MISHA (V.O.)
                        It's not just the quality, Sasha. 
                        It's the variety.

           INT. SHERATON MOSCOW HOTEL BAR -- NIGHT

           Sasha, Misha, SERGEY and GENNADY drink, laughing loudly.  

                                 MISHA
                        Here, they all come in the same color. 
                        There, it's white, black, brown, any
                        color you want. 

                                 GENNADY
                            (laughs)
                        How about blue? 

                                 SASHA
                        You've had a black one? 
                                 MISHA
                        Of course, I would never compromise
                        my prime directive.  

           Everyone laughs.  Sasha knocks back another shot. 

                                 MISHA (CONT'D)
                        So you drink vodka now?

                                 SASHA
                        Just for tonight. 

           Misha looks at Sasha.  His expression clouds over.   

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                            (very drunk)
                        Any color you want.  Any size.  Cars,
                        washing machines, women.  One big
                        supermarket.  That's all it is.   

                                 MISHA
                        That's not all it is.  It's more
                        than that.  

                                 SASHA
                        Didn't take long, did it. 

                                 MISHA
                        You have no idea.  No idea. 

           Misha rises from the table. 

                                 MISHA (CONT'D)
                        I'm going for a piss. 

                                 GENNADY
                        I'll go with you.  

           Misha looks at him.  They exit, leaving Sergey with Sasha. 

                                 SERGEY
                        You know, Alexander Valterovich, you
                        can't talk a man out of a thing he's
                        already done.  
                            (a beat)
                        Finish your drink.  When they get
                        back, we're going.

           EXT. M10 HIGHWAY SHOULDER -- NIGHT

           Misha's SCREAMS and CRIES can heard over the HOWL of traffic
           from the M10 highway.  

           Misha stumbles along, PLEADING for mercy as Gennady kicks
           him like a deflated football along the shoulder.  
                                 SASHA
                        That's enough.  He made a mistake, 
                        he's sorry.  He's had enough. 

                                 GENNADY
                            (kicking Misha)
                        Shlyuha!  

                                 SASHA
                        That's enough, I said.  What is this?

                                 SERGEY
                        Vyshaya Mera.  That's what this is.  

           The words are a slap in the face.  Sergey offers him a gun.  

                                 SERGEY (CONT'D)
                        No?  Didn't think so.  

           Misha can't walk anymore, so they drag him facedown along
           the ground until they reach a suitable ditch.  Then they
           prop him up before it, weeping. 

                                 SERGEY / GENNADY
                        Predatel'. 

                                 MISHA
                        I'm sorry.

           In unison, they FIRE high-caliber rounds into the back of
           Misha's head.  Misha's body lands softly, his blood and brains
           melting through the fresh snow.  

           They walk back to their car.  Drivers on the highway have
           watched the entire thing, wide-eyed, causing a mini-traffic
           jam on the M10.  Sergey glares at them and they speed off.   

           Sasha stands by the ditch, staring at Misha's faceless body. 

                                 SERGEY
                        You staying or you coming with us?

           INT. SASHA'S APARTMENT -- BEDROOM -- DAY

           Sasha lies in bed, pale and hung over.  From outside he hears
           a woman's WAILING.  He rises from his bed, goes to the window --

           EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD -- DAY

           -- where Misha's wife is speaking to two MOSCOW POLICE as
           her uncomprehending CHILDREN look on.  

                                 NATASHA (O.S.)
                        What happened?
           INT. SASHA'S APARTMENT -- BEDROOM -- DAY

           Natasha, Sasha's wife, stands in the shadows as he looks out
           the window.  He whispers to himself:

                                 SASHA
                        Vyshaya Mera.  The punishment for
                        traitors. 

                                 NATASHA
                        What did they do to him?

           Sasha doesn't answer. 

                                 NATASHA (CONT'D)
                        We can't be seen with them anymore. 

                                 SASHA
                        Where are they going to go?  How are
                        they supposed to survive?  

                                 NATASHA
                        It doesn't matter. 

           Natasha dissolves into the shadows.

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        I felt such pity for his family. 
                        But for Misha, I felt nothing.  
                            (a beat)
                        To me, the USSR was the best, the
                        fairest society on Earth.  I couldn't
                        imagine how he could betray it. 

           Sasha drops the curtain, leaving us in DARKNESS --

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        And then everything changed. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

           -- and the curtain surrounding Sasha's bed is DRAWN BACK,
           flooding the room with daylight.

           Everything is OUT OF FOCUS: we can barely make out the forms
           of nurses and orderlies bustling around Sasha's hospital
           bed, and a DOCTOR's white coat talking to Marina:

                                 DOCTOR
                        Blood work and urinalysis all came
                        back normal.

           Sasha raises his hand and FOCUSES his gaze on it.  He runs
           his fingers through his hair.  His hand comes back matted
           with clumps of the stuff.
                                 DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                        Few cases of food poisoning last
                        more than 48 hours.  I'm going to
                        release him tomorrow.

           Sasha wipes the hair off on his bedsheet, then runs his
           fingers through his hair again.  It comes out effortlessly.

                                 SASHA
                        Is this symptom of food poisoning?

           The Doctor comes into focus as he approaches Sasha's bedside.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Hair loss is not a symptom of
                        poisoning.  It is a symptom of middle
                        age.

                                 MARINA
                        He always had the most beautiful
                        hair.  It's not like him.

           The Doctor turns to leave.  Sasha watches as Marina follows
           the Doctor into the hallway outside, whispering:

                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        Something is wrong with my husband.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Cephalosporin 40mg, twice daily, bed
                        rest, plenty of fluids.

           Marina watches him walk away.  She pulls out her mobile phone. 
           She scrolls through the names until she finds one labeled,
           simply, "BORIS".  She gazes at it for a moment, uncertain.

           Finally, she stabs the DIAL button.  Raises it to her ear.

                                 MARINA
                        This is Mrs. Marina Litvinenko.  Is
                        he available?
                            (a beat)
                        Of course.

           She gazes skyward, unsure, anxious.  Then:

                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        Hello, Boris.
                            (a deep breath, then:)
                        We need your help.

           Marina glances back at us.  An orderly pulls the curtain
           closed again, drawing Sasha into darkness...
                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        One morning, we woke up to find that
                        our country was gone. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A STATUE OF LENIN

           as it's dragged through the streets of Moscow behind a truck,
           throwing glowing sparks in its wake.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        For you, it was victory.  For us, it
                        was tragedy.

           TITLE UP: MOSCOW 1993 

           EXT. TYVERSKAYA PROSPEKT -- DAY

           As the statue passes, we MOVE with it through streets crowded
           with dazed, aimless-looking, hungry people.  Most stores are
           boarded up.  The ones that aren't have lines around the block.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        The ruble was worthless.  Millions
                        of people starved on the streets.  

           Now we hear SIRENS in the distance -- we turn another corner,
           breaking away, leaving the statue behind --

           EXT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY

           -- and approach the flashing sirens just as a government-
           issue VOLGA SEDAN pulls up outside the warehouse.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        They called it the Wild East. 

           A major bust is in progress.  ANDREI GUSAK, a dead-eyed
           chainsmoker with a scar down one cheek, climbs out.  

           INT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY

           As we enters the warehouse we see dozens of tattooed GANG
           MEMBERS lying facedown on the floor in handcuffs.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        The prisons just opened their doors
                        and let everyone out.  

           A MOSCOW PD officer leads Gusak to a platform overlooking
           the warehouse --

           -- and he looks out upon their haul: GUNS as far as the eye
           can see.  
           Crates of AK-47's, RPG's, rocket launchers, jeeps, even a
           MiG helicopter.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Thousands of men who'd taken the
                        Oath of Thieves in the Gulag were on
                        the streets.

           Now Gusak examines the gangsters as they're being photographed
           shirtless against the wall --

           INT. FLASH PHOTOS -- INSERTS

           -- and in a series of Weegee-like FLASH PHOTOS we see their
           elaborate tattoos depicting their lives and crimes: an entire
           pictorial history of Russia inked upon their wiry flesh.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        There was not one, but hundreds of
                        Russian mafiyas.  Not just the ancient
                        ones like the Slavs, the Mohammedans,
                        the Chechen Thieves' World --

           One after another, they flash countless indecipherable obscene
           gestures at us.  Finally, we recognize one of the gangsters --

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        -- soon policemen, military units,
                        circus performers, even Olympic teams
                        formed their own mafiyas.  

           -- it's Sasha, himself covered in tattoos.  Gusak roughly
           grabs him out of the lineup and leads him out.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And to stop it all, to hold back the
                        tide, there was only us.  Kontora.

           The gang leader, ORHUK THE BEARDED ONE, cries out to Sasha:

                                 ORHUK, THE BEARDED ONE
                        Kontoristi!  You're dead, blivad!  

           Sasha stops.  Turns.  

                                 SASHA
                        What's that?  

                                 ORHUK, THE BEARDED ONE
                        We know who you are.

           The other gangsters begin to chant Kontoristi, a low ominous
           oath upon Sasha's life. 
                                 ORHUK, THE BEARDED ONE (CONT'D)
                        You.  Your mother.  Your wife.  We're
                        coming for you. 

                                 SASHA
                        Why wait?

           Sasha reaches for Gusak's holster and pulls out a 9mm Makarov. 
           He hands it to the gangster.  The other cops react.  

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        Go ahead.  Kill the Kontoristi.  See
                        what happens. 

           He steps forward until he's at point-blank range.  The
           gangster does nothing.  

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        I think you already know.  

           Sasha quickly disarms the Bearded One by grabbing the Makarov
           and twisting it sharply backwards, twisting his finger and
           dropping him to his knees.  Sasha then hands the Makarov
           back to Gusak.  He announces to the assembled thugs:

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        When you get to prison, spread the
                        word.  Tell your friends.  The KGB
                        is taking back Russia. 

           EXT. TYVERSKAYA PROSPEKT -- NIGHT

           It's raining as Sasha, Gusak and the young PONKIN climb into
           their Volga.  They are a team of opers, Anti-Gang operatives. 

                                 GUSAK
                        That trick with the Makarov?  I never
                        get tired of seeing you do it.  But
                        someday somebody's going to pull the
                        trigger.

           Sasha doesn't answer.  He's trying to scrub off his temporary
           tattoos.  

                                 PONKIN
                        Did you see what those cavemen had
                        in there?  Fucking helicopter!  A
                        year ago it was knives and rocks!

                                 GUSAK
                            (shrugs)
                        The cavemen are biznesmeny now. 

                                 SASHA
                        We're all biznesmeny now.  
           He says it ruefully, as if lamenting Russia's lost innocence. 

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        Pull over here.  

           INT. BALLET STUDIO -- EVENING 

           BALLERINAS practice Arabesques to Prokofiev's "Romeo and
           Juliet".  Another world entirely from the street outside. 

           Sasha, Gusak, and Ponkin enter and everything stops, as if a
           pack of wolves had wandered in.  The studio's owner, OLGA,
           sees Sasha and smiles nervously.  

                                 OLGA (V.O.)
                        We can't pay this money.  Every week
                        they want more than the week before. 
                        Everyone pays, they said.  Everyone.  

           INT. BALLET STUDIO -- LATER

           Sasha glances at the studio mirrors: they've all been smashed. 

                                 OLGA
                        We're a ballet studio.  We don't
                        have this kind of money. 

                                 GUSAK
                        You should be happy with the Jap. 
                        Everybody needs a krisha these days. 
                        If it's not the Jap, maybe it's
                        someone worse.

                                 OLGA
                        The Jap is gone, disappeared.  No
                        one knows where.  It's Karoly now.  

           Sasha reacts with surprise. 

                                 SASHA
                        Lieutenant Karoly did this?   

           Olga sobs, nodding.  Sasha and Gusak exchange a look. 

                                 OLGA
                        Alexander Valterovich -- you could
                        be our krisha.  We could pay you. 

                                 SASHA
                        I can't do that.   

                                 OLGA
                        I don't mean to offend.  
                            (sobs)
                        These times we live in -- !
                                 SASHA
                        I'm not offended.  But we're not
                        like Moscow PD.  There's a code we
                        follow.  Some of us, at least. 

           Sasha takes it all in: the dancers, the music.  It seems
           like a remnant of a better time.   

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        We can reason with Karoly.

                                 GUSAK
                        You may have to hand over a little
                        babki each week so he doesn't lose
                        face -- 

                                 OLGA
                            (embracing Sasha)
                        You are an angel, like Vitaly says. 
                        Tonight I am having a birthday party
                        for a friend.  You must come. 

                                 SASHA
                        I'll try. 

           Olga kisses him goodbye.  Gusak and Ponkin smirk. 

                                 PONKIN
                        Sasha, you angel.  Are you going to
                        the ballet party?  You must come!    

                                 SASHA
                        You people have no culture. 

           INT. BAR LUBYANKA -- DAY

           A cavelike cop bar.  LT. KAROLY follows several football
           games at once on satellite TV as he works off a hangover
           with three of his opers.  He shrugs agreeably.

                                 LT. KAROLY
                        She'll still have to pay a little
                        something, of course.

                                 GUSAK
                        Of course.  Naturally.  Thanks, Volya.

           Sasha pointedly doesn't thank him.

                                 LT. KAROLY
                        You haven't touched your drink.

                                 SASHA
                        I'm nursing it.
                                 LT. KAROLY
                        You know, Sasha, it's social graces. 
                        The bottle gets passed.  Everyone
                        drinks.  After a while, someone
                        doesn't drink, people begin to wonder
                        if he didn't piss in it, you know?

                                 SASHA
                        You got me, Volya.  I pissed in it.

           Everyone laughs nervously.

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        Whatever happened to the Jap, anyway? 

                                 LT. KAROLY
                        He went home.  To Japan.

                                 SASHA
                        The Jap isn't Japanese.  

                                 LT. KAROLY
                        I know.  You should collect on a few
                        shopkeepers for yourself, Sasha.   

                                 SASHA
                        I'm busy.

                                 LT. KAROLY
                        Then we'll get some for you.

                                 SASHA
                        Too much work.

                                 LT. KAROLY
                        You'd only have to count the money! 

                                 SASHA
                        Eh.  It could get confusing, you
                        know?  Being Anti-Gang Division and
                        a gangster at the same time.  I might
                        get up one morning, arrest myself,
                        bribe myself, then beat myself to
                        death in custody.  Dangerous!

           Nobody's laughing.

                                 GUSAK (V.O.)
                        Don't even talk to me.    

           EXT. BAR LUBYANKA -- DAY

           Sasha and Gusak stand waiting for the light to change. 
                                 SASHA
                        You expect me to apologize?

                                 GUSAK
                        No.  I expect I'll have to apologize
                        for you.  Like always.

                                 SASHA
                        Don't worry.  Fat bolvan won't get
                        away with this.  When this gets out --

                                 GUSAK
                        He is getting away with it.

           Sasha thinks about this.

                                 SASHA
                        It's stupid, what he's doing.  

                                 GUSAK
                        Karoly isn't stupid.

                                 SASHA
                            (realizes)
                        He must have someone's blessing. 
                        Someone high up.  
                            (finally)
                        The krisha has a krisha of his own.

           Sasha looks stunned, and angry.  Gusak smiles. 

                                 GUSAK
                        Things change.

           INT. ROOFTOP PARTY -- NIGHT

           Christmas lights and Eurodisco music on a summer night. 
           Even amidst dancers, Marina is possessed of a unique grace. 

                                 MARINA
                        You invited an agent of the KGB to
                        my birthday party?

                                 OLGA
                        Marina.  They changed the name. 
                        It's not the KGB anymore.  

                                 MALE DANCER
                        KGB, FSB -- whatever they call it,
                        it's still Kontora. 

           People nearby overhear this.  They stub out their joints and
           rush to the bathroom. 
                                 OLGA
                        Besides, he's very nice. 

                                 MARINA
                        Olga, how could you?

           We hear the TOILET FLUSHING in the BG as people flush their
           drugs.  The rooftop is already starting to clear out --

           -- the crowd that separates Sasha and Marina dissolves. 
           Sasha is overdressed in a suit and utterly out of place.   

                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        Is that him?

                                 MALE DANCER
                        Dear God, he's coming this way...

           He slips away, leaving Marina alone.  Sasha approaches. 

                                 SASHA
                        Where is everyone going?

                                 MARINA
                        They're leaving.  

                                 SASHA
                        What for?

                                 MARINA
                        They're afraid of you. 

                                 SASHA
                        Oh.  Are you afraid of me?

                                 MARINA
                        I have nothing to be afraid of. 
                        Besides, it's my party.  I can't
                        leave. 

                                 SASHA
                        I'm very sorry.  I'll go now.  

                                 MARINA
                        No.  You are a guest at my party. 
                        Can I offer you something to drink?

                                 SASHA
                        I don't drink. 

                                 MARINA
                        Something to eat, then.  No?  Do you
                        dance? 
           EXT. ROOFTOP -- DANCE FLOOR -- DAY

           The dance floor clears out as the music changes to a
           sentimental Chanson. 

                                 MARINA
                        You dance very well.  Do they teach
                        dancing at Lubyanka?

                                 SASHA
                        No.  

                                 MARINA
                        You're a natural dancer, then.  

                                 SASHA
                        And you?  

                                 MARINA
                        I was, once.  I used to travel around
                        the world, dancing for the Motherland. 

                                 SASHA
                        What happened? 

                                 MARINA
                        They offered me the chance to join
                        the youth wing of the Party.  I turned
                        it down.  I was nineteen.  I couldn't
                        see becoming part of the system for
                        the sake of having a career.

                                 SASHA
                        What do you do now?

                                 MARINA
                        I teach aerobics to Japanese tourists.  

                                 SASHA
                        That was stupid.  

                                 MARINA
                        It probably was.  

                                 SASHA
                        I didn't mean that how it sounded. 

                                 MARINA
                        Yes you did.  I don't mind.  

                                 SASHA
                        I meant to say -- the system wasn't
                        perfect.  But it was fair.  Russia
                        was strong.  And people were safe. 
                                 MARINA
                        Some people were safe. 

           She pulls away from him.  The rooftop is near-empty. 

                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        It seems my birthday is over.  

                                 SASHA
                        I'm sorry. 

                                 MARINA
                        Don't be.  I have to get up early to
                        take a driving test that I will fail.  

                                 SASHA
                        You don't know that. 

                                 MARINA
                        Yes I do.  I don't have money to
                        bribe the examiner, so he keeps
                        failing me. 

           Marina puts on her coat. 

                                 SASHA
                        Let me drive you.  Moscow's dangerous. 
                            (as she walks away)
                        What's the use of having an agent of
                        the KGB break up your party if he
                        can't escort you home safely? 

                                 MARINA
                        I was raised in Moscow.  I'm not as
                        delicate as I look.  

           INT. LADA AUTOMOBILE -- DAY

           Marina sits behind the wheel of a tiny Lada hatchback.  A
           DRIVING EXAMINER sits beside her, examining his clipboard. 

                                 EXAMINER
                        Do you have the payment?

                                 MARINA
                        I paid my fee at the window. 

                                 EXAMINER
                        You waste the resources of the state
                        with this game, Miss.  It is a crime,
                        what you do.

           Someone slips into the seat directly behind him.  
                                 EXAMINER (CONT'D)
                        There are people who are forced to
                        wait months for a driving examination
                        because people like you insist --
                            (cranes his neck)
                        Excuse me.  Who are you?

           The RED BADGE of the KGB/FSB appears before him.  The very
           sight of it strikes fear into the Examiner.    

                                 EXAMINER (CONT'D)
                            (to Marina)
                        Take this to the window to collect
                        your drivers' license. 

                                 SASHA (O.S.)
                        What are you doing?

           The Examiner goes pale.  He tears up the form.  

                                 EXAMINER
                        She fails the test. 

                                 SASHA
                        Wrong again.  

           Now the Examiner is really frightened.  

                                 EXAMINER
                        There must be some mistake.  I've
                        done nothing wrong. 

                                 SASHA
                        Is that what you think?  

                                 EXAMINER
                        What do you want me to do?

                                 SASHA
                        I want you to do your job.  

                                 EXAMINER
                        I don't know what that means. 

                                 SASHA
                        You're so far gone you don't even
                        know what it means to do your job?

           The Examiner is on the verge of tears.  

                                 EXAMINER
                        I want to do my job.  Please.  Tell
                        me what my job is, and I'll do it. 
                                 MARINA
                        This isn't necessary. 

           Sasha leans forward. 

                                 SASHA
                        You're going to administer the test. 
                        If she passes, you give her her
                        licence.  If she fails, you don't. 
                        That's your job.  Can you do that?  

                                 EXAMINER
                        I think so. 

                                 SASHA
                        Good.  Let's go for a drive. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           MARINA'S DRIVERS LICENSE

           in Sasha's hands. 

                                 SASHA (O.S.)
                        Not even the photographers of the
                        Ministry of Automotive Vehicles can
                        dim your beauty, Marina. 

           Marina drives while trying to conceal her happiness at getting
           her license.  Sasha places her license on the dashboard,
           then gazes silently at his red KGB badge. 

                                 MARINA
                        What's wrong?

                                 SASHA
                        The red paint is beginning to wear
                        off, that's all. 
                            (a beat)
                        I've never done that before.  Used
                        my badge to frighten someone.  

                                 MARINA
                        I thought that was what they were
                        for. 

                                 SASHA
                        I just wanted someone to do something,
                        just once, without first collecting
                        a bribe.  

           Marina pulls over. 

                                 MARINA
                        Here we are. 
           Lubyanka Center looms in the distance.  She has given him a
           ride back to work.  She gazes at the fortress on the horizon. 

                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        The ballet studio.  Why did you help
                        them?

                                 SASHA
                        I don't know.  I thought it was
                        beautiful.  I wish I had a better
                        reason.  

                                 MARINA
                        There is no other reason.  

           She takes his ID badge from him. 

                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        Litvinenko, Alexander Valterovich. 
                        Captain, Anti-Gang Division.  185
                        centimeters.  81 kilograms.  Hair
                        blond.  Eyes blue.  
                            (a whisper)
                        What kind of KGB agent is this?

           She looks up at Lubyanka, then at Sasha.   

                                 SASHA
                        I'm married. 

                                 MARINA
                        I don't care.  

           They kiss, passionately, in the shadow of Lubyanka.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT

           Sasha is sleeping.  Brent Hyatt sits in a chair, studying
           him.  His mobile VIBRATES.  He answers, whispering:

                                 HYATT
                        Hyatt.  Yeah.  At the hospital.  The
                        Russian.  Dr. No.  I don't know. 
                        Sometimes I think he's having me on. 
                        Sometimes I'm sure of it.  Wait. 
                        He's waking up. 

           A SQUEAKING from the hallway outside.  Sasha wakes.  It's a
           bald CHEMOTHERAPY PATIENT pushing an IV drip.

                                 SASHA
                        My new comrade.

           Sasha nods to her as she passes, and she nods back.
                                 MARINA
                        No, Sasha.  She has cancer. 

                                 SASHA
                        It's not the cancer that makes her
                        hair fall out.

           Something seems to dawn on Sasha, a recognition...

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        Bastards.  Get me out of here.  

           He abruptly sits up and tries to climb out of bed.  Marina
           rushes to stop him. 

                                 MARINA
                        Sasha, no -- !

           Marina struggles to get him back in bed.  Hyatt watches the
           whole thing without lifting a finger.  HEADLIGHTS play over
           the window beside him.  Hyatt glances outside -- 

                                 HYATT
                        What's this?

           We PUSH OVER HIS SHOULDER to see what he's looking at:

           A CONVOY OF VEHICLES 

           pulls into the hospital's driveway: a MAYBACH LIMOUSINE
           flanked by two armored SUV's, all in black.  

           Marina approaches the window.  The Maybach's windowshade
           retracts, and a single dark eye peers out at us...

                                 MARINA
                        Boris.

           A BODYGUARD opens the Maybach's door.  A dark, bald, compact
           man emerges, wearing a bespoke suit.

                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        Sasha... Boris is here.

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

           BORIS BEREZOVSKY rolls down the hallway like a small tank,
           flanked on all sides by his team of bodyguards, his publicist
           LORD TIMOTHY BELL, and a private physician, DR. JOHN HENRY. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT

           Once the bodyguards have swept the room, Boris enters.  He
           approaches Sasha's bedside.  Sasha seems wary of Boris.  
                                 BORIS
                        What have they done to you, my old
                        friend?  I brought a doctor for you. 
                        He is world's foremost specialist.

                                 HYATT
                        World's foremost specialist in what?

                                 BORIS
                        Poison.   

                                 SASHA
                        Thank you for coming, Boris
                        Abramovich.

                                 BORIS
                        Sasha.  I would come from the ends
                        of the Earth if you were in trouble.

           Boris bows to kiss Sasha.

                                 BORIS (CONT'D)
                        I will never forget that you saved
                        my life.  

           EXT. MOSCOW SIDE STREET -- MORNING

           Boris Berezovsky slips out of his posh row house and into
           the back seat of a waiting Mercedes limo, and the car speeds
           off.  He takes a call on his 1995-era mobile phone.  

           Up ahead, the one-lane road is blocked by a little AutoVAZ
           with its hood up for repairs.  

                                 BORIS
                        What's the delay? 

           The car's DRIVER sees the Mercedes coming and runs away,
           abandoning his vehicle.  Boris sees this, realizes --

                                 BORIS (CONT'D)
                        ChÃ«rt poberÃ­!  Back up -- ! 

           THE CAR EXPLODES

           and the fireball BILLOWS skyward, shattering every window on
           the narrow street.  The Mercedes is blown off its tires,
           flipping sideways into the row of cars parked along the
           sidewalk.  A cloud of SMOKE overtakes everything --

           INT. MERCEDES SEDAN -- MORNING

           -- and all is darkness.  Boris looks up from the bottom of a
           deep hole.  The interior of the car is drenched with blood.  
                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        To some people, Boris' survival was
                        a miracle, an act of God.

           He gazes up into the light from the rear-passenger-side
           window.  Boris claws his way toward it, shoves the door open --

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But for most of Russia, it only proved
                        what they already knew: that Boris
                        must be in league with the Devil...

           EXT. MOSCOW SIDE STREET -- DAY

           -- and tumbles onto the asphalt below.  He crawls between
           two parked cars, taking cover --  

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        ...or, just perhaps, that Boris
                        Berezovsky was the Devil himself. 

           -- as the Mercedes gastank BLOWS and we 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           BORIS BEREZOVSKY

           working at a blackboard covered with abstruse mathematical
           formulae as he speaks, a cigarette dangling from his lips.

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Boris was a mathematician.  He worked
                        on Nobel Prize-winning research.  He
                        was one of the first in USSR to see
                        the end coming.  

           INT. UNIVERSITY CLASSROOM -- DAY

           We MOVE AROUND Boris, REVEALING that we are in a lecture
           hall packed with earnest students.  A Soviet banner overhead.  

                                 STUDENT 1
                        But Professor Berezovsky, isn't it
                        true that capitalism is nothing more
                        than the law of the jungle?

           We keep MOVING, revealing what Boris is working on --

                                 BORIS
                        The law of the jungle is the only
                        law that needs no police to enforce
                        it.  Soon it will be the only law
                        there is.
           -- it's not a mathematical formula, but a crude picture of a
           shark devouring a smaller fish.  

                                 BORIS (CONT'D)
                        If you want my advice, tovarischi,
                        you will leave this classroom today
                        and you will never return.  

                                 STUDENT 2
                        What would you have us study?

                                 BORIS
                        Biznes. 

           Boris looks at his watch.  Packs his briefcase to leave. 

                                 STUDENT 1
                        They don't offer business at Soviet
                        university!  Where are we supposed
                        to study it?

           Boris closes his briefcase and smiles. 

                                 BORIS
                        In the streets, children.  That's
                        where you'll find me. 

           EXT. MOSCOW BACK ALLEY -- DAY

           Boris kicks the tires on a Trabant 601 along with another
           professor.  Boris examines the car's lawnmower-like engine.

                                 BORIS
                        Two-cylinder, two-stroke engine.  A
                        masterpiece of socialist engineering!

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        Boris saved twenty years to buy his
                        first car.  He was forty years old. 

           Boris takes out a wad of ruble notes and starts counting. 

                                 BORIS
                        Professor Mostov and I can only afford
                        one cylinder apiece.  So we will
                        have to share the car.  

                                 BLACK MARKETEER
                        Very Soviet of you. 

                                 BORIS
                        It's a temporary arrangement. 

           Boris SLAMS the hood and hands the Black Marketeer his money. 
                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        Within five years, he was one of the
                        richest men in the world.  

           Professor Mostov starts to climb behind the wheel.  Boris
           pushes him aside. 

                                 BORIS
                        Me first. 

           Boris gets behind the wheel, puts the key in the ignition,
           TURNS -- the car's engine ROARS unexpectedly as we 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. MERCEDES -- NIGHT

           -- the German car's engine ROARS thunderously as Boris revs
           the gas.  The Mercedes rolls down a long metal ramp --

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        When the time came, Boris was ready. 
                        He bought Mercedes used in West
                        Germany then sold them for double
                        price in Moscow.  His biggest problem
                        was keeping up with demand.  

           -- and we REVEAL that it's one of twenty brand-new Mercedes
           being unloaded from a transport trailer as Boris's partner
           BADRI and a tattooed Uzbek MOB BOSS look on.     

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Of course, in those days, you needed
                        a krisha, a roof, to protect you. 
                        Boris' krisha was the ancient Thieves'
                        World of Uzbekistan.  

           The Mercedes drives up to us --

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It was the price of doing biznes.  

           EXT. MERCEDES DEALERSHIP OF MOSCOW -- NIGHT

           -- and we PULL BACK from the same gleaming sedan in the window
           of Moscow's first Mercedes dealership.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        Soon Boris had the very first Mercedes
                        dealership on the very finest street
                        in Moscow.  But people got jealous,
                        like people often do.  

           Suddenly the window SHATTERS before us as a brick crashes
           through it.  We PULL BACK --
                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        The whole thing ended in the final
                        battle of the Great Mafiya Wars.  

           -- to reveal a line of UZBEK GANGSTERS with AK-47s sandbagged
           on the rooftop, firing at a mob of angry SLAVS.   

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It was the Uzbeks versus the Slavic
                        Alliance, fighting for control of
                        Boris' car dealership, right across
                        from the Bolshoi Ballet.  

           The Slavs return fire from behind parked cars.  Theatergoers
           leaving the Bolshoi Ballet scramble for cover.  

           The Uzbeks hoist a shoulder-mounted RPG and LAUNCH it at the
           Slavs, DETONATING a the cars the Slavs are hiding behind. 
           The Slavs fall back, dragging their dead with them.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And when it was over, Boris was still
                        standing. 

           Boris emerges from his dealership to a chorus of shrieking
           CAR ALARMS, surveys the scene, and GRUNTS with satisfaction:

                                 BORIS
                        Horosho'. 

           INT. LOGOVAZ FACTORY -- ASSEMBLY LINE -- DAY

           All work ceases as Boris, Badri, and their retinue inspect
           the assembly line like the Party bosses of old. 

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        Boris went from selling cars to taking
                        over whole car company, LOGOVAZ.  But
                        this he did in his own special way.

           At the end of the line, Badri hands one of the factory
           managers an envelope filled with US dollars.

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        He paid the company's executives to
                        siphon its cashflow to shell
                        corporation in Switzerland.  Then,
                        when the company was starved and
                        ready to collapse, he bought it for
                        a fistful of rubles.  Or not. 

           EXT. PANEL DISCUSSION -- DAVOS, SWITZERLAND -- DAY

           Boris sits on a panel of mega-moguls alongside GEORGE SOROS. 
           Flashbulbs POP and WHIRR.  We MOVE DOWN the panel --
                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        One day they were students, cab
                        drivers.  Next day they were
                        billionaires.  Multi-billionaires. 
                        And Boris was their leader.  

           -- to take in the faces of self-satisfied young billionaires:  -
           ROMA ABRAMOVICH, MIKHAIL KHODORKOVSKY, MIKHAIL GUSAK, etc.

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        They called them the Oligarchs.

           EXT. DACHA DRIVEWAY -- DAY

           An OLIGARCH leaves his country estate and steps into a Bentley
           with gold-plated wheels.  As the car rolls away, we see that
           it is flanked on all sides by ARMORED SUVs carrying Kevlar-
           ed members of the oligarch's PRIVATE MILITIA.

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        For the first time in Russia, it was
                        money, not power, that mattered...

           EXT. M10 HIGHWAY -- DAY

           A ZIL limousine rolls toward Moscow, bearing a grey-suited
           Silovik reading his Pravda.  Suddenly, the very highway
           beneath us begins to RUMBLE --

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        ...And the Siloviki were left in the
                        dust.  

           -- and the Oligarch's convoy BLASTS past at 140 km/h,
           practically running the ZIL off the road.

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Or so it seemed.  Certain people got
                        jealous, like people often do.

           EXT. VOLGA RIVER BRIDGE -- DAY

           A GUNSIGHT flips up, drawing the Bentley into its crosshairs --

           -- and a shoulder-mounted ROCKET launches, its vapor trail
           corkscrewing over the river --

           -- and the Bentley is BLOWN CLEAN OFF THE BRIDGE, tumbling
           like a blackened beer can into the Volga below.  

           The convoy rolls to a stop.  The militia climbs out, gazing
           down helplessly at the Bentley bubbling into the water.  We 

                                                            MATCH CUT TO:
           BORIS' MERCEDES

           As it smolders in the alleyway following the car-bomb attempt
           on his life.  Firemen hose it down to douse the flames. 

           EXT. MOSCOW SIDE STREET -- DAY

           Boris sits on the curb where he took shelter from the blast. 
           He stares shell-shocked at the scorched hubcap in his hands.

                                 BORIS
                        My own car.  They tried to kill me
                        with one of my own cars -- !

           A leather-jacketed man approaches.  He flips out a badge --
           the Red Badge of the KGB/FSB.  Boris won't look at it.

                                 BORIS (CONT'D)
                        I have nothing to say.

                                 SASHA (O.S.)
                        Whoever did this will try again. 

           We TILT UP to reveal Sasha.  Boris glances at his badge. 

                                 BORIS
                        It's you I have to worry about.  

           Sasha takes out a business card and offers it to Boris.   

                                 SASHA
                        You can buy all the private security
                        in the world, but you still have to
                        live in Moscow. 

           Sasha walks away.  Boris looks at the card, bemused.

                                 BORIS
                        "Alexander Valterovich Litvinenko". 
                        Why should I trust you?

           Sasha turns.  

                                 SASHA
                        Even a criminal needs a cop
                        eventually. 

           INT. SASHA'S APARTMENT -- KITCHEN -- DAY

           A celebration.  The kitchen table is laden with serving trays
           and cookpots.  The women dole out dumplings, stew and stuffed
           cabbage leaves onto plates for the men.  Marina poses for
           pictures with Baby Tolik, who wears a Russian Orthodox
           christening gown.  Her mother NADJA takes the baby from her.
                                 NADJA
                        So big like his father!  Feels like
                        five kilos already!
                            (embracing her)
                        You did the right thing, Marina. 
                        The smart thing.

                                 MARINA
                        I don't know what smart had to do
                        with it.

                                 NADJA
                        Soon you'll get a bigger apartment.

                                 MARINA
                        Not with what Sasha brings home.

                                 NADJA
                        Marina.  Your husband is Kontora. 
                        What he wants he can take.

           EXT. SASHA'S APARTMENT -- BALCONY -- DAY

           Sasha wears a denim suit for the celebration.  Gusak and
           Ponkin stand with him on the balcony overlooking the 20-story
           apartment bloc.  They look serious, almost grave. 

                                 SASHA
                        You know something?  It was harder
                        to have someone killed back in the
                        old days than it is now.  There were
                        documents to be signed.  Permissions
                        to be granted.

                                 GUSAK
                        There was a system.  Now there is no
                        system.

                                 SASHA
                        Someone gets it in his head that
                        someone should be gone and it becomes
                        an order that has to be carried out.
                            (a beat)
                        This guy is one of ours --  

           The screen door opens: it's Marina's sister bringing plates
           of food for them.  Gusak waves her off.  The door closes.  

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        This is one of the good guys.  They
                        should give him a medal.

                                 PONKIN
                        They'll give him five medals.  And
                        one to the head, for insurance.
           Sasha takes an envelope from Gusak: inside is a surveillance
           file with a photo of a lumpy man named MIKHAIL TREPASHKIN.

                                 SASHA
                        They should be after the blijad that
                        sold the guns to the gangsters, not
                        the one who told about it.

                                 GUSAK
                        You know that's not how it works.

                                 SASHA
                        Let them find someone else to do it. 

                                 GUSAK
                        They want us to do it.  They want to
                        know where you stand.  It's a test,
                        Sasha.  Old-style.  A test of loyalty. 

                                 SASHA
                        No, it's not.  It's insurance.  If
                        we do it, they'll have the murder to
                        put on us if we ever try to talk. 
                        If we don't do it, they'll kill us. 
                        We're fucked. 

                                 GUSAK
                        You know what?  You're right.  You
                        had to mouth off to Karoly.  One
                        time too many.  This is what it gets
                        you.  So.  What's it going to be?

                                 SASHA
                        We're going to let it pass.

                                 GUSAK
                        They won't let it pass.  

           Sasha hurls the file at him.  Gusak steps aside and it flies
           over the railing.  Sasha shoves him, hard. 

                                 SASHA
                        You bring shit like this to my son's
                        christening?  What's wrong with you?

           Gusak shoves Sasha back, and Ponkin steps between them. 
           Gusak glares, but lets it go.  

           Sasha goes back inside.  Gusak and Ponkin watch as the papers
           drift to the courtyard below like dying birds.

           INT. SASHA'S APARTMENT -- LIVING ROOM -- EVENING

           The party has ended.  Sasha watches TV amidst the detritus. 
           The phone RINGS.  Sasha picks it up.
           Marina is washing the dishes in the kitchen.  She steps
           outside to find Sasha whispering urgently on the phone.

                                 SASHA
                        Don't let them take you.  If they
                        do, you'll die in custody.  They'll
                        call it a heart attack.  Try to hold
                        them until I get there.

           Sasha hangs up.  He grabs his jacket.  Sees Marina.

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        If I don't come back --

           Sasha hesitates.  She looks panicked.  

                                 MARINA
                        What?

                                 SASHA
                        Marusya.  Don't be afraid.

           He kisses her and goes.  She's left standing there in her
           dishwashing gloves, terrified.

           EXT. CLUB LOGOVAZ -- EVENING

           A large Palladian mansion in the center of Moscow.  A
           bulletproof SUV blocks the driveway.  Sasha steps past it --

           -- To find Boris' security detail face-down in handcuffs on
           the asphalt.  He crouches, whispers:

                                 SASHA
                        Who's inside?

                                 BODYGUARD
                        Moscow PD.

           INT. CLUB LOGOVAZ -- EVENING

           Boris' private club, complete with a stuffed alligator and a 
           PIANO PLAYER and BARTENDER who are both face-down on the
           floor.  We hear a loud POUNDING from upstairs --

           -- where five MOSCOW PLAINCLOTHES POLICE carrying riot guns
           are POUNDING on a reinforced metal door.

           INT. BORIS' OFFICE -- EVENING

           Boris is holed up inside, with a single bodyguard holding a
           shotgun covering the door as the cops POUND away.  He watches
           the cops outside from a surveillance monitor.  
           INT. CLUB LOGOVAZ -- STAIRWELL -- EVENING

                                 SASHA (O.S.)
                        FSB!  What's going on here?

           The cops all turn -- to see Sasha standing on the stairwell
           beneath them, holding his red badge aloft.

                                 MOSCOW COP
                        This is Moscow PD business.  We're
                        here to arrest Boris Berezovsky. 

                                 SASHA
                        Moscow PD!  My goodness!  Don't you
                        have any hairdressers to shake down? 

           The cop descends toward him.  

                                 MOSCOW COP
                        You go home now, bratÃ¡n.  You were
                        never here.

                                 SASHA
                        But I am here.  

           The cop raises his shotgun.

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        And three opers like me are on the
                        way.  

           The cop presses his muzzle into Sasha's cheek.  In reply,
           Sasha raises his red badge in his clenched fist, inches from
           the cop's face, as if it were a weapon.  Which it is.

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        Muzhik, beware.   

           The cop lowers his gun.  Gusak and Ponkin appear downstairs. 

                                 MOSCOW COP
                        We're going to ask around about you.

                                 SASHA
                        You ask around.  I'm very well-known.  

           The cops glower at him as they file past.  Sasha turns to
           see Boris Berezovsky standing at the top of the stairs.

                                 BORIS
                        How long until they come back?

                                 SASHA
                        They need permission to kill me first. 
                        That could take a while.
           Boris reaches into his pocket and pulls out a large roll of
           $100 bills.  He offers it to Sasha.  Sasha shakes his head.

                                 BORIS
                        Come on, take it.  Who refuses money?   

           Sasha says nothing.  Boris shoves the wad back in his pocket.  

                                 BORIS (CONT'D)
                        Here, then.

           He removes his watch.

                                 BORIS (CONT'D)
                        It's a Patek Phillipe.  It's a $50,000
                        watch.  

                                 SASHA
                        $50,000?  What does it do?

                                 BORIS
                        It tells time.  It's yours.  Take
                        it.   

                                 SASHA
                        My Volga keeps good time.

           Boris watches as Sasha walks away. 

           INT. SASHA'S APARTMENT -- BATHROOM -- MORNING

           Sasha is shaving when he hears his mother-in-law SHOUTING
           from the terrace.  He walks outside --

           EXT. SASHA'S APARTMENT -- BALCONY -- MORNING

           -- to find Marina and her mother already outside.  Everyone
           in the apartment bloc is out on their terraces, gazing down
           at a convoy of black SUV's waiting in the street below.

           INT. SUV -- MORNING

           The only sound is that of cut-crystal decanters tinkling as
           they ride in the back seat.  Marina stares at the tattoos
           etched upon the driver's neck.  Soon they've arrived at a
           private airstrip where a GULFSTREAM JET idles.

                                 SASHA
                        Wait.  What is this?

                                 BODYGUARD
                        It's lunch.
           INT. GULFSTREAM JET -- MORNING

           We PUSH down the aisle of the wood-paneled compartment. 
           Boris sits with his back to us, his Italian loafer bouncing
           nervously as he scans the morning's Pravda. 

                                 BORIS
                        You must be Marina.  So beautiful.

           Across the aisle sits a quiet blond man named ANDREI LUGOVOI.

                                 BORIS (CONT'D)
                        Sasha, I believe you know Andrei
                        Lugovoi already. 

                                 SASHA
                            (shaking his hand)
                        I thought you were still with FSB.

                                 LUGOVOI
                        I work for Boris now.  I'm his Chief
                        of Security.

                                 SASHA
                        You're doing a hell of a job.

           Lugovoi flinches a bit at Sasha's sarcasm. 

                                 BORIS
                        I hope you didn't have plans.  We're
                        going to Geneva.

           The plane is already taking off.

           INT. GULFSTREAM JET -- LATER

           Boris eats his soup course, napkin tucked into his collar.

                                 BORIS
                        With Berezovsky, nothing is hidden! 
                        Who I am, my history, everything has
                        been laid out for all to see.  This
                        is why I say I am the most honest
                        man in Russia today!   

                                 SASHA
                        There is a saying.  Behind every
                        great fortune lies a great crime.

                                 BORIS
                        Balzac.  You have good taste, Sasha.

                                 SASHA
                        I've never read any of his books.
                                 BORIS
                        Neither have I.  Who has the time? 
                        The idea is what matters.  Andrew
                        Carnegie, J.P. Morgan -- these were
                        hard men.  It took men like these to
                        build a great country.  

           Boris reaches over and opens the window shade.  The vast
           Russian landscape sprawls beneath them.

                                 BORIS (CONT'D)
                        Russia needs men like this if she is
                        to be a great country again.  But
                        she also needs men like you.

                                 MARINA
                        Like Sasha? 

                                 BORIS
                        The security services are corrupt. 
                        Someone has to clean them up.  A
                        brave man.  An uncorrupted man.

                                 MARINA
                        Sasha can't afford to be brave.

                                 SASHA
                        Marina. 

           Marina falls silent.  

                                 BORIS
                        We can help each other, Sasha.

           Sasha shakes his head.  

                                 SASHA
                        We're different, you and I.  You
                        want cars, watches, jets, factories. 
                        I don't want these things.  

                                 BORIS
                        Not everyone wants things.  But
                        everyone wants.  Even you.  

           Sasha is silent, wary. 

                                 BORIS (CONT'D)
                        I have friends in the Kremlin.  You
                        know this.  I own television stations,
                        media --

           Sasha reacts visibly.  Boris picks up on this.  He leans in:
                                 BORIS (CONT'D)
                        Tell me, Sasha.  What is it you want?

           Sasha thinks a moment.  Then: 

                                 SASHA
                        I want people to fucking listen.  

           INT. SASHA'S APARTMENT -- BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Marina watches Sasha as he gazes into darkness.  Baby Tolik
           sleeps between them.  Marina whispers:

                                 MARINA
                        He's a gangster.

                                 SASHA
                        He's a capitalist.

                                 MARINA
                        I don't like him putting ideas in
                        your head.  It scares me.

                                 SASHA
                        Somebody has to get the truth out.

                                 MARINA
                        You're a pawn to a man like him.  

                                 SASHA
                        A pawn is what I am.  He's giving me
                        a chance to be something more. 
                            (off her look)
                        When this gets out, the Kremlin will
                        have to investigate.  They'll clean
                        out the Bureau.  Men will finally be
                        recognized for what they've done. 

                                 MARINA
                        You think your life is some kind of
                        movie.  

                                 SASHA
                        There's a lot I don't tell you.  I'm
                        in constant danger.  They want me to
                        do things to prove myself.  If I
                        don't, they're going to kill me. 

                                 MARINA
                        Then quit.

                                 SASHA
                        You don't quit this.  
                                 MARINA
                        Then keep your head down.  Keep quiet.

                                 SASHA
                        Now you've waked the baby.  

           Sasha climbs out of bed.  Marina grabs his arm.  

                                 MARINA
                        This isn't a movie, Sasha.  This is
                        our life.

           INT. LUBYANKA CENTER -- ANTI-GANG HEADQUARTERS -- MORNING

           A great room with old Soviet desks in rows and yellowing
           portraits of forgotten apparatchiki.  Sasha enters to find
           it empty.  He goes to the samovar of tea, shakes it.

                                 SASHA
                        Empty.  Always empty.

           In the distance he hears SHOUTING.  

           INT. KOMMISAR'S OFFICE -- MORNING

           The entire department has been summoned here:  the Bureau's
           Kommisar, KOVALEV -- the same man who first gave Sasha his
           KGB badge -- is on a red-faced tirade.   

                                 KOVALEV
                        Russia is being picked clean by
                        parasites and gangsters!  And you do
                        nothing.  You pursue common thugs
                        while the real criminals eat caviar! 
                        Is there a single pair of true iron
                        Cheka balls left in all of Lubyanka?

           Approving nods and grunts from the audience. 

                                 KOVALEV (CONT'D)
                        Enough, I say.  Enough.  Let's start
                        with Berezovsky!  Who will volunteer? 
                        Who will kill this Kremlin jew?

           Silence.  Kovalev searches the crowd.

                                 KOVALEV (CONT'D)
                        Alexander Valterovich.  You're friends
                        with Berezovsky.

                                 SASHA
                        What?  No.  I'm not his friend.

                                 KOVALEV
                        Then you will kill him.
                                 SASHA
                        What?  What is going on here?

           All eyes are on Sasha.   

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        Is this a trap?  Is this room wired?  

           Kovalev says nothing.  Sasha raises his index finger to his
           temple, circling, as if to say "you're crazy".

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        I'm not saying anything.

           He turns and walks out of the room.

           INT. SASHA'S CAR -- UNDERGROUND GARAGE -- DAY

           Sasha sits behind the wheel, utterly wired.  Ponkin's in
           back.  Gusak slips in the passenger seat.  

                                 SASHA
                        It's out in the open, finally.

                                 GUSAK
                        You must admit you brought this on
                        yourself. 

                                 SASHA
                        Maybe.  Maybe.  But now there's just
                        one thing to do.

                                 GUSAK
                        Yeah.  What's that?  
                            (realizing)
                        No.  No.  You made me a promise.  

           Sasha says nothing. 

                                 GUSAK (CONT'D)
                        You son of a bitch.  I vouched for
                        you.  It's only because of me you're
                        alive this long.    

                                 SASHA
                        I can't keep quiet anymore.

                                 GUSAK
                        Anymore?  You never could shut up! 
                        You've fucked yourself.  Now you're
                        going to get us both killed.  Otvali,
                        what's the point?  I'll do you myself --

           Gusak reaches for his holster.  Sasha grabs his arm.  They
           struggle.  Sasha shouts:
                                 SASHA
                        Yeah?  Let's do it.

                                 PONKIN
                        Ho!  Not in the car!  

                                 SASHA
                        Let's do it.  For real.  A duel. 
                        Right here.  Swords or pistols.  I
                        should warn you, I'm very good with
                        both.

           Gusak just stares at him.  He's insane. 

                                 GUSAK
                        You and me.  We're done.    

           Gusak SLAMS the door behind him.  Sasha looks at Ponkin. 

                                 SASHA
                        So?  What about you? 

           INT. LUBYANKA CENTER -- ANTI-GANG HEADQUARTERS -- DAY

           Sasha walks the rows of desks.  One by one, without a word,
           he selects people, simply by tapping them on the shoulder,
           then pointing upwards, as if to say meet me upstairs.  

           The opers either nod, rise from their desks and quietly drift
           out of the room, or they shake their heads no.

           EXT. LUBYANKA CENTER -- ROOFTOP -- DAY

           Two dozen OPERS are standing on the rooftop, waiting for
           Sasha to arrive.  Sasha walks into the center of the circle.

                                 SASHA
                        Someday soon, each one of you is
                        going to be asked to commit murder. 
                        Some of you have already gotten the
                        order.  This is what it's come to.  
                            (a beat)
                        Each of you has three choices.  Number
                        one.  You can commit murder and get
                        rich.  The market price to commit
                        murder in Moscow today is $10,000,
                        and there's lots of work to be had.
                            (a beat)
                        Number two.  You can ignore your
                        orders.  If you do this, you will be
                        demoted, ostracized, and humiliated
                        but they'll never let you go.  Or:
                            (a beat)
                        Number three.  We can go public.

                            (a beat)
                        I don't have to tell you what this
                        would mean.  It would be like standing
                        in front of a cannon.

           Silence from those assembled.

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        Each of you has to make his own
                        decision.
                            (a beat)
                        As for me, my choice is made.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           SASHA

           as he walks down a backstage corridor wearing a dark suit. 

           Following him are a dozen other opers wearing ski masks and
           mirrored sunglasses to conceal their identities as they enter

           INT. INTERFAX NEWS AGENCY -- PRESS CONFERENCE

           Every flashbulb on Earth is inside this white room and they're
           all going off at once.  Camera shutters SNAP and WHIRR like
           hungry locusts.  The opers file in and sit down at a long
           table, with Sasha at its center.  They look around, a little
           dazed, muttering to each other through their ski masks:

                                 PONKIN
                        Fucking discotheque in here!

           Of all those at the table, only Sasha wears nothing to
           disguise his identity.

                                 SASHA
                        My name is Alexander Litvinenko. 
                        For the past several years, I believed
                        that I was a special agent of Russian
                        State Security.  I was wrong.  
                            (a beat)
                        Over the past several weeks I have
                        come to realize that I am actually a
                        member of a criminal gang.

           The camera shutters start CLICKING ravenously.

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        This gang is engaged in extrajudicial
                        killings, drugs, extortion, torture,
                        robbery, counterfeiting, weapons
                        smuggling, and contract murder.
           INT. SASHA'S APARTMENT -- LIVING ROOM -- DAY

           Marina's mother SCREAMS.  Marina enters holding the baby. 
           Her mother points at the TV, shouting:

                                 NADJA
                        Marina, look -- !

           Marina turns to see Sasha on television.

                                 SASHA (O.S.)
                        This gang goes by many names -- Cheka,
                        Kontora, KGB, FSB -- but it  has
                        only one intent: to gain a monopoly
                        on all criminal activity in Russia. 

           Marina covers her mouth in horror.  She's watching him commit
           suicide on live television.

                                 MARINA
                        Sasha -- nyet!  

                                 SASHA (O.S.)
                        I have personally been ordered to
                        commit murder to prove my loyalty to
                        the Gang from Lubyanka. 

                                 MARINA
                            (kneeling)
                        Tiho, Sasha!  No more!

           INT. BORIS BEREZOVSKY'S OFFICE  -- DAY

           Boris watches the broadcast from his sofa, practically purring
           with contentment.

                                 SASHA (O.S.)
                        The victim was Boris Berezovsky, the
                        billionaire industrialist.  

                                 JOURNALISTS
                        Why would anyone want to kill
                        Berezovsky?

                                 SASHA
                        They say Boris stole Russia.  They
                        want to steal it back.  

                                 JOURNALISTS (O.S.)
                        Mr. Litvinenko, why are you coming
                        forward now?

                                 SASHA
                        I am a patriot.  I love my country. 
                                 JOURNALISTS (O.S.)
                        Why didn't you simply resign from
                        the FSB?

                                 SASHA (O.S.)
                        You don't just resign from a gang. 
                        When you join, they own you.  Until
                        the day you die, or until the day
                        they kill you.

           Sasha motions at the others.  

                                 SASHA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        We have no choice, me and these men
                        who have joined me today.  We cannot
                        leave the FSB.  
                            (a beat)
                        So we are forced to save it.

           Boris reaches for the telephone:

                                 BORIS
                        Get me the Kremlin.  

           INT. THE KREMLIN -- MORNING

           Boris moves with silent steps down marble hallways where
           Rasputin himself once schemed.  He reaches a great wooden
           desk flanked by a military honor guard. 

                                 ATTENDANT
                        The President will see you now.

           INT. THE KREMLIN -- MAIN RESIDENCE -- MORNING

           Boris holds his breath as he enters the chambers where slept
           the Tsars, Catherine the Great, Lenin, Stalin.  He gazes up
           at the icons, the marble, the gold leaf... and he wants it. 
           He wants everything, but more than anything, he wants this.

           Then he hears a SOUND -- a splashing echo from the next room. 
           He moves toward the open doorway and peers inside

           INT. MASTER BATHROOM -- DAY

           A 65-year-old man crouches over the toilet, VOMITING loudly. 
           He is naked but for a pair of white jockey underpants.  Boris
           tries to duck away discreetly, but it's too late.  PRESIDENT
           BORIS YELTSIN beckons him forth, waving.

                                 YELTSIN
                        Borya, come here!  I need your help. 
                        It's this fucking cold.  I can't
                        seem to shake it.
                                 BORIS
                        There's a bad one going around. 

                                 YELTSIN
                        Get us a drink, will you?

           Boris goes to the nightstand by the bed, where rests an open
           bottle of vodka.  He pours a glass and brings it to Yeltsin.

                                 YELTSIN (CONT'D)
                        Where's yours?

                                 BORIS
                        I have meetings with City bankers
                        all morning long.  

                                 YELTSIN
                        Are you worried they'll mistake you
                        for a Russian?

           Boris flinches.  He pours a glass, and they drink together.

                                 YELTSIN (CONT'D)
                        Ah.  Better.

           The TV is playing footage of Litvinenko's press conference.

                                 YELTSIN (CONT'D)
                        Have you seen this?  
                            (realizes)
                        What am I saying?  It's your network.

                                 BORIS
                        That's what I wanted to speak to you
                        about, Boris Nikolayeovich.

           Yeltsin reaches for the intercom while pulling on his pants. 

                                 YELTSIN
                        Send Volya in, will you?

                                 BORIS
                        The Security Services have gone
                        rotten.  They can't be trusted.

                                 YELTSIN
                        Not by you, it seems. 

                                 BORIS
                        Exactly.  This proves what I've been
                        telling you all along.  There is a
                        plot to kill me.

                                 YELTSIN
                        So?
                                 BORIS
                        So... there can be no question as to
                        why this order has been given. 
                        Because of my loyalty to you.  Once
                        I'm gone, they can retake my network. 
                        My greatest fear is not for myself,
                        Boris Nikolayevich, but for you!

           Yeltsin nods.  He'd never thought of it that way.  

                                 YELTSIN
                        What are you proposing?

                                 BORIS
                        A new man to run Kontora.  An
                        uncorrupted man.  A brave man. 

                                 YELTSIN
                            (re: Litvinenko)
                        Him?  It's madness, what he's doing. 

                                 BORIS
                        The same might have been said of you
                        the historic day you climbed atop
                        that tank --

                                 YELTSIN
                        Yah, yah.  Enough.  I agree with
                        you, Borya.

                                 BORIS
                        I'm glad.

                                 YELTSIN
                        But I have my own man for the job.

           Boris reacts.  A door opens and someone enters the room.

                                 YELTSIN (CONT'D)
                        A man of lifelong service to the
                        state.  A man known to be untouched
                        by corruption.

           The man steps out of the shadows and into SHARP FOCUS.  A
           compact man, with a pale, clammy gaze and an air of supreme
           self-discipline.  He extends his hand toward us.

                                 YELTSIN (CONT'D)
                        This is Vladimir Putin.

           EXT. LUBYANKA CENTER -- DAY

           Sasha Litvinenko climbs the steps to the great fortress,
           clutching a briefcase and dressed in his best suit.
           INT. LUBYANKA CENTER -- MEN'S ROOM -- DAY

           Sasha stands before a mirror in the men's room.  He combs
           his hair.  Straightens his tie.  There is a sense of
           anticipation.  This is his moment.  

           INT. VLADIMIR PUTIN'S OFFICE -- DAY

           Vladimir Putin rises from his desk as Sasha enters.  He does
           not extend his hand.  

                                 PUTIN
                        Lieutenant Colonel Litvinenko.

                                 SASHA
                        Lieutenant Colonel Putin.

           Putin seems molded from the same concrete as his surroundings. 

                                 PUTIN
                        Please sit down.

           Sasha sits.  He gazes across the mausoleum-slab of a desk.

                                 SASHA
                        Felix Dzherzinsky.

                                 PUTIN
                        Excuse me?

           Sasha nods at a bust of Dzherzinsky behind Putin.  

                                 PUTIN (CONT'D)
                        Ah, that.  This was his office.

                                 SASHA
                        I didn't know that.

                                 PUTIN
                        I am having everything restored to
                        how he had it, down to the last
                        detail.  Then it will be made into a
                        permanent exhibition.  For visitors. 
                        Velvet ropes and all that.

                                 SASHA
                        Where will you go? 

                                 PUTIN
                        Down the hall.  An office more
                        suitable for a simple civil servant.

                                 SASHA
                        You won't have to restore much.
                                 PUTIN
                        Little changes have been made over
                        the years.  The integrity of the
                        design has been compromised. 
                            (a beat)
                        So much has been lost.  We have to
                        preserve what we can.

                                 SASHA
                        I agree, Lieutenant Colonel.  Boris
                        Berezovsky assures me that you share
                        my desire to restore the integrity
                        of our institution.

           Putin says nothing.  Sasha reaches into his briefcase and
           pulls out a stack of files.

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        These files contain information I
                        have collected over several years 
                        on corruption inside the bureau. 
                        Names, photos, financial transactions.

           Sasha places the files on Putin's desk.  Putin makes no move
           to examine them.  They lie there like a dead body, ignored.

           Putin stands.  Sasha stands as well.  

                                 PUTIN
                        Tell me.  Which directorate did you
                        serve in?

                                 SASHA
                        Third Directorate.  And you? 

                                 PUTIN
                        The Fifth.

           Sasha says nothing.  He waits for a goodbye.  When none is
           forthcoming, he turns and exits.

           Putin stands behind his desk for a long moment.  Then he
           reaches out with one finger and presses the intercom button.

                                 PUTIN (CONT'D)
                        Tap his phone.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           SASHA'S FRONT DOOR

           POUNDS, over and over again, splintering.  We PUSH IN on it --
           INT. SASHA'S APARTMENT -- LIVING ROOM -- DAY

           -- and it EXPLODES, disgorging a dozen MOSCOW POLICE with
           battering rams and body armor.  Marina SCREAMS.  Tolik
           SCREAMS.  They kick down the bedroom door --

           -- where they grab Sasha and shove him on the bed, bellowing
           obscenities.  They pin him, cuff him, lock him in a strangle
           hold, and drag him backwards by the throat into

           INT. FEDERAL COURTROOM -- DAY

           A CAGE of wrought iron stands at the center of the room. 
           The walls are painted bright red.  There are no windows.  A
           crowd of jeering FSB/KGB and Moscow Police officers has
           gathered nonetheless, spilling into the corridor outside.  

           Sasha stands inside the iron cage in shackles, pacing back
           and forth like an animal, shouting back at his tormentors.    

                                 JUDGE
                        Quiet!  If order is not restored,
                        contempt citations will be made!

           The crowd ignores him.  After all, they are the cops.  An
           elderly SHOPKEEPER sits in the dock, mumbling his testimony.

                                 PROSECUTOR
                        You'll have to speak up, sir.

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        I said:  "And that was when Sasha
                        demanded the money."

                                 PROSECUTOR
                        Precisely how much money?

           The shopkeeper glances into the crowd beseechingly. 

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        Ten thousand rubles?

                                 SASHA
                        He's forgotten his lines again!  

                                 JUDGE
                        Quiet!

                                 SASHA
                        Ratko, you know me!  How many times
                        have I helped you on the street?

                                 PROSECUTOR
                        He's tampering with the witness!
           The shopkeeper covers his face in shame.  

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                        I didn't want this, Sasha.  They
                        give me no choice!

           Chaos.  Everyone in the room is SCREAMING.  But Sasha screams
           loudest, clutching the bars and rattling his own cage: 

                                 SASHA
                        He admits he's giving his testimony
                        under duress!  What more do you need? 
                        This system is a fucking joke!

                                 JUDGE/PROSECUTOR
                        Quiet, you!  Bailiff!

           The Bailiff SLAMS Sasha's fingers with his billy-club.  Sasha
           recoils in pain -- then he turns and sees them --

           -- the CAMERAS from Channel One, Boris' network.  The cops
           are jostling them, trying to push them out the doorway, but
           the cameramen keep shooting.  Sasha raises his hands like a
           ringleader in a circus, ROARING:

                                 SASHA
                        You!  The cameras!  Get a good shot
                        of this!  Beam it off a fucking
                        satellite!  Let the world see what
                        justice looks like in our New Russia!

           Pandemonium.  The cops struggle to wrest the cameras away,
           but the cameramen keep shooting.  Sasha paces his cage like
           a panther, reveling in the madness.  Then he sees her --

           Marina, standing at the edge of the fray.  She's in tears,
           covering her face.  Sasha calls out to her:

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        Marusya.  Marusya!  Don't be afraid --

           But she can't hear him.  The judge pounds his gavel, looking
           directly at the cameras:

                                 JUDGE
                        Does the accuser wish to recant his
                        testimony?

           A bored SILOVIK in the crowd flips out his mobilnik.

                                 SILOVIK
                        The judge is ready to dismiss. 
                        Fucking TV cameras, that's what. 
                                 SASHA
                        Look at me, Ratko!  Don't look at
                        them, look at me!   These bastards
                        can't make you do this -- 

                                 SHOPKEEPER
                            (whispering)
                        Yes, Judge.  I wish to recant.

           More screaming and jeering from the crowd.  

                                 SILOVIK
                        The witness is recanting.  We'll
                        need to take Litvinenko.

                                 JUDGE
                        The accuser recants.  Criminal
                        proceeding #R994042 is dismissed
                        under the legal authority of the
                        Russian Federation. 

           The bailiffs open the cage and lead Sasha out as the crowd
           shouts and spits at them.

                                 SASHA
                        Take these shackles off me.  Marusya!

           Through the crowd, he finds her, her eyes shining with tears.

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        Marusya!

           He struggles to reach her as the bailiffs fend off the mob. 
           Then we HEAR something over the crowd --

           -- a low RUMBLE, thunderous and rolling toward us.  The
           confused courtroom falls silent.  What's that sound?  

           We PUSH IN on the Silovik as he leans against the wall with
           a satisfied smile, waiting for what is to come --

           -- and then it hits.  An EIGHT-MAN PARAMILITARY TEAM storms
           the courtroom bearing guns and ski-masks.  The mob parts  --

                                 MARINA
                        Sasha!  

           -- as they head straight for Sasha.  He holds onto the bars
           of the cage he's just escaped from as the paramilitary squad
           wrests him away.  The Judges rise from the bench, stunned:

                                 JUDGE
                        What's going on here?  What's
                        happening here!
           Sasha SCREAMS as the paramilitary squad peels him loose,
           lifts him up, and carries him forcibly out of the courtroom --
           and as suddenly as they appeared, they're gone.

           INT. ARMORED TRUCK -- DAY

           A THUD as we hit something metal.  Frantic, suffocated
           breathing.  We're inside a plastic garbage bag.  An ENGINE
           REVS.  TIRES peel.  We're moving fast, too fast.  CAR HORNS. 

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Otvali, I want him to see this.

           They pull off the garbage bag.  Sasha GASPS for air. 

                                 VOICE 2 (V.O.)
                        Open your eyes.  Open your eyes!

           Someone punches him in the head.  He opens his eyes --

           -- and we see the worst view on Earth through the windshield:
           the cold stone face of Lubyanka Center hurtling towards us.   

                                 VOICE
                        Now you make the trip to Lubyanka.

           INT. LUBYANKA PRISON

           The legendary prison GROANS around us.  Sasha is shunted
           down corridors and through doorways, the millionth rat in
           this ancient maze.  A door opens.  The Special Prosecutor is
           waiting for us, a file open before him.  His name is BARSUKOV.  

                                 SASHA
                        Don't waste your time with the
                        theatrics.  I know all the approaches. 
                        All the routines.  

                                 BARSUKOV
                        Litvinenko, Alexander.  You have
                        been accused of a criminal offense.

                                 SASHA
                        The case was thrown out. 

                                 BARSUKOV
                        Not that offense.  A new offense.

                                 SASHA
                        New offense?  What offense?  
                            (interrupting)
                        No, wait.  Don't bother.  Whatever
                        it is, I confess.  There.  Now that
                        that's done, you can execute me.
           Barsukov just looks at him.

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        What are you waiting for?  Do you
                        need me to sign something?  No? 
                        Then execute me.  We still do that
                        on the premises, right?

           Barsukov says nothing.

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        Oh, that's right.  You can't.  You
                        can't kill me.  You know why?

                                 BARSUKOV
                        Why. 

                                 SASHA
                        Because I'm famous.  And that makes
                        it so much harder.  It just wouldn't
                        do to have me turn up face-down in a
                        ditch one week after I accused FSB
                        of murder on international television.  

                                 BARSUKOV
                        You like being on television, don't
                        you?

                                 SASHA
                        Fucking love it!  I think I have a
                        talent for it, you know?  A face like
                        this is wasted in the Secret Services!

                                 BARSUKOV
                        You're disgusting.

           Sasha smiles.  Barsukov quickly recovers his composure. 

                                 BARSUKOV (CONT'D)
                        I don't think you appreciate the
                        gravity of the charges against you.

                                 SASHA
                        Let's hear it.  What's the charge? 
                        Murder? 

                                 BARSUKOV
                        You are charged with extortion.

                                 SASHA
                        What am I accused of extorting?

                                 BARSUKOV
                        You are accused of extorting... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BARSUKOV (CONT'D)
                            (reads from his file)
                        "...A can of sweet peas."

                                 SASHA
                        A can of sweet peas.

                                 BARSUKOV
                        It's a very serious charge.  Of
                        course, the courts face a heavy
                        caseload.  There is so much crime
                        these days.  

                                 SASHA
                        I never stole anything.  We both
                        know that.

                                 BARSUKOV
                        It may take a very long time to get
                        a hearing before a judge.

                                 SASHA
                        Who is this accuser -- ?
                            (catches himself)
                        No.  There is no accuser.  Look. 
                        There's no use in playing this game.  

                                 BARSUKOV
                        It's a very serious offense.  

                                 SASHA
                        There is no offense.  

                                 BARSUKOV
                        In time, as your case moves through
                        the system, you will face your
                        accuser.  Until then --

                                 SASHA
                        There is no accuser.  There is no
                        crime.  Just admit it. 

           Someone grabs Sasha from behind.  He struggles.  As they
           haul him away, Sasha shouts:

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        There is no accuser.  There is no
                        crime.  There is no anything.  There
                        is no fucking can of peas --

           They whisk him away to
           INT. LEFORTOVO PRISON -- DAY

           Sasha is led, shirtless, past lightless cells with men stacked
           to the ceilings in bunks, twelve or fifteen to a ten-foot
           cell.  They gaze out at us like chickens on a factory farm.

                                 BARSUKOV (V.O.)
                        Every prisoner at Lefortovo is an
                        enemy of the state.

           The prisoners are covered in PRISON TATTOOS.  Sasha is paraded
           before them, his pale, unmarked skin glowing in the dark.

                                 BARSUKOV (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Kontora killed their fathers, tortured
                        their brothers, raped their women,
                        worked them to death.

           Sasha pleads with the guard:

                                 SASHA
                        I need my own cell.  I'm a cop.  I
                        can't be in the population.   

           The guard doesn't hear him.  

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        I have friends on the outside.  Money. 
                        Anything you want.

           They approach a communal cell, with dozens of gang members
           pressed against the bars.   

                                 BARSUKOV (V.O.)
                        This is where you will wait for trial.

           The guard throws Sasha tumbling into the cell.  The tattooed
           crowd gathers round, then parts --

           -- to reveal ORHUK THE BEARDED ONE, the gangster Sasha sent
           to prison.  He gazes at Sasha and hisses:

                                 ORHUK, THE BEARDED ONE
                        Kontoristi -- !

           Sasha leaps from the ground, lunging at Orhuk -- the crowd
           is upon him, tattooed hands tearing him away as he sinks his
           teeth into Orhuk's face and holds on for dear life.

           We GAZE DOWN upon Sasha as the tide of tattooed limbs claw
           at him, tearing at his flesh, bearing him up on a swell of
           flesh, ink, grime and blood --
           -- and then it swallows him whole, and he is gone.

                                                               BLACK OUT.

           EXT. CONCRETE WALL -- DAY

           A great wall looms before us.  A metal door opens.  A wizened,
           emaciated man shuffles out.  It is only from his clothes
           that we realize it's Sasha.  Despite his condition, he smiles:

                                 SASHA
                        Devotchka moya.

           Marina has been waiting for his release outside the prison
           along with the 3-year-old Tolik.  She gazes at him, stunned.

           INT. MARINA'S CAR -- DAY

           Sasha sits in the passenger seat, motionless.  

                                 SASHA
                        When they put me into the population
                        I did everything I could to get
                        killed.  Then, when they put me in
                        confinement, I went on hunger strike. 
                        They were forced to release me. 
                            (smiles)
                        I knew they had to keep me alive. 
                        So I made that impossible for them.  

           Marina sobs.  Sasha reaches out to her. 

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        Kroshka.  Don't be afraid.  I've got
                        it all under control.

                                 MARINA
                        Is that what you think?

           Marina clutches herself, rocking back and forth.

                                 SASHA
                        You should have seen it, Marusya. 
                        Every day in the mines we walked
                        over fragments of bones from all the
                        men who had been worked to death. 
                        The other prisoners buried their
                        bodies where they fell and then kept
                        on working.  Everywhere, little pieces
                        of bone, like seashells on a beach.
                            (a beat)
                        I thought the system was broken. 
                        But this is how the system works. 
                        How it's always worked.  
                                 MARINA
                        What are we going to do, Sasha?

                                 SASHA
                        I've got a plan.

           INT. SASHA'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

           Sasha combs the apartment for listening devices.

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        I knew the whole apartment would be
                        wired when I got out of prison.

           He finds one in the kitchen lamp, the phone, the lightswitch.

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        This was good.  It meant they were
                        following textbook procedure. 

           He carefully replaces the fixtures, leaving the bugs in place.  

           EXT. STREET CAFE -- DAY

           An FSB agent in a ZIL across the street is watching Sasha,
           taking pictures.  Sasha moves his chair into the light to
           give the guy a clearer shot. 

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        They would also have someone informing
                        on me -- probably a friend.  It's
                        always someone from the old days.  

           Someone approaches his table -- it's Ponkin.  They embrace. 

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I thought it would be Gusak, but it
                        turned out to be my old friend Ponkin. 

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        I was thinking of taking the family
                        on holiday for a few days.  

                                 PONKIN
                        Holiday?  Yeah?  That's nice.  Where?

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        I was happy for Ponkin.  He was always
                        a good kid.  Informing on me would
                        advance his career.  
           INT. SASHA'S APARTMENT -- KITCHEN -- DAY

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        Most important was to make sure they
                        always knew my whereabouts.  The
                        intel from the wires and from Ponkin
                        had to sync up perfectly.

           Sasha literally reads his travel itinerary over the phone,
           enunciating loudly and clearly:

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        Then, on Thursday at 10AM, I thought
                        we'd go to the beach at Zelenogradsk.   

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I was going to have to bore them to
                        death.  Then could I make my move. 

           Sasha glances down at the table, where lies a PASSPORT,
           FOREIGN CURRENCY, MAPS, PREPAID MOBILEPHONES and SIM CARDS.

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        They could watch me, but they couldn't
                        kill me, as long as I stayed famous. 
                        Important thing was to stay famous.

           Sasha hangs up the phone.  We HOLD ON the phone --

           INT. SASHA'S APARTMENT -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT

           -- and then, hours later, it RINGS.  Marina is carrying Tolik
           to bed in his pajamas.  She picks it up.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Sasha Litvinenko.

                                 MARINA
                        May I give him a message?

                                 VOICE
                        Tell him we are going to kill him.  

                                 MARINA
                        Who is this?

                                 VOICE
                        Either him, or his son.  

                                 MARINA
                            (rising panic)
                        Who are you?  What do you want?
                                 VOICE
                        Sasha or Tolik.  One or the other. 
                        Deliver the message.

                                 MARINA
                        Who are you?  Whatever you want --

           DIAL TONE.  She stands there with the receiver in her hand,
           overcome.  We MOVE AROUND her to look through the doorway to
           the living room, where Sasha is watching television.

           She hangs up the phone without saying a word. 

           EXT. TYVERSKAYA PROSPEKT -- NIGHT

           Marina pulls her little car into a parking space.  She checks
           her makeup in the mirror.  Her hands won't stop shaking.

           INT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

           The Maitre D' unlocks the door and shows her in.  The
           restaurant is closed, but one table is set for dinner.  An
           old Silovik rises from the table as she approaches --  

           -- and, though he is ten years older, we recognize him at
           once.  It's Egorov, the man who trained Sasha.

           INT. RESTAURANT -- LATER

           A waiter brings plates of food.  Marina shakes her head.

                                 EGOROV
                        Please, eat.  My chef is the best on
                        Tyverskaya Prospekt.

                                 MARINA
                        You are very kind, just as Vladimir
                        Bukovsky said.

                                 EGOROV
                        He also said you were very beautiful.  

           Marina reluctantly picks at her food.

                                 MARINA
                        He said you might be able to do
                        something for Sasha.

                                 EGOROV
                            (shrugs)
                        I am retired.

                                 MARINA
                        No one ever retires from Kontora. 
                        Even I know that.
                                 EGOROV
                        Whatever influence I might have would
                        be meaningless.  Sasha's life belongs
                        to Kontora.  This is like a law. 
                        More than a law.  There can be no
                        exceptions.  If I saw Sasha on the
                        street, I would be honor bound to
                        kill him myself.

           Marina stares at him.  Then: 

                                 MARINA
                        They said they would kill my son.

                                 EGOROV
                        That's possible.

                                 MARINA
                        He's four years old.

                                 EGOROV
                        I don't know what to say.

                                 MARINA
                        Why not me?

                                 EGOROV
                        I don't understand.  

                                 MARINA
                        Why don't they just kill me?

                                 EGOROV
                        That would never happen.  

                                 MARINA
                        If you can kill my son instead of my
                        husband, then you can kill me instead
                        of them.

                                 EGOROV
                        We would never harm a woman.

                                 MARINA
                        Well.  You are men of honor.

           For an instant, the mask falls away. 

                                 EGOROV
                        Be careful what you say to me.

           Marina falls silent.  

                                 MARINA
                        Why did you agree to meet with me?
                                 EGOROV
                        Sasha is lost.  No one can help him
                        now.  But you can protect your son.
                            (a beat)
                        Cut all ties to Sasha.  Move to
                        another town.  The farther you are
                        from Sasha, the more likely they are
                        to seek him instead of Tolik.

                                 MARINA
                        That's it?

                                 EGOROV
                        That's all I can offer you.

           Marina rises to leave.

                                 EGOROV (CONT'D)
                        Sasha is a reckless man.  He was
                        wrong for us.  I could see that from
                        the start, but I did nothing.  He
                        was so gifted...

                                 MARINA
                        I know.  

                                 EGOROV
                        For this, I will always be sorry.  I
                        know you won't make the same mistake.

           EXT. MOSCOW STREETS -- NIGHT

           Sasha emerges from the Moscow subway.  He walks the streets
           without any attempt to conceal his identity.

           SIRENS blaze by.  Fire trucks pass, then an ambulance.  Sasha
           follows, passing people with panicked looks on their faces.

           There's an infernal glow on the horizon.  Sasha moves toward
           it.  We FOLLOW him round a corner to see

           A DEMOLISHED APARTMENT COMPLEX

           Lying in smoldering ruins.  Bodies are hauled from the
           wreckage as people watch in tears.  An OLD MAN hisses:

                                 OLD MAN
                        Terroristi!

           TITLE UP:  SEPTEMBER 9, 1999

           We PUSH IN on Sasha as he stands bathed in the infernal glow,
           a look of gathering recognition in his eyes...
           INT. SASHA'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

           Marina walks into the living room wearing the t-shirt she
           sleeps in.  The bombing coverage is on Channel One.  Sasha
           is working at a laptop computer via screeching dial-up modem.

                                 MARINA
                        Have you been up all night?

           Sasha puts a finger to his lips: hush.  He turns the volume
           on the TV all the way up.

                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        So loud -- !

           Then she sees what's on TV.  Bodies, wreckage, wailing
           relatives, angry onlookers.

                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        Oh God.  What now?

           Sasha unplugs the laptop.  Leads her outside, to

           EXT. SASHA'S APARTMENT -- BALCONY -- MORNING

           Sasha reads rapid-fire from his laptop screen:

                                 SASHA
                        June 22.  Three months ago. 
                        Moskovskaya Pravda publishes leaked
                        documents about Operation "Storm in
                        Moscow" in which the FSB would
                        organize terrorist acts to bring
                        about a state of emergency --

                                 MARINA
                        I'm not even dressed.  This is crazy. 
                        I'm going back in --

           She tries to go back inside, and he stops her.  

                                 SASHA
                        Don't go in there.  They're listening.  
                            (resuming)
                        Three weeks before that, Swedish
                        paper Svenska Dagbladet reported
                        that the Kremlin was planning "a
                        series of bombings that could be
                        blamed on the Chechens to justify an
                        invasion that would rally the public
                        around the new regime -- "

           Now, on the TV in the living room, a familiar face appears --
           -- the face of Vladimir Putin.  He is giving an emergency
           press conference, his voice bland and emotionless:

                                 PUTIN
                        ...These attacks must be answered
                        with force.  Russia will protect her
                        citizens from these terrorists...

           Beneath him reads: Vladimir Putin, President of Russian
           Federation.  Sasha watches Putin, and Marina watches Sasha. 
           Each is horrified, but for very different reasons.  Sasha
           resumes reading the evidence: 

                                 SASHA
                        There's more --

           Marina reaches out and covers his mouth.   

                                 MARINA
                        No.  No more.  Please.  Tiho.

                                 SASHA
                        Let go of me.  Don't you see what
                        they're doing?

                                 MARINA
                        They're going to kill Tolik.

           Sasha blinks, uncomprehending.

                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        They're going to kill one of you. 
                        You or him.  As punishment.  They've
                        been calling on the phone.

                                 SASHA
                        Why didn't you tell me this?

                                 MARINA
                        You have to apologize, Sasha.

                                 SASHA
                        Apologize?

                                 MARINA
                        You have to publicly recant everything
                        you said.  Like the old days.  Confess
                        your crimes.  Read whatever statement
                        they hand you.  We'll be ruined, but
                        they'll let you and Tolik live.

                                 SASHA
                        Marina.  This isn't the old days. 
                        They won't let anyone live.
                                 MARINA
                        It's our only chance.

                                 SASHA
                        Marina, these people blew up buildings
                        full of people!  They're not just
                        killers!  They're terrorists!  

                                 MARINA
                        I don't want to hear it!

                                 SASHA
                        And you want me to apologize?!

           She lunges at him, trying to cover his mouth. 

                                 MARINA
                        Shut up!  Shut up!  I don't want to
                        hear it!  I don't want to hear it!

           Sasha pulls her into a bear hug.  

                                 SASHA
                        Marina.  They're watching.  They
                        can't see this.

                                 MARINA
                        Shut up!  Shut up! 

           Marina struggles, then breaks down, utterly bereft:

                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        Oh God.  Not my baby.  Not my baby. 

                                 SASHA
                        They can't see this.

           He turns her so her back is to the apartment building opposite --

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING OPPOSITE -- MORNING

           -- as an FSB SURVEILLANCE OPERATOR wearing headphones steps
           out on his balcony with his morning tea and toast.  He looks
           through his camera's viewfinder --

           -- to see Marina in just her t-shirt on the balcony, with
           Sasha holding her.  He smirks and starts shooting pictures
           for his own private collection.

           EXT. SASHA'S APARTMENT -- BALCONY -- MORNING

           Marina is silent now, her eyes glassy, her face streaked
           with tears.  If Sasha weren't holding her, she would collapse.  
                                 SASHA
                        Marusya?  

           She doesn't answer.  He turns so his back is to the building
           opposite.  He reaches into his pocket and pulls something
           out -- it's a tiny ISM card.

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        This is a clean SIM card.  For your
                        mobilnik.  They don't know about
                        this number. 

           She looks at him, uncomprehending.

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        Wait a few days.  Then put this card
                        in your phone.

                                 MARINA
                        What -- ?

                                 SASHA
                        The plan wasn't supposed to go live
                        yet, but I have to move now.  I can't
                        tell you any more.  This is for your
                        own protection.  
                            (a beat)
                        We'll be together again, Marina.  

           Marina stares at him, expressionless.

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        I swear it.

           We hear an oncoming ROAR -- 

           EXT. TRANS-URAL EXPRESS -- DAWN

           -- as we ROAR out of a tunnel into daylight.  Sasha wakes in
           a cramped 3rd class compartment aboard the trans-continental
           train.  The endless Russian landscape is a blur.  

           He carries nothing but the clothes on his back and a crumpled
           PAPER BAG, which holds an object the size of a small handgun. 
           He gazes out at the approaching horizon --

           EXT. GEORGIAN BORDER FERRY -- EVENING

           -- and fourteen hours later, he's at a ferry crossing at the
           Russian/Georgian border.  Sasha eyes two RUSSIAN BORDER GUARDS
           with rifles slung over their shoulders as they examine
           passports at the checkpoint gate to the ferry.  

           Sasha checks his watch -- it's two minutes to 6PM.  He reaches
           into the bag -- and pulls out not a gun but a bottle of CHEAP 
           COLOGNE.  He splashes it on by the handful, then throws the
           bottle away.  He runs, as if racing to make the ferry.  

                                 GUARD
                        Passport and visa.

                                 SASHA
                            (searching his pockets)
                        Shit.  I forgot it.  Shit!  I've got
                        a girl waiting across the river.

                                 GUARD
                        So I smell.

           The border guards laugh.  Sasha reaches out, buddy-buddy --

                                 SASHA
                        Help me out.  If you saw what I had
                        waiting on the other side --

           -- and slips a 100-ruble note into the guard's pocket.

                                 GUARD
                        Maybe I should just take your money
                        and your girl.

           Sasha looks panicked.  

                                 GUARD (CONT'D)
                        Easy on the aftershave next time.

           The guard motions him through.  Sasha walks the gangplank,
           and as the ferry takes off, he watches Russia drift away.

           INT. SASHA'S APARTMENT -- BEDROOM -- DAWN

           Marina stands in the doorway, staring at her empty marriage
           bed.  Sasha is gone.  She goes to the closet --

           -- and pulls out all of Sasha's belongings.  QUICK CUTS: she
           stuffs all of Sasha's things into garbage bags, and her
           belongings into suitcases and boxes. 

           EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD -- DAY

           She throws the bags in a dumpster.  She packs the boxes into
           her little car.  When it's done, her face is soaked in sweat.

           She takes out the SIM card Sasha gave her.  She considers
           throwing it into the dumpster as well.  But she can't help
           herself.  She inserts it into her mobile.  It comes to life --

           -- and there is one INCOMING CALL on its screen.  She
           hesitates, then presses the button to return the call --
                                 SASHA (O.S.)
                        Devotchka moya.

           Marina hesitates, then:

                                 MARINA
                        Where are you?

           EXT. ISTANBUL, TURKEY -- DAY

           The minarets of Topkapi and the Blue Mosque loom in the
           distance.  Sasha stands on the terrace of his hotel. 

                                 SASHA
                        I'd rather not say.  We have to be
                        careful.  Look, I want you to book a
                        package tour somewhere in the West. 
                        Costa del Sol, something like that. 
                        When you get there, I'll contact you
                        on this number with more instructions --

                                 MARINA (V.O.)
                        I'm not going.

                                 SASHA
                        What?

           EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD -- NIGHT

                                 MARINA
                        I'm happy you made it, Sasha.  But
                        Tolik and I won't go with you.  

                                 SASHA
                        Marina, we're almost clear!  I've
                        been planning this operation for
                        weeks!  They'll never find us --

                                 MARINA
                        It's you that I'm afraid of.

           A stunned SILENCE on the other end.  

                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        You can't change, Sasha.  It's what
                        you live for.  This fight.  You feed
                        on it.  For me, I don't care.  I
                        would die with you.  But not Tolik. 
                        I can't bear to leave you, Sasha. 
                        But I will, for him. 

                                 SASHA
                        Marusya, I love you --
                                 MARINA
                        It doesn't matter.  

           INT. SASHA'S APARTMENT -- BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Marina lies on the bare mattress with Tolik in her arms. 
           Their bags are packed and ready to leave the next morning.

           The phone RINGS.  Marina rises.  She goes to the kitchen
           phone, stares at it, but doesn't pick up.  She steps outside --

           EXT. SASHA'S APARTMENT -- BALCONY

           -- and looks down.  Boris' armored convoy is idling below,
           waiting for her.

                                 MARINA (V.O.)
                        My decision is made.

           INT. ARMORED MERCEDES -- NIGHT

           Tolik sleeps in the front passenger seat next to Boris'
           bodyguard/driver.  Boris and Marina sit in the back seat.

                                 BORIS
                        I'm sure you think it is.  But you
                        will go with Sasha.  You will go
                        with him because you love him, and
                        because he will die without you.

                                 MARINA
                        I didn't realize you were a romantic. 

                                 BORIS
                        I'm not.  I'm a mathematician.  You
                        see, like numbers, human emotions
                        have an inescapable logic.  
                            (a beat)
                        Sasha loves you.  Am I correct?

                                 MARINA
                        Yes. 

                                 BORIS
                        If you don't go to Turkey, Sasha
                        will come back here for you.  He
                        won't be able to help himself.  When
                        he returns, they will kill him.

           Marina is silent.  He's right.    

                                 BORIS (CONT'D)
                        You are faced with a choice between
                        the possibility of Tolik's murder 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BORIS (CONT'D)
                        and the certainty of Sasha's.  You
                        will be compelled to take a chance
                        on Sasha.  Because you love Sasha as
                        much as he loves you.  Maybe more.
                            (a beat)
                        Is there a flaw in my reasoning?

           Marina can't breathe. 

                                 MARINA
                        No.  

           She looks out the window: they have arrived at the airport.  

                                 BORIS
                        When you reach Spain, you should
                        immediately board a flight for Ankara.

           Boris hands Marina a pair of airline tickets.

                                 MARINA
                        But our things -- my clothes, and
                        Tolik's -- 

                                 BORIS
                        There's no time.  You must leave
                        now, before they know Sasha is gone. 

           Marina climbs out of the car, then takes Tolik from the front
           seat, bundling him up in her arms.  She turns: 

                                 MARINA
                        What do you get out of all this?

                                 BORIS
                        Everything.

           INT. ANKARA AIRPORT -- DAY

           Marina and Tolik exit their plane, utterly bleary after 24
           hours of nonstop flying.  Marina looks up, sees him --

           -- it's Sasha, wearing sunglasses and a tan, like an actor
           in a spy movie of his own imagining.  Tolik runs into his
           arms.  In spite of herself, Marina smiles. 

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        American Embassy is surrounded by
                        FSB surveillance, 24 hours a day.

           INT. TAXICAB -- AMERICAN EMBASSY -- ANKARA, TURKEY -- DAY

           The American Flag flies atop the white-walled compound. 
           Sasha and Marina eye it from the back of a taxi. 
                                 SASHA
                        It's standard procedure.  They
                        photograph everyone.  As soon as we
                        walk in, they'll know we're in Ankara.  

                                 MARINA
                        Sasha -- I don't want to hear things
                        like that anymore.

           Sasha nods, chastened.  

                                 SASHA
                        I never meant to frighten you.  

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                            (brightening)
                        That's all over now.  Tonight we
                        sleep in a hotel suite, with clean
                        sheets, and room service.  Tomorrow
                        we fly to America, and we begin again.  
                            (to Tolik)
                        How does that sound?  Are you ready? 
                        Let's go for a walk. 

           EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY -- ANKARA, TURKEY

           We watch the small family through a TELEPHOTO LENS as they
           walk hand-in-hand up the stairway to the American Embassy. 
           A SHUTTER CLOSES and we cut to

           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY -- CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

           Sasha sits alone in a windowless room with two sad-looking
           American flags and a framed photograph of Bill Clinton.  A
           35-year-old man in a BROOKS BROTHERS SUIT enters.

                                 BROOKS BROTHERS
                        I'm afraid the news is not what we'd
                        hoped for.

                                 SASHA
                        What?
                            (blinks, stunned)
                        The information I gave you. 

                                 BROOKS BROTHERS
                        The intelligence checked out.  It
                        simply wasn't enough.  In order to
                        take a step like this, we would need
                        more.

                                 SASHA
                        More?  There is more.  I will give
                        you more when I defect.  
                                 BROOKS BROTHERS
                        No one "defects" anymore.  We would
                        be granting you political asylum.  

                                 SASHA
                        I was Lieutenant Colonel in KGB, do
                        you understand?  

                                 BROOKS BROTHERS
                        Mr. Litvinenko, the Cold War is over. 
                        Russia is an ally of the United
                        States.  We would be taking a
                        significant diplomatic risk.  To
                        justify that risk, we would need --

                                 SASHA
                        More.  I will not negotiate with
                        you.  I will not let you use me up
                        and throw me back to FSB.  I know
                        what you're doing.  Who are you --

           A business card lies on the table.  Sasha picks it up.

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        "Doug Clancy"?  You wear Brooks
                        Brothers suit.  You are Ivy League. 
                        You speak perfect Russian.  And you're
                        supposed to be "Embassy Assistant"
                        stationed in Ankara, Turkey?   

                                 BROOKS BROTHERS
                        I don't understand you.

                                 SASHA
                        I know what you are.  And you are
                        making big fucking mistake.

                                 BROOKS BROTHERS
                        I don't think so.
                            (rising)
                        Good luck to you on your journey.

           INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY LOBBY/EXIT -- EVENING

           Embassy workers go home for the night.  Marina and Tolik sit
           silently on a bench by the exit. 

           Sasha paces in front of the glass doors and the dangers that
           lie beyond.  The fluorescent lights overhead go dark.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        The Embassy is now closed.
           EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY -- EVENING

           The doors BOLT shut behind them.  They stand on the Embassy
           steps, utterly exposed.  Sasha doesn't know what to do.

                                 TOLIK
                        Can we go to the hotel now?

           Sasha picks Tolik up, holding him tightly, as if shielding
           him from unseen snipers, and runs down the stairs. 

                                 MARINA
                        Sasha.  What's happening?

                                 SASHA
                        Nothing's happening.  Come on. 

           Once in the street, he frantically hails a taxi.   

           INT. ANKARA AIRLINES -- TICKET COUNTER -- NIGHT

           An AIRLINE TICKETING AGENT clicks away at her terminal.

                                 TICKET AGENT
                        You're in luck.  I have a direct
                        flight to Moscow leaving in one hour.

                                 SASHA
                        I don't want direct flight.  I want
                        flight to Moscow... with a connection
                        in London.  

                                 TICKET AGENT
                        The connecting flight would add nine
                        hours to your trip.  Why would you --

                                 SASHA
                        We like to shop Duty-Free at Heathrow. 
                        Gifts.  Whiskey.  Perfume.  

                                 TICKET AGENT
                        You don't have visas for travel to
                        London.

                                 SASHA
                        We don't need them to fly to Moscow.

           He lays the cash out on the counter, speaking slowly:

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        I want a flight to Moscow... with a
                        connection in London.

           The Ticket Agent looks at him... and she hits "PRINT".  The
           boarding passes are mechanically SPIT OUT --
           INT. ANKARA AIRPORT -- MAIN CONCOURSE -- NIGHT

           -- and, as they make their way to their gate, Marina spots
           them: two TURKISH SECRET SERVICE AGENTS in cheap suits and
           earpiece wires shadowing them. 

                                 SASHA
                        They're Turkish Secret Service.  The
                        Americans must have called them. 
                        They're going to arrest us and
                        extradite us back to Russia.

           They hurry toward their gate.  They hand their boarding passes
           to the ticket-taker, then run through the boarding bridge
           toward the airplane.  Sasha casts a glance back --

           -- to see the Secret Service whispering to the ticket-taker. 
           He hurries Marina and Tolik along.  They enter the plane. 
           The stewardess is closing the door behind them when:

                                 TICKET-TAKER (O.S.)
                        Hold the door!  Mr. Litvinenko!

           Sasha closes his eyes.  It's over.  He turns --

           -- to see the ticket-taker holding their boarding passes.

                                 TICKET-TAKER (CONT'D)
                        Your boarding passes, Mr. Litvinenko.

           Sasha takes the tickets, a little stunned.  The Secret Service
           Agents are still at the ticket desk, watching. 

                                 SASHA
                        Thank you.  
                            (a beat)
                        Excuse me.  Those two men.  What did
                        they say to you?

                                 TICKET-TAKER
                        They said to make certain you left
                        on this plane.
                            (off his look)
                        You are not welcome in Turkey, Mr.
                        Litvinenko.  Enjoy your flight.

           She closes the airplane door and we BLACK OUT. 

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        We are political refugees from Russia. 
                        We request asylum in your country.
           INT. HEATHROW AIRPORT -- CUSTOMS -- DAY

           They stand at the customs desk at Heathrow.  The British
           customs agent signals for security.    

                                 CUSTOMS AGENT
                        Without a visa, you will not be
                        admitted to the UK.  You will be
                        deported to your home country --

                                 SASHA
                        Is British law.  You must to take us
                        in once we request political asylum.  

           He throws down their Russian passports.  They are torn in
           half.  The customs agent glowers unhappily.  

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        So.  Here we are. 

           INT. THE KREMLIN -- DAY

           Boris Berezovsky walks the marbled corridors once more.  He
           shoots his cuffs, preening, confident.  He is at home here. 
           A Presidential AIDE opens a door for him --

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- THE KREMLIN -- DAY

           -- to reveal a dozen OLIGARCHS seated around a conference
           table, with Vladimir Putin at its head.  

                                 PUTIN
                        You're late, Borya.  

                                 BORIS
                        The meeting starts at 10AM.  So I
                        was told. 

           Putin ignores him.  An AIDE reads from a legal document:

                                 AIDE
                        Finally, 50% of these properties
                        will revert to state control,
                        effective upon the signature of the
                        President.  

           A silence.  Finally one of the young Oligarchs, MIKHAIL
           KHODORKOVSKY, speaks:

                                 KHODORKOVSKY
                        You can't do this.  We have property
                        rights.  You can't simply expropriate
                        50% of our private property!  
                                 PUTIN
                        It was never your property to begin
                        with.  It belongs to the State. 
                        I've chosen to leave you with 50%. 
                        This is very generous, you will agree. 
                        In exchange, you will abstain from
                        any criticism of the State. 

                                 KHODORKOVSKY
                        You little thug.  You third-rate
                        apparatchik.  We put you in that
                        chair you're sitting in.  We financed
                        your campaign.  We made you.  

                                 PUTIN
                        Russia made me.  

           Khodorkovsky rises, throws open the door, and walks out.  A
           long SILENCE ensues.  Finally, one of the Oligarchs rises:

                                 ABRAMOVICH
                        Mr. President.  I applaud your
                        decision.   

           With that, Abramovich begins to CLAP.  One by one, the other
           oligarchs rise as well.  They all stand there, terrified
           smiles plastered to their faces, APPLAUDING Putin.  Only
           Boris remains seated, visibly sinking into his chair. 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- THE KREMLIN -- LATER

           The meeting is over.  As Putin exits, Boris speaks:

                                 BORIS
                        Vladimir Vladimirovich, I must ask: 
                        does this decision apply to me as
                        well?

           Putin turns on his heel, red-faced with anger:

                                 PUTIN
                        It applies to you most of all.  

           Boris is stunned.  

                                 PUTIN (CONT'D)
                        Why do you attack me, Borya?  Your
                        television network.  Every night.   

                                 BORIS
                        Volya.  I don't tell them what to
                        report!  It's a free press!  

                                 PUTIN
                        You are trying to weaken me. 
           Putin seems genuinely wounded. 

                                 PUTIN (CONT'D)
                        I thought we were friends.

                                 BORIS
                        We are.  I helped you, Volya!

                                 PUTIN
                        You wanted someone you could control. 
                        You knew I was loyal.  You never
                        thought about who I'd be loyal to.  
                            (a beat)
                        Get your affairs in order. 

           INT. MERCEDES SEDAN -- BACKSEAT -- DAY

           Boris speaks breathlessly on his mobilnik:

                                 BORIS
                        Frozen?  All our assets?  Everything?
                            (grim)
                        Surprised?  No.  I prepared for this. 
                        This is why God created Switzerland. 
                        Tell them to have the jet fueled and
                        ready when we arrive.  Where?
                            (a beat, thinking)
                        London.

           EXT. PICCADILLY CIRCUS -- DAY

           Sasha walks through Piccadilly, huddled against the wind. 
           He could easily be a lost tourist.  He approaches a newsagent
           and buys the Russian newspapers, one of each, then descends
           into the Piccadilly tube station.

           INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- DAY

           Marina sits at the kitchen table, a manuscript box open before
           her.  She reads the final page, then places it in the box. 
           Sasha enters to find her staring silently into the box.

                                 MARINA
                        What are you calling it?

                                 SASHA
                        The KGB Blows Up Russia.  
                            (a beat)
                        My publisher seems to like it.

                                 MARINA
                        Boris?  I'm sure he does.

           She gently closes the box and pushes it away.  
                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        They'll never allow this to be
                        published in Russia.  Never. 

                                 SASHA
                        We're smuggling it over the border. 
                        It's all there, Marina.  No one's
                        put the evidence together like this. 
                        When this comes out, Putin is going
                        on trial at the Hague.  For murder. 
                        And he might have gotten away with
                        it, if his own agents hadn't been
                        caught planting the bomb at Ryazan -- 

                                 MARINA
                        You can't do this.
                            (a beat)
                        We're safe here.  We have a life. 
                        School for Tolik.  But only because
                        they don't know where we are.  If
                        this gets out, they'll come for you.

                                 SASHA
                        You don't even believe they did this.   

                                 MARINA
                        It doesn't matter what I believe.

                                 SASHA
                        It matters to me.  

                                 MARINA
                        Sasha, don't.

                                 SASHA
                        I have to know whether you believe
                        they did this or not.

                                 MARINA
                        Don't make me prove my loyalty to
                        you.  Please.

           A silence.  Then:  

                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        I don't believe it.  It's too much. 
                        To kill three hundred of their own
                        citizens this way?  To start a war? 
                        It's too monstrous.  Even for them.  
                            (a beat)
                        You have my confession.  Are you
                        happy? 

                                 SASHA
                        I am happy.
           Marina seems impossibly weary.  

                                 MARINA
                        You never left, Sasha.  You're still
                        back there.  In Moscow.  You've never
                        tried to fit in here, never tried to
                        speak English, to find a job -- 

                                 SASHA
                        This is my job.   

                                 MARINA
                        You must not do this.  You must not
                        publish this book.  I'm begging you. 

                                 SASHA
                        It's already done.

           EXT. GEORGIAN-RUSSIAN BORDER CROSSING -- NIGHT

           HEADLIGHTS illuminate a border-crossing checkpoint as the
           small truck pulls over.  A RUSSIAN BORDER GUARD climbs into
           the payload area with a flashlight --

           -- inside is a shipment of REVOLVING TABLE FANS in boxes. 
           He checks a few boxes, OK, but then he goes deeper -- and
           these boxes are heavy.  He tears one open, revealing --  

           THE KGB BLOWS UP RUSSIA, by Alexander Litvinenko.  Dozens,
           hundreds of copies.  The guards spill them out --

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL PAPER SHREDDER -- DAY

           -- and they EXPLODE.  Thousands of books devoured in the
           shredder's whirling maw, rendered into snowflakes, then dust,
           then nothing at all.

                                                           FADE TO BLACK.

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        They have a saying here.  I hear it
                        all the time.  It goes like this:
                        "We are born alone, and we die alone".

           EXT. LONDON STREETS -- MONTAGE -- DAY

           Sasha walks the streets of London wearing an ill-fitting
           suit, searching for a job.

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        The first time I heard it, I thought
                        it was the stupidest thing I'd ever
                        heard.
           We peer through doorways to see him speaking to receptionists
           who can't understand his accent.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I grew up sleeping in the same bed
                        with four cousins.  I never had this
                        luxury of loneliness.  I didn't know
                        what it was to take a shit in private
                        until I was eleven. 

           Sasha waits in lobbies for appointments that never come.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But then I realized: that's the pact
                        Russia makes with her children.  

           At every office, Sasha is turned away.

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        Whatever else happens, whatever
                        suffering she makes you endure, you
                        will never be alone. 

           He shuffles through windswept streets, carrying a stack of
           misspelled resumes under his arm.

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Because in a cold country the child
                        who sleeps alone wakes up dead.

           He turns a corner and he sees them: ORANGES, hundreds of
           them, spilling from a rubbish bin, left to rot in an alleyway
           behind a supermarket.  Sasha gazes at them, astonished.

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I don't want to live the way these
                        people live.  I don't want to die
                        they way they die, in their hospital
                        beds, alone.

           He sits at a bus stop, gazing at the endless parade of
           solitary Londoners weighed down by their shopping bags.

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        We aren't whole people, Marina. 
                        We're just pieces of Russia -- a
                        clump of hair, a tooth, a fingernail --
                        that's been torn away and lost to
                        the wind.  We're nothing on our own.

           INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- BEDROOM -- EVENING

           Night is falling.  Sasha sits in darkness, with Marina
           watching him.
                                 MARINA
                        Maybe Boris can help us.

                                 SASHA
                        Boris is cutting me off.  He told me
                        a few days ago, there's no more money. 
                        I'm not useful to him anymore.  

                                 MARINA
                        How will we live? 

                                 SASHA
                        I have to find a job.  There must be
                        a job somewhere for an old Russian
                        to do.  Otherwise we won't survive. 

                                                              BLACK OUT. 

           AMBULANCE DOORS

           burst open.  ORDERLIES reach in, hauling out the gurney --

           EXT. UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

           -- and we're flying, fast, toward the entrance of a steel-
           and-glass hospital in the distance.  Brent Hyatt leads the
           way while talking on his mobile:

                                 HYATT
                        Fades in and out.  Afraid not.  He's
                        in no shape for questioning.  I will.  

           NEWS HELICOPTERS hover overhead, searchlights beaming down. 
           A scrum of REPORTERS surrounds the hospital entrance.

                        being poisoned in Mayfair --

                        We have no statement.  Excuse me.

           The gurney blows past and we are joined by two uniformed
           Metropolitan Police officers.
                                 HYATT (CONT'D)
                            (into mobile)
                        This department leaks like a bloody
                        sieve! 

           INT. UNIVERSITY COLLEGE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

           Doctors, medical personnel and police are waiting for the
           gurney.  Sasha spots Marina and Tolik amongst them.  

                                 SASHA
                            (hoarse)
                        Marusya.  Tolik.  Give us a kiss.

           Tolik breaks away from Marina and runs toward Sasha's gurney. 

                                 DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        Keep him away from the boy!

           Someone grabs Tolik and pulls him away from us.  Sasha turns
           to see Tolik gazing back at him in tears.

                                 SASHA
                        Tolik.  Don't.  It's me.  Just me. 

           We keep MOVING, leaving Tolik behind, entering

           INT. ELEVATOR

           The elevator's walls are made of reflective glass.  Sasha
           turns to see his own reflection, REVEALING --

           -- that he has been transformed.  His hair is completely
           gone.  His skin has turned to yellowed parchment.  He gazes
           back at his reflection in disbelief, almost laughing:

                                 SASHA
                        What?  No.  What did they do?  Doctor -- 

           He looks up: he is surrounded by figures in white RADIATION
           SUITS with hoods.  The elevator doors open --

           INT. HOSPITAL 3RD FLOOR CRITICAL CARE WARD -- NIGHT

           -- and we're ROLLING down the hospital corridor.  All the
           rooms are empty: the entire corridor has been evacuated.

                                 SASHA
                        Marusya... Doctor...

           Suddenly Sasha convulses, racked by a meltdown at his core. 
           He SCREAMS, writhing.  The Suits struggle to hold him down
           as we PUSH through a door marked CAUTION/RESTRICTED --
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT

           -- and the gurney is locked down.  The Suits surround him,
           attaching diodes, wires, morphine drips to his body.  The
           pain abates for a moment, and he gazes up into the light:

                                 SASHA
                        ...Somebody...

           INT. HOSPITAL 3RD FLOOR MEZZANINE/CORRIDOR-- NIGHT

           The mezzanine has become an impromptu crisis center, teeming
           with doctors, police and public health officials.  A WALL OF
           GLASS overlooks the TV satellite trucks gathered outside.  

           Marina and Tolik drift through it all, ignored.  She guides
           Tolik to a hospital lounge and sits him down in front of the
           TV with a female Metropolitan Police officer.  

           Then she walks outside, toward the doors marked
           CAUTION/RESTRICTED, when a young POLICE OFFICER stops her. 

                                 OFFICER
                        Read the sign, Ma'am.  This is a
                        quarantine site.  

           Dr. JOHN HENRY, Berezovsky's specialist, sees Marina and
           breaks out of a conference with two representatives of COBRA,
           the British government's emergencies committee. 

                                 DR. HENRY
                        Terribly sorry, Ms. Litvinenko.  We
                        can't take the risk of exposure.

                                 MARINA
                        I am already exposed.  I have been
                        with him, 24 hours, for days.

           The doctors exchange glances.  

                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        So if you will excuse me --

                                 DR. HENRY
                        During that time, have you ever been
                        exposed to your husband's bodily
                        fluids?

                                 MARINA
                        I cleaned up his vomit that first
                        night.  And many times after.  Vomit,
                        sweat, tears, all of it.

                                 DR. HENRY
                        Your son.  What about him?
                                 MARINA
                        No.  Not at all.

                                 DR. HENRY
                        He must not be exposed to Sasha.

                                 MARINA
                        He's his father.

           The doctor is silent. 

                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        I'll take him home, then.

                                 COBRA OFFICIAL
                        You can't go home.
                            (off her look)
                        Your home is a radioactive contaminant
                        site, Ms. Litvinenko.  It will have
                        to be sealed.

                                 MARINA
                        For how long?

                                 COBRA OFFICIAL
                        Permanently.  It will be completely
                        gutted by a contaminant-disposal
                        team. 

           She stares at him.

                                 DR. HENRY
                        We realize this is difficult.  None
                        of this is meant to frighten you. 

                                 MARINA
                        It is frightening me.

                                 DR. HENRY
                        I'm sorry.  But you must know.  What
                        Sasha's been exposed to -- as a result
                        of your contact with him, you may
                        suffer the effects as well.

                                 MARINA
                            (nods)
                        If as you say, the damage is done, I
                        would like to see my husband now. 

           Marina turns and walks through the RESTRICTED doors, into
           the empty, silent corridor.  As she walks, she allows herself
           a moment of private grief, but then, as she turns the corner --
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

           -- she puts on a brave face.  Sasha sits upright in the
           hospital bed, his pain kept at bay by morphine.  The sight
           of her brings a smile to his eyes.

                                 SASHA
                        Devotchka moya.

                                 MARINA
                        Sasha.  

                                 SASHA
                        My hair seems to have escaped in the
                        night.  Maybe it knows something I
                        don't.  
                            (a little self-
                             conscious)
                        I think I'll keep it this way.  What
                        do you think?

                                 MARINA
                            (kissing him)
                        Not even the photographers of the
                        Ministry of Automotive Vehicles could
                        dim your beauty. 

                                 SASHA
                        It wasn't them that did this to me.

           Marina kisses him again.  For a moment they seem possessed
           of the same effortless grace they've always had.

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        Marusya.  My love.  From your smile
                        I know the news must be very bad.

                                 MARINA
                        It isn't good.

                                 SASHA
                        Nobody talks to me.  Nobody will say
                        what's happening to me.

                                 MARINA
                        They've explained it to me.

           She recites it mechanically, as if that's the only way she
           can bring herself to say it at all. 

                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        You have swallowed a substance called
                        Polonium-210.  It is extremely rare,
                        and it is extremely radioactive.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        Even a microscopic dose is fatal to
                        human beings.  And you have swallowed
                        much, much more than that. 

           Sasha says nothing.

                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        The doctors say that it would be
                        impossible for you to have been
                        exposed by accident.  Polonium-210 --

                                 SASHA
                        I know what Polonium-210 is.

           Marina reacts.  Sasha's voice is numb.  

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        In the Soviet times, there was a
                        town where they made it.  This town
                        had no name.  Just a number.  They
                        produced the Polonium to be used in
                        nuclear bombs.  People were considered
                        very fortunate to live there.  The
                        whole town worked all year, like
                        little elves, to produce just a
                        thimbleful of Polonium to use in the
                        bombs.

           He holds an imaginary thimble before him.

                                 MARINA
                        How do you know this?

                                 SASHA
                        I was KGB.  KGB did research, looking
                        for other uses for Polonium.  New
                        uses.  KGB found it was almost
                        impossible to detect in the blood,
                        even in an autopsy, unless you knew
                        how to look for it.

           He gazes at his yellowed, skeletal hands, the veins coursing
           with radiation.  

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        And that is how KGB realized that
                        Polonium would make pretty good
                        poison.

           EXT. HOSPITAL 3RD FLOOR MEZZANINE/CORRIDOR-- NIGHT

           Brent Hyatt paces anxiously by the glass windows as his boss, 
           PETER CLARKE, takes part in a conference call by mobile phone.
                                 CLARKE
                            (whispering)
                        Sit down, Hyatt.  You're hovering.

           Hyatt spies someone collecting files from a doctor at the
           central desk -- a man and a woman, both smartly dressed.  

                                 HYATT
                        Oi.  What's this?  
                            (hurrying over)
                        Can I help you?

           JOHN ACKERLEY's Windsor knot is just a little more discreet
           than Hyatt's, his accent a little more polished.

                                 ACKERLEY
                        We've got everything sorted, thanks. 
                        This case is now under the oversight
                        of Her Majesty's Secret Service.  

                                 HYATT
                        What?  Under what authority?

           Ackerley nods at his boss, MCLAREN, also on his mobile.  

                                 ACKERLEY
                        We're on the phone with the Home
                        Office right now.

                                 HYATT
                        As it happens, so is Scotland Yard.

           Hyatt nods at Peter Clarke.  They're all on the same call.

                                 ACKERLEY
                        This is case of nuclear terrorism. 
                        It's an international incident. 
                        It's out of Scotland Yard's league.  

                                 HYATT
                        It's a murder case.  You lot don't
                        know the first thing about solving
                        murders.  You only know how to cover
                        them up.  

           SIMULTANEOUSLY, in the BG, Peter Clarke and his MI6
           counterpart are having the same argument with the Home Office. 
           As the four-way argument reaches a crescendo, they fall silent
           as, somewhere at the Home Office, a verdict is reached:  

                                 CLARKE
                        Thank you, sir.  Good evening.  
                            (rings off, smiling)
                        It's final.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLARKE (CONT'D)
                        The investigation will proceed under
                        the supervision of Scotland Yard
                        Murder Division... 
                            (a courtly nod)
                        ...in close consultation with Her
                        Majesty's Secret Service.

           Ackerley nods grimly as he rings off as well.  Hyatt beams,
           triumphant.  Then, from O.S.:

                                 MARINA (O.S.)
                        Murder Division?

           All turn to see Marina standing nearby.

                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        But my husband isn't dead.

           No one says it, but it's there on their faces: Not yet.

                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        Why is investigation needed at all? 
                        Isn't it obvious who did this?

                                 CLARKE
                        Ms.  Litvinenko, this has been a
                        difficult ordeal.  One of our officers
                        will take you and your son home --

                                 MARINA
                        We have no home now.  So we will
                        stay here, with Sasha.  
                            (a beat)
                        This poison they used on my husband. 
                        Only Kontora could have gotten it.  

                                 ACKERLEY
                        That's why they couldn't have been
                        the ones that did it.

                                 HYATT
                        What?

                                 ACKERLEY
                        If there's one thing the Russian
                        government is good at, it's killing
                        Russians.  It's something of a
                        specialty.  

                                 HYATT
                        You don't say.
                                 ACKERLEY
                        They had countless methods with which
                        to murder Mr. Litvinenko.  A gun, a
                        knife, a staged mugging.  They could
                        have simply pushed him off a tube
                        station platform.  

                                 CLARKE
                        Must we have this discussion in front
                        of Ms. Litvinenko?

                                 MARINA
                        Yes.  Continue. 

                                 ACKERLEY
                        With all the weapons available to
                        the KGB, why would they use an exotic
                        radioactive isotope that only they
                        had access to?  Why would they leave
                        physical evidence that pointed
                        directly and exclusively at them?

           He's got a point.

                                 HYATT
                        So because KGB were the only ones
                        that could have committed this crime,
                        this means they could not possibly
                        have committed it?

                                 ACKERLEY
                        In my business, the only time anything
                        is ever obvious is when somebody
                        wants it to be obvious.  In this
                        case, somebody wanted the evidence
                        to point directly at Vladimir Putin.  

                                 HYATT
                        Who. 

                                 ACKERLEY
                        By our estimates, the dose of Polonium-
                        210 that poisoned Alexander Litvinenko
                        would have cost ten million dollars
                        on the open market.  

                                 HYATT
                        That's a lot of cash.   

                                 ACKERLEY
                        Right.  So ask yourself: who had
                        one, the money and two, the motive
                        to pin a murder on Vladimir Putin?
           Hyatt's face falls.  He sees what Ackerley's driving at. 
           Marina and Hyatt turn to look through the wall of windows
           beside them.  We CRANE UP, gazing down with them --

           EXT. UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

           -- at the front steps of the Hospital, where Boris Berezovsky
           is holding a press conference with his publicist.  

                                 ACKERLEY
                        There's your leak, Mr. Hyatt.

                                                                CUT TO: 

           EXT. LONDON -- OVERHEAD -- HELICOPTER SHOT -- MORNING

           The streets surrounding Piccadilly Circus have been cordoned
           off, with crowds pressed against the barricades.  White
           QUARANTINE TENTS are set up at several sites along the route. 

           EXT. ITSU SUSHI -- PICCADILLY CIRCUS -- MORNING

           ON THE MONITOR in the quarantine tent we see a SPECTROGRAPH
           IMAGE of the interior of the restaurant. 

                                 CLARKE
                        How many people have eaten at this
                        restaurant in the past two weeks? 
                        How many people have walked this
                        street?

           Inside, the Radiation Suits are doing the painstaking work
           of analyzing the entire restaurant, centimeter by centimeter.   

                                 CLARKE (CONT'D)
                        Somebody's going to have to go in
                        and question Litvinenko in detail. 

           Clarke looks around.  No volunteers.  Finally, Hyatt nods. 

                                 HYATT
                        I've already been with him for days. 
                        I've got nothing to lose.  

           EXT. UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON HOSPITAL -- DAY

           Hyatt's Vauxhall pushes through the ever-growing crush of
           media and reporters.  Hyatt emerges and looks out upon it
           all, a little amazed. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

           Hyatt enters the room where lies Sasha Litvinenko: spotlit,
           hairless, his chest covered with diodes, his skin waxy, more
           a statue than a man.  Hyatt approaches Sasha's bedside --
           -- and the eyes open.  With a gesture, Sasha motions him
           closer.  Hyatt bends close, and Sasha smiles weakly:

                                 SASHA
                        Now you listen.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           SASHA'S BOOTS

           As he pulls them on in the morning, the shoebox on the bed
           beside him.  They're brand-new, bought for a special occasion.

           We recognize his clothes: they are the same he wore when he
           checked into the hospital.  This is the day of his poisoning.  

           INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- ENTRYWAY -- MORNING

           Sasha grabs a pear from a bowl of fruit as he hurries out. 
           Marina grabs him playfully as he heads out the front door.

                                 MARINA
                        Don't go.  Stay home today.  

                                 SASHA
                        After all it took me to get this?

           EXT. LONDON APARTMENT -- DOORSTEP --- MORNING

           He kisses her on the doorstep as he goes. 

                                 SASHA
                        It's a job, Marusya.  A job!   
                            (kissing her)
                        I'm going to make you proud.

           EXT. PICCADILLY CIRCUS -- DAY

           Sasha ascends from the Tube station into sunlight.  He makes
           his way through the lunchtime crowds in a hurry.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        It was beautiful day to be murdered. 
                        I had very busy schedule.

           Sasha approaches Itsu Sushi -- 

           INT. ITSU SUSHI -- SPECTROGRAPH IMAGE -- DAY

           -- and, as he enters, we view the restaurant as a SPECTROGRAPH
           IMAGE, with ghostly patrons eating at the sushi bar.  One of
           the ghosts rises to greet us --
                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        First there was lunch with a good
                        friend of mine, Mario Scaramella. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

           As Sasha speaks, Brent Hyatt surreptitiously types the name
           into his mobile -- S-c-a-r-a-m-e-l-l-a -- then hits SEND --

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        London has many many little Marios,
                        all peddling rumors and intelligence
                        in hotel bars for money.

           INT. ITSU SUSHI -- NORMAL IMAGE -- DAY

           -- as the doughy MARIO SCARAMELLA shakes Sasha's hand.   

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        Mario had called to tell me he had
                        evidence that Romano Prodi, head of
                        European Commission, was actually a
                        spy for KGB, and would I like to get
                        some sushi, and I said, why not?

           INT. APARTMENT CORRIDOR -- DAY

           A rumpled Mario Scaramella, just rousted out of bed, is led
           down the corridor by detectives from Scotland Yard.  

           INT. ITSU SUSHI -- NORMAL IMAGE -- DAY

           Six neatly sliced tekka maki are set before us.  Sasha eats
           with chopsticks as he listens to Scaramella's pitch.

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        It was good lunch, though the tekka
                        maki could have been fresher, but
                        when the check came Mario handed me
                        an email he'd gotten that said that
                        somebody was going to kill me.

           As Sasha examines the printed email, we catch a glimpse of a
           few words -- TARGETS LISTED INCLUDING LITVINENKO, ALEXANDER
           V. -- before Sasha folds it and puts it in his coat pocket.

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I think Mario hoped I would pick up
                        the check, but I just thanked him
                        and said I had to run.

           INT. SCOTLAND YARD -- MEN'S ROOM/CORRIDOR-- DAY

           Mario Scaramella urinates into a plastic cup under the
           watchful eye of a roomful of policemen and scientists.
                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        Next stop was offices of my very
                        good friend Boris Berezovsky.  

           As soon as he's done, Mario hands the cup over, and one of
           the cops runs with it, delivering it to the crime lab. 

           INT. MAYFAIR ROW HOUSE -- DAY

           Sasha is greeted by Boris' SECRETARY as he enters Boris'
           sumptuously decorated offices.

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        Boris always lets me use his fax
                        machine.  I was expecting a very
                        important fax.

           Sasha watches anxiously as a FAX SCREECHES slowly out of the
           fax machine, then drifts to the floor like a dead leaf.

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        The fax was for the dossier I was
                        preparing for my client.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

           Sasha has fallen silent, his gaze faraway.

                                 SASHA
                        I was to deliver this dossier to my
                        client at the Pine Bar of the
                        Millennium Hotel in Mayfair... 
                            (a beat)
                        ...and I was running late.

           EXT. GROSVENOR STREET -- DAY

           Sasha runs down crowded streets, the dossier clutched under
           his arm, sprinting like the Olympian he once dreamed of
           becoming, sprinting as if his very life depended on it.

           Finally he arrives at a door with a brass sign that reads
           PINE BAR.  He throws open the door --

           INT. PINE BAR, MILLENNIUM HOTEL -- SPECTROGRAPH IMAGE

           -- and we behold a radiological disaster zone.  Glowing
           stains, streaks, ghosts, even hand prints are everywhere,
           like the aftermath of some nuclear bloodbath.

           The RADIATION SUITS enter the scene.  We hear only their
           BREATHING as they move through this deep-sea darkness, taking
           in glowing traces of Polonium-210 scattered everywhere.  
           Now, from O.S., they see an even stronger glow.  It's coming
           from behind the bar.  We MOVE AROUND the bar with them --

           -- REVEALING that the glow is coming from within a luminous
           dishwasher behind the bar.  The Radiation Suits exchange
           baffled glances.  One of them crouches, opens the dishwasher --

           -- and an UNEARTHLY LIGHT beams out from within.  It's almost
           miraculous.  The Radiation Suit reaches inside -- 

           -- and pulls out an object so impossibly bright as to burn a
           hole in the screen.   

           It's a teapot.

           INT. PINE BAR, MILLENNIUM HOTEL -- DAY

           The door is thrown open, and we enter the crowded hotel bar. 
           Sasha moves through the crowd, his face slick with sweat. 
           The teatime crowd is a mÃ©lange of bored Saudis, tourist
           Japanese, dissipated City bankers, well-dressed prostitutes --

           -- and, most of all, extremely wealthy Russians.  Sasha
           approaches a table where three such Russians are sitting --

           -- and we recognize the man at the center immediately.  It's
           Alexander Lugovoi, Berezovsky's former security chief.

                                 LUGOVOI
                        We were worried about you.

                                 SASHA
                        So sorry, Andrei.  I know I'm late. 

           Then Lugovoi smiles that familiar ghostly smile.

                                 LUGOVOI
                        Somebody get this man a drink.  

                                 MARINA (V.O.)
                        Don't go.  Stay home today.

           EXT. LONDON APARTMENT -- DOORSTEP -- MORNING

           We're back on the doorstep with Sasha and Marina.

                                 MARINA
                        Something's not right about this.

                                 SASHA
                        He's giving me a chance.  Besides,
                        Lugovoi used to work for Boris -- 
                                 MARINA
                        Everyone connected to Boris is either
                        dead or in exile.  But Lugovoi stayed
                        in Moscow and got rich.  How?

                                 SASHA
                        He owns a security business now, and
                        a soft drink bottling company  --

                                 MARINA
                        He's one of them, Sasha.  The
                        Siloviki.  He never left them, even
                        when he was working for Boris.  Why
                        do you think there were so many
                        attempts on Boris' life back then?  
                            (a beat)
                        It's like you said: no one ever leaves
                        Kontora.  No one gets rich in Russia
                        without their blessing.

           INT. PINE BAR, MILLENNIUM HOTEL -- DAY

           Lugovoi pores over the dossier Sasha's brought with him.  

                                 LUGOVOI
                        This is good, Sasha.  Thorough.

                                 LUGOVOI (CONT'D)
                        I think we'll be doing a lot of
                        business together.

                                 SASHA
                        Whatever you need, Andrei.  I was
                        always a hard worker, you know that.

           Lugovoi explains to the man on his right, DMITRY KOVTUN: 

                                 LUGOVOI
                        Companies in the West ask us to
                        prepare intelligence dossiers on
                        their business partners in Moscow.  
                            (shrugs)
                        For some reason, don't ask me why,
                        they're scared to do business with
                        Russians.

                                 KOVTUN
                        Crazy. 

                                 LUGOVOI
                        Either way, we're happy to take their
                        money, right, Sasha?  
                            (puts dossier away)
                        Enough of that.  Where's that
                        waitress?
           The man on Lugovoi's left, heretofore known only as THE THIRD
           MAN, rises from his chair.

                                 THE THIRD MAN
                        Never mind.  I'll get the vodka.

                                 SASHA
                        Tea for me.  A pot of green tea.

           They all look at Sasha.   

                                 LUGOVOI
                        Sasha doesn't drink.

                                 KOVTUN
                        Some sort of health thing, is it?

                                 SASHA
                        I just don't like to lose control.

           The others smile blankly.  

                                 LUGOVOI
                        He'll outlive us all.

           EXT. LONDON APARTMENT -- DOORSTEP -- MORNING

           Marina stands on the doorstep, imploring Sasha: 

                                 MARINA
                        No one ever leaves Kontora.  And no
                        one gets rich in Russia without their
                        blessing.

                                 SASHA
                        Listen to you.  You've been living
                        with a madman for too long.
                            (kissing her goodbye)
                        It's a job, Marusya.  A job! 
                            (turns to leave)
                        I'm going to make you proud.

           As Sasha hurries off, she whispers:

                                 MARINA
                        I am proud.

           But he's already gone.

           INT. PINE BAR, MILLENNIUM HOTEL -- DAY

           (NOTE: What follows is a shot-for-shot duplicate of the film's
           opening scene -- but viewed without spectrograph imagery) 
           Lugovoi pours a round, commencing the complicated business
           of Russian drinking etiquette with the first toast:  

                                 LUGOVOI (V.O.)
                        Budem zdrovy!  

           They drink.  Lugovoi quickly pours another round.

                                 LUGOVOI (CONT'D)
                        "Between the first toast and the
                        second, a finger must not pass."

           Lugovoi raises his glass, then glances up at Sasha. 

                                 LUGOVOI (CONT'D)
                        You haven't touched your drink.

                                 SASHA
                            (a little embarrassed)
                        It's tea, not vodka.  Besides --

           He tilts up his cup to show that it's empty.

                                 LUGOVOI
                        Pour him a cup of tea.  

           The Third Man reaches offscreen -- and he comes back with
           the teapot.  He pours Sasha a cup of tea.

                                 LUGOVOI (CONT'D)
                        For missing the first toast, Sasha,
                        you must make the second.

                                 SASHA
                        "To the dead."

                                 KOVTUN
                        That's the third toast!  The third
                        toast is always to the dead!

                                 LUGOVOI
                        Dmitry's right.  We need a different
                        toast.

           Sasha thinks a moment, then:

                                 SASHA
                        To biznes.

           They all drink.  Sasha grimaces at the taste of the tea:

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        Ach.  Bitter. 
                                 KOVTUN
                        Another!  Do dna!  

           The Third Man pours.  Lugovoi raises his glass and smiles.

                                 LUGOVOI
                        Now we drink to the dead.

           EXT. GROSVENOR SQUARE -- DAY

           Sasha makes his way home through the crowded square, past
           shoppers loaded down with shopping bags.

           His steps falter.  He feels unwell.  He stops.  Something is
           terribly wrong.

           He stands utterly still as oblivious pedestrians stream around
           him.  He looks directly at us, and then --

           -- he begins to run.  Slowly at first, then faster, even as 
           the knot tightens within him.

           INT. CITY BUS -- DAY

           Sasha rocks in his seat, clutching his head in pain as the
           other passengers stare.  He's reached his stop --

           EXT. MUSWELL HILL -- DAY

           -- and he's running again, sprinting, then stumbling, until --

           INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- DAY

           -- he throws open the door, stumbling to the bathroom --

           INT. BATHROOM -- DAY

           -- and throws open the cabinet beneath the sink, searching
           frantically, spilling everything out onto the floor --

                                 MARINA
                        Sasha?

           -- and then he finds it: a bottle of AMMONIUM CARBONATE,
           labeled in Cyrillic and English.  He fumbles with the cap,
           then gulps down a slug of it --

           -- and VOMITS violently.  No sooner does he stop heaving
           than he drinks another slug and vomits again.

                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?  Stop -- !

           She crouches, holding him, trying to grab the bottle from
           him.  He keeps drinking, desperate for the emetic it contains.  
           Finally the bottle is empty.  He tosses it aside, utterly
           drained, and then he begins to weep like a child in her arms. 

                                 SASHA
                        They got me, Marusya.  They got me. 
                        They got me they got me they got me.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- EVENING

           Sasha lies in bed, tears streaming down his face, whispering:

                                 SASHA
                        They got me.  

           Hyatt sits in the gathering darkness, watching him.  

                                 BARSUKOV (V.O.)
                        Is very sad story.  Very sad.  

           INT. RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF JUSTICE -- HEARING ROOM -- DAY

           Behind a long wooden table sits Andrei Lugovoi as well as
           Dmitry Kovtun, whose head is wrapped in bandages, as if from
           third-degree burns.  Speaking on their behalf is none other
           than Litvinenko's Special Prosecutor, Barsukov.  

                                 BARSUKOV
                        A pity it makes no sense. 

           Across the table sits a delegation from Scotland Yard and
           the Home Office, including Brent Hyatt and Peter Clarke.  

                                 BARSUKOV (CONT'D)
                        It seems you do police work much
                        different in London.  We would be
                        asking different questions.  

                                 CLARKE
                        Such as?

                                 BARSUKOV
                        If a former CIA agent, say, were to
                        be found beaten to death with a
                        suitcase nuke in the middle of Moscow,
                        we would not ask "who beat this
                        unfortunate CIA agent to death?"

                                 CLARKE
                        What would you ask?

                                 BARSUKOV
                        We would ask "what in God's name is
                        a suitcase nuke doing in Moscow?"

           A silence. 
                                 BARSUKOV (CONT'D)
                        Gentlemen, you have problem.  You
                        have discovered ten million dollars
                        of nuclear precursor at large in the
                        middle of London.  And yet, for some
                        reason, you choose to come here to
                        accuse these men. 

                                 CLARKE
                        Who should we be accusing?

                                 BARSUKOV
                        Is obvious.  It was not these men
                        that poisoned Litvinenko --

           -- he motions at the bandaged Kovtun -- 

                                 BARSUKOV (CONT'D)
                        -- it was Litvinenko that poisoned
                        them.  Either accidental, or on
                        purpose.

           The Home Office types are starting to look anxious. 

                                 HYATT
                        I've been a detective for nine years
                        now. 

                                 BARSUKOV
                        Not so long. 

                                 HYATT
                            (shrugs)
                        I've seen a lot of murders.  And
                        I've seen a lot of murder weapons. 
                        And I've seen a lot of murderers
                        leave a lot of fingerprints all over
                        those weapons. 
                            (a beat)
                        But this is the first time I've ever
                        seen a murder weapon leave its
                        fingerprints all over the accused.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM -- MILLENNIUM HOTEL -- SPECTROGRAPH IMAGE

           Glowing traces of Polonium-210 are everywhere as the Radiation
           Suits scan Lugovoi's hotel room. 

                                 HYATT (V.O.)
                        Polonium-210 left its fingerprints
                        all over Andrei Lugovoi's hotel room. 
           INT. LUFTHANSA AIRLINES 727 -- SPECTROGRAPH IMAGE

           The Radiation Suits move down the aisle of the 727 until we
           come upon a small explosion of Polonium-210 in a window seat.  

                                 HYATT (V.O.)
                        Polonium-210 left its fingerprints
                        all over the Lufthansa 727 that Dmitry
                        Kovtun flew from Frankfurt to London. 

           INT. RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF JUSTICE -- HEARING ROOM -- DAY

           Hyatt slides the photographs across the table toward Barsukov. 
           He nods at Dmitry Kovtun's bandaged head. 

                                 HYATT
                        And from the looks of it, Polonium-
                        210 left its fingerprints all over
                        Dmitry Kovtun himself.

           Barsukov pushes the photos back at Hyatt.  

                                 BARSUKOV
                        Lugovoi was visiting London with his
                        family.  His wife slept in that hotel
                        room.  His children!  Why would these
                        men -- why would anyone -- knowingly
                        expose themselves to Polonium-210? 

                                 HYATT
                            (nods grudgingly)
                        Couldn't make sense of it myself. 

                                 BARSUKOV
                        Then this matter is closed. 

                                 HYATT
                        But someone else did.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT

           Darkness.  The only sound is the faint beeping of the EKG. 
           Marina keeps her vigil at Sasha's side.  Hyatt enters.  

                                 MARINA
                        I want to touch him, but they tell
                        me his bones, they are... what was
                        the word?  Disintegrate. 

           Hyatt says nothing.  His mobile VIBRATES.  He shuts it off. 
           Suddenly Sasha starts WHEEZING violently --

           -- and they both leap to their feet.  This is it.
                                 HYATT
                        I'll get the doctor.

           Suddenly Sasha starts shaking his head -- no, no, no -- and
           he begins to CACKLE.  Seems he's not dying, but LAUGHING,
           painfully but with wicked glee:

                                 SASHA
                        Stupid!  Stupid stupid stupid!

                                 MARINA
                            (to Hyatt)
                        Dementia.  The drugs.  
                            (to Sasha)
                        Sasha, my love, it's Marina --

                                 SASHA
                        Oh.  Oh.  Hurts.   

                                 MARINA
                        What's wrong?  Are you all right?

                                 SASHA
                        Marusya... Krosha moya... The bicycle
                        I got for Tolik on his birthday.  I
                        put it together one way, other way,
                        but every way at the end always more
                        parts were left on the carpet.

                                 MARINA
                            (pityingly)
                        Yes, Sasha, he still has that bicycle. 

                                 SASHA
                        Marina!  I'm trying to speak!

                                 MARINA
                        All right!  I'm listening!

           Sasha turns to Hyatt, exasperated.

                                 SASHA
                        I thought there was this thing.  It
                        was called Evil.  And somewhere there
                        was a door, and if you could find
                        this door and open this door you
                        would find Evil there, sitting around
                        a table, making its plans.  And its
                        plans would be terrifying.  Because
                        Evil is smart. 

                                 HYATT
                            (humoring him)
                        Right.  
                                 SASHA
                            (exasperated)
                        No!  That's your problem.  Cops!

                                 HYATT
                        All right, you tell me.

           Sasha grabs Hyatt, with a force that surprises him: 

                                 SASHA
                        I found the door.  I opened the door. 
                        I went into the room.  Do you know
                        what I found?

                                 HYATT
                        What?  What did you find?

           INT. BRIEFING ROOM -- LUBYANKA CENTER -- DAY

           A concrete room with a table at its center.  At the table
           sits DMITRY KOVTUN.  Across from him sits A GRAY-SUITED
           SILOVIK who holds a package in his hand.

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        The plan was efficient.  The plan
                        was compartmentalized.  The plan was
                        like this:

                                 SILOVIK
                        I am giving you a package to deliver. 
                        You do not open the package.  On
                        November 1st, you will hand this
                        package to your contact at the
                        Millennium Hotel.

                                 KOVTUN
                        That's all?  Deliver the package?

                                 SILOVIK
                        Deliver the package.  That is all. 

           INT. BAR LUBYANKA -- DAY

           The Silovik briefs the Third Man.

                                 SILOVIK
                        You will take the package from your
                        contact.  Inside the package will be
                        a lead vial.

           INT. PINE BAR, MILLENNIUM HOTEL -- DAY

           The Third Man stands at the bar with the vodkas and a teapot. 
           He empties the contents of a LEAD VIAL into the teapot.   
                                 SILOVIK (V.O.)
                        You will empty the vial's contents
                        into Litvinenko's drink.

                                 THE THIRD MAN (V.O.)
                        That's all? 

                                 SILOVIK (V.O.)
                        After, you re-seal the vial, throw
                        it into the Thames, and you're done. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM -- MILLENNIUM HOTEL -- DAY

           Lugovoi takes a call on his mobilnik.

                                 SILOVIK (O.S.)
                        Do you remember Alexander Litvinenko?

                                 LUGOVOI
                        Yeah, of course.

                                 SILOVIK (O.S.)
                        You're going to invite him for drinks. 
                        3PM, November 1st at the Pine Bar. 

                                 LUGOVOI
                        I haven't seen him in years.

                                 SILOVIK (O.S.)
                        Find a pretext.  Business opportunity. 
                        Simple enough.  Two friends will
                        join you.

                                 LUGOVOI
                        Who?

                                 SILOVIK (O.S.)
                        You don't know them.

                                 LUGOVOI
                        So that's all?  Invite him to drinks?  

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        Invite him to drinks.  Deliver the
                        package.  Empty the vial.  No one
                        knowing more than their little task. 
                        No last-minute attacks of guilt.  No
                        one to tell anything if questioned.  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           THE PACKAGE

           On a kitchen table.    
                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        This was KGB tradecraft!  When it
                        comes to killing people, no one is
                        better than KGB!  And this... 

           INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT

           We PULL BACK to reveal Dmitry Kovtun sitting at his sad little
           kitchen table as he stares intently at the package, trying
           to summon the power of x-ray vision.

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        ...is their downfall.  They know
                        everything about killing people but
                        nothing about living people, nothing
                        about real living human beings.

           Finally, Kovtun's curiosity gets the better of him.  He
           reaches for a kitchen knife.  Carefully opens the sticky
           envelope.  Reaches inside --

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        If they did, they would have known
                        what would happen next.

           -- and pulls out the metal vial.  He gazes at it for a moment,
           then unscrews the cap --

           INT. KITCHEN -- SPECTROGRAPH IMAGE -- NIGHT

           -- and POLONIUM-210 RADIATION is released into the air,
           blooming forth like a GLOWING GENIE unleashed from its bottle.

           INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT

           DMITRY'S BLOODSHOT EYE gazes down into the tiny vial.  What
           he sees there is not terribly interesting to him.

           There's an air of anticlimax to the whole thing.  He screws
           the cap back onto the vial, re-seals the package -- 

           INT. FRANKFURT AIRPORT -- SPECTROGRAPH IMAGE -- DAY

           -- and carries the package beneath his arm as he makes his
           way to the Lufthansa gate, the Polonium Genie following him
           all the way. 

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        You see?  This is why there were
                        always parts left all over the carpet!

           INT. LUFTHANSA AIRLINES 727 -- DAY

           Dmitry furtively skims a German porno mag whilst relaxing in
           Business Class, the Polonium Genie hovering over his shoulder.  
                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        This was my mistake!  I thought evil
                        was smart!

           INT. HOTEL ROOM -- MILLENNIUM HOTEL -- SPECTROGRAPH IMAGE

           The three murderers inhale tiny minibar Vodkas, blissfully
           unaware of the Polonium Genie in their midst.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.)
                        But when you open that door, you
                        don't find smart.  You find stupid.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT

           CLOSE ON Sasha as what seemed to be a morphine-induced rant
           comes into very sharp focus. 

                                 SASHA
                        You're not listening. 

                                 HYATT
                        Oh, I'm listening. 

                                 SASHA
                        You're not typing. 

           Hyatt fumbles for his mobile and starts typing. 

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        Evil is stupid.  Is an idiot child
                        that survives only because we feed
                        it.  We feed it because we fear it. 
                        What we must do is call it what it
                        is and let it die.

           Silence.  Barsukov is stone-faced.  Lugovoi looks at Kovtun
           with disdain.  Kovtun looks away sheepishly.  Finally: 

                                 BARSUKOV
                        We will not extradite these men. 
                        Two reasons why.  First, they did
                        not kill Litvinenko. 

                                 HYATT
                        Then prove it in open court.

                                 BARSUKOV
                        Second, even if they did kill
                        Litvinenko, this was not a crime.

                                 CLARKE
                        Excuse me?
                                 BARSUKOV
                        Six weeks ago, law was passed in
                        Russia making legal to kill enemies
                        of the state on foreign soil.

                                 CLARKE
                        What serendipitous timing.

                                 BARSUKOV
                        So even if Litvinenko's killing was
                        illegal in Britain, it is not illegal
                        in Russia.  So... there is no crime.

           Hyatt and Clarke are flummoxed.

                                 BARSUKOV (CONT'D)
                        Besides.  These men are heroes in
                        Russia.

                                 HYATT
                        How's that?

                                 BARSUKOV
                        Litvinenko was a traitor.

                                 CLARKE
                        But you just said they had nothing
                        to do with Litvinenko's murder.

                                 BARSUKOV
                        They didn't.

                                 HYATT
                        Then how can they be heroes?

                                 BARSUKOV
                        Because Litvinenko was a traitor.

           Hyatt just stares at him.  Then:

                                 HYATT
                        Stupid.  Stupid stupid stupid.

                                 BARSUKOV
                        I remind you that you are guests of
                        the Russian state.

                                 HYATT
                        And what exquisite hospitality you've
                        shown. 

           He rises abruptly, knocking over his chair, and storms out,
           muttering as he goes: 
                                 HYATT (CONT'D)
                        Beg pardon if I don't stay for tea.

           EXT. TYVERSKAYA PROSPEKT -- DAY

           Hyatt fumes as he rides off empty-handed in the back of a
           diplomatic sedan, the Kremlin receding in the rear window.

                                 BORIS (V.O.)
                        Surely you can't be surprised.  Did
                        you think they'd just hand them over?

           INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY -- DAY

           Back in London, Hyatt gazes out at the media outside, still
           angry.  Boris seems amused.

                                 HYATT
                        They didn't even try to hide the
                        fact that they did it. 

                                 BORIS
                            (shrugs)
                        They never did.

                                 HYATT
                        What do you mean?

                                 BORIS
                        Their plan was always to get caught.

                                 HYATT
                        You're joking.

                                 BORIS
                        Don't tell me you didn't realize
                        this.  One thousand trained assassins
                        in Kontora, and they send these three
                        idiots?  Think!

                                 HYATT
                        But they've just been exposed as 
                        murderers before the international
                        community --

                                 BORIS
                        The international community!  Oh
                        dear!  Who knows what revenge they
                        will take!  They might send a strongly
                        worded letter!

           Boris' bodyguard helps him  with his camel-hair topcoat as
           he makes his way to the elevator. 
                                 BORIS (CONT'D)
                        You are an addict.  They are the
                        dealer.  They control 70 billion
                        barrels of your drug of choice.  The
                        dealer has sent message to the world,
                        signed in Polonium-210.  It says we
                        are in control now.  We play by
                        Siloviki Rules.  What we want, we
                        take.  We can kill your citizens at
                        will, at home, on your soil, and you
                        can do nothing.

           Hyatt is silent.  Boris stabs the "down" button.  

                                 BORIS (CONT'D)
                        Don't look so sad.  Is how Russians
                        have lived for a hundred years.  We
                        got used to it.  So will you.

           INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY -- NIGHT

           Boris walks out, straightening his tie, smoothing his hair,
           preparing for the cameras outside.

                                 BORIS
                        You see, is not you they're afraid
                        of.  Is their own people they fear. 
                        This is why they must keep killing
                        them.  They know the dissident is
                        out there, the one that will bring
                        them down.  They just don't know who
                        it is.

                                 HYATT
                        Do you?

                                 BORIS
                        I had always hoped it would be Sasha. 
                        But now?  I wish I knew.

           EXT. UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

           As Boris steps outside, the flashbulbs begin.  Boris pretends
           to be in deep, important conversation with Scotland Yard.

           Boris' Maybach has appeared.  His driver opens the door.

                                 BORIS
                        One day my enemies will float facedown
                        in the Volga.  On that day...
                            (climbs inside)
                        ...I am going home.
                                 HYATT
                        And that's when you become our dealer. 
                        Right, Boris?

                                 BORIS
                        Someone has to do it.

           He closes the door, pulls the windowshade shut, and is gone.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAWN

           Sasha's eyes open.  Marina has fallen asleep in her chair,
           her head resting on his blanket.  He touches her hair and
           she wakes.  His voice is pale and thin.

                                 SASHA
                        Kroshka.
                            (a beat)
                        I'm sorry.  For everything.

                                 MARINA
                        I am sorry for nothing.

           Sasha turns to look out the window.  Outside, the satellite
           trucks stand waiting for him to die. 

                                 SASHA
                        I need your help, Marina.

                                 MARINA
                        Anything.

                                 SASHA
                        I want to write a letter.

           Marina nods.  She knows what this means.  She goes to the
           nightstand.  Pulls out a pad and pencil. 

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        I want to thank the British people
                        for their support.  And I want to
                        thank my wife, Marina, who has stood
                        by me.

                                 MARINA
                        You don't have to write that.  

                                 SASHA
                        My love for her and my son knows no
                        bounds.

           Sasha waits.  Finally, she writes it down.   
                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        As I lie here I can distinctly hear
                        the wings of the Angel of Death at
                        my back.  I may be able to give him
                        the slip, but I have to say my legs
                        do not run as fast as I would like.  
                            (a beat)
                        I think, therefore, that this may be
                        the time to say one or two things to
                        the person responsible for my present
                        condition.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A FLASH as Sasha sits for a photo portrait, the diodes on
           his chest exposed for the world to see.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        You may have silenced me.  But that
                        silence comes at a price.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           SASHA in bed, convulsing violently beneath the fluorescent
           light as his vital systems fail.  

                                 SASHA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        You have shown yourself to be as
                        barbaric and ruthless as your most
                        hostile critics have claimed.

           Marina watches her husband trembling in his bed like a man
           freezing to death.  Finally, she crosses to his bed --    

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        You may succeed in silencing one
                        man.

           -- and she climbs in with him. 

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        But the howl of protest from around
                        the world will reverberate in your
                        ears for the rest of your life.

           She holds him as he trembles, as, in the window behind them,
           a HOWLING northern wind strips the leaves from the trees,
           until, finally, Alexander Litvinenko is still.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           THE REAL VLADIMIR PUTIN

           at a TV news conference at the Russia-EU Summit in Helinski.
                                 PUTIN
                        Mr. Litvinenko's death is a tragedy.  

           INT. HOSPITAL LOUNGE -- NIGHT

           Hyatt, Clarke, Boris and other cops and doctors, all utterly
           spent, stare up at the TV bolted to the ceiling. 

                                 PUTIN
                        But there has been no suggestion
                        from the British authorities that
                        Mr. Litvinenko's death was foul play.

           No one even raises an eyebrow at this.

                                 REPORTER (O.S.)
                        But what about the letter released
                        after his death which accuses you --

                                 PUTIN
                        I don't believe he wrote this letter.

           Putin speaks directly to the camera, smirking:  

                                 PUTIN (CONT'D)
                        And to those who wrote this letter I
                        say, alas, you are not God... and
                        Mr. Litvinenko is not Lazarus.

           INT. AUTOPSY UNIT

           Sasha's body lies on a slab.  Nearby lies the lead casket in
           which he must be buried.  Marina touches his face one last
           time.  Then walks away, leaving his body to the pathologists.  

           As she enters the basement elevator, she sees them.  They
           are all clad in radiation suits.  As they crowd around Sasha's
           body, the elevator doors close, shutting us out.  

           INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY -- DAY

           Hyatt stands in the lobby, gazing at the satellite trucks
           and cameras outside.  He turns and spots Marina a few feet
           away, saying goodbye to Sasha's doctors.  

           She approaches the glass doors that lead to the front steps,
           and the gauntlet of cameras beyond.  Hyatt stops her. 

                                 HYATT
                        You don't have to go out there.  A
                        car will take you out through the
                        basement.  No one will see you. 

           Marina says nothing.  She stares out the window, utterly
           still.  Then:
                                 MARINA
                        In Soviet Union, it was a crime to
                        be unhappy.
                            (a beat)
                        Of course, it was never written in
                        the law books that way.  It was an
                        unspoken thing.  Sasha told me.  KGB
                        would sit down with an informant,
                        give him a cigarette, and ask them,
                        Who's unhappy?
                            (a beat)
                        It makes sense, in a way.  Unhappy
                        people cause all the trouble in the
                        world.  They meet together in
                        basements.  They write pamphlets. 
                        Unhappy people start revolutions.

           She carefully dries her tears.

                        That's how they are, you see.  They
                        take every light from your life, and
                        then, when unhappiness is all you
                        have left, they come to claim that
                        as well.  Well they can't have mine. 
                        They took my joy, but my pain is
                        mine alone.  You see, I intend to
                        use it.  I'm supposed to be quiet,
                        to live as a warning to anyone who
                        would do what Sasha did.  But I can't
                        swallow it anymore.  I don't even
                        want to.  I want to scream. 

           She pushes the door open and walks outside.

           EXT. UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON HOSPITAL -- DAY

           As she steps outside, the flashbulbs begin.  This is what
           they have been waiting for.  The widow.  

           But as she descends the staircase, the ravenous clicking of
           cameras ebbs away.  There are no tears, you see.  

           There is only the dancer's preternatural grace, and all the
           force of will that lies behind it.  

           Finally, the cameras fall silent.  She takes her first steps
           before the microphone and lifts her voice to speak.

                                                               BLACK OUT.
