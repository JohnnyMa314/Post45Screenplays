            The cover of this year’s Black List was designed by Leo Roquentin.
            THE BLACK LIST was compiled from the suggestions of over 300 film executives, each of whom 
            contributed the names of up to ten of their favorite scripts that were written in, or are 
            somehow uniquely associated with, 2009 and will not be released in theaters during this 
            calendar year.

            This year, scripts had to be mentioned at least five times to be included on THE BLACK LIST.

            All reasonable effort has been made to confirm the information contained herein.  THE BLACK 
            LIST apologizes for all misspellings, misattributions, incorrect representation 
            identification, inelegant loglines, and questionable “2009” affiliations.

            It has been said many times, but it’s always worth repeating: 

            THE BLACK LIST is not a “best of” list.  It is, at best, a “most liked” list.

            Enjoy.
            THE BLACK LIST reminds everyone that  
                                                                      and applauds
