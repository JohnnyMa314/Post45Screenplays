           INT. JENSEN APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY

           MONTAGE:

           1) Expectant father PETER JENSEN, a 40ish businessman, sits
           with his 8 1/2 month pregnant wife CHRISTINE (mid 30s). 
           They interview a LATINA NANNY in her 50s.

                                 LATINA NANNY
                        ...and I just want to say, I will
                        take care of your baby as if it is
                        my own.

                                 PETER
                        Thank you, Rosario.  We'll be in
                        touch.

           The Latina Nanny exits.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        I don't know about her.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        What?  She's perfect.

                                 PETER
                        Christine, this is the person who
                        is going to be taking care of our
                        child.  We can't just hire some
                        stranger.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        She was my sister's nanny for eight
                        years. 

                                 PETER
                        She's in the mix.

           2) Peter and Christine interview a PREPPY NANNY in her 20's.

                                 PREPPY NANNY
                        ...they had two children and I
                        worked for them for three years.

                                 PETER
                        And in that time, how often would
                        you say you missed worked?
                                 PREPPY NANNY
                        Knock on wood, I was never sick a
                        day.

                                 PETER
                        In other words, you're due.

           3) They interview an OLDER RUSSIAN WOMAN. 

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        A lot of applicants say they know
                        C.P.R.  You'll understand if I'd
                        like to see you prove it.

           4) They interview a JAMAICAN NANNY.  She hands them a resume.

                                 JAMAICAN NANNY
                        I have references from families in
                        the U.S. and Jamaica as well.

                                 PETER
                        Uh huh.  That's great.  And I assume
                        you won't mind submitting to random
                        urine tests?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Peter!

                                 PETER
                        What?  Drug use is part of her
                        culture.

           5) They interview a 20 YEAR-OLD GIRL with a NOSE RING.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        No.

           6) They interview a CAMBODIAN NANNY.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Let's talk about the elephant in
                        the room:  Vietnam.

           7) The RUSSIAN WOMAN is on the floor breathing into a "C.P.R.
           Annie" doll.  Peter holds a stop watch.

           END OPENING CREDITS.

           EXT. ENCINO HOUSE - DAY

           A "FOR SALE" sign is on the front lawn.
           INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A fastidiously dressed male REAL ESTATE AGENT shows Peter
           and Christine a nice but modest house in the Valley.

                                 REAL ESTATE AGENT
                        ... I'm so pleased you like the
                        house, Peter.  Of course I was
                        pleased when you liked it the first
                        four times.

                                 PETER
                        It's a good school district, right?

                                 REAL ESTATE AGENT
                        Yes, still is.  When's the baby
                        due?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I'm having a C-section next Friday.

                                 REAL ESTATE AGENT
                        Caesar salad!  Are we happy about
                        that?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I'm not especially, but Peter is.

                                 PETER
                        I don't like the randomness of
                        natural childbirth.

           The Real Estate Agent's PHONE RINGS.

                                 REAL ESTATE AGENT
                        Would you excuse me for a minute?

           The Real Estate Agent moves off.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I really want this house.

                                 PETER
                        I'm just not sure we can afford
                        it.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        We've been over this.  We have the
                        down payment.  We have plenty of
                        savings.  With both our salaries--

                                 PETER
                        I know, but what if I lose my job?
                                 (MORE)
                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Or what if there's unexpected
                        medical bills?  Or you end up having
                        septuplets?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Honey, stop worrying about the
                        "what-ifs."  I know you're nervous,
                        I am too.  But it's time to move
                        out of the apartment.

                                 PETER
                        I don't feel we have the cushion
                        yet.  How about one life-changing
                        event at a time?

           INT. BULL RUSH OFFICES - DAY

           Corporate headquarters of up-and-coming energy drink Bull
           Rush.  Framed posters on the wall tout their catch phrase,
           "All Rush, No Bull."  Peter enters the office of JERRY EASTMAN
           (50s), company president.

                                 PETER
                        You wanted to see me, Jerry?

                                 JERRY
                        Have a seat, Peter.  I've got some
                        big news.

                                 PETER
                        What's up?

                                 JERRY
                        What comes to mind when I say the
                        name Goran Vodavic?

                                 PETER
                        Boston Celtics.  All Star power
                        forward.  Hits three pointers in
                        his sleep.  Dates supermodels.

                                 JERRY
                        You left out that he's the number
                        one action movie star in Croatia. 
                        And, that he's looking to endorse
                        an energy drink.

                                 PETER
                        Wow, he could do for us what Michael
                        Vick did for Powerade.  Until the
                        dogs and the... you know...
                                 JERRY
                        Right.  Poor guy.  You've got a
                        meeting with Vodavic on Monday.

                                 PETER
                        I'm all over it.

                                 JERRY
                        I knew you would be.  I booked you
                        a room at the Copley Plaza.

                                 PETER
                        That's in Boston.

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah.  Celtics are at home this
                        week.

                                 PETER
                        Oh.  Yeah... right.

                                 JERRY
                        Problem?

                                 PETER
                        Well kind of... Christine and I
                        are having the baby on Friday.  C-
                        Section. 

                                 JERRY
                        Wife about to pop, you don't wanna
                        mess with that.  No worries, I'll
                        send Bob Taicher.  His wife already
                        hates him.

                                 PETER
                        No.  I'm the V.P. of marketing, I
                        should go.  Any chance of moving
                        Goran back a week?

                                 JERRY
                        Can't.  He's meeting with everybody
                        Monday.  Let me send the Taich.

                                 PETER
                        No no no.  I'm going.  Don't worry,
                        it won't be a problem.

           INT. JENSEN APARTMENT - EVENING

           Peter sets the kitchen table.  Christine brings over two
           plates of food.
                                 PETER
                        Look, I'm not thrilled about the
                        timing either, but this is huge. 
                        If we get an NBA star, it'll take
                        us to the next level.

           Peter pulls a chair out for Christine to sit.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        And if I don't go, Jerry will send
                        Bob Taicher.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        God I hate Taicher.

                                 PETER
                        Everyone does.  But if Taicher
                        lands this Croat, he'll be known
                        as the guy who put Bull Rush on
                        the map.  And I'll be known as the
                        guy who used to be the guy who was
                        gonna make partner.

           Christine picks silently at her food.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Making partner means financial
                        security for our child.  And we
                        can re-open discussions about a
                        house.  

                                 CHRISTINE
                        It's just that... this was going
                        to be our last week to be together
                        as just a twosome.

                                 PETER
                        And it still will.  I'll take the
                        red-eye Sunday night.  Meet Goran
                        Monday morning.  Be back in time
                        for dinner Monday night.

           Christine moves over to Peter.  She stretches her arms out
           and rests them on his shoulder, her bulging belly between
           them.  She gives him a kiss.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You should go.

                                 PETER
                        It'll be just like I went to work
                        for the day.  No different.
           EXT. BOSTON - HIGH-RISE BUILDING - MORNING (MONDAY)

           Establishing shot of an imposing office building.

           INT. AGENT'S OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

           Peter (in a finely tailored Armani suit) stands in the doorway
           of a fancy conference room with Croatian NBA star GORAN
           VODAVIC.  Also there is Goran's agent GENE HONG (30s), a
           smooth Asian man with his hair slicked back like Pat Riley.

                                 PETER
                        Goran, it was great meeting you. 
                        All the folks at Bull Rush are
                        very excited at the prospect of
                        working with you.

           Vodavic nods and shakes Peter's hand.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        By the way, my wife and I loved
                        you in "Full Court Mess"

                                 GORAN
                        You saw my movie?

                                 PETER
                        Saw it?  I own the DVD.

                                 GORAN
                        You know, I did my own stunts.

                                 PETER
                        Well who else could hang off a
                        basketball rim and kick a Serbian
                        mobster in the face like that?

           Goran smiles.

           INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

           Peter walks toward the reception area with the gum-chomping,
           blue-tooth wearing Gene Hong.

                                 GENE HONG
                        Awesome job in there, Peter.  Gimme
                        some, dawg.

           Gene holds out his fist for a bump.  Peter gives it to him.

                                 GENE HONG (CONT'D)
                        We just gotta meet with a few more
                        co's, I'll get back to you A-SAP.
           They reach the reception area.  There are SEVERAL MEN IN
           SUITS with various presentation materials.  Gene approaches
           one of the reps.

                                 GENE HONG (CONT'D)
                        Rob, how you doing?  Gimme some,
                        dawg.

           Gene gives Rob a fist bump.  They head off down the hallway. 
           Peter turns to another rep who holds a 7-foot tall cardboard
           cutout.  It's Vodavic shooting a jump shot with a "Lightning
           Juice" bottle.

                                 PETER
                        You got Goran shooting with his
                        right hand.  You know he's a lefty.

                                 LIGHTNING JUICE REP
                        Dammit.

           EXT. LOGAN AIRPORT - MORNING

           A Lincoln Town Car inches its way toward the American Airlines
           departure terminal.

           INT. LINCOLN TOWN CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Peter is in the back, on his Blackberry.  His leather
           briefcase is on the seat next to him.

                                 PETER
                            (into Blackberry)
                        Hey sweetie, how you feeling?...
                        Yeah, I think it went well... Hey,
                        how 'bout I stop by that Thai
                        restaurant on Ventura, pick us up
                        a couple of number thirty-sixes...

           The Lincoln Town Car pulls to a stop.  The DRIVER gets out
           and puts Peter's briefcase on the curb.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Okay, I've got to hurry, I'm running
                        late for my flight.  See you
                        tonight, love you.

           Peter hangs up and opens his car door when... THE CAR DOOR
           IS RIPPED OFF by a beat-up Ford Focus that is angling for a
           spot closer to the curb.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Oh, shit.
           EXT. LOGAN AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

           Peter gets out of the car.  His Driver approaches from where
           he set Peter's briefcase on the curb.

                                 DRIVER
                        Are you okay, sir?

           The passenger door of the Ford Focus opens.  A half-open
           BACKPACK with clothes spilling out is thrown from the car,
           knocking over Peter's briefcase.  Man-child ETHAN TEMBLAY,
           32, gets out of the car, along with a cloud of smoke.  An
           angry Peter approaches the Ford Focus. 

                                 PETER
                        What the hell?  You could've killed
                        me.

           Ethan looks at the Town Car door, which lies on the ground.

                                 ETHAN
                        Dude, you should look before you
                        open your door.

                                 PETER
                        You're saying it's my fault?!

           Ethan grabs his backpack.

                                 ETHAN
                        I'm not saying it's anybody's fault. 
                        Have your guy work it out with my
                        guy, I gotta catch a flight.

           Ethan darts off toward the terminal. 

           INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

           Peter waits impatiently near the front of a long line to get
           through the metal detector.  He tosses his briefcase on the
           conveyor belt, then passes through the metal detector without
           a problem.

                                 X-RAY GUY
                        Bag check!

           The X-Ray Guy stops the conveyor belt.  An officious, tough-
           looking AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE SCREENER approaches and holds
           up Peter's leather briefcase.

                                 SCREENER
                        Is this your bag, sir?
                                 PETER
                        Yes, why?

                                 SCREENER
                        You sure it's your bag?

                                 PETER
                        Is there a problem?

                                 SCREENER
                        I need to hear you state that it
                        is your bag.

                                 PETER
                        Fine.  I state that it is my bag. 

           The Screener reaches into the outside pocket of Peter's
           briefcase and pulls out a brown paper bag.  From that bag he
           pulls out magazines, holding each one up as he calls out the
           name of it.

                                 SCREENER
                            (loud)
                        "Hustler."  "Hustler's Leg World." 
                        "Today's Spanker."

           Peter turns red, as other travelers stare at him.

                                 PETER
                        Those aren't mine.

                                 SCREENER
                        Oh no?  They came from your bag.

           The Screener reaches into the bag and pulls out a small
           ceramic PIPE.  He sniffs it.

                                 SCREENER (CONT'D)
                        Smells like weed.

                                 PETER
                            (re: paper bag)
                        Obviously, that isn't my bag. 

                                 SCREENER
                        I'm gonna have to confiscate your
                        pipe.

                                 PETER
                        It's not mine, none of this is
                        mine.  Keep everything, just hurry.
                                 SCREENER
                        It's gonna take the time it takes.   
                        Please empty your pockets. 

           Peter sighs and empties his pockets.  The Screener sniffs
           Peter's wallet.

                                 SCREENER (CONT'D)
                        Can't tell if that smells like
                        weed or cow hide.

                                 PETER
                        There's no pot in there.  I don't
                        use it.

                                 SCREENER
                        Maybe you sell it.

                                 PETER
                        Do I look like a drug dealer?

                                 SCREENER
                        I don't know, what's a drug dealer
                        look like?  It'll help me for next
                        time.

                                 PETER
                        Well, not like me.

                                 SCREENER
                        Maybe they look more like me.

                                 PETER
                        I didn't say that.  I mean, I'm
                        sure there are lots of black people
                        who are drug dealers who don't
                        look like you.
                            (off Screener's look)
                        You know what, that didn't come
                        out right--

                                 SCREENER
                        I think I'm gonna have to do a
                        more detailed search.

                                                            SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. AIRPORT BACK ROOM - DAY

           Peter has his shoes off.  The Screener is slowly checking
           under the insoles.
                                 PETER
                        You sure you don't want to remove
                        the crown on my back molar?

                                 SCREENER
                        Just doing my job, sir.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, right.  Taking 20 minutes to
                        search me.  Good work.

                                 SCREENER
                        Actually, I'm not quite finished.

           The Screener SNAPS on a LATEX GLOVE.

           INT. AIRPORT - GATE AREA - DAY

           Peter runs toward his departure gate with the awkward stride
           of a man who's just had a finger up his ass.  A GATE AGENT
           is about to close the door to the jetway.

                                 PETER
                        Hold on!

           A winded Peter hands the Gate Agent his boarding pass.

                                 GATE AGENT
                        Mr. Jensen.  I'm sorry but we had
                        to give away your business class
                        seat.  I can put you in 32D, last
                        open seat.

                                 PETER
                        Goddammnit.  Fine, whatever.

           INT. PLANE - DAY

           Peter plops down in an aisle seat of the last row of coach. 
           He puts his wallet, keys and Blackberry in the seat pocket
           in front of him.  He tries to lean his seat back, then
           realizes he's in the row that doesn't recline.  He swears to
           himself then notices the seatmate to his right.  It's ETHAN.

                                 PETER
                        Oh God.  

                                 ETHAN
                        How you doing?  I was originally
                        in the exit row, but I don't want
                        the responsibility.

                        I never gave it much thought until
                        I heard the flight attendant's
                        speech about being able to open
                        the emergency exit and I realized
                        people's lives could be in my hands. 
                        I mean, if we're opening the
                        emergency exit that means we're in
                        serious shit, which means people
                        are going to start to lose their
                        shit, which probably means I'll
                        lose my shit and totally fuck things
                        up and maybe kill people.  I'm a
                        nervous flyer to begin with, I
                        don't want that responsibility.

           Ethan takes a closer look at Peter.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        You look familiar.  Do I know you?

                                 PETER
                        Yeah.  You know me.

                                 ETHAN
                        Do you buy your meat at Shaw's?

                                 PETER
                        You just ripped the door off the
                        car I was riding in.

                                 ETHAN
                        That was you?

                                 PETER
                        Forty-five minutes ago.  Tops.

           Ethan reaches into a brown paper bag and pulls out a magazine.

                                 ETHAN
                        Investor's Daily?  What the fuck
                        is this?

                                 PETER
                        That's mine.

                                 ETHAN
                        I'm completely confused.

                                 PETER
                        Our bags got switched after the
                        accident.

                        pipe, I'm late, I was strip
                        searched, and I have to sit back

                                 ETHAN

                        So, you don't have my magazines.

                                 PETER
                        I threw them out. 

           Peter's Blackberry BEEPS.  He takes it out of the seat pocket
           and reads an e-mail.

                                 ETHAN
                        You tossed my pornos?  Why would
                        you do that?

                                 PETER
                        I didn't know I'd have the good
                        fortune of running into you again.

           Peter turns away from Ethan and starts typing on his
           Blackberry.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)
                        In preparation for take off, please
                        turn off all electronic devices...

           A small LIGHT BEAMS into Peter's eye.  Peter looks over and
           sees that it's the glare coming off of Ethan's IPHONE.  The
           iPhone is off, and Ethan is nervously twirling in his hands.

                                 PETER
                        Do you mind?

                                 ETHAN
                        What?

                                 PETER
                        The sunlight's going in my eyes.

                                 ETHAN
                        Oh, sorry man.
           Peter goes back to his Blackberry.  A beat later, the light
           hits his right eye.  Peter moves his head but the light dances
           over into his left eye.

                                 PETER
                        Alright, now you're doing it on
                        purpose.

                                 ETHAN
                        You gotta turn that thing off. 
                        They made the announcement.

                                 PETER
                        Don't worry about it.

                                 ETHAN
                        I read in Maxim that it screws up
                        the plane's radar.

           Peter ignores him.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        It's not just about the radar. 
                        Terrorists use cell phones to
                        trigger bombs in their luggage.  I
                        don't remember where I read that.

                                 PETER
                        It's a Blackberry, it's not a bomb.

                                 ETHAN
                        I didn't say it was a bomb, I said
                        terrorists use it to trigger a
                        bomb.  At least that's what I meant
                        to say, I might not have made myself
                        clear.  Did I mention I'm a nervous
                        flyer?

                                 PETER
                        Jesus!  If it'll shut you up, I'll
                        put it away.

           Peter puts his Blackberry in his seat pocket.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Okay, there, I put the bomb away. 
                        My bomb is in the seat pocket!

                                 ETHAN
                            (holds up iPhone)
                        And my bomb is in my pants pocket.

           Ethan puts his iPhone in his pocket.  A FLIGHT ATTENDANT
           stares at Peter and Ethan with a look of concern.
           She reaches for the galley phone.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                            (quietly into phone)
                        Get me the Air Marshall.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LOGAN AIRPORT - DAY

           Peter and Ethan sit on chairs in an otherwise empty room.

                                 ETHAN
                        Alright look, we better get our
                        stories straight.  I don't remember
                        who brought up "bomb" first, but
                        let's just say it was you.

                                 PETER
                            (angry whisper)
                        Stop talking.

                                 ETHAN
                        I'm just saying they're gonna
                        separate us at some point and we
                        gotta get on the same page.

                                 PETER
                        Shut up.  They're listening to us. 
                        Do you really think that guy went
                        to get a cup of coffee?!

                                 ETHAN
                        He said he was.  So you think he's
                        not going to bring me one back? 

           They sit in silence for several beats.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        You know I don't think I ever got
                        your name.  I'm Ethan.  Ethan
                        Temblay.

           Ethan holds out his hand to shake.  Peter doesn't.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                            (out of side of his
                             mouth)
                        You really should shake my hand
                        like we're meeting for the first
                        time.  That'll help our case.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Peter and Ethan have been separated.  Peter sits across a
           table from two TSA AGENTS in suits.
                                 PETER
                        Look, I shouldn't have been using
                        my Blackberry after the announcement. 
                        I admit that.  But the rest of this
                        is complete crap.  It's a joke.

                                 TSA AGENT #1
                        It's not a joke to say you have a
                        bomb on a commercial aircraft.

                                 TSA AGENT #2
                        Why did you say there was a bomb
                        in your luggage, sir?

                                 PETER
                        I didn't.  Look, this is all because
                        of this goddamn idiot--

                                 TSA AGENT #1
                        The one who requested to be moved
                        from the exit row to sit next to
                        you.

                                 PETER
                        Yes.  No.  That was before I got
                        there... I don't even know him.

                                 TSA AGENT #2
                        So this "idiot" you don't know,
                        who moved next to you, you're
                        talking to him about ways to trigger
                        bombs.

                                 PETER
                            (sighs)
                        Look, my wife and I are expecting
                        our first child on Friday and I
                        need to get home to L.A.

                                 TSA AGENT #1
                        You have no identification.

                                 PETER
                        I told you, my wallet is in the
                        seat pocket on the plane.

                                 TSA AGENT #2
                        Your fingerprints aren't in the
                        system.

                                 PETER
                        How is that a bad thing?  That
                        means I've never been in trouble.
                                 TSA AGENT #2
                        Well you're in big trouble now,
                        Peter.

           INT. LOGAN AIRPORT - HALLWAY - DAY

           The two TSA Agents look through one-way glass into a different
           interrogation room.  They see Ethan furiously stabbing at
           the buttons on his iPhone.

                                 TSA AGENT #2
                        Did he call or text anyone?

                                 TSA AGENT #1
                        He's been playing "Call of Duty
                        IV" nonstop since we put him in
                        there.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LOGAN AIRPORT - DAY

           The two Agents walk back into the room and sit across the
           table from Peter. 

                                 TSA AGENT #1
                        They found your wallet on the plane. 
                        Seems your I.D. checks out.

                                 PETER
                        Good.  May I have it please?  And
                        my Blackberry.

                                 TSA AGENT #2
                        The plane is in the air over
                        Pennsylvania.  

                                 PETER
                        Dammit, I've got everything in
                        that Blackberry.  Can I go now?

                                 TSA AGENT #1
                        We're releasing you from custody. 
                        But you're being placed on the No
                        Fly List.

                                 PETER
                        What?  Why?

                                 TSA AGENT #2
                        Because you were heard to make
                        statements that can be classified
                        as a threat to aviation.  We don't
                        have any leeway on that.   
                                 PETER
                        Well, how do I get off the list? 
                        Is there someone I can talk to so
                        I can fly out later today?

           The Agents look at each other.

                                 TSA AGENT #2
                        You can petition the Department of
                        Homeland Security's Traveler Redress
                        Inquiry Program.

                                 TSA AGENT #2
                        It used to take months to get a
                        response, but now you should hear
                        back within a couple of weeks.

                                 PETER
                        Weeks?!  How am I supposed to get
                        back to Los Angeles?

                                 TSA AGENT #1
                        On the ground.

           INT. LOGAN AIRPORT - DAY

           Peter is at a rental car counter, talking with a RENTAL CAR
           AGENT and her SUPERVISOR.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        I'm not sure what you're asking
                        me, sir.  You want to rent a vehicle
                        but you have no method of payment
                        or form of identification.

                                 PETER
                        Yes.  But my wife can give you her
                        credit card number over the phone.

                                 RENTAL CAR AGENT
                            (to Supervisor)
                        I told him that's against our
                        policy.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        Sir, even if I were to make an
                        exception on payment, you don't
                        have a driver's license.
                                 PETER
                        I have a driver's license, I just
                        don't have it with me. 
                            (realizes)
                        But I know my number, it's B94--

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        That's not going to be good enough.

           ANGLE: A NEARBY RENTAL CAR COUNTER.  Ethan is chatting with
           a FEMALE RENTAL REP.

                                 RENTAL REP
                        Here's your credit card and driver's
                        license back, Mr. Temblay.  We
                        have you in a Toyota Echo.  Space
                        G-126.

                                 ETHAN
                        I had a buddy who had one of those. 
                        Kind of a little piece of shit,
                        isn't it?  Ehh, no worries, it'll
                        get me to California.

           She hands him his rental agreement.  He notices a small tattoo
           on her wrist.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        That's a cool tat.

                        It's a Chinese symbol for peace. 
                        I got it when I was in Tibet.

                                 ETHAN
                        Tibet?  That's where the Dalai
                        Lama is, did you meet him?

                                 RENTAL REP
                            (laughs)
                        No.

                                 ETHAN
                        I've never been to Europe.  That's
                        something I gotta do.  You got any
                        other tattoos?

           ANGLE: Peter at his rental car counter.

                                 PETER
                        I'll tell you what --
                                 (MORE)
                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                            (reads nametag)
                        Mr. Diaz -- I'll sign whatever
                        form you want releasing you from
                        all liability.  There will be no
                        risk to the Budget Rental
                        Corporation.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        Sir, you're in this predicament
                        because you've been placed on the
                        No Fly List.  That's not exactly a
                        ringing endorsement.

           ANGLE: Ethan.  He's got his sleeve rolled up to his bicep. 
           He shows his Rental Rep a tattoo that reads "BE".

                                 ETHAN
                        ...This was supposed to say Becky,
                        after my dog.  Actually it wasn't
                        really my dog, but I would bring
                        it home scraps from work.  I was
                        drunk enough to start the tattoo,
                        then I freaked out and bailed after
                        the "B-E."  People think it's some
                        philosophical shit, like "To Be or
                        Not to Be."  But it's just part of
                        a dog's name.

                                 RENTAL REP
                            (laughs)
                        You know what, we might have a
                        Chevy Malibu in the lot.  That's a
                        midsize.

           ANGLE: A frustrated Peter points at a sign behind the counter.

                                 PETER
                        It says "Customers Come First!" 
                        I'm a customer!

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        I'm sorry, sir.  There's nothing I
                        can do.

           An exasperated Peter grabs his briefcase and starts off.  He
           turns and watches as Ethan yucks it up with his Rental Rep.

                                 RENTAL REP
                        And do you have a Gold Club card
                        for a free starter tank of gas?

                                 ETHAN
                        Not on me.
                                 RENTAL REP
                        Well luckily I have mine.

           She swipes a card through a reader.

           EXT. LOGAN AIRPORT RENTAL CAR LOT - DAY

           Ethan tosses his backpack into the trunk of a Chevy Malibu. 
           He slams the lid and sees... Peter standing next to the car.

                                 PETER
                        I have no credit cards, no cash,
                        no I.D.  I've got no way back to
                        L.A. and my wife's giving birth on
                        Friday.

                                 ETHAN
                        So, you're looking for a ride?

                                 PETER
                            (with difficulty)
                        Yes.

                                 ETHAN
                        Well... I still didn't get your
                        name.

                                 PETER
                        Peter.  Peter Jensen.

                                 ETHAN
                        Can I see some I.D.?

                                 PETER
                        You know what, forget it.

           Peter starts to walk away.  Ethan follows after him.

                                 ETHAN
                        I'm fucking with you.  Come on
                        dude, we're going cross country. 
                        We're gonna have some fun.  Wooo!

           Ethan hops in the driver's seat and slams his door shut. 
           Peter stands outside the passenger door.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        You getting in or what?

                                 PETER
                        Would you unlock the doors please?
           INT. CHEVY MALIBU - DAY

           Ethan is driving; Peter's in the passenger seat talking on
           Ethan's iPhone. 

                                 PETER
                            (into iPhone)
                        ... so I don't have my phone, but
                        I'm using Ethan's.  You can call
                        that number anytime.  I've
                        Mapquested the route.  It's 2,978
                        miles, I'll be home on Thursday.

           INTERCUT WITH:  Christine at home.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Thursday is cutting it pretty close.

                                 PETER
                        I know, but the important thing is
                        I'll be back in time.

           Peter turns away from Ethan, trying to gain some privacy.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        A full day before the delivery.

                                 ETHAN
                            (loudly)
                        Hello, Christine, I'm Ethan!  Ethan
                        Temblay.  Congratulations on the
                        baby.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        He sounds nice.

                                 PETER
                            (softly)
                        He's kinda like your Uncle Joey,
                        if you know what I mean.

                                 ETHAN
                        You got an Uncle Joey who's hung
                        like a horse?

                                 PETER
                        Hey, it's my wife.  Quit
                        eavesdropping.
                            (into phone)
                        Alright, as soon as we hang up I'm
                        going to call Louise.  She's half
                        a block away, she'll check up on
                        you.
                                 CHRISTINE
                        I'm not an invalid, Peter.

                                 PETER
                        The plan is to reach West Virginia
                        by nightfall.  I don't want to
                        drive any longer than that, I'm
                        exhausted from the red-eye.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        If you're in West Virgina, you
                        should stay with Janine and Steve.

                                 PETER
                        What?  No, I don't want to stay
                        with your cousins.  They hate me.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        They don't hate you.  You just
                        offended them.  Look at it as a
                        chance to make things right.

                                 PETER
                        Okay, fine.  I'll call you later. 
                        Love you.

           Peter clicks off.

                                 ETHAN
                        What's your pleasure, Pete? 
                        Metallica or U2?

                                 PETER
                            (tired)
                        U2, I guess.

                                 ETHAN
                        Okay.
                            (beat; starts singing)
                        In the name of love, what more in
                        the name of love...

           Off Peter's look...

           INT. CHEVY MALIBU - LATER - DAY

           CLOSE UP on Peter's face.  He's fallen asleep in the passenger
           seat.  He slowly opens his eyes.  Sniffs.  A cloud of smoke
           passes by his face.  His eyes get very wide.  He looks down...

           PETER'S POV:  Ethan's head is in his lap, bobbing slightly
           up and down, sucking on...
                                 PETER
                        Aaahh!  What the hell?!

           Ethan lifts his head and we see he's been sucking on the end
           of a BONG which is wedged between Peter's legs.  He has one
           hand on the steering wheel, the other holding a lighter.

                                 ETHAN
                            (trying to hold in
                             the smoke)
                        It's cool, man.

           Ethan straightens and goes back to driving.  He exhales smoke.

                                 PETER
                        What the hell are you doing?!

                                 ETHAN
                        Well as you know, they took my
                        pipe at the airport.  So I had to
                        break out the bong.  And I couldn't
                        hold it and drive, that's not safe,
                        so I--

                                 PETER
                        Are you completely retarded? 

                                 ETHAN
                        I drive better when I'm high. 
                        More kicked back, you know?

                                 PETER
                        How about just one rule for this
                        trip, okay?  The driver will not
                        do bong hits.

                                 ETHAN
                        You know what, my friend?  I don't
                        want to do anything that makes you
                        uncomfortable.  Agreed.

           INT. CHEVY MALIBU - DAY

           Peter is now driving.  Ethan has a giant map unfolded.  He's
           also doing stuff on his iPhone.

                                 ETHAN
                        Check it out.  I found this website
                        called "World's Largest Everything."   
                        Did you know that in Tennessee
                        there's a 20-foot castle made out
                        of petrified horse manure?
                                 PETER
                        We don't have time to sightsee.

                                 ETHAN
                        There's some pretty cool giant
                        stuff  along the way.  We definitely
                        have to see the World's Tallest
                        Totem Pole.  It's only a few miles
                        from the Grand Canyon.

                                 PETER
                        Nope.

                                 ETHAN
                        C'mon, how often are we going to
                        get to drive cross country?

                                 PETER
                        We will only do it this once. 

                                 ETHAN
                        You never stop to smell the roses,
                        do you?  Life's about the journey,
                        not the destination.

                                 PETER
                        What place mat did you read that
                        on?

                                 ETHAN
                        Several.

                                 PETER
                        I've got a baby due on Friday.  We
                        are stopping only for food, sleep,
                        and to use the rest room.  We are
                        not stopping to look at animal
                        feces. 

           They drive in silence for a few beats.

                                 ETHAN
                        Okay, little bit about me.  Until
                        recently, I assistant-managed the
                        meat department at Shaw's
                        supermarket.  I'm currently single,
                        that's by choice.  That's a lie. 
                        And barring one drunken incident,
                        I am heterosexual.  And I too must
                        get to L.A. by Friday.

                                 PETER
                        Good.  We're on the same page. 
                        Same deadline.
                                 ETHAN
                        That's it?

                                 PETER
                        What?

                                 ETHAN
                        A normal person, in the
                        circumstances in which we're in,
                        would have some interest in his
                        traveling companion's personal
                        situation.

                                 PETER
                        You're seriously suggesting that
                        I'm not the normal one here?

                                 ETHAN
                        I'm not speaking to you again until
                        you ask me why I have to be back
                        by Friday.

                                 PETER
                        Can I ask you on Friday?

           Ethan looks hurt.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Fine.  Why do you have to be back
                        by Friday?

                                 ETHAN
                        You don't care.

                                 PETER
                            (sighs)
                        Oh, Christ.  I do care.  I want to
                        know.

                                 ETHAN
                        You totally ruined the moment. 
                        I'm not telling you.

                                 PETER
                        Tell me when you're ready then.

                                 ETHAN
                            (instantly)
                        I'm gonna be on "Survivor."

                                 PETER
                        That's great.

           Peter continues to drive.
                                 ETHAN
                        That's it?

                                 PETER
                        What?

                                 ETHAN
                        A guy says he's gonna be on a TV
                        show, and all you say is "that's
                        great."

                                 PETER
                        Uh, okay...
                            (forced enthusiasm)
                        Hey Ethan, how did you get to be
                        on Survivor?

                                 ETHAN
                        Well I'm not officially on it yet. 
                        I'm in the final two hundred.

                                 PETER
                        Aren't there only like fifteen
                        people on the show?

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah.  That's why I quit my job. 
                        I'm a lock.

                                 PETER
                        That's an eight percent chance.

                                 ETHAN
                        People can manipulate statistics
                        to sound like anything they want. 
                        The flip side is that I have a 92
                        percent chance. 

                                 PETER
                        This is the calculation that made
                        you quit your job?

                                 ETHAN
                        I can't go into the audition with
                        a job.  They're gonna think I'm
                        not serious.  Pull off at this
                        exit.

                                 PETER
                        What?  Why?

                                 ETHAN
                        I gotta drop a deuce.
           EXT. SMALL HOUSE - HORSHAM, PENNSYLVANIA - DAY

           Peter and Ethan stand at the front door.  A 35 year-old WOMAN
           who looks like she's 45 opens the door.  She wears a
           housecoat, has a cigarette hanging out of her mouth, and a 6
           month-old baby in her arms.

                                 ETHAN
                        Hello, my friend and I are out-of-
                        towners who were on Highway 420
                        and I had to go to the bathroom
                        and then we sorta got lost so I
                        was hoping I could use your
                        bathroom.

                                 PETER
                        420?  Isn't it I-90?

                                 HOUSECOAT WOMAN
                        Oh, you're just around the corner
                        from 420.  I can easily give you
                        directions.

           INT. SMALL HOUSE - DAY

           Peter and Ethan follow the Housecoat Woman inside.  There
           are eight kids running around, ranging in age from 6 months
           to 6 years old.

                                 PETER
                        Wow.  You've got a big family.

                                 HOUSECOAT WOMAN
                        They're not mine.  I run a day
                        care center.

           The Woman lights a new cigarette.  She thrusts the baby out
           at Peter who has no choice but to grab the child.

                                 HOUSECOAT WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        Here.  Hold on to...
                            (reads name on diaper)
                        ...Tyler while I give directions
                        to your friend.

                                 PETER
                        Uh okay, but from a liability
                        standpoint--

           But the Housecoat Woman and Ethan head off to the kitchen.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Okay.
           Peter holds 6 month old Tyler in his arms.  He looks out at
           the room, and sees the other kids.  A couple of them are
           fighting over a paintbrush.  One reads a book out loud to
           herself on the couch.  Another stares at a video of Barney
           blaring on a small TV.

           Ethan's iPhone RINGS.  Peter pulls it out of his pocket and
           checks the Caller ID.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Damn.  Jerry.
                            (calls off)
                        Okay, kids?  Can everyone be quiet
                        for a minute, I need to take this
                        business call.

           Peter gently sets Tyler down on the ground.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Don't move.
                            (answers phone)
                        Hey, Jerry.

                                 JERRY
                        Peter!  Good news, Vodavic liked
                        you.  We're still in the running.

                                 PETER
                        Okay, what do we need to do?

           A lonely Tyler begins to CRY loudly.  Peter tries to give
           the "stop" sign with his hand to Tyler.

                                 JERRY
                        Is that a... did you have the baby,
                        Peter?

                                 PETER
                        Uhh--

                                 JERRY
                        'Cause if you did, I can put Taicher
                        on this.

                                 PETER
                        No, we didn't have the baby.  I'm...
                        at a store right now.  Shopping. 
                        Lots of people and uh, kids. 

           Peter gets hit in the eye with a flying paint brush.  Blue
           paint streaks down his shirt.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Ow!
                                 JERRY
                        You okay, Pete?

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, it's just crowded in here.

           Tyler gets up and wobbles like a drunken sailor toward a
           coffee table.  Peter has to cradle the iPhone against his
           neck as he races to stop Tyler from taking a header. 

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Can you hold on a second, Jer?

           Peter covers the iPhone's microphone.  He carries Tyler in
           his arms and approaches a 6 year-old girl reading a book on
           the couch, HALEY.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Hi there.  What's your name?

                                 HALEY
                        Haley.

                                 PETER
                        Haley, how would you like to earn
                        one dollar?

                                 HALEY
                        Okay.

                                 PETER
                        All you have to do is sit here
                        with  Tyler for just a minute,
                        make sure he doesn't go anywhere. 
                        Can you do that?

                                 HALEY
                        I can do it for two dollars.

           Peter sighs and hands Tyler to Haley. 

           EXT. SMALL HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

           Peter, on the iPhone, pulls the back door shut behind him.

                                 PETER
                        Sorry about that, Jerry.

                                 JERRY
                        Goran's agent, the Chinaman, is
                        gonna call you tomorrow morning. 
                        Talk about next steps.   
           From offscreen WE HEAR the SNARLING and GROWLING of a dog. 
           Peter looks to his side and sees a mangey PIT BULL, not on a
           leash, gazing up at him.  Peter backs up a step, and the dog
           moves a step closer.  The pit bull growls then BARKS.  Peter
           holds up his hand, begging the dog not to come any closer.

                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        Did you get a dog, Pete?

                                 PETER
                        No.  No, I'm at a pet store.

                                 JERRY
                        Taicher doesn't have a dog.  He
                        doesn't have kids.  Hell, he may
                        not even have a home.

                                 PETER
                        No, no.  I'm good.  I can handle
                        this. 

           The dog growls again, then LEAPS up onto Peter, startling
           him and TACKLING him to the ground.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Yaaaaah!

                                 JERRY
                        Hell yeah, "yaah!"  I like your
                        enthusiasm.  Let me know how the
                        call goes... partner.

           The dog RIPS at Peter's suit, and slobbers all over him. 
           Peter kicks at it furiously.

                                 PETER
                        You got it, Jerry.

           Peter hangs up and continues kicking at the pit bull, who
           continues to rip into Peter's once-elegant suit.

           INT. SMALL HOUSE - PENNSYLVANIA - DAY

           A disheveled Peter steps back in.  He has mud in his hair
           and on his face, and large rips in his suit.  The paint kids
           are THROWING paint at each other.  Tyler's still on the couch,
           but his DIAPER is on his HEAD.  Haley reads her book.

                                 PETER
                        Jesus.

           Peter awkwardly tries to put the diaper back on Tyler.
                                 HALEY
                        Whose daddy are you?

                                 PETER
                        No one's.  I'm here to get
                        directions.  Actually I'm going to
                        be a Daddy in just a few days.

           Tyler rips off his diaper and throws it over Peter's head.

                                 HALEY
                        You're gonna be a Daddy?  
                            (laughs)
                        Can I have my two dollars now?

                                 PETER
                            (flustered)
                        Umm.  Right.  Sure.

           Peter instinctively reaches into his pocket, then remembers...

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Actually, I don't have any money.

           Haley's bottom lip trembles and she immediately begins to: 

                                 HALEY
                        [LOUD WAILING CRY]

                                 PETER
                        It's okay.  No need to cry.

                                 HALEY
                        [LOUDER WAIL]

                                 PETER
                            (toward rear room)
                        Uh ma'am?  Ma'am?!  I think the
                        kids miss you.

           Peter moves toward the kitchen to get the Housecoat Woman. 
           He does a "swinging knock" on the kitchen door and opens it.

           PETER'S POV:  Ethan and the Housecoat Woman sit at the kitchen
           table, taking hits off a BIG FAT DOOBIE.

           EXT. SMALL HOUSE - PENNSYLVANIA - DAY

           Peter and Ethan walk back toward the car.  Ethan holds a
           large BAG OF WEED.  Peter is pissed.
                                 PETER
                        What kind of country is it where a
                        woman like that runs a day care
                        center?

                                 ETHAN
                        Why do you have to talk shit about
                        Ruth behind her back?

                                 PETER
                        How did you even find her?

                                 ETHAN
                        Craigslist.

                                 PETER
                        She advertises on Craigslist? 
                        What's it say, "Dealing in child
                        care and dope?"

           Ethan laughs.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        You're no different than the
                        children in there.  You only care
                        about what your impulsive little
                        brain wants at any given moment.

                                 ETHAN
                        Oh yeah?  Well would a child have
                        gotten directions back to the
                        highway?

           Ethan holds up a diaper with writing on it.  A beat, then we
           hear NASTY BARKING, as the PIT BULL runs toward them.  Peter
           and Ethan race to the car, getting inside just in time.  The
           dog scratches at Peter's window and tries to bite the glass.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - EVENING

           The Chevy Malibu cruises down a West Virginia highway, as
           day turns to night.

           EXT. JANINE AND STEVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The Chevy Malibu is parked on the street.  Peter and Ethan
           head up the walk to the house.  Peter's suit is in tatters.

                                 PETER
                        Listen, Christine's cousins are a
                        little sensitive about their West
                        Virginia-ness, so be careful you
                        don't say anything to offend them.
                                 ETHAN
                        Why would I say something to offend
                        them?

                                 PETER
                        Trust me, it's easy to do.

                                 ETHAN
                        What'd you say to piss them off?

                                 PETER
                        It's not important, it's in the
                        past.

                                 ETHAN
                        If you don't want me to make the
                        same mistake, you better tell me.

                                 PETER
                            (sighs)
                        A few hours before my wedding, I
                        was in the hotel lobby and I ran
                        into Janine.  She was wearing what
                        looked like some kind of smock. 
                        And I innocently told her that
                        there was time for her to go back
                        to her room and change.

                                 ETHAN
                        So?

                                 PETER
                        Turns out she had already changed.

                                 ETHAN
                        Dude.

                                 PETER
                        I found out later she'd spent two
                        months sewing the hideous dress-
                        smock herself. 

           INT. JANINE AND STEVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Peter and Ethan sit in the living room with STEVE, an amiable
           blue collar guy (48); and JANINE (45), chatty and chubby.     

                                 JANINE
                        So, Peter, you must be excited
                        with the baby on the way.

                                 PETER
                        Oh yeah.  Who wouldn't be?
                                 STEVE
                        I remember when you first got
                        married, you said you didn't want
                        to have kids.

                                 PETER
                        Did I?  No, I probably said I didn't
                        want to have kids right away. 

                                 JANINE
                        I don't think so.  I have what
                        they call an "eidetic memory."  We
                        were at the wedding, table number
                        four.  Steve was on my left and a
                        delightful gentleman named Bob
                        Taicher was on my right.  And I
                        remember exactly what I was wearing.

           Janine glares at Peter.  Peter gives an awkward smile.

                                 JANINE (CONT'D)
                        Anyway, you were drinking a vodka
                        and cranberry juice and you said,
                        quote:  "We've decided not to have
                        children."  And then the band played
                        "I Want To Put On My Boogie Shoes."

                                 PETER
                        I meant not right away.

                                 ETHAN
                        Janine, I gotta ask about that
                        gorgeous dress you're wearing. 
                        Did you buy that in Paris?

                                 JANINE
                        No.  I made it myself.

                                 ETHAN
                        Get the fuck out of here.  You
                        made that dress?

                                 STEVE
                        Yes she did.

                                 ETHAN
                        You should sell your shit on QVC. 
                        You'd be a multi-millionaire.

                                 JANINE
                            (pointed; to Peter)
                        Well, it's nice to meet a man with
                        such good taste.
                                 PETER
                        And those shoes are stunners. 
                        There's nothing you can't make.

                                 JANINE
                        They're from Target.

           An uncomfortable beat of silence.  Then...

                                 JANINE (CONT'D)
                        Oh hey Steve, why don't you go get
                        Missy's wedding album to show Peter.

                                 STEVE
                            (exiting)
                        Right, right.

                                 JANINE
                        You're not too tired to look at
                        some pictures from our daughter's
                        wedding,  are you Peter?

                                 PETER
                        No, no.  Nothing I'd rather do.
                            (to Ethan; hinting)
                        Unless you're too tired, Ethan. 
                        You did say you were tired.

                                 ETHAN
                        Nope.  Got a second wind.  Bust
                        out all the albums you got. 
                        Wedding, vacation, school plays...
                        I love to get a window into people's
                        lives.

           INT. JANINE AND STEVE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A bedroom that used to be used by Janine and Steve's kids. 
           A couple of twin beds and a bathroom off to one end.  Peter
           and Ethan are in the two beds a few feet away from each other. 
           The lights are off.

                                 ETHAN
                        ...you know most people go on
                        Survivor and they try doing all
                        kinds of subterfuge shit.  You
                        know what my strategy is?  Be
                        honest.  Just be myself.  That's
                        how I'm gonna win in Survior. 
                        That's how I win in life.

                                 PETER
                        Good for you. 
                                 ETHAN
                        I'm always honest.  I was honest
                        about Janine's dress.  I'd buy
                        that dress for my girlfriend.  If
                        I had one.

                                 PETER
                        What are you gonna do if you don't
                        get on Survivor?

                                 ETHAN
                        I don't know.  I'll figure it out.

                                 PETER
                        It sounds like you had a good job.

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah, they were talking about moving
                        me up to senior assistant manager --
                        with full bennies.

                                 PETER
                        You could've stayed with that
                        company for twenty years.  That's
                        security.

                                 ETHAN
                        And twenty years from now I could
                        drop dead of a heart attack like
                        my Dad.  Fuck that shit.

                                 PETER
                        That's rough, I'm sorry.

                                 ETHAN
                        He worked for Raytheon right out
                        of college.  Always wanted to quit
                        and build boats.  Never got around
                        to it. 

           A beat.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        So, is your dad still alive?

                                 PETER
                        Yes.

                                 ETHAN
                        What's his deal, what's he do?

                                 PETER
                        I don't know.
                                 ETHAN
                        You don't know?  How do you not
                        know?

                                 PETER
                        I'll tell you about it some other
                        time.  Good night.

                                 ETHAN
                        C'mon, we're having a conversation. 
                        We're bonding.

                                 PETER
                            (sighs)
                        He walked out on us when I was
                        twelve.  I don't speak to him.  I
                        don't even think about him.

                                 ETHAN
                        I don't believe that.  Every guy
                        thinks about his Dad.  I think
                        about mine all the time. 

           A beat.

                                 PETER
                        We really should get to sleep.

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah.  Alright.

           Peter turns over and pulls up his blanket.  After a few beats,
           he hears some creaking and rustling from Ethan's bed, mixed
           in with some SOFT GRUNTS.

                                 PETER
                        What are you doing?

                                 ETHAN
                        Taking care of business.  I can't
                        fall asleep if I don't.

                                 PETER
                        I'm three feet away!

                                 ETHAN
                        I'll be done in a second.  Just
                        don't talk.

                                 PETER
                        For godsakes, take a night off--

                                 ETHAN
                        I'm done.
           INT. BEDROOM - EARLY NEXT MORNING (TUESDAY MORNING)

           Peter and Ethan are asleep.  An alarm clock starts to BEEP,
           BEEP, BEEP.  Peter turns it off.

                                 PETER
                        Ethan, wake up.

                                 ETHAN
                        [GROGGY MUMBLE]

                                 PETER
                        It's 6 a.m.  Let's go.

                                 ETHAN
                        Just give me one or two more hours.

                                 PETER
                        Get up!  We've got over two thousand
                        miles to cover.

           Peter flips on the light and starts to get dressed.  He puts
           on a pair of TARTAN PLAID WOOL PANTS and a LIME GREEN SWEATER.  
           Ethan slowly gets out of bed.

                                 ETHAN
                        What the hell are you wearing?

                                 PETER
                        It's all Steve had left from before
                        he put the weight on.

                                 ETHAN
                        Not sure that's your look, dude.

                                 PETER
                        I'll buy some clothes as soon as
                        we hit a major city.

           Peter puts on one black sock and scans the floor looking for
           the other.  He finds it over by Ethan's bed.

                                 ETHAN
                        That's mine.

                                 PETER
                        No, yours are over there.

           Peter gestures to a pair of blue socks by Ethan's jeans. 
           Peter puts on his sock.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        What the hell?  It's wet. 
           Peter notices Missy's WEDDING ALBUM on Ethan's bed, opened
           to photos of her BRIDESMAIDS.  He looks to his foot, then
           back to Ethan and the open wedding album...

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        OH MY GOD!

           Peter WHIPS off his sock and chucks it across the room.

                                 ETHAN
                        It was dark.  I thought it was my
                        sock.

           Peter drags his bare foot across the carpet to wipe it off. 
           Peter hoists his foot up into the bathroom sink.  He furiously
           scrubs at it with a bar of soap.

                                 PETER
                        You were using Missy's wedding
                        album for... stimulation?

                                 ETHAN
                        Well, somebody threw out my porn.

                                 PETER
                        That's just gross.  And
                        disrespectful.

                                 ETHAN
                        Dude, you gotta check out this
                        picture where they're all hugging
                        each other.  It's borderline lesbo
                        action.

           Ethan grabs the album.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        Oh shit.

           Ethan pulls the album closer and starts rubbing at one of
           the photos.

                                 PETER
                        What?

                                 ETHAN
                        One of the pictures caught a little
                        shrapnel.

           Ethan rubs a little too hard, and he ends up smearing the
           picture.  He yanks out the damaged photo and starts re-
           arranging the other photos on the page.
                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        There's plenty of pictures of the
                        bridesmaids.  They won't notice
                        it's gone.
                            (finishes)
                        There.

           Ethan puts the damaged photo in a trash can. 

                                 PETER
                        Don't put it in there, they'll
                        find it.

           Peter snatches it out of the garbage and shoves it in his
           pants pocket.

           INT. JANINE AND STEVE'S HOUSE - MORNING

           Peter (in Steve's clothes) and Ethan come down the stairs. 
           Ethan's carrying the wedding album.  All the lights are off. 
           They speak in hushed tones so they don't wake anyone.

                                 PETER
                        Put the album back on the coffee
                        table.  I'm gonna leave a note.

           Ethan heads toward the family room.  Peter walks into...

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Peter enters the kitchen.  Janine and Steve are up and
           dressed.

                                 JANINE
                        Good morning!  Don't you look
                        handsome?

                                 STEVE
                        I used to do very well with the
                        ladies in those slacks.  How do
                        you like your bacon, Peter?

                                 PETER
                        Actually, we're gonna hit the road. 
                        Get a jump on the traffic.

           Ethan enters.

                                 ETHAN
                        Janine, Steve, thanks for
                        everything.

           Ethan shakes Steve's hand and kisses Janine on the cheek.
                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                            (to Peter)
                        I'm gonna put my stuff in the car,
                        can I get the keys?

           Peter pulls out his keys and gives them to Ethan, who exits. 

                                 STEVE
                        Oh hey, you dropped something there.

           Janine bends down and picks up a PHOTO off the floor.

                                 JANINE
                        This is a photo of Missy's
                        bridesmaids.  Why was it in your
                        pocket?

                                 PETER
                        Uhhh, it wasn't.  I think it was
                        on the floor.  Maybe you dropped
                        it last night.

                                 JANINE
                        Noooo.  I saw it fall out of your
                        pocket when you pulled out your
                        car keys.

           She looks at the photo more closely.

                                 JANINE (CONT'D)
                        What's this all over it?

                                 PETER
                        Umm, I don't know.  Probably the
                        glue from the photo album.

           Janine licks her finger, touches it to the photo, then takes
           a taste.

                                 JANINE
                        It doesn't taste like glue.

           Peter tries to avoid eye contact.  Janine looks at the
           picture, then back at Peter.

                                 JANINE (CONT'D)
                        Oh my.

           INT. CHEVY MALIBU - DAY

           Peter drives.  Ethan is in the passenger seat.
                                 PETER
                        I went to sleep, and I had righted
                        the ship with my wife's cousins. 
                        And because you can't keep your
                        hands off your dick, the whole
                        thing went to hell!

                                 ETHAN
                        Hey, there's nothing to be gained
                        by focusing on the negative.

                                 PETER
                        Oh, you're right.  Let's focus on
                        the positives.  What possible
                        fucking positive is there?

                                 ETHAN
                        Well... you don't have to have a
                        positive to not focus on the
                        negative. 

                                 PETER
                        You're lucky there are witnesses
                        who have seen us together on this
                        trip.

                                 ETHAN
                        What is that?  Is that a death
                        threat?

                                 PETER
                        Take it however you want to take
                        it.

           Ethan's PHONE RINGS.

                                 ETHAN
                            (into phone)
                        Hello? ... Just chillin'.  What's
                        up with you, dawg? ... Cool.  Cool. 
                        Who is this? ... Gene who?  I don't
                        know any--

                                 PETER
                        It's for me, give me the--!

           Peter grabs the phone out of Ethan's hand.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                            (into phone)
                        Hey Gene, it's Peter.  Sorry about
                        that, I got a new assistant--

           Ethan accidentally cuts a LOUD FART.  Peter covers the phone.
                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                            (to Ethan)
                        Hey, this is an important call. 
                        Do not fuck this up for me.

           Ethan gives Peter an apologetic look.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                            (into phone)
                        ...Listen Gene, if Goran's not
                        comfortable speaking English, we
                        could do more visually oriented--

           Peter catches a whiff of Ethan's fart.  It's pretty rank. 
           Peter lowers the windows.  Noisy wind rushes into the car.   

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                            (into phone; shouting)
                        ... We could do TV ads where we
                        keep the dialogue to a minimum. 
                            (shouts louder)
                        I said we'll keep the dialogue to
                        a minimum.

           Peter rolls the windows back up.  Ethan lets out a LONG,
           SQUEAKY FART.  This one stinks worse than the last.  Peter
           punches Ethan in the shoulder.

                                 ETHAN
                        Sorry, I can't help it.

                                 PETER
                            (struggling to speak)
                        What's that?  What's that, Gene? 

           Beads of SWEAT drip down Peter's forehead.  Ethan grabs his
           stomach.

                                 ETHAN
                        Oooh, incoming.

           It's a seeper.  Peter dry-heaves.

                                 PETER
                            (into phone)
                        You want me to come to Dallas? ...
                        Hold on one second, let me check
                        my schedule.

           Peter cradles the phone between his ear and shoulder and
           starts to unfold a road map.  He takes the opportunity to
           quickly roll down his window, stick his head out, and grab a
           few gasps of fresh air.
           Wind rushes back into the car and blows the map around the
           front seat until it plasters across Ethan's face.  Peter
           snatches the map back, rolls up the window, and scans the
           map.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                            (into phone)
                        I can make it to Dallas tomorrow,
                        no problem.  It's practically on
                        the way... I mean I'll clear my
                        schedule for Goran... Great, see
                        you then.

           Peter clicks off the phone and rolls the windows back down. 
           He hands the iPhone back to Ethan.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        What the hell is wrong with you?

                                 ETHAN
                        Janine's lasagna.  That shit was
                        heavy, man.

                                 PETER
                        No, I'm asking if there's something
                        wrong with you.  That is not a
                        smell that comes out of a human.

                                 ETHAN
                        What was I supposed to do?  Hang
                        my ass out the window? 

                                 PETER
                        It's not funny.  This is my job,
                        it's how I provide for my family.

                                 ETHAN
                        So what's going on in Dallas?

                                 PETER
                        I'm pitching Goran one more time
                        before the Celtics-Mavs game.  If
                        he likes what he hears, I think
                        he'll sign with us.

                                 ETHAN
                        You know, you haven't really
                        explained the whole Vodavic ad
                        campaign to me.  I'm an idea guy,
                        maybe I can tell you how to make
                        it better.
                                 PETER
                        Uh, no.  Thanks anyway.  I've got
                        a headache.  And I'm nauseous. 
                        How about some peace and quiet,
                        okay? 

                                 ETHAN
                        For how long?

                                 PETER
                        Until we get to Kentucky.

           Peter stares straight ahead, not speaking.  Ethan sits for a
           few beats in silence.

                                 ETHAN
                        Alright, here's a question me and
                        my buddies like to debate.  If you
                        had to -- and you've gotta pick
                        one -- if you had to, would you
                        give a hand job to, or get a blow
                        job from... Elton John?

           Peter makes a wincing face, but doesn't respond.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        I pick hand job and I'll tell you
                        why.  I can close my eyes and
                        pretend I'm playing tug of war on
                        a piece of old rope.  Sure it's
                        gonna take a lot longer to complete
                        the act, but at least there's no
                        contact between mucous membranes. 
                        How about you?

           Peter sighs but still stays silent.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        Your silence indicates to me that
                        you would pick blow job.  You want
                        to put your candle in his wind,
                        don't you?

           Peter continues to ignore him.  Ethan angles his iPhone so
           that it beams sunlight at Peter's eyes.  Peter's first
           reaction is to bring down the sun visor.  Then Ethan does it
           again and Peter realizes what he's doing.

                                 PETER
                        Cut it out.

                                 ETHAN
                        I'm just trying to get you to loosen
                        up, man.
                                 PETER
                        I don't need to loosen up.  What I
                        need to do is get to L.A. before
                        my son is born.

                                 ETHAN
                        And we're gonna do that.  But it
                        wouldn't kill you to have a little
                        fun along the way.

           Ethan shoots a light beam at Peter's eyes.

                                 PETER
                        Knock it off.  Don't be an ass.

                                 ETHAN
                        Hey, you don't call a guy an ass
                        for giving you a Hardwick's Brother.

                                 PETER
                        A what?

                                 ETHAN
                        We named it that back in high
                        school.  We were in chemistry class
                        and this guy Billy Hardwick's
                        brother came by and stood in the
                        doorway and was trying to ask Billy
                        for lunch money.  And all of us
                        were like using our watches and
                        calculators and stuff to shine
                        sunlight in his eyes and Hardwick's
                        brother kept squinting and putting
                        his arms up to block it and shit. 
                        It went on for like ten minutes. 
                        Most hilarious thing in the history
                        of the world.

                                 PETER
                        High school?  You got nothing more
                        recent?

           Ethan kicks the Hardwick's Brothering into overdrive.  Peter
           tries to ignore it.  Ethan wiggles the iPhone, creating a
           strobe-light effect.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Goddamnit, give me that!

           Peter reaches over and grabs the iPhone.

                                 ETHAN
                        What are you doing?
                                 PETER
                        I'm going to throw it out the
                        window.

                                 ETHAN
                        No you're not, you need it.

                                 PETER
                        Promise you'll stop Hardwick's
                        Brothering me!

                                 ETHAN
                        Promise you'll lighten up!

           Ethan grabs at the phone, but Peter doesn't release his grip.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        Let go of it!

           Peter SWERVES into the wrong lane.  He almost gets nailed by
           an ONCOMING TRUCK.  Then he SWERVES too far back in the other
           direction.  Out of control, the Chevy WHIPS back across two
           lanes, PLUNGES into a roadside GULLY, and ROLLS OVER.  The
           car ends up on its side, passenger side up.

                                 PETER
                        You okay?

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah, you?

                                 PETER
                        I think so.

           EXT. CHEVY MALIBU - DAY

           Ethan and Peter extricate themselves from the car by climbing
           out the passenger side door.  They stumble a few yards away
           from the vehicle.  They stare back at the Malibu, which lies
           on its side.  Smoke seeps from under the hood.

                                 PETER
                        Alright, maybe we can push it back
                        upright.

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah, yeah.  That's a good idea.

           They take one step back toward the car and then FLAMES start
           shooting out of the hood.

                                 PETER
                        Jesus!
                                 (MORE)
                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                            (beat)
                        Aw crap, my briefcase's in there.

                                 ETHAN
                        Noooo!

           Ethan BOLTS toward the car.

                                 PETER
                        Ethan, forget it.  It's just some
                        presentation materials--

           But Ethan isn't stopping.  And the FIRE IS SPREADING.  Ethan
           sticks his head and arms through the blown out passenger
           window.  Peter chases after him.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        You're gonna kill yourself.  Forget
                        it.

           Peter grabs Ethan by the waist and yanks him out, just as
           the car is ENGULFED IN FLAMES.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Are you crazy?!  It's a goddamn
                        briefcase.

                                 ETHAN
                        I didn't go back for that.

           Ethan holds up his bag of weed.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Soot-covered and slightly bruised, Peter and Ethan walk along
           on an empty stretch of highway, the Chevy burning behind
           them.  They pass a sign, "REST STOP - 3.5 MILES."  Ethan
           talks on his iPhone.

                                 ETHAN
                        ...Yeah, I know that ordinarily
                        you can't get the supplemental
                        insurance on the car after you
                        crash it, but I was hoping you
                        guys could make an exception...
                        Hello?

           Ethan hangs up.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        Welp pardner, good news and bad
                        news.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        Good news is they do have a mid-
                        sized car with air co, somewhat
                        nearby.

                                 PETER
                        Great.

                                 ETHAN
                        Bad news is they charged my credit
                        card 20 grand for the damage and
                        now the card is maxed out so I
                        can't rent another car.

                                 PETER
                        What?!

                                 ETHAN
                        I know, they're being completely
                        unreasonable--

                                 PETER
                        How am I going to get home?  I
                        can't miss the birth of my son.  I 
                        need a car... I shouldn't even
                        need a car.  I should be able to
                        go to an airport and get on a plane. 
                        I am so fucked!

                                 ETHAN
                        Don't flip out on me, dude.  We
                        should be thankful we're alive. 
                        Remember, focus on the positive.

           Peter stops and glares at Ethan.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        C'mon, we'll get to the rest stop
                        and figure it out.

           A frustrated Peter starts marching down the road.  Ethan
           follows after him.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        Oh, shit, I forgot.  Peter!

                                 PETER
                            (stops; turns around)
                        What?

                                 ETHAN
                        You can't wear a condom while he's
                        blowing you.
                                 PETER
                        What?

                                 ETHAN
                        You chose blow job.  So when Elton's
                        blowing you, you can't wear a
                        condom.  If you want to change
                        your mind and pick hand job, I'll
                        let you, because I didn't tell you
                        before.  But when you're jerking
                        him, he can't wear a condom and
                        you can't wear rubber gloves. 
                        It's skin on skin.  There's a big
                        debate about using lotion but--

                                 PETER
                        Stop it!  Just stop talking for
                        one minute!  Can you do that?

           Peter and Ethan walk in silence for a few beats.

                                 ETHAN
                        What are you thinking about?

                                 PETER
                        Beating your head in with a tire
                        iron.

                                 ETHAN
                        You want it on your conscience
                        that you killed the next winner of
                        Survivor?

                                 PETER
                        Not that I give a shit, but you
                        might want to have a back up plan
                        on the "tiny" chance you don't
                        win.

                                 ETHAN
                        Hey, I don't have to win.  Elisabeth
                        Hasselbeck didn't win and she's
                        got her own talk show now.

                                 PETER
                        So you're going to host a national
                        talk show?

                                 ETHAN
                        I could.  I'm good at talking.

                                 PETER
                        Talking a lot and being good at
                        talking are two different things.
                                 ETHAN
                        Well, if the talk show thing doesn't
                        happen, I'll figure it out.

                                 PETER
                        You know, you keep saying that,
                        but life doesn't work that way. 
                        You've gotta have a plan.

                                 ETHAN
                        You can't plan for everything.

                                 PETER
                        Yes, you can.  When I was a freshman
                        in high school, I decided I was
                        going to Stanford.  I changed my
                        curriculum and my extra-currics to
                        ensure I would get in, and I did. 
                        And by the end of my sophomore
                        year, I had already targeted the
                        Fortune 500 companies I wanted to
                        work for.  After I graduated, I
                        laid out a five year plan for when
                        I'd get married and how many years
                        would be between promotions.  Well
                        you know what, I'm at the end of
                        my fourth five year plan, and I'm
                        about to sign Goran Vodavic and
                        get promoted again.  Right when
                        I'm about to have my first child --
                        just like I planned.  So yeah, I'd
                        say it's worth planning and not
                        just hoping you'll "figure it out."

                                 ETHAN
                        Alright, fair enough.  But let me
                        ask you this:  If you spend all
                        your time planning, when do you
                        live?

           INT. REST STOP MEN'S ROOM - DAY

           Peter stands at a sink.  He uses paper towels to clean his
           face and his wounds.  Looks at his disheveled self in the
           mirror.

           EXT. REST STOP -  DAY

           Peter talks on a pay phone.  INTERCUT WITH Christine in the
           apartment.

                                 PETER
                            (into phone)
                        Hey honey, it's me.
                                 CHRISTINE
                        Is everything alright?  You sound
                        like something's wrong.

                                 PETER
                        Uh, everything's okay.  We had a
                        little accident.  Minor delay.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Did you get hurt?

                                 PETER
                        I'm fine.  How are you?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I'm okay.  They delivered the crib.

                                 PETER
                        The alabastair white with the double-
                        lock gate, right?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Yes.  And after they set it up,
                        you realize how tight things are
                        in here.  You know, the house we
                        looked at is still available...

                                 PETER
                        I can't think about that right
                        now.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        When do you think you'll be here?

                                 PETER
                        Don't worry, still on track for
                        Thursday night.  But just to be
                        safe, maybe we should call Dr.
                        Schwartz and see if we can push
                        back the C-section.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I already talked to him.  He's not
                        comfortable doing that.  It's too
                        risky for the baby.

                                 PETER
                        Damn.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I just want you here, Peter. 
                                 PETER
                        You know what, I'm going to call
                        Louise, have her come over and
                        keep you company.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I don't want fucking Louise!  I'm
                        sorry.  I just -- I just want you
                        to get home.

                                 PETER
                        I do too.

           Peter hangs up.  Ethan approaches.

                                 ETHAN
                        Well Mister "there are no
                        positives," fate has been kind
                        enough to introduce us to Claudia
                        and Randi Barnes and their daughter
                        Bethany.

           Ethan grabs Peter and drags him to a LESBIAN COUPLE in their
           early 60's: CLAUDIA, beefy and tough; RANDI, skinny, pretty,
           granola-type; and BETHANY (17) shy and cute.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        The Barneses, it turns out, are
                        driving their recreational vehicle
                        from North Carolina to Los Angeles.

                                 RANDI
                        We're taking Bethany on a campus
                        visit to Pepperdine.

                                 ETHAN
                        And they've graciously offered to
                        give us a ride.

                                 RANDI
                        Ethan told us how your wife's having
                        a baby and how you're so jittery
                        that you crashed the car.

           Ethan smiles at Peter.

                                 RANDI (CONT'D)
                        When we were pregnant with Bethany,
                        this one was a nervous wreck.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I was not.
                                 ETHAN
                        Turns out these guys are also big
                        hoops fans.  I said you could
                        introduce them to Goran Vodavic.

                                 PETER
                        Uh, yeah.  Absolutely. 

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Climb aboard, we're not going to
                        leave two fellow travelers stranded.  

           They head toward an RV that's decked out All-American style,
           including a sticker that reads, "This Motor Home Insured by
           Smith and Wesson."

           INT. RV - DAY

           Cruising down I-44 in Missouri, along the old Route 66 which
           goes to Los Angeles.  Claudia is driving, Randi sits shotgun. 
           Peter and Ethan are in the rear passenger seats.  Bethany is
           off to the side reading a book.

           Peter notices a lot of hunting paraphanelia adorning the
           walls (rifles, scopes, awards, etc).

                                 PETER
                        So... you guys are hunters?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I am, the wife and kid aren't. 
                        Mostly big game.  White-tailed
                        deer.  Elk.  You shoot, Peter?

                                 PETER
                        Uh, well, sort of.  I played laser
                        tag with some guys from my firm
                        last month.

           Claudia gives Peter a disapproving look.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I've charted out the stops between
                        here and Dallas.  There'll be two
                        breaks before we bunk down for the
                        night.  So plan accordingly.

                                 ETHAN
                        Boy, you really know how to party.

           Randi chuckles, Claudia doesn't and shoots Randi a look. 
           Randi rolls her eyes and gives Ethan a playful shove on the
           knee. 
                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        So Bethany, where else you looking
                        besides Pepperdine?

                                 BETHANY
                        Well, I'd like to check out      
                        UC-San Diego too.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Actually, we're going to concentrate
                        on schools that are more academically
                        focused.

                                 RANDI
                        College isn't only about academics,
                        Claudia.  We want Bethany to have
                        a positive social experience as
                        well.  Gotta learn how to party
                        sometime.

                                 BETHANY
                        Jesus, Mom, I'm not retarded.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Whoa!  No taking the Lord's name
                        in vain.  Not in this Winnebago.

                                 ETHAN
                        Well anything you need to know
                        about the collegiate experience
                        Bethany, I'm your guy.

                                 RANDI
                        Where'd you go to school, Ethan?

                                 ETHAN
                        Worcester.

                                 PETER
                        They have a college there?

                                 ETHAN
                        Junior college.  They go the full
                        two years, I did one. 
                            (mumbles)
                        Semester.

           EXT. INTERSTATE 44/ROUTE 66 - NIGHT

           The RV pulls off at an exit with a sign that reads
           "Campground."
                                 CLAUDIA (V.O.)
                        Welcome to Oklahoma.  Campground
                        of America up ahead half a click. 
                        Randi, I'll take an Old Milwaukee
                        if you got one.

           EXT. CAMPGROUND - NIGHT

           The group sits around a campfire, the RV and TENTS behind
           them.  Peter, Ethan, and Bethany roast marshmallows.  Randi
           leans against Claudia, who smokes a big cigar.

                                 RANDI
                        Nothing brings purpose to your
                        life like having a child.  You'll
                        know that feeling soon enough,
                        Peter.

                                 PETER
                        Looks like I'm gonna know that
                        feeling on Friday, thanks to you
                        guys.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I'll give you the secret to raising
                        kids, if you wanna hear it.

                                 PETER
                        I'm all ears.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        It's about having rules, and being
                        there to enforce them.  It's tough
                        sometimes, but you're not their
                        buddy, you're their parent.

                                 RANDI
                        She wanted to put that in our
                        wedding vows.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        As you can tell, I'm the bad cop.

                                 ETHAN
                        Is it rude to ask which one of you
                        is the birth mother?
                            (to Bethany)
                        I think you look a lot like Randi.

                                 PETER
                        It seems rude.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        It's pretty rude.
                                 RANDI
                        He's right, though.  I was a better
                        candidate for the in vitro.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Damn, Randi, talk about rude. 
                        This isn't appropriate campfire
                        chatter.

                                 PETER
                        Christine and I went through in
                        vitro too.  It's nothing to be
                        embarrassed about.  Didn't work
                        for us, though.  Then two years
                        later we were pregnant.  Doctor
                        called it a "miracle conception."

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I don't like talking about it. 
                        Guess I'm old fashioned that way.

                                 RANDI
                        In which way aren't you old
                        fashioned?

                                 BETHANY
                            (laughs)
                        Yeah mom, I'd like to know too.

           There's some awkward, tension-filled silence.

                                 ETHAN
                        Boo-yeah!  This is one perfectly
                        toasted marshmallow.  Somebody get
                        a picture of this.

           Ethan holds up his marshmallow on a stick and takes a photo
           of himself with his iPhone.

           INT. TENT - NIGHT

           Peter is asleep in a sleeping bag.  We see on Ethan's nearby
           iPhone that the time is 1:25 a.m.  The phone RINGS.  Peter
           bolts upright and answers.

                                 PETER
                        Christine?

                                 ETHAN (OVER PHONE)
                            (shouting over noise)
                        No, it's Ethan.

           Peter looks over to an empty sleeping bag.
                                 PETER
                        Where are you?

                                 ETHAN (OVER PHONE)
                        I went out for a bike ride.  But I
                        got caught up in something, I need
                        you to come get me.  I'm texting
                        you the address right now.

                                 PETER
                        You went for a bike ride in the
                        middle of the night?

           But there's no answer.  Ethan has hung up.

           EXT. CAMPGROUND - NIGHT

           Peter, dressed in the tartan plaid pants and green sweater,
           stands among the few tents.  He looks at the map on the iPhone
           and sees the address is 1.6 miles away.  Peter looks over at
           a MOUNTAIN BIKE hanging from a rack on the rear of the RV.

           EXT. OKLAHOMA COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHT

           Peter pedals a mountain bike up to a modest house.  Loud
           music is playing inside.  He checks the iPhone to confirm
           the address, then gets off the bike.

           INT. CAMPUS HOUSE - NIGHT

           Peter enters.  It's a party house.  The music's super loud. 
           College kids are getting high, drinking and making out.

                                 COLLEGE GUY #1
                            (re: Peter's clothes)
                        Somebody's Dad's here!

                                 ETHAN (O.S.)
                        Peter!  Over here!

           ETHAN, beer in one hand, joint in the other, is partying
           with some students.  Peter marches up to him.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                            (to students)
                        This is the guy I was telling you
                        about!

                                 PETER
                        I thought you were in some kind of
                        trouble.

                                 ETHAN
                        I was, man.  I almost died.
           Everyone is silent for a beat, then the students burst out
           laughing.  Then Ethan bursts out laughing.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        Aww, you guys made me laugh.
                            (to Peter)
                        Alright, I wasn't in any trouble
                        but this is like the best party
                        I've ever been to.  Oklahoma
                        rocks!!!

                                 PETER
                        You're unbelievable.  How'd you
                        find this place?

                                 ETHAN
                        Facebook.  Sent out a Friend Finder,
                        said I was in O.K.L.A. looking for
                        a party.

           Peter looks furious.  Ethan puts his arm around him.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        C'mon, Peter, you need this.  You're
                        wound so fucking tight.  Loosen up
                        and party with some Rogers State
                        Hillcats.

           Peter takes several deep breaths to try to calm himself.  He
           pulls Ethan away from the others.

                                 PETER
                        I should beat your ass right here,
                        right now.  But I'm too tired.  So
                        I'm going to bike back to the
                        campsite.  And if you're not around
                        in the morning, I'll tell Claudia
                        to leave without you--

           Peter notices a group of college kids playing GUITAR HERO. 
           The guitar is being played by a familiar-looking girl...

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Is that... Bethany?

                                 ETHAN
                        Where?

           Ethan turns to look where Peter is looking.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        Oh yeah, that's her.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        We were talking, she said she was
                        getting cabin fever.  So I thought
                        I'd introduce her to the collegiate
                        party scene.

           Peter goes over to Bethany, who is rocking out on the guitar.

                                 BETHANY
                            (eyes on the TV)
                        Hey, Peter.

                                 PETER
                        Bethany, do your Moms know you're
                        here?

                                 BETHANY
                        No.

                                 PETER
                            (turns to Ethan)
                        We gotta get her back.  Now.

                                 BETHANY
                        I'm about to get the the high score
                        here.  Just give me ten minutes.

                                 PETER
                        Ten minutes, that's it.

           Peter moves aside.  He takes a few steps and runs into
           ROOSTER, a massive, offensive lineman type.

                                 ROOSTER
                        Yo!  Ethan, is this the Red Bull
                        guy, bro?

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah.  He's like almost the head
                        of all of Red Bull.

                                 PETER
                        Not Red Bull.  Bull Rush.

                                 ROOSTER
                        Bull Rush?  Bull Rush is an inferior
                        beverage.

                                 PETER
                        And why is that?

                                 ETHAN
                        Oh shit.  It's on!
                                 ROOSTER
                        'Cause you can't mix it with vodka. 
                        You can mix Red Bull with vodka --
                        it's called a Red Bull and vodka.

                                 PETER
                        Have you ever tried Bull Rush and
                        vodka?

                                 ROOSTER
                        No.

                                 PETER
                        Market research shows consumers
                        prefer the taste of Bull Rush and
                        alcoholic beverages over Red Bull
                        nearly two to one.

                                 ROOSTER
                        Red Bull, Bull Rush, what you just
                        said is Bull Shit.

           Rooster playfully pokes Peter in the chest.

                                 ETHAN
                        It.  Is.  Motherfuckin' on!

                                 PETER
                        Where's your bar?

                                 ROOSTER
                        Back there.

           Rooster points to an impressively stocked bar with all
           different kinds of booze.

                                 PETER
                        You got any Bull Rush in this dump?

                                 ROOSTER
                        I can find some.

           Peter takes off his jacket and rolls up his sleeves.

                                 PETER
                        Bring some cups.
                            (re: music)
                        And turn this shit down.

           INT. CAMPUS HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

           Peter is behind the bar, mixing drinks at a furious pace and
           calling out the names of the drinks to the large crowd that
           has gathered around.
                                 PETER
                        Bull Rush, tequila, and margarita
                        mix is a Bullgarita... Bull Rush,
                        Midori and vodka is a MelonBull...

           The partygoers down some drinks.  Peter tosses a few back
           too.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        B.R., gin and orange juice is a
                        Bull Rush Original Gangsta...

                                 ETHAN
                        O.G.!  Talkin' a coupla O.G.'s up
                        in here.

           Peter grabs a clear glass and turns to Rooster.

                                 PETER
                        I'll tell you what, my friend --
                        Rooster is it?

                                 ROOSTER
                        Rooster it is.

                                 PETER
                        I'm going to fill this glass here
                        with the best tasting energy drink
                        in America...

           Peter empties a can of Bull Rush into the glass.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        And then I'm going to pour some
                        Jagermeister into this shot glass. 
                        And then I'm going to drop the
                        shot glass into the big glass and
                        you're gonna drink a Bull Rush
                        Torpedo!

           The mixture of Bull Rush and Jagermeister spills over the
           top of the glass.  The massive Rooster downs it effortlessly. 
           He pauses for a beat, wipes his mouth with his sleeve, then:

                                 ROOSTER
                        Whooooooo!  Bull Rush Torpedo!

           INT. CAMPUS HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

           Peter is sitting at the bar, drinking with a few college
           students.  He's enjoying himself.  He downs a large cup.
                                 PETER
                        Man, that is smooth.  Can't even
                        taste the Bull Rush.

                                 COLLEGE GUY #2
                        Dude, we've been leaving out the
                        Bull Rush for like an hour.  You've
                        been drinking straight vodka.

                                 PETER
                        Then top me off, motherfucker!

           Peter laughs and holds out his cup.

           INT. CAMPUS HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

           A DRUNKEN PETER stands atop the bar with several students,
           and Ethan.  They're singing the Rogers State Hillcats' fight
           song.  Peter holds up a can of Bull Rush.

                                 PETER/ETHAN/STUDENTS
                            (singing)
                        ...Put on your shirt/Put on your
                        hat/Let them know you're a Rogers
                        State Hillcat! ... Put up your
                        dukes/Pick up your bat...

           One of the Students grabs a blue and red painted HILLCAT
           BASEBALL BAT and holds it up like a microphone.

                                 PETER/ETHAN/STUDENTS (CONT'D)
                        ...And fight, fight, fight like a
                        Rogers State Hillcat! 

           Everybody cheers.  Peter FALLS OFF the bar.

           INT. CAMPUS HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

           Several hours and drinks later, Peter is drinking and holding
           court with a group of students and Bethany and Ethan.

                                 PETER
                        ... You kids should make the most
                        of your time at college.  I'm a
                        Vice President, on my way to being
                        Partner Vice President.  Study
                        hard and some day you too can be a
                        big shot at a top ranked energy
                        beverage company.

                                 ETHAN
                        To Bull Rush.

           Everyone raises their cup and takes a drink.
                                 PETER
                        But I didn't have it handed to me. 
                        Nothing's ever been handed to me. 
                        I had to man-up early.  My Dad
                        left when I was twelve.  He was a
                        drinker and a gambler.  And a douche
                        bag.  I don't gamble.  I don't
                        douche bag.  I really don't drink
                        much either.

                                 BETHANY
                        To not drinking!

                                 PETER
                        Bethany?  Ethan, Bethany's here.

                                 ETHAN
                        Sorry about your dad, Peter.  That's
                        harsh.

                                 PETER
                        Not your fault, partner.
                            (turns to others)
                        Traveling partner.  We're traveling
                        partners 'cause the government
                        banned us from the skies.

                                 ETHAN
                            (cocky)
                        Anyone else here on the No Fly
                        List?  Huh?  Nobody?  I didn't
                        think so.

           Peter downs the rest of his drink and goes to get a beer. 
           He squeezes past a caffeined-out WEIRD LOOKING GUY and takes
           a seat on the couch.  Ethan joins Peter, they're alone.

                                 PETER
                        I'm not gonna be like him.

                                 ETHAN
                        That freak?  Why would you want
                        to?

                                 PETER
                        No, my dad.  The day he left, that's
                        the day I became a man.  A twelve
                        year-old man.  I mowed lawns and
                        shoveled snow and saved every penny
                        and put myself through college. 
                        Did you know I got an M.B.A. at
                        night?
                                 ETHAN
                        I took harmonica lessons at night.

                                 PETER
                        Can I tell you a secret?  I can
                        tell you a secret because we're
                        traveling partners.  And traveling
                        partners share everything, right?

                                 ETHAN
                        Absolutely.

           Peter leans in.

                                 PETER
                        I'm scared to death about having
                        this kid.

                                 ETHAN
                        What are you so scared of, man?

                                 PETER
                        I'm not ready.

                                 ETHAN
                        You're ready, you're just drunk.

                                 PETER
                        I don't have my ducks in a row. 
                        The ducks need to be lined up. 
                        And they're not, they're not
                        properly rowed.

                                 ETHAN
                        What?

                                 PETER
                        What?

           Peter stares at Ethan, confused.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        I need a drink.

           INT. CAMPUS HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

           The music's pumping.  Ethan's off in a corner with a HOT
           FEMALE GRAD STUDENT, holding a bong.

                                 ETHAN
                        So, we've smoked like half a pound
                        of my weed.  You wanna, uh, go
                        somewhere more private now?
                                 HOT GRAD GIRL
                        I'm not going to fuck you, dude.

                                 ETHAN
                        Oh, okay.  You wanna go somewhere
                        more private and you don't have to
                        fuck me?

                                 HOT GRAD GIRL
                        I'm not going to blow you either.

           Ethan stands alone for a beat.  A shockingly ugly GOTH GIRL
           approaches.

                                 GOTH GIRL
                        You got any more weed?

                                 ETHAN
                        Uh, no.  Sorry, all out.

                                 GOTH GIRL
                        Oh, 'cause I'd blow you for it.

           Ethan looks the Goth Girl up and down, contemplating.

                                 ETHAN
                            (sighs)
                        This is really a borderline call...
                        Does that lip ring come out?

                                 GOTH GIRL
                        Yeah.

                                 ETHAN
                        Alright, I do have more weed.

                                 GOTH GIRL
                        Let's go.

           The Goth Girl grabs Ethan's hand and starts to lead him off. 
           A college senior, MARK, intercepts them.

                                 MARK
                        Hey, what're you doing?

                                 GOTH GIRL
                        Leave us alone, Mark.

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah, leave us alone, Mark.

                                 MARK
                        That's my girlfriend, asshole.
                                 ETHAN
                        Well your girlfriend's about to
                        blow me, so out of my way.

           Mark gets in Ethan's face.

                                 MARK
                        You lookin' to get your ass kicked?

                                 ETHAN
                        I'm not looking for anything. 
                        Your girlfriend seems to be looking
                        for a few more inches, Stumpy. 
                        Maybe you oughta watch, learn how
                        to treat a lady.

           Mark shoves Ethan hard against the wall.  Ethan pushes back,
           knocking Mark into a five-man game of "quarters."  And the
           fight is on.  Mark tackles Ethan to the ground.  Ethan punches
           him in the head and kicks him off. 

           The fight goes on and Ethan eventually gets the upper hand...
           which is when two of Mark's buddies grab Ethan and hold him
           back.  Mark spits out some blood and starts wailing on Ethan.

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                        Get off him!

           They turn to see Peter holding the red and blue painted
           HILLCAT BASEBALL BAT.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        I said get the fuck off him!

           Peter starts SMASHING beer bottles, lamps, bongs, etc. 
           Bethany and other students enter to see what all the commotion
           is about.  Bethany is wearing the Guitar Hero guitar.

                                 MARK
                        Easy, man. 

                                 PETER
                        I will kill every last motherfucker
                        here!  You've got no idea the
                        pressure I'm under!  Croatians!  A
                        baby!  Look what I'm wearing! 
                        Aaaaahh!!!

           Peter smashes a coffee table.

                                 MARK
                        Okay.  Just put the bat down.
           Peter doesn't.  He instead cocks the bat back like Barry
           Bonds.

                                 ETHAN
                        Dude, I didn't know you were a
                        lefty.

                                 PETER
                        We're getting out of here.  You
                        too, Bethany.

           Bethany hands the guitar to a student, then she and Ethan
           head toward the front door.  Peter backpedals behind them,
           holding the bat out menacingly.  He looks out at the disturbed
           faces of the partygoers and then lowers the bat.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Drink Bull Rush.

           Peter, Ethan, and Bethany run out the door as fast as they
           can.

           INT. TENT - NEXT MORNING (WEDNESDAY MORNING)

           The sun beams into Peter's tent.  He wakes up, hungover. 
           Ethan is already up and out.

           EXT. CAMPGROUND - MORNING

           Peter comes out of the tent and shields his eyes from the
           glare of the sun.  He sees Claudia, wearing a jog bra and
           shorts, doing one-handed push-ups.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        'Morning, lazy bones.

                                 PETER
                        'Morning.  Where is everybody?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I don't know.  Just got back from
                        running a 10K.

                                 PETER
                        You seen Ethan?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Nope.

           Claudia does one final push-up then stands up.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT'D)
                        Wanna give me a hand getting
                        breakfast going?
                                 PETER
                        Sure, no problem.  We should make
                        it a quick one, I need to buy a
                        suit when we get to Dallas.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Roger that.

           Peter follows Claudia to the RV.

           INT. RV - MORNING

           Claudia is looking in the fridge, handing items back to Peter.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Alright, I've got eggs, bacon,
                        wheat bread, white bread, O.J.--

                                 ETHAN (O.S.)
                        [GRUNTING SEXUAL NOISES]

                                 CLAUDIA
                        What the hell is he doing?

                                 PETER
                        Oh, God.  Sorry.  He's immature...
                        still got the hormones raging...

                                 CLAUDIA
                        He's whacking it?

           Claudia starts laughing.  Peter chuckles along.  Then we
           hear FEMALE MOANING NOISES.  Claudia stops laughing.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT'D)
                        What the--?!

           Claudia pushes past Peter to the rear of the RV.  She flings
           open the closed bedroom door to find...

           ETHAN AND RANDI

           Fully NAKED on the bed.  Ethan's doing the gray-haired Randi
           doggie style.

                                 PETER
                        Oh, shit.

           Ethan and Randi look up, two deer caught in headlights.
           EXT. INTERSTATE 44/ROUTE 66 - MORNING

           Ethan walks next to Peter, who has a look of total horror
           and disbelief.

                                 PETER
                        I'll be honest.  I thought after
                        you jacked off on a wedding album,
                        that you'd fired your best shot. 
                        But I gotta hand it to you.  You
                        exceeded my expectations.

                                 ETHAN
                        Randi is obviously not completely
                        committed to the lesbian lifestyle.

                                 PETER
                        Oh, then that makes it okay. 
                        Because for a minute there, I was
                        going to be angry at you for fucking
                        the 60 year-old domestic partner
                        of the one person who could get us
                        to California! 

           Peter walks ahead.  Ethan catches up to him.

                                 ETHAN
                        It's really Claudia's fault.  I
                        mean, she loves Randi but you can't
                        totally control someone for twenty
                        years and not expect--

                                 PETER
                        Do you ever stop to think that
                        maybe your impulses have
                        consequences?  Not just for you,
                        but for me as well?

                                 ETHAN
                        It wouldn't hurt you to be impulsive
                        every now and then -- like you
                        were last night.  That's the Peter
                        Jensen I wanna hang out with. 

           A car approaches from down the highway.  Peter holds his
           thumb, but the car just speeds on by.  Peter checks his watch.

                                 PETER
                        Fuck.  I'm never going to make the
                        meeting.  Gimme your phone.

                                 ETHAN
                        Oh man, I forgot to tell you.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        That agent dude called this morning. 
                        The meeting's off.

                                 PETER
                        What?

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah, he said something came up,
                        he couldn't do Dallas, wanted you
                        to meet him in Seattle.  I told
                        him we couldn't do Seattle, we're
                        having a baby Friday.  He said he
                        couldn't push it, it had to be
                        Seattle.  I said he wasn't
                        understanding me.  Things got a
                        little heated, words were exchanged,
                        bottom line is I pulled us out.

                                 PETER
                        Pulled us out?  Who's us?

                                 ETHAN
                        You.  Me.  The company.

                                 PETER
                        You don't work for the company!

                                 ETHAN
                        He thought I did.  You know, Gene
                        said some pretty disrespectful
                        things.  Not just about me, but
                        about Bull Rush too.

           Peter frantically dials the iPhone.

                                 PETER
                        Hey Gene, it's Peter Jensen...

           INTERCUT WITH:  Super-Agent Gene Hong, on his Bluetooth,
           chomping on a piece of gum.

                                 GENE HONG
                        Hey Peter.  What's up, dawg?

                                 PETER
                        Gene, I think there's been a
                        misunderstanding.  The guy you
                        talked to earlier, he was just a
                        temp.  Total flake, he's been fired. 
                        Where are you guys gonna be middle
                        of next week, because I can meet
                        you--
                                 GENE HONG
                        Let me stop you there, P-man. 
                        Goran's going with Thunder Juice.

                                 PETER
                        What?  Gene, it's just a couple
                        days.  What about a videoconference--

                                 GENE HONG
                        It's not gonna work out this time,
                        dawg.  But hey, good luck on the
                        baby thing.  E-mail me your address,
                        I'll have my office send a gift.

           Gene hangs up.  Peter turns to Ethan.

                                 PETER
                        I could have closed this.  But
                        because of you, now this whole
                        trip was for nothing.

                                 ETHAN
                        Okay.  That's fine.  You can blame
                        me if you want.

                                 PETER
                        Who the hell else should I blame?

                                 ETHAN
                        An impartial observer might conclude
                        that this guy's been stringing you
                        along the whole time.  That he's
                        been using you to negotiate a better
                        deal with your competitor.

           Peter thinks about this for a beat.  Ethan might have a point.

                                 PETER
                        You had no right to do that. 

           Peter starts walking.  Ethan follows him.

                                 ETHAN
                        For my money, there are other hoops
                        stars who are better suited for
                        the product.  You thought about D-
                        Wade?

                                 PETER
                        The only thing I'm thinking about
                        now is getting home.

           They walk for a little bit and Peter stops at a roadsign
           that reads:  "Tulsa 38 miles.  Albuquerque 619 miles.
           Los Angeles 1436 miles."

                                 ETHAN
                        Whoa.  We're not walking to L.A.

                                 PETER
                            (points)
                        Tulsa.  I've got a college buddy
                        there.  Maybe he can get us a car.

           EXT. JIM'S HOUSE - DAY

           A small, single-story home in Tulsa.

           INT. JIM'S HOUSE - DAY

           Near the end of lunch, finishing up some steaks.  Peter and
           Ethan sit at a small dining room table with JIM CALVIN, a
           big, African-American, former college football player, the
           same age as Peter. 

           (Peter now wears a XXL pullover shirt that Jim gave him, as
           well as a pair of jeans that are too big and have to be
           cinched tight at the waist.  Peter will have to keep pulling
           up the pants for the rest of the movie.)

                                 JIM
                        ... Nah, Pete didn't party much in
                        college.  Sumbitch was too busy
                        studying and working two jobs.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, I didn't have time for much
                        else.

                                 JIM
                        Found time to steal my girlfriend.

                                 PETER
                        I didn't steal Christine, you two
                        had already broken up.

                                 JIM
                        Well, there's "broken up" and
                        there's "broken up."

                                 ETHAN
                        Wait, "Christine" as in your wife
                        Christine?

                                 JIM
                        One and the same.  God's gift to
                        this great green planet.

                        Great woman.  The best.  Sweet
                        Christine McGowan.

           Jim takes a bite of steak and stares off into the distance. 
           Ethan looks at Peter, who seems uncomfortable.

                                 ETHAN
                        Uh, hey, Jim.  You ever been to
                        the Grand Canyon?

                                 JIM
                        Coupla times.  Hiked to the bottom
                        and slept by the river once.

                        Tell your bud here to let me stop
                        and  take a look.

                                 PETER
                        If we didn't have time when we
                        started out, we definitely don't
                        have time now. 

                                 JIM
                        He's got a point, Ethan.  Man's
                        wife is having a baby.  You line
                        up Dr. Schwartz, you better be
                        there on time.  Best cutter in
                        L.A.

                                 PETER
                        How do you know we're using
                        Schwartz?

                                 JIM
                        Christine mentioned it in one of
                        her e-mails.

                                 PETER
                        Oh, okay. 
                            (beat)
                        How many e-mails does she send
                        you?

                                 JIM
                        What do you mean?  It's e-mail. 
                        You know, every couple days,
                        whatever.
                                 PETER
                        You e-mail my wife every couple
                        days?

                                 ETHAN
                        Oops.

                                 JIM
                        I send her a joke, she hits me
                        back with an LOL.  No big deal.

                                 PETER
                        It's not a big deal.  It's just
                        that she's never mentioned it.
                            (beat; mumbling)
                        It's obviously more than LOL if
                        you know which OB/GYN we're using.

           Jim starts picking his teeth with a toothpick.

                                 JIM
                        You've really made it, Pete.  Just
                        like we all knew you would.  You
                        got it all.  Good job.  Great wife. 
                        Kid on the way.  And you can bet
                        Christine will get that smokin'
                        hot body back real soon after giving
                        birth.

                                 PETER
                        Uh, thanks, Jim.  What about you? 
                        You seeing anyone?

                                 JIM
                        I'm out there looking.  Dated my
                        personal trainer for awhile.  We
                        even talked about moving in
                        together, but...
                            (chuckles; claps Peter
                             on shoulder)
                        ... this guy here took the best
                        damn woman I ever had.

           An awkward beat of silence.

                                 ETHAN
                        Welp, I better try to squeeze one
                        out before we hit the road again. 
                        Where's your toiletto?

           INT. JIM'S HOUSE - LATER

           Jim and Peter are finishing clearing the dinner plates. 
           Ethan is still in the bathroom.
           Jim reaches into his pocket and tosses Peter a set of keys.

                                 JIM
                        So, it's an old truck, 95,000 miles. 
                        But she'll get you to L.A. no
                        problem.

                                 PETER
                        I'll have someone drive it back
                        after--

                                 JIM
                        Nah, I'll drive it back myself
                        after I fly out to see the baby.

                                 PETER
                        Oh, okay.  Thanks.

           Jim makes an "it's nothing" gesture.  Ethan returns.

                                 ETHAN
                        Well, in retrospect, I probably
                        should have eaten something other
                        than steak and dinner rolls.  I
                        totally balked in there.

           Ethan notices a FRAMED PHOTO on an entertainment center shelf.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        Whoa, that chick can work a straw. 
                        Is that the personal trainer?

           ANGLE: THE PHOTO.  It's Jim and Christine at a Mexican
           restaurant/bar sipping on two straws from a giant glass. 
           Christine is almost cheek to cheek with Jim.

                                 JIM
                        That's Christine.

                                 ETHAN
                        Seriously?

           Peter moves over to look at the photo.  Behind it, there are
           several other photos of Christine (from college, etc). 

                                 PETER
                        Uh, I don't remember this.  Where
                        is it from?

                                 JIM
                        Last year in San Diego.  Chris
                        told you we ran into each other
                        down there, right?
                                 PETER
                        Ran into, yes.  She didn't say you 
                        shared a Mojito.

                                 JIM
                        Margarita.  Christine doesn't--

                                 PETER
                        --like rum, I know.

                                 ETHAN
                            (squints to read photo)
                        What's the date on this, June 19th?

                                 JIM
                        Sounds about right.  Who's ready
                        for dessert?

           Jim exits to the kitchen, leaving Peter and Ethan.

                                 ETHAN
                            (whispering)
                        Dude, June 19th is like nine months
                        ago.

                                 PETER
                        So?

                                 ETHAN
                        No disrespect, but I think this
                        guy had sex with your wife.

                                 PETER
                        That's insane. 

                                 ETHAN
                        I'm just saying, she wanted to
                        have a baby.  And you said yourself
                        that you couldn't get an erection...

                                 PETER
                        No I didn't.

                                 ETHAN
                        "In vitro."  Isn't that Latin for
                        impotent?

                                 PETER
                        No.  Not even close.

                                 ETHAN
                        Well, you couldn't get her pregnant.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        So she rendez-vouses with this big
                        black ex-boyfriend, gets him
                        drunk...  Now she's e-mailing him
                        ten times a day...  "Miracle
                        conception?"  I don't think so. 
                        Come D-day, you're in for a big
                        surprise.

           Jim returns with dessert.

                                 JIM
                        I hope you guys like key lime pie. 
                        I make a mean key lime pie.

           Ethan takes a plate of pie.  An annoyed Peter takes one also,
           without saying anything. 

                                 JIM (CONT'D)
                        Hey Pete, you pick a name for the
                        boy yet? 

                                 PETER
                        Of course.  But we're not telling
                        people until after--

                                 JIM
                        I like the name Jerome.  Jerome
                        Jensen.  We can call him J.J. 
                        Jerome was my father's name.

           Ethan shoots Peter a look.

                                 PETER
                        Why would we name him after your
                        father?

                                 JIM
                        It's not "after" my father, it's
                        just the same name.

                                 ETHAN
                        It's kind of a black person's name,
                        isn't it?  Old school black.  If
                        you're gonna go with a black name,
                        do something fresher like Carmello
                        or Plaxico.  Something that ends
                        in an "o."

                                 JIM
                            (to Ethan)
                        Are you for real?
                                 ETHAN
                            (oblivious)
                        What?

           The guys eat their pie in awkward silence, until...

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        Jim, did you bang Peter's wife in
                        San Diego?

                                 JIM
                        What the fuck did you just say?!

                                 PETER
                        Ethan, for chris'sakes.

                                 JIM
                        You come into a man's home, eat
                        his lime pie and then accuse him
                        of adultery with his friend's wife? 
                        So I was in San Diego and ran into
                        an ex-girlfriend.  The operative
                        word there is ex.  E-X.  We had a
                        few drinks, I walked her back to
                        her hotel.

                                 PETER
                        Wait, what?!

                                 JIM
                        Would you rather I didn't walk her
                        back, Pete?  Let her walk alone at
                        night?   

                                 PETER
                        No, I wouldn't.  But I'm supposed
                        to believe you just "ran into" her
                        in San Diego?

                                 JIM
                        Now you're starting with this shit?

                                 PETER
                        Well Jim, it's pretty clear you
                        still have feelings for Christine. 
                        I mean, did you run into her in
                        San Diego or did you plan to run
                        into her?

                                 JIM
                        Look, Pete, I know you're under a
                        lot of stress.  And you've been
                        cooped up with this d-bag for two
                        days--
                                 ETHAN
                        Wait.  What'd I do? 

                                 JIM
                        Take the truck.  Get going before
                        I change my mind.

           INT. JIM'S PICK-UP TRUCK - DAY

           An old Ford pick-up truck.  Ethan rides shotgun.  Peter
           drives, he's talking on Ethan's iPhone.

                                 PETER
                        ...Hey Christine, I left you a
                        message at home too.  Just checking
                        in, seeing how you're doing.  We're
                        in Oklahoma.  Ran into Jim Calvin. 
                        Wanted to discuss that with you...
                        Unless he's already e-mailed you. 
                        Anyway, call me back.

           Peter hangs up.

                                 ETHAN
                        Sorry, dude, about your kid.  Jim's
                        kid.  The kid.

                                 PETER
                        You're completely off base.  I am
                        not discussing this any further. 

                                 ETHAN
                        The important thing is, you'll
                        love the baby no matter what.

                                 PETER
                        You know what?!  I should leave
                        you right here, right now.

                                 ETHAN
                        Dude--

                                 PETER
                        But I'm not going to.  Because
                        when you had a car, you helped me
                        out.  But I'm done screwing around. 
                        We're driving straight through the
                        night.

                                                        SMASH CUT TO:
           EXT. HIGHWAY - OKLAHOMA-TEXAS BORDER - DAY

           As the late afternoon sun begins to set, Peter and Ethan
           drive Jim's pick-up truck into the Lone Star state, passing
           a sign that reads, "Don't Mess With Texas." 

           INT. TEXAS GROCERY STORE - DAY

           MUSIC CUE:  AC/DC's "You Shook Me All Night Long."

           CLOSE ON:  A six-pack of BULL RUSH drops onto the checkout
           conveyor belt.

           WIDER:  Peter drops a second six-pack onto the belt.  Ethan
           follows behind Peter and dumps an armful of chips, candy,
           etc.  And two TEXAS TRUCKER HATS that read "Texas -- A Whole
           'Nother Country."  Ethan hands Peter his debit card.  Peter
           swipes it through the card reader.

           EXT. TEXAS - DAY/NIGHT

           As the words to the song kick in, we see a MONTAGE of images
           as Peter and Ethan head west in Jim's truck across Texas:

           - Small-town Texas whizzes by: Diners, boot shops, neon signs
           for pawn shops, boarded-up mom and pop businesses, a used
           Cadillac dealer; vast oil fields -- some drained dry and
           some once again being drilled; hand-painted signs for Indian
           reservations; large, flat farms of cattle, cotton and other
           crops; craggy-faced Texans in cowboy hats and lots of denim.

           - Emtpy Bull Rush cans tossed into the rear of the cab.

           - Ethan in the bed of the pickup, wearing the Trucker cap,
           getting high.  Peter closes the sliding window in the back
           of the cab.

           - The truck is pulled off on the side of a road.  Peter leans
           against the side, looking at a text message on Ethan's iPhone. 
           ANGLE: IPHONE.  "From: Christine.  Got ur message.  Out
           shopping w/Louise.  Jim called, said u guys had lots of
           laffs."

           - Ethan comes out of the woods with a magazine in his hand. 
           Frustrated and disappointed, he shakes his head "no."

           - A Texas-sized, orange and purple SUNSET.

           - Peter using the glow of Ethan's iPhone to read a book
           titled, "How To Get Your Child Into An Ivy League College."

           - Peter driving under an amazing, ink-black sky dotted with
           luminous stars while Ethan hangs his ass out the passenger
           window and farts. 
           - The sun starts to rise.  Ethan is driving, Peter is zonked
           out in the passenger seat. 

           INT./EXT. JIM'S TRUCK - NEXT MORNING (THURSDAY MORNING)

           The song ends.  The morning sun wakes Peter up.  He looks
           out the window and sees a sign:  "Arizona Highway 99."

                                 PETER
                        Highway 99?  What happened to the
                        interstate?

                                 ETHAN
                        A trucker told me this way would
                        shave off like three hours. 

                                 PETER
                        Three hours is good.
                            (checks dashboard)
                        We better get some gas.

           INT. GAS STATION/MINI-MART - ARIZONA - DAY

           Ethan is at the counter talking to a NATIVE AMERICAN CLERK. 
           Peter is off in the corner, talking on the iPhone.  Ethan
           slaps his debit card on the counter.

                                 ETHAN
                        Whatever I filled up on the truck
                        out there, this beef jerky, and a
                        copy of...
                            (stares behind counter)
                        ...is that the current issue of
                        "Finally Legal?"

           The Clerk shrugs and tosses it on the counter.

                                 CLERK
                        Anything else?

           The Clerk begins to ring Ethan up.  Peter approaches, taking
           a bite from a Power Bar.

                                 PETER
                            (to Clerk)
                        Add this too.
                            (to Ethan)
                        I talked to Christine.  The whole
                        thing with Jim was much ado about
                        nothing.

                                 ETHAN
                        Really?
                                 PETER
                        Yeah.  Turns out that they weren't
                        even together at that Mexican
                        restaurant.  Jim was there with
                        another girl, and Christine ran
                        into him, and she just posed for
                        the picture with the other girl's
                        straw.  That's all.

                                 ETHAN
                        Right, it happens all the time. 
                        You run into someone, you ask their
                        date if you can put your lips on
                        their straw and then you head off
                        on your merry way.  Happens every
                        day in every bar in America.

           Peter realizes the excuse Christine gave doesn't sound so
           good now that he's said it out loud.

                                 CLERK
                        Denied!

                                 ETHAN
                        What?

                                 CLERK
                        You got 16 dollars left on your
                        debit card and 82 dollars in
                        purchases.  You need another card
                        or cash.  No checks!

                                 ETHAN
                        I don't have another card.  I
                        have...
                            (pulls cash from pocket)
                        Seven dollars and twenty-two cents.

                                 CLERK
                        That leaves fifty-eight dollars
                        and change.  
                            (turns to Peter)
                        How 'bout you, sunshine?  You got
                        any money?

                                 PETER
                        No.  I left my wallet on the--

                                 CLERK
                        Plus one seventy-five for the Power
                        Bar.

           Ethan looks at the Clerk and gives him a helpless shrug.
           EXT. GAS STATION/MINI-MART - ARIZONA - DAY

           Peter and Ethan stand next to Jim's truck.  Peter stares at
           him with an accusatory glower.

                                 ETHAN
                        I thought I had more left on my
                        debit card.  How was I supposed to
                        know that it was tapped out?

                                 PETER
                            (losing it)
                        It's a debit card!  It tells you
                        exactly how much is left!  That's
                        the point!

                                 ETHAN
                        What's the difference between that
                        and a credit card?

           Peter throws his hands up in disgust and lets out a scream. 
           Ethan takes out his bag of weed and starts rolling a joint.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        Alright, maybe we can get some
                        cash by selling something. 
                            (nods at Peter's feet)
                        Like those shoes, what'd you pay
                        for those, five hundy? 

           Ethan lights the joint and takes a deep hit.  He looks at
           Peter, who stares at him and his joint with a seething glare.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        What?  You want a hit?

           Peter gestures to the bag of weed.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        Oh. 

           EXT. ARIZONA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Ethan and a nervous Peter sit in Jim's truck, parked next to
           a sprawling desert high school.  Peter is in the driver's
           seat.  Ethan points to some guys with shaved heads.

                                 ETHAN
                        What about those guys?  They look
                        like they party.

                                 PETER
                        I don't know, they look so young.
                                 (MORE)
                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        You sure they're even in high
                        school?

                                 ETHAN
                        They're at Barry Goldwater High,
                        carrying books and backpacks. 

                                 PETER
                        There's gotta be some place else
                        to sell it.

                                 ETHAN
                        It's eleven o'clock in the morning. 
                        You know of any rock concerts or
                        left-wing political rallies going
                        on right now?

           There's a RAPPING on Peter's window.  It's a beefy SCHOOL
           SECURITY GUARD holding a billy club.  Meet DUNCAN, a 35ish
           former football player who couldn't make it as a cop.  Duncan
           motions for Peter to roll down his window.

                                 PETER
                        Oh shit.

                                 ETHAN
                        Just be cool.  School cop.

           Peter rolls down the window.

                                 DUNCAN
                        You can't park here.

                                 PETER
                        Oh, okay.  I'm just dropping him
                        off for school.

           Duncan takes a closer look at Ethan.

                                 DUNCAN
                        He looks like he's forty.

                                 ETHAN
                            (offended)
                        I'm thirty-two.

                                 DUNCAN
                        License and registration.

                                 ETHAN
                            (softly to Peter)
                        You don't have to show him shit. 
                        He's a friggin' crossing guard.
                                 PETER
                        Actually Officer, I don't have any
                        of that.  I lost my I.D. and...
                        you know what?  We'll just get
                        going.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Turn off your ignition and stay
                        right there. 

           Duncan walks back toward a compact Chevy Cobalt with the
           words "Barry Goldwater High School Security" stencilled on
           it.  He takes a cell phone off the dash and dials it.

                                 DUNCAN (CONT'D)
                        Billy?  Hey, it's Duncan.  Can you
                        run a plate for me?

           BACK ON:  Peter and Ethan, still in the truck.

                                 ETHAN
                        Just take off.  He can't follow
                        us, he doesn't have jurisdiction.

                                 PETER
                        I'm not gonna just take off.  It's
                        suspicious.

                                 ETHAN
                        I'm holding here, man.  I'm telling
                        you, just gun it.

                                 PETER
                        Let me go talk to him.

           Peter climbs out of the truck and approaches Duncan, who's
           still on the cell phone.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Listen, sir, I think there's been
                        a misunderstanding.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Are you Jim Calvin?

                                 PETER
                        Uh... yes.  Yes I am.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Really?  Because you don't look
                        like a six foot two, 225 pound
                        black man.
           Suddenly, Ethan PEELS OFF in the pickup truck.  He hauls ass
           down the street and disappears around a corner.  Peter and
           Duncan watch in disbelief.  Duncan pulls out a can of PEPPER
           SPRAY and aims it at Peter's face.

                                 DUNCAN (CONT'D)
                        Up against the car!  Hands on the
                        hood!

           Peter leans against the hood of the diminutive Cobalt as
           Duncan frisks him.  Then Duncan moves Peter over to a wooden
           bench and sits him down.

                                 DUNCAN (CONT'D)
                        You ain't running off, you can
                        make book on that.

           He puts Peter's hands behind his back and through the slats,
           then cuffs him to the bench with PLASTIC CUFFS.

                                 PETER
                        Ow, Jesus!  Not so tight!

                                 DUNCAN
                        I knew you two were up to something.

                                 PETER
                        You gotta help me out here.  I
                        have a pregnant wife in Los Angeles
                        who is about to give birth--

                                 DUNCAN
                        I'm gonna turn you over to the
                        Coconino County cops.  Maybe now
                        Chief "Suarez" will let me re-take
                        the police exam.

           Duncan moves back to his car.  He sits in the driver's seat,
           leaving the door open.  He starts to dial his cell phone
           when suddenly we hear the ROAR of an engine.

           Seemingly out of nowhere, Jim's truck races down the street
           and BARRELS into the Cobalt's open door, RIPPING IT OFF. 
           Ethan slams the truck into REVERSE, and backs up against the
           side of the Cobalt, blocking Duncan from getting out.  Ethan
           leans his head out the window.

                                 ETHAN
                        Get in!

                                 PETER
                        I can't, I'm cuffed to the bench!
           Duncan struggles to climb over the gear shift to the passenger
           side of the Cobalt.  Ethan hops out of the truck and quickly
           helps lift Peter and the bench up into the truck bed.  Peter's
           oversized jeans fall down in the process.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Go, go!

           Ethan runs back into the truck, hits the gas, and the truck
           PEELS OUT down the street.  Peter is in the back lying on
           his side and cuffed to the bench. 

           Duncan exits the Cobalt out of the door-less driver's side
           and pops the trunk.  He pulls back the carpet liner, and
           takes out a SHOTGUN hidden beneath.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Ethan is driving fast.  Peter's in the open-air truck bed,
           cuffed to the bench, lying on his side.  He tries to right
           himself, but can't do it.

           INT. JIM'S TRUCK - DAY

           Ethan checks the rearview mirror.  He sees Duncan behind
           him, in his door-less Cobalt, gaining ground.  Ethan TURNS
           HARD LEFT at the next intersection.

           IN THE BED of the truck, Peter slides hard into the right
           inside panel of the truck.

                                 PETER
                        Ow!

           Duncan holds the shotgun out the open side and FIRES a shot. 
           It SHATTERS the passenger side of Ethan's rear window.

                                 ETHAN
                        Holy fuck!
                            (turns to Peter)
                        Good thing you weren't sitting
                        there!

           Ethan races ahead north, but at the next street a car heading
           west crosses in front of him.  He SWERVES LEFT AND RIGHT,
           avoiding the car, but BOUNCING Peter like a PINBALL in the
           cab of the truck.

                                 PETER
                            (with each smack)
                        Shit!  Shit!  Shiiiiittt!

           Ethan sees the entrance ramp to the highway.  He cuts it too
           close and BANGS over a curb.
           Peter bounces up HIGH and then crashes back DOWN onto the
           truck bed, the left side of Peter's face being the only
           cushion for the landing.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Ethan races down the highway, SWERVING in and out of other
           vehicles.  Duncan follows behind, doing the same thing.

                                 ETHAN
                            (shouts)
                        Do you see him?

                                 PETER
                            (shouts)
                        Slow down.  You're giving me a
                        concussion.

                                 ETHAN
                        We can have a discussion later. 
                        I'm gonna lose this psycho.

           Duncan's souped-up Cobalt is surprisingly fast.  He eventually
           pulls alongside Ethan and aims his rifle at the front tire.

           Ethan SLAMS on the brakes.  Peter FLIES forward into the
           back of the cab.  Duncan FIRES.  The shot misses.  Duncan
           SLAMS on his brakes, aims the rifle back at Ethan and Peter,
           and... gets REAR-ENDED hard by an 18-wheeler.  Duncan's air
           bags inflate.  He drops the shotgun onto the highway.  Ethan
           runs over it.  

           Now Ethan floors it.  He races down the highway, putting
           space between himself and Duncan.  He passes a road sign
           that reads "Flagstaff 12 miles."  

           Ethan speeds up, then makes a sharp right onto an OFF RAMP,
           driving over the median in the process.  Peter bounces up
           and down like a Mexican Jumping Bean.

                                 PETER
                            (with each bump)
                        Stop.  The.  Truck.

           Ethan gets over the median and guns it up the ramp.

           BACK ON THE HIGHWAY, moments later, Duncan's mangled Cobalt
           sputters PAST the ramp and keeps on going, dragging its back
           bumper along the blacktop.

           EXT. ARIZONA ROAD - A LITTLE LATER

           Ethan has finally pulled the truck to a stop on a dirt road. 
           It's the middle of nowhere.  And it's hot.
           Ethan and Peter stand next to the truck.  A small toolbox is
           open in the bed of the truck.  Ethan uses an Exacto knife to
           finish cutting off Peter's plastic handcuffs.

                                 PETER
                        What the FUCK is the matter with
                        you?!

                                 ETHAN
                        In what respect?

                                 PETER
                        I was bouncing all over the truck! 
                        You could've killed me!

                                 ETHAN
                        Excuse me, I was trying to escape. 
                        It's only 'cause of my evasive
                        maneuvering that you didn't get
                        shot.

                                 PETER
                        I came this close to falling out
                        of that truck at 80 miles an hour.

                                 ETHAN
                        Hey, how about a thank-you?  I
                        came back to save you.

           Peter snorts.  He walks around to the driver's side and hops
           in.  Ethan climbs into the passenger side.

           INT. JIM'S PICK-UP TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Peter turns the key, the engine sputters.  He tries again. 
           It sputters again.

                                 PETER
                        C'mon, c'mon.

           Peter looks at the gas gauge.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Shit.  It's out of gas.

           EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - CONTINUOUS

           Peter slams the door of the truck closed as he steps out
           into the hot desert sun.

                                 PETER
                        Give me your phone, I'm gonna call
                        Triple A.
           Ethan hands it to him.  Peter dials.  He waits for a beat.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Dammit, no signal.  Huh, that's
                        strange, there's no signal in the
                        middle of the fucking desert!

           He KICKS the truck, then kicks the road, then kicks at the
           truck again.  Peter takes a moment to digest everything,
           then looks around and takes in his surroundings.  

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Where are we?

                                 ETHAN
                        Arizona.

                                 PETER
                        Where in Arizona?  I saw a sign
                        that said Flagstaff was twelve
                        miles away.

                                 ETHAN
                        Okay, so we're near Flagstaff.

                                 PETER
                        Flagstaff's way north of where
                        we're supposed to be.  You were
                        trying to go see that fucking totem
                        pole, weren't you?

                                 ETHAN
                        No, I wasn't.

                                 PETER
                        Yes you were.

                                 ETHAN
                        Dude, I wasn't.

                                 PETER
                        Once again, you are incapable of
                        thinking about anyone else but
                        yourself.  You're a child.

                                 ETHAN
                        I wasn't doing it for me.  I was
                        doing it for you.  So you could
                        see your Dad.

                                 PETER
                        My Dad?
                                 ETHAN
                        He's in a retirement home called
                        Garden City.

                                 PETER
                        I know where he is.

                                 ETHAN
                        Don't you see?  It's fate that
                        we're here.  Think about it. 
                        Everything that happened to us,
                        happened for a reason.  Our meeting. 
                        The No Fly List.  Even you catching
                        me with Randi.  It was all so that
                        we could be brought together at
                        this moment for one thing: so you
                        could reconcile with your father
                        before your son is born.

                                 PETER
                        And when did this revelation come
                        to you?  When you were high on pot
                        or just in your normal haze of
                        stupidity?

                                 ETHAN
                        You don't need to insult me.

                                 PETER
                        You don't need to be messing with
                        my life.  There's one thing I need,
                        and that is to get home.  You have
                        screwed me so many ways I've lost
                        count.  The last thing I need to
                        do right now is have anything to
                        do with my father.  You don't know
                        what's right for me.  Hell, you
                        don't know what's right for
                        yourself.  Survivor?  Why would
                        they pick you?

           Peter shakes his head.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Actually, I stand corrected.  They
                        always have one annoying fuckup
                        who ruins it for everybody else.

           Ethan is speechless for a few beats, clearly hurt.  Then:

                                 ETHAN
                        You know, you haven't exactly been
                        the world's coolest traveling buddy.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        You're uptight, arrogant,
                        ungrateful, and you're
                        condescending.  You're right, I'm
                        not the smartest guy in the world. 
                        And maybe I am a fuckup.  I'm thirty-
                        two years old, I don't have a
                        girlfriend, I don't have a wife. 
                        I don't have anybody in my life
                        who depends on me.  But if I did,
                        I sure as hell wouldn't have flown
                        across the country when she was
                        about to have our baby.

           This really stings Peter.

                                 PETER
                        It's time we go our separate ways.

                                 ETHAN
                        Fine with me. 

                                 PETER
                        Okay then.  Have a good life.

           Peter starts walking away.

                                 ETHAN
                        Where are you going?

                                 PETER
                        Wherever you aren't. 

           Peter gives a half-hearted backwards wave as he heads down
           the dirt road back to the highway.  The Arizona sun beats
           down on him.

           EXT. ARIZONA DESERT ROAD - DAY

           A SERIES OF SHOTS OF Peter walking along a two lane Arizona
           road under the searing hot mid-day sun:  A car passes by,
           Peter holds out his thumb to hitchhike, the car keeps on
           driving; Peter wipes sweat from his brow;  Peter opens a
           roadside CALL BOX.  He lifts the receiver and it comes
           completely free of the box -- the cord has been cut;  A weary
           Peter holds his hands above his head to shield the sun.  He
           passes by a road sign that says "Welcome To Garden City." 
           Peter looks at the sign.

                                 PETER
                        Ah, hell.
           EXT. GARDEN CITY RETIREMENT HOME - DAY

           Peter trudges up a long driveway that leads to a series of
           low-rise apartment-style buildings.  Engraved in two boulders
           adorning the driveway are the words:  GARDEN CITY RETIREMENT
           COMMUNITY.

           INT. GARDEN CITY RETIREMENT HOME - DAY

           Peter stands in the hallway, outside a door to one of the
           rooms.  He's sweaty, dusty, and dirty.  He takes a deep breath
           then knocks on the door.

           The door is opened by Peter's father BURT, a 70 year-old
           Alan Arkin-type.

                                 PETER
                        Hey, Dad.

                                 BURT
                        Peter?  Jesus, you look like shit.

           INT. BURT'S ROOM - DAY

           A small and sparsely decorated room.  Burt sits in a chair,
           Peter sits on the matching institutional loveseat.

                                 BURT
                        ...No Fly List?  I never
                        accomplished anything like that. 
                        I was persona non grata at several
                        casinos, but I never had the Feds
                        on my ass.

                                 PETER
                        As I said, it's a long story... do
                        you have a car I can borrow?

                                 BURT
                        Let me ask you something.  Did you
                        get the letters I sent you?

                                 PETER
                        Yeah Dad, I got your letters.

                                 BURT
                        You couldn't write back?  Or call?

                                 PETER
                        I don't want to get into this now. 
                        I've got to get going.
                                 BURT
                        I haven't seen you in twenty years,
                        you can't spend half an hour with
                        your old man?  What's the rush?

           Peter thinks for a beat, then...

                                 PETER
                        I'm going to be a father.

           Burt is taken aback.  He didn't know.  He's hurt.

                                 BURT
                        You're having a kid?

                                 PETER
                        Christine's having a C-section
                        tomorrow.

                                 BURT
                        So it takes some cockamamie bullshit
                        on an airplane for me to hear I'm
                        going to be a grandpa?

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, I guess so.  Look, if you
                        don't have a car, do you have any
                        cash?  Maybe I can buy a bus ticket
                        and--

                                 BURT
                        I can get you a vehicle.

           Burt stands up.  Grabs his wallet off the dresser.

                                 BURT (CONT'D)
                        But I'm confused.  You knew your
                        wife was having the baby tomorrow,
                        right?  So what the hell were you
                        doing flying to Boston?

           Peter stands up.  Tries to contain himself.

                                 PETER
                        What was I doing?  I was working. 
                        I was trying to close the most
                        important deal of my life, one
                        that would have made me partner. 
                        So my son wouldn't have to hold
                        two jobs and go to school at night. 
                        It's called responsibility, but
                        you wouldn't know about that.
                                 (MORE)
                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        After everything you did -- or
                        didn't do -- you're going to judge
                        me?

                                 BURT
                        Whoa, whoa.  Peter.  Okay, I deserve 
                        that.  But I'm not judging you.  I
                        just... I don't know you very well -- 
                        I wish I did.  But I can see that
                        you're trying so hard not to be
                        me, that you're making the same
                        mistake I did.

                                 PETER
                        Same mistake?  I haven't gambled
                        away our savings and walked out on
                        my family.  

                                 BURT
                        Your wife's about to have a baby
                        and you're not there.  The reason's
                        not as bad, but the end result's
                        the same.  

                                 PETER
                        I'll be there.

                                 BURT
                        You should've never left.

                                 PETER
                        You should know.

                                 BURT
                        I do know.  That's my point.  You
                        get to my age, you don't look back
                        and think about accomplishments or
                        awards.  You think about moments
                        and memories.  The ones you had --
                        and the ones you missed out on. 
                        So while you're busy trying to
                        make partner and plan how
                        everything's supposed to work out,
                        let me tell you that you can't. 
                        You can't control everything in
                        life.  Hell, it wouldn't be any
                        fun if you could.  But what you
                        can do is be there, Peter.  Be
                        present.  Don't spend so much time
                        planning that you forget about
                        living. 
           Peter has heard that before.  About 1500 miles back.  He
           sighs heavily and nods.

           EXT. ARIZONA ROAD - DAY

           A wilted Ethan sits on rock near the side of the road.  A
           WHITE VAN with the Garden City Retirement Home logo on the
           side approaches and stops.  Peter gets out.  Ethan is sucking
           on a foot-long rubbery substance.

                                 PETER
                        What are you doing?

                                 ETHAN
                        Trying to get some water out of
                        this piece of cactus.

                                 PETER
                        That's the bottom of an old tennis
                        shoe.

                                 ETHAN
                        It's not real moist.

           Ethan chucks the shoe away.

                                 PETER
                        So... I uh, stopped in Garden City. 
                        He's in the van.

           Ethan nods.

                                 ETHAN
                        My father's been gone for twenty
                        years, and I still miss the hell
                        out of him.  Good, bad, or
                        indifferent I wish he was part of
                        my life.  I just thought, you still
                        have the chance--

                                 PETER
                        I appreciate what you did.  And
                        the things I said to you before,
                        you know... that was the heat
                        talking.

                                 ETHAN
                        Yeah, I didn't mean what I said
                        either.  Well, some of it I did. 
                        Most of it.

           Peter chuckles.
                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        I came so close to dying out here. 
                        Two days without food or water. 
                        No civilization for miles.  Thanks
                        for coming back -- you saved my
                        life.

                                 PETER
                        Ethan, it's been less than three
                        hours.

                                 ETHAN
                        Really?

           INT. GARDEN CITY VAN - DAY

           Peter drives.  Burt's in the passenger seat.  Ethan is in
           the backseat guzzling water and fiddling with his iPhone.

                                 ETHAN
                        There were two "B. Jensens" in the
                        greater Flagstaff area.  The other
                        one was a woman.  Betty and I had
                        a nice conversation.  After her
                        divorce goes through, I think I
                        got a shot. 

                                 BURT
                        You take that shot, Ethan.  One
                        thing you realize at my age is you
                        never pass up pussy.

                                 PETER
                        That's nice, Dad.
                            (to Ethan)
                        What's with the phone?

                                 ETHAN
                        Still no signal.  I think maybe I
                        got sand in it when I used it to
                        dig a tunnel.

           Ethan hits the phone against his palm and tries to shake
           sand out of it.

                                 PETER
                        Where were you digging the tunnel
                        to?

                                 ETHAN
                        I was just trying to get out of
                        there.  I was delirious.  
           They pass a road sign that says "Grand Canyon 5 miles, Palm
           Springs 290 miles, Los Angeles 460 miles."

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        Damn, the Grand Canyon's only five
                        miles away.

                                 BURT
                        I was there last year.  Me and a
                        guy from Garden City took one of
                        those airplane sightseeing tours
                        couple weeks before he died. 
                        "Bucket List" kinda thing.

                                 ETHAN
                        They're letting you take this van
                        all the way to California, Burt? 
                        That's pretty cool.

                                 BURT
                        I told them I was going to the
                        mall.  By the time they figure it
                        out, we'll already be in L.A.

                                 PETER
                        You stole the van?

                                 BURT
                        Technically we stole the van.

                                 ETHAN
                            (re: iPhone)
                        Got it!  I got a signal.

           Suddenly, WE HEAR a rapid series of BEEPS.

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        Uh, dude, you got like ten messages
                        from your wife.

           INT. VOLVO - DAY

           CHRISTINE is talking on her cell phone in the passenger seat
           of 40 year-old LOUISE'S Volvo.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        My water broke.  I'm going into
                        labor.

           INTERCUT WITH: PETER.

                                 PETER
                        What?  But we're not supposed to
                        have the baby until tomorrow.
                                 CHRISTINE
                        Well he's coming today.  Where are
                        you?

                                 PETER
                        Arizona.  Dammit!

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Peter, you've got to get here. 
                        Louise is driving me to the hospital
                        right now.

                                 LOUISE
                        Hey Peter.  Don't worry, she's in
                        good hands.

                                 PETER
                        I'm still a six hour drive from
                        L.A.  Labors can last that long,
                        right?

           Christine grimaces loudly from a contraction.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I don't think this one will.

                                 PETER
                        Don't worry, honey.  I will get
                        there in time.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Hurry.

           Peter hangs up.  Turns to Ethan and Burt.

                                 PETER
                        There's no way I can get there in
                        time.

                                 BURT
                        Let me ask you something.  That No-
                        Fly List only applies to commercial
                        airlines, right?

                                 PETER
                        Yeah.

                                 BURT
                        Then I've got an idea.

           EXT. CANYON AIR ADVENTURES - DAY

           One of those airplane sightseeing tour places.  Peter, Ethan,
           and Burt stand on the tarmac of a small airport, talking
           with a TOUR PILOT (50s).  Several Cessna 402b twin piston
           engine aircraft are parked nearby.

                                 TOUR PILOT
                        ... Los Angeles?  I'm not supposed
                        to fly beyond the Grand Canyon.

                                 PETER
                        Please, this is an emergency. 
                        I'll give you three times what it
                        would cost you.  How's five grand?

                                 TOUR PILOT
                        Well... you have the cash on you?

                                 PETER
                        No.  But I can get it for you in
                        Los Angeles.

                                 TOUR PILOT
                        I don't think so.  Why don't you
                        go to Phoenix airport?  They have
                        flights practically every hour.

                                 ETHAN
                        Uhh... there's not enough time. 
                        C'mon, dude, hook us up.

                                 TOUR PILOT
                        I'm sorry.

                                 BURT
                        Alright, listen.  This man here is
                        my son.  He's a great success and
                        a great person, and all of that is
                        no thanks to me.  I've been a real
                        shit of a father to him for the
                        last twenty years.  Now I can't do
                        anything to change the past, but
                        I've got a chance to maybe be a
                        part of his life in the future. 
                        It would be a helluva first step
                        if I could get him home in time
                        for the birth of his son.  My
                        grandson.  So please, I'm begging
                        you, help us out here.

           A beat.  The Tour Pilot turns to Peter.

                                 TOUR PILOT
                        You good for the money in L.A.?

                                 PETER
                        Yes.  Absolutely.
                                 TOUR PILOT
                        Give me five minutes.

           EXT. TARMAC - DAY

           Peter and Ethan are about to get on the small plane.  Burt
           sees them off.

                                 PETER
                        So... what you said back there--

                                 BURT
                        Least I could do, huh?  Hey, do me
                        a favor.  After the baby's born? 
                        Call me.

                                 PETER
                        I'll call you.

           Burt and Peter shake hands.  Peter holds the handshake for a
           few extra beats.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Or... you could come with me now. 
                        Meet your grandson.

                                 BURT
                        You serious?

           Peter smiles.

           INT. CESSNA PLANE - DAY

           The plane is in the air, just after takeoff.  The Tour Pilot
           is in the cockpit, which is really just the seat ahead of
           Peter, Burt, and Ethan.  Ethan is very NERVOUS.  He holds
           his arms around his waist and rocks back and forth.

                                 ETHAN
                        Damn this is a tiny fucking plane.

                                 BURT
                        Hey Peter, when you get in that
                        delivery room, Christine is going
                        to need your full support.

                                 PETER
                        Of course.

                                 BURT
                        She needs to know that you will
                        love that kid like he's your own.

           Peter turns to Ethan.
                                 PETER
                        Did you... what did you tell him?

                                 ETHAN
                        I just wanted him to be prepared
                        for all the possibilities.  What
                        are the rules for tiny private
                        planes?  I mean, are they inspected
                        or is it like the honor system?

                                 BURT
                            (looking out window)
                        Mmm, mmm, mmm.  Will you look at
                        that?

           BURT'S POV: Flying over the Grand Canyon.  It's beautiful.

                                 BURT (CONT'D)
                            (points)
                        Over there is where I spread Irv's
                        ashes.

                                 PETER
                            (stares out window)
                        It is pretty amazing.  You oughta
                        take a look, Ethan.

                                 ETHAN
                        No thank you.

                                 PETER
                        C'mon.  You can actually see that
                        totem pole you've been crying about. 

                                 ETHAN
                        I can't.  If I look out that window
                        I'm gonna freak out.  Oh God, what
                        if the only way to get to the
                        Survivor island is on something
                        smaller than this?  And what if
                        it's a desert island?  I can't
                        even survive a desert in Arizona. 
                        And what if--

           A streak of LIGHT hits Ethan in the eye.  He instinctively
           tries to brush it away.  But the light hits him again.  He
           looks back to see that Peter is using his watch to angle the
           sun's rays at Ethan.  A Hardwick's Brother. 

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing, man?
                                 PETER
                        You've got to loosen up, stop
                        worrying about the what-ifs.  You
                        made it this far, you're going to
                        do great.

           Ethan smiles.  Then dry-heaves.

           EXT. VAN NUYS AIRPORT - DAY

           The Cessna lands at the small airport in the Valley.  Before
           the plane has come to a full stop, its door opens and Ethan
           jumps down onto the tarmac.  He rolls, comes to a stop, then
           kisses the ground.  A beat.  Then he VOMITS.

           The Cessna comes to a stop.  Peter and Burt hurry off the
           plane.  Peter grabs Ethan off the ground, and the three of
           them head for a waiting taxi.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES FREEWAY - DAY

           The cab speeds down the 101, WEAVING in and out of traffic,
           honking, and driving on the shoulder.

           EXT. ENCINO HOSPITAL - DAY

           The cab screeches to a stop in front of the hospital.  Peter,
           Ethan, and Burt race out.  Burt tosses a few bills back into
           the cab.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

           The three guys running.  Ethan trails a few steps behind
           Peter and Burt.

           SLOW-MOTION:  The trio are on a desperate dash through the
           hallway, fighting their way through a crowd of people and
           equipment.  Suddenly, an ORDERLY pushing a CART comes out of
           nowhere and SLAMS into Ethan.  He goes down hard.

                                 ETHAN
                            (slo-mo; to Peter)
                        Gooooo.  Goooooooo.

           BACK TO REAL SPEED:  Peter and Burt run on ahead.

           INT. HOSPITAL DELIVERY ROOM - DAY

           Peter hears the sounds of a CRYING NEWBORN.

                                 PETER
                            (out of breath)
                        I'm here, I'm here.
           Peter smiles at the Delivery Room Nurse.  She holds up a
           healthy, nine-pound, AFRICAN-AMERICAN BABY.  Peter's smile
           turns into a look of total shock.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Oh my god.

                                 BURT
                        Oh boy.

           The baby's AFRICAN-AMERICAN MOTHER sits up and looks around.

                                 AFRICAN-AMERICAN MOTHER
                        Who the hell are you people?

           INT. DIFFERENT DELIVERY ROOM - DAY

           Peter rushes in with Burt.  Christine is lying down.  Louise,
           DOCTOR SCHWARTZ, and a Nurse stand next to her. 

                                 PETER
                        Did I make it?  Am I too late?

                                 CHRISTINE
                            (rapid breathing)
                        No honey, you're way early.

           Peter takes her hand in his.

                                 PETER
                        Christine, sweetheart, I am so
                        sorry.  I should have never left. 
                        But I'm here.  I made it, I'm here
                        for you.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I knew you would be.  Did you sign
                        your Croatian?

                                 PETER
                        They're going with Thunder Juice.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I'm sorry.

                                 PETER
                        Doesn't matter.  We're buying that
                        house.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Really?  But I thought you said--

                                 PETER
                        Don't worry, we'll figure it out.
           Christine smiles.  Burt gives a not-so-subtle cough.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Oh, and this may not be the optimal
                        place for introductions but...
                        this is your father-in-law, Burt.

                                 BURT
                        Sorry to come empty handed.  I 
                        should have flowers or candy--

                                 CHRISTINE
                            (massive groan)
                        Aaaaaaah!

                                 DR. SCHWARTZ
                        Okay folks, we're having a baby.

           Ethan enters the room, with a big bruise on his face.

                                 ETHAN
                        I'm here!

                                                           FADE TO BLACK:

           INT. DELIVERY ROOM - A LITTLE LATER - DAY

           FADE BACK UP ON:

           Christine holds the healthy baby boy in her arms.  Peter
           stands next to her, his hand resting lovingly on her shoulder,
           his face beaming with pride.  Burt stands nearby with Ethan,
           who is nearly in tears.

                                 ETHAN
                        Dude, he looks just like you.

                                 PETER
                        He does?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Of course he does.  He's beautiful.

                                 BURT
                        I think he kinda looks like me.

                                 ETHAN
                        All babies look like old men.

           Peter kisses Christine on the forehead and approaches Ethan.

                                 PETER
                        Thanks for getting me here.
                                 (MORE)
                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        I mean, thanks for getting me to
                        the hospital, and... thanks for
                        getting me to where I needed to be.

                                 ETHAN
                        Piece of cake.

           Peter puts his arm around Ethan's shoulder.

                                 PETER
                        Listen, I've thought it over and...
                        Hand job.  I'd give Elton the hand
                        job.

                                 ETHAN
                            (nodding in agreement)
                        Dude.

           They bump fists. 

                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        Get over there, I wanna get a
                        picture.

           Ethan pulls out his iPhone and holds it up.  Peter moves
           over to Christine and the baby.  Ethan SNAPS the picture,
           and we FREEZE FRAME on the photo.  

           ROLL END CREDITS...

           on the shelf of his entertainment center.

                                                                FADE OUT:
