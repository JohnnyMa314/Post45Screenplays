           FADE IN:

           A BABY STROLLER

           rolling along the sidewalk, passing gargantuan homes, set 
           like gems within Las Vegas’s famed Rancho Fantasma Estates. 

           CAROLINE BELL pushes the stroller.  26 years old.  
           Sunglasses.  Black hair in a pageboy bob, glistening in the 
           sun like the skin of a bubble.  

           She maneuvers the stroller up a long and winding driveway.

           And we ZOOM IN on the stroller.  Because there is CABLE 
           UNSPOOLING from its underside.  Landing slack along the 
           ground.  1/4-inch Hercuflex Titanium weave.  Almost invisible 
           on the gray asphalt of the driveway.  

           INT. SURVEILLANCE POST - THAT MOMENT

           These men have been packed in here for days.  Inside this 
           metal box.  Hunched over a nest of video monitors.  Pissing 
           in Gatorade bottles.  Breathing air that seems to have been 
           filtered through a dead rat.  

           Caroline Bell glides across their monitors.

           FBI SPECIAL AGENT WARD OATES (42) leans in close, eyes almost 
           bumping the video screen. 

           EXT. HOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Caroline pulls a key ring from her purse.  Among the jumble 
           of keys is a DOUBLE BALL LOCK PICK.  She pops the front door 
           with it in less than a second.  Looks totally natural.

           INT. SURVEILLANCE POST - THAT MOMENT

           Oates watches Caroline push the stroller into the house and 
           shut the door behind her.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           LATER

           On the video monitor: Caroline exits the mammoth house.  
           Walks down the driveway.  The stroller is gone.  Her purse is 
           gone.  Someone mutters:

                                 SOMEONE (O.S.)
                        If that’s her, she’s not carrying 
                        anything.

                                 SOMONE ELSE (O.S.)
                        That’s not her.  Could that be her?
                                 SOMEONE (O.S.)
                        Why would she leave her baby alone?

           All the agents’ eyes fixate on Oates, awaiting his command.  
           Oates thinks for a moment, then:

                                 OATES
                        I’ve dedicated the last two years 
                        of my life tracking down this crew.  
                        In that time my wife has fucked at 
                        least four men, including her new 
                        husband.  Something’s amiss.  I can 
                        feel it.  They’re not getting away 
                        this time.  Gear up.

           EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT

           Caroline strides along, following the barely perceptible 
           cable, which runs along the sidewalk, then veers off, across 
           the wide open street.

           EXT. HOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           SEWER REPAIR TRUCKS are set up across the street, just down 
           the block from the target house.  A WINDOWLESS UTILITY VAN 
           and a PUMP TRUCK.

           Ward Oates and a team of 4 AGENTS exit the van.  Speed across 
           the street, up the driveway, to the door of the target house.

           Oates double blinks-- A CABLE!  Running into the house 
           through the slightly open door.  Oates turns, sees the 
           silvery trail spanning the entire length of the driveway.  
           All the agents see it now.  Oates draws his .45.  Kicks into--

           THE FOYER

           where there is an overturned stroller, American Girl doll 
           hanging limply out of it.

           The keypad for the house’s security system dangles off the 
           wall, suspended by a rainbow of bypass wirework.

           Oates quick draws a hand radio.

           EXT. STREET - NEXT MOMENT

           Caroline is now waaaay down the block and on the other side 
           of the street, about to round the corner.

           A BLACK FBI SEDAN chirps its siren.  Sends a neural JOLT 
           through Caroline.  Stops her in place.

           The car SCREEEEEKS to a halt in front of her.  
           Two AGENTS fly out.  Use the open doors as body shields and 
           as elbow supports for their gun arms.

                                 AGENT #1
                        Freeze!

                                 AGENT #2
                        Don’t!  Fuckin’!  Move!

           Caroline dose precisely as she is told.  Doesn't even react 
           when she sees the FBI sedan is parked directly over the 
           titanium cable.

           INT. HOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Oates leads his team up the spiral stairway, fast, pistols in 
           scan mode, following the strange cable-- down a hall, through 
           a door, and into a--

           MASTER BEDROOM

           where it runs along the maple floor, then straight underneath 
           two closed double doors on the far side of the room.

           EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT

           The agents still have Caroline at gunpoint, are still hiding 
           behind the doors of the black sedan.

                                 AGENT #1
                        Place your hands on top of your 
                        head and approach the vehicle.

           Caroline remains frozen.

                                 AGENT #2
                        Put your hands on your fuckin’ head 
                        and get over here.

           Caroline’s watch alarm BEEPS.  She glances at the cable on 
           the ground.  She takes one big step...backward.  

           The agents look at each other, deeply perplexed.

           INT. HOUSE/MASTER BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Oates approaches the double doors.  Eyes fixed on the cable 
           running underneath them.  He stops.  He extends a hand.  He 
           grips a brass door handle.  He--  

           KA-VOOOOOOOOM!

           is SLAMMED FLAT.  BY A CHARGING RHINO.  EXPLODING THROUGH THE 
           DOUBLE DOORS, SCATTERING THE 4 AGENTS LIKE PAPER DOLLS, 
           GOUGING WALLS, SHATTERING FURNITURE, RAMPAGING OUT OF THE 
           MASTER BEDROOM IN A SHRAPNEL-SHROUDED ROAR.  
           EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT

           The cable beneath the FBI sedan is moving.  Something REELING 
           IT IN, so fast it scorches the concrete.

           The agents look down, noticing it for the first time. 

           Caroline takes another step back.

           EXT. HOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           The Rhino HYPER-BURSTS out of the house, through the front 
           door and onto the driveway.  But now, out in the bright 
           sunlight, it clearly is not a Rhinoceros. 

           IT’S A SAFE.

           An ANTI-LANCE TXTL-60.  Expertly tethered to the rip-roaring 
           titanium tow cable.  Some mysterious force on the other end, 
           pulling it with the power of a runaway freight train.

           The safe whips into the street, gouging asphalt, clipping the 
           front bumper of a moving Mercedes, uprooting a fire hydrant, 
           flipping a manhole cover into the air like a tossed coin.

           THE TWO FBI AGENTS

           holding Caroline at gunpoint see the safe, tow cable 
           slingshotting it around a phone pole, flinging it TOWARD THEM 
           AND THEIR CAR, like some jet-propelled, kamikaze-piloted 
           wrecking ball.

           No time to think.  Only to dive.  As everything blends into 
           SUPER SLOW MOTION, the kind National Geographic uses to film 
           Great White Sharks leaping out of the ocean to chomp meat off 
           a hook.

           The impact is silent.  The impact LAUNCHES the FBI sedan.  
           Spinning.  Rippling.  Coming apart like hot taffy. 

           The SUPER SLOW MOTIONS ENDS.  The car CRASHES back to Earth.  
           And the safe whips around a light post, around the corner.  
           Caroline running close behind.  Both are gone.

           EXT. ANOTHER STREET - THAT MOMENT

           A MACK TITAN TRUCK.  HURTLING down a sleepy street.  Flanked 
           by Spanish mansions and a golf course.  There is a man behind 
           the wheel of the truck, up-shifting and squinting into the 
           desert sun.  CHARLIE DECKER.  Maybe 27 years old.

           We move around the truck, to the rear of the trailer it’s 
           towing.  The trailer’s hatch is open.
           Bolted to its floor is a HYDRAULIC WINCH, normally used for 
           deep sea salvage.  It is SLURPING UP the TITANIUM CABLE as if 
           it were a spaghetti noodle.

           JOHNNY UNDERHILL (27) operates the winch.  The safe comes 
           smashing and clanging up the street, toward the open trailer 
           hatch.  It skips, jumps, sliiiiides, grinding up the ramp.  
           SLAMS into the massive winch arm.  The motor GRINDS.  POPPING 
           and SQUEALING.  Underhill hits buttons, frantically trying to 
           shut the thing down.

           In the driver’s cab, Charlie hears all the noise, vibrating 
           through his seat.  He calmly radios back to Underhill:

                                 CHARLIE
                        Blue button on the left.

           Underhill hops to the left side of the winch.  Hits the blue 
           button.  Silence.  Machine’s off.  He radios up to Charlie.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Thanks.

           EXT. HOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Ward Oates wobble-walks out of the house, onto the driveway.  
           He’s panting, showered white with plaster debris.  His team 
           waddles out after him.

           Oates eyeball sweeps the street, following the trail of 
           gouged Earth, past flattened shrubs, past the hydrant geyser, 
           past the scattered chunks of FBI sedan, all the way to the 
           end of the block where the wake of devastation turns the 
           corner and he can’t see anymore of it. 

           A baby CRIES.  At the end of the driveway.  In a stroller.  
           Young mother standing behind it, dressed identically to 
           Caroline-- sunglasses, black hair in a pageboy bob.  Her face 
           is a monument of shock.

           INT. MACK TRUCK - THAT MOMENT

           Charlie Decker slows the truck.  Unlocks the doors.  

           Caroline Bell yanks open the cab’s passenger door.  Swings 
           inside.  Removes her sunglasses and black wig, revealing a 
           wavy, slicked-back dome of sunflower blonde hair.  

           He gives her a look: Are you okay?  Her look back: Just 
           fucking drive.  And so he does.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
           INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE (LAS VEGAS) - DAY 

           Charlie Decker enters through the front door, stands on the 
           cool granite tile of his foyer.  He’s holding a pizza box and 
           a six pack of ice-cold MGD beer bottles.  

           Caroline Bell walks out from the TV room.  Bare feet and self-
           cut jean shorts.

                                 CAROLINE
                            (borderline monotone)
                        You got pizza.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sausage, onions, and jalapeños.

                                 CAROLINE
                        ...hmm...

                                 CHARLIE
                        The Caroline Special.

                                 CAROLINE

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay...what the fuck?

                                 CAROLINE
                        I got in.

           Charlie now sees she is holding a college acceptance packet, 
           from UCLA.  Charlie places the pizza and beer on a side table 
           usually reserved for mail.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You said you weren’t even going to 
                        apply.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I’m old, Charlie.  Soon I’ll be too 
                        old.

                                 CHARLIE
                        So go to UNLV.

           She shakes her head.  She’s heard this before.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I can’t do this anymore.  Not after 
                        last time.  Can’t you just please 
                        come with me? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        To Los Angeles?  What about Johnny? 
                                 CAROLINE
                        He’s a grown man.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I can’t just leave him.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Why not? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Uh...He saved my life once.  That’s 
                        one thing.

                                 CAROLINE
                            (rolls eyes)
                        You were six years old.  You fell 
                        out of a tree house. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        And he caught me.

                                 CAROLINE
                        You landed on top of him.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What would I even do in L.A.?  

                                 CAROLINE
                        Anything.  Go to school with me.  
                        You already have all the money 
                        you’ll ever need.
                            (then)
                        All the things we’ve done...  We’re 
                        lucky now.  None of them have gone 
                        so bad that we can’t turn back.  We 
                        don’t stop soon, we’ll be stuck in 
                        this life forever. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        No we won’t.

                                 CAROLINE
                        How long, then?  Five more years?  
                        Ten?  Because if you’re serious 
                        about me, getting married and 
                        everything...you have to decide.  
                        Because I can’t take it.

           Charlie just stares at her.  

                                 CAROLINE
                        Don’t just stare at me like a 
                        fuckin’ turd. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        Whoa, take it easy...  I don’t know 
                        right now.  I don’t have an answer, 
                        okay?  I need a little time to 
                        think it over and--  

                                 CAROLINE
                        --How about a ballpark guess, then?  
                        I’ll settle for that.  
                        Approximately how many more years 
                        are we gonna waste, here, stupidly 
                        risking our lives?

           Silence.  Charlie tries to think of a good reply.  Shrugs.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Shrug?  That’s your answer?  Shrug?  
                        Fuckin’ pathetic.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Jesus Christ, you want an answer?!!

                                 CAROLINE
                        No.  I want a snow cone.

           Charlie kicks their big TV off the stand as hard as he can.  
           Spiderwebs the LCD screen.  Casually says,

                                 CHARLIE
                        There...that’s my answer.

           She turns, hurries through the house, picking up her keys, 
           cell phone, and purse along the way.  Charlie follows. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        So you’re just leaving?  This is 
                        it?  Right now?  This is madness.

           She opens the front door.  About to step out.

                                 CHARLIE
                            (contrite)
                        Hold on.  Hold on. 

           He grabs her shoulder.  She stops.  Turns.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Caroline, you just can’t move to 
                        L.A. and start things brand new.  
                        The world doesn’t work that way.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Fuck do you know about the world?  
                        I’ve done it before...when I was 
                        eighteen years old.  Second time 
                        should be a breeze.
                                 (MORE)
                                 CAROLINE (cont'd)
                            (then)
                        Remember when we met and I told you 
                        my name was Caroline?  I lied.

           The door slams shut behind her.

           EXT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           A glossy new BMW 750i pulls into the driveway of Charlie’s 
           stucco mini-mansion.  Johnny Underhill steps out.    

           INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Underhill enters the living room.  Charlie lies prone on the 
           couch.  Same clothes he was wearing in his last scene, which 
           took place a week ago.  There’s a 16 ounce bottle of water 
           and a semi-nibbled Fig Newton on the coffee table.  This is 
           everything he intends to eat today.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        You okay?  I’ve been calling. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh...I snapped my phone into a lot 
                        of pieces.

           Charlie gestures to a mutilated cell phone on the floor. 

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Why don’t you just talk to her?

                                 CHARLIE
                        What’s there to say, this point...?

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Come on, just...  First thing...  
                        Get up.  Shower.  We’ll go to 
                        Denny’s for some Mihammy.  On me.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’d rather eat shit out of the 
                        toilet.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I know...I know...but the only 
                        reason she’s doing it is to get 
                        your attention.  To piss you off.  
                        It’s so obvious...a move of 
                        desperation.  Why else would she 
                        pick a dump like The Sonic Bang? 

           Charlie sits up.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What?  Sonic Bang...?
                                 UNDERHILL
                        Oh...I assumed you already...

                                 CHARLIE
                        I haven’t talked to anyone in a 
                        week.  What’s going on?

           Charlie gets the gist from Underhill’s look.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re telling me she’s stripping?  
                        She’s a stripper?  She’s a stripper 
                        who’s stripping at The Sonic Bang? 

           Underhill shrugs in the affirmative.  Charlie chuckles.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s impossible.  She and I...we 
                        make fun of people like that.   

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I mean I haven’t seen it.  But 
                        there have been several reports of--

                                 CHARLIE
                        --Fully nude?  In front of all 
                        those glazed degenerates?  Touching 
                        that pole with her...  It can’t be.  
                        The universe would sooner collapse.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Word is that she’s doing it for 
                        money...money for school.  Does she 
                        want to go to school or something?

           Silence.  Charlie’s guts nosedive.  He launches off the 
           couch.  Grabs his keys.  Blurs out the door.

           INT. SONIC BANG STRIP CLUB - DAY 

           Charlie barges through the club’s double doors.  Brushes past 
           TWO HULKING BOUNCERS, as if they were holograms.

           The Bouncers trade what-the-fuck glances.

           Charlie dashes, eyes searching, through waves of chemical 
           smoke and lap grinding and Depeche Mode, all the way to--

           THE DRESSING ROOM

           Strippers buzz about.  Spray tans and body glitter.  Caroline 
           Bell sits on a folding chair amid this Milky Way of twinkling 
           tits.  She’s wearing jeans and a T-shirt.  She’s reading a 
           Sue Grafton novel.  She looks up and half-smiles at Charlie.
                                 CAROLINE
                        Scared you, didn’t I?

           Charlie is silent.  She dog ears her book and shuts it.

                                 CAROLINE
                        You know it took you long enough.  
                        I’ve been paying them to let me sit 
                        back here for four days now.  Once 
                        in a while I run out on stage in my 
                        swimsuit and do some pretty sweet 
                        karate moves.  But mainly I read.  
                        This is the fifth book I’ve-- 

           --Charlie yanks her to her feet.  Engulfs her in his arms and 
           kisses her.  VWOOOM-- all sound drops off the soundtrack.

           When they break apart Charlie has tears in his eyes.  
           Caroline wipes one away with her thumb.  Kisses the rest.  
           Every stripper watches this, utterly captivated.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I’m so sorry...

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s okay...I’m a fuckin’ idiot...

                                 CAROLINE
                        No...what is this I’m even doing?

           They kiss more.  Between kisses:

                                 CHARLIE
                        What’s...what’s...your real name?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Oh...that?  It’s--

           --Charlie hits the floor hard.  Kicks to the legs.  Kicks to 
           the ribs.  Two Bouncers above him.  One raises his boot, 
           about to skull stomp when--

           A folding chair PANCAKE-SLAMS HIS FACE.  Caroline swings it 
           again, edge first.  Bouncer teeth crack and fly.  The second 
           bouncer spins.  The second bouncer eats chair and crumples 
           cold.

           Charlie de-blurs his vision.  Looks up at Caroline and says:

                                 CHARLIE
                        Whatever your name is, will you 
                        marry me?
           EXT. HI-HO! WEDDING CHAPEL - NIGHT 

           Charlie and Caroline bound down the chapel steps arm-in-arm, 
           so fast the cheap little veil blows off her head.  They stop 
           and kiss.  Still laughing.  Complimentary bouquet crushed 
           between them.

           EXT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - DAY 

           There’s a for sale sign in the lawn.  There’s a U-Haul 
           hitched to Charlie’s Acura MDX.  Caroline in the passenger 
           seat.  Charlie and Johnny Underhill on the front stoop of the 
           house.  Charlie locks the door for the last time in his life.    

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sure I can’t change your mind?

                                 UNDERHILL
                        What would I do in L.A.?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hang out with me and watch TV.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        You know I’d like that, but...I got 
                        Sheila, plus my bar...  I’m happy 
                        here.
                            (then)
                        Don’t worry about me.  I can easily 
                        find another thief with great 
                        leadership skills to take your 
                        place.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Great leadership skills?  That’s 
                        how you think of me?

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Maybe, I dunno...  Why?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Just funny to hear, I guess.
                            (then)
                        Anyway...

           Charlie hands Underhill the house keys.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Thanks for helping me with this, 
                        and for, you know...

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Have a safe...good trip.

           Underhill extends a hand.  Charlie looks at it for a second, 
           then hugs him for a long time.
           INT. ACURA (MOVING) - DAY 

           Charlie drives.  Caroline pulls a CD from her bag.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I made a sweet CD for our drive.

           She pops it in.  A song from the movie National Lampoon’s 
           Vacation comes on at top volume.  It’s called Holiday Road, 
           and it plays over the entirety of our--

           L.A. FUN-TIME MONTAGE

           INT. NEW HOUSE - DAY 

           A REALTOR shows Charlie and Caroline around a little Spanish-
           style house, high up in the Hollywood Hills, shrouded in 
           eucalyptus trees.  Caroline whispers to Charlie.  

                                 CAROLINE
                        This place is totally haunted.
                            (then)
                        Let’s take it.

           INT. UCLA FRESHMAN ORIENTATION - DAY 

           Charlie and Caroline sit in a lecture hall amid hundreds of 
           rubber-faced 18-year-olds.

           INT. BEVERLY CENTER/PET STORE - DAY 

           Charlie and Caroline look at dogs.  She spies a small and sad 
           yellow lab.  Asks to hold it.  Gets the warm little thing in 
           her arms and her soul shatters and reforms in the shape of a 
           puppy.

           INT. HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           Charlie installs a 52-inch LCD TV on the wall.  Caroline 
           chases COMET the yellow pup past a bunch of new furniture. 

           INT. SPACE MOUNTAIN - DAY 

           Charlie and Caroline explode through hyperspace in the front 
           car of Disneyland’s premier roller coaster. 

           TIME PASSES, THREE YEARS WORTH, BLURRING BY ON THE SCREEN:

           Birthdays...Christmas...Vacation in Hawaii...Drinking 
           milkshakes...Learning to surf...Celebrating good grades on 
           report cards...Playing in the park with a full-grown 
           Comet...Snuggling under a blanket while watching an Italian 
           zombie movie on the couch....

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
                                      3 YEARS LATER

           INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           Caroline and Comet nap soundly on the couch.  Charlie sits 
           beside them, absorbed in a book entitled Hitler: Nemesis.

           The doorbell rings.  Charlie rises silently to answer it.  

           When he opens the door he sees Johnny Underhill for the first 
           time in three years, looking sunken and impossibly tired.  He 
           sees a mildly obese man named GILBERT BLATCH.  28 years old.  
           Wearing a black, sweat-matted tank top.  Tattoo on his flesh 
           glob of a shoulder, one word: POONTANG.  And in the driveway, 
           behind Underhill and his strange companion, Charlie sees an 
           obscure DUTCH SUPER CAR called a SPYKER C8.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY 

           Charlie, Underhill, and Blatch sit around the kitchen table.  
           Blatch’s knee fidget-bounces without end.  They whisper, 
           careful not to wake the napping Caroline.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Where’s it from?

                                 BLATCH
                        Valet at The Mandalay Bay... Dope 
                        rides roll in, he calls me.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Dope rides?

                                 BLATCH
                        Bomb-ass whips.

           Charlie turns to Underhill, tries to zone out Blatch.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why did you steal a car if you 
                        can’t move it yourselves? 

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I thought I could.  It had been a 
                        while but...

                                 CHARLIE
                        You know all the same people I 
                        know.  You’re a smart guy.  Just 
                        call one of them.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I did.  Those people...  They don’t 
                        think I’m so smart anymore.  
                                 CHARLIE
                        Isn’t there anyone else you can...?

                                 UNDERHILL
                            (shakes head)
                        The Super Bowl flattened me.  And 
                        the last three years...I know we 
                        haven’t really talked...

           Blatch snort-hawks a phlegm wad into his mouth.  Swallows it.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        ...I need help on this one, 
                        Charlie.  I need the money.  I 
                        just...I need it for so many 
                        things.  If you would make some 
                        calls, vouch for me...

                                 CHARLIE
                        I can’t have trouble in my life 
                        like that.  I can’t.  I can not.

                                 BLATCH
                        Don’t tell me you don’t miss it, 
                        though.

                                 CHARLIE
                        ...?

                                 BLATCH
                        The rush, brotha.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I like sitting on the couch with my 
                        wife and watching 90210 on SoapNet.

                                 BLATCH
                        Jesus Christ, we drove all night to 
                        listen to this bullshit?  90210...?
                            (right to Charlie)
                        Long as we’re here, what other 
                        shows about gay blowjobs do you 
                        like to watch?

           Charlie raises an eyebrow, looks at Underhill.

                                 BLATCH
                        Come on, Johnny.  Let’s roll the 
                        fuck out.  We don’t need this.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Just hold on a--

                                 BLATCH
                        I thought you said you trusted my 
                        leadership skills.  Let’s bounce.
                                 UNDERHILL
                        Just...shut up a second.

                                 BLATCH
                        Whatever.
                            (stands)
                        I saw a porta-potty down the 
                        street.  I’m gonna go take a shit 
                        in it.

           Blatch leaves.  When he’s good and gone.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What the fuck are you doing with 
                        that...guy? 

           Underhill shakes his head, looks away, embarrassed.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I dunno...I dunno...I dunno.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Listen, Johnny, if you really need 
                        my help...

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Just a phone call or two.

                                 CHARLIE
                        If Caroline finds out about this...  
                        You’re paying for my divorce 
                        attorney, and then you’re willfully 
                        committing suicide.
                            (then)
                        I am serious.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Thank you.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Now get out of here before she 
                        wakes up.  I don’t even want her to 
                        know you’re in the city.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK, we hear a MAN’S VOICE WHISPER...

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        Close your eyes, my darling.
           INT. VEGAS HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           There is a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.  Totally naked.  Cuffed to a bed.  
           SOMEONE is squirting Hershey’s chocolate syrup all over her 
           body, swirling patterns, between her legs, up her stomach, 
           around her breasts.  This someone is a man named LEE 
           FARALLON, age 64, stone grey suit, shark tooth bolo tie, lots 
           of scars on his hands.  

           Farallon draws a line of syrup from the bound woman’s body, 
           across floor, all the way to a SNARLING ROTTWEILER, tethered 
           to a closet doorknob.    

           The Rottweiler licks chocolate.  Lunges for more.  The leash 
           snaps taut. 

           KEN VERITEK (33) watches this from the corner.  Veritek is 
           6’4”, 261 lbs.  Neck gorilla thick.  Ears cauliflowered like 
           chewed Hubba Bubba.  The dog snarls and he cringes.

           Farallon RIPS duct tape off the woman’s mouth.

                                 FARALLON
                        Now you’re going to tell me what I 
                        want to know, or I cut Dynamo’s 
                        leash.  He’ll eat you alive.

           The woman is near mental implosion.  She cries.  Farallon 
           slaps her until she sputters,

                                 WOMAN
                        ...okay, okay...stop!  I’ll tell 
                        you...please don’t...I’ll tell you 
                        anything...

           Farallon’s cell rings.  He answers.  He listens.  He hangs 
           up.  Draws his silenced Titanium pistol.  PUMPS A ROUND 
           through the woman’s face.  Veritek blanches. 

                                 VERITEK
                        Holy-shit-what-the-fuck?

                                 FARALLON
                        We have a new assignment.

                                 VERITEK
                        ...?

                                 FARALLON
                        We are going to find a stolen car.

           Farallon CUTS Dynamo’s leash.  The dog POUNCES on the candy-
           coated corpse.  We don’t see much.  But we do hear CHEWING.  
           INT. CHARLIE’S ACURA - DAY

           Charlie in his car.  Parked outside Vons.  On his cell.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I am retired.  It’s for Underhill.

           INTERCUT - VINCENT BARNES

           On his cell.  In his CHOP SHOP.  Walking past men dicing cars 
           with oxy-acetylene torches.  Sparks spew in thick washes.

                                 BARNES
                        Well...if you can personally 
                        guarantee it, we have a deal.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Isn’t that what I just did?

                                 BARNES
                        Since you ditched him, Underhill’s 
                        reputation has been lower than 
                        crocodile piss.  I want you to 
                        bring the car to me.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fuck that.

                                 BARNES
                        Forget it then.

                                 CHARLIE

                                 BARNES
                        Whatever you say.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Goddamn it.  Alright, fine...fuck.

                                 BARNES
                        Where’d a guy like Underhill get a 
                        quarter million dollar car anyway?

           EXT. CHEVRON (LAS VEGAS) - DAY 

           A Chevron gas station.  Webbed with yellow tape.  Alive with 
           police, trying to compute the aftermath.  Blood.  Everywhere.  
           Splattered across a fuel pump.  Pooled on the cement.  
           Blooming across a chalk body outline.  Streaking out of the 
           lot, in the form of fishtailing tire tracks.  

           Farallon and Veritek stand just beyond the perimeter of 
           police tape.  Veritek aghast.  Farallon expressionless.  
                                 VERITEK
                        Christ almighty.... 
                            (gathers himself)
                        Okay...let’s go over what Francis 
                        told us.  Our guys stop here.  One 
                        goes in the mini mart for a Coke.  
                        Driver starts filling the tank.  
                        Guy comes out with his Coke, sees 
                        two men.  Ski masks.  One fat, one 
                        skinny.  Fat man’s got a gun. 
                        Driver’s head is already blown off.  
                        Skinny guy looks confused, in a 
                        daze.  Fat guy goes berserk, 
                        unloading...
                            (points to bullet holes in 
                             mini mart facade)
                        Blam, blam, blam.  Our guy drops 
                        back for cover.  Comes out.  Car’s 
                        gone.  Right...?

           Farallon does not respond in any way.  He eye scans-- the gas 
           station lot, the street, zeros in on a car, a Honda Civic, a 
           block away, parked in a loading zone, two tickets under the 
           wiper.  He walks to it.  Veritek figures he might as well 
           follow.

                                 VERITEK
                        What do you think?  Fatty and 
                        skinny just left their car here, 
                        walked to the station?  They 
                        couldn’t be that stupid.

           Farallon reads the parking tickets.  Tries the doors.  All 
           locked.  Looks around.  All clear.  Puts a silenced shot 
           through the driver’s window.  Opens the door.  A rat’s nest 
           of used Kleenex and fast food containers.  There’s a 
           McDonald’s bag in the footwell.  Farallon grabs it.  Receipt 
           inside.  Credit card charge to John J. Underhill, dated 26 
           minutes before the carjacking. 

                                 FARALLON
                        Johnny Underhill.

                                 VERITEK
                        You know him?

                                 FARALLON
                        I know the thief who has employed 
                        him for the last decade.

           Charlie, still sitting in his parked car in the Von’s lot, 
           dialing his cell, mumbling obscenities.
           INT. HIGHLAND GARDENS HOTEL SUITE - DAY

           Blatch lies on the hotel bed, reading an L.A. Weekly.   
           Underhill fidgets with his phone.  It RINGS.  He answers.

           INTERCUT - Charlie

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s all set.  Tomorrow at noon.  
                        Be at my house with the car at ten.  
                        Caroline has class.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I owe you, so much.
                            (to Blatch)
                        It’s on.  Noon tomorrow.

           Blatch is oblivious.  He frantically motions to Underhill.

                                 BLATCH
                        Come here!  Come here!

           Underhill crosses the room.  Blatch points to an article he 
           has been reading, about a Korean Sushi bar that serves live 
           octopus.  He finger-stabs a pic of a an octopus in a chef’s 
           hand.

                                 BLATCH
                        I’m gonna fuckin’ eat this octopus.
                            (then)
                        Want me to make a reservation for 
                        two at this place?

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Uhhh...I really don’t think we 
                        should be going anywhere tonight.

           Blatch is already dialing the restaurant.

                                 BLATCH
                        Relax, brotha.  I’ve gotten us this 
                        far, haven’t I?

           EXT. FBI HRT (HOSTAGE RESCUE TEAM) TRAINING AREA - DAY 

           Fabricated city streets and building facades.  Like a studio 
           backlot.  Special Agent Ward Oates stands before a large TOUR 
           GROUP of 8th GRADERS, who are here visiting FBI Headquarters 
           during their big, year-end Washington trip.  The kids 
           couldn’t be more bored, texting on their phones, staring 
           blankly into space, thinking of nothing but going back to the 
           Courtyard Marriott, where they’ll pound the vodka they 
           smuggled in shampoo bottles, then dry hump till dawn.  Oates 
           tries to invigorate them with his presentation, to no avail. 
                                 OATES
                        Forget everything you’ve ever seen 
                        on TV.  When some perp takes a 
                        cover position behind a car, to an 
                        HRT operator, he might as well be a 
                        barn in an open field.

           Oates points across the street to a parked, bullet-riddled 
           Camry, behind which is a crouching mannequin, seemingly 
           unexposed to any forward line of fire.

                                 OATES
                        Bullets cannot penetrate the car’s 
                        body.  But in two shots, I will 
                        take the dummy’s head off.  
                        Observe.  

           Oates draws his .45 Kimber.  Aims.  Before he can fire, a 
           young agent named AMANDA WHURLITZER runs up.

           Oates lowers his gun.  Turns to her.

                                 WHURLITZER
                            (out of breath)
                        Mister Oates...one of our CIs...in 
                        Los Angeles...  The crew he works 
                        for...his boss just set up an 
                        impromptu deal, tomorrow at noon, 
                        with Charlie Decker.  
                            (then)
                        They’re giving you another shot at 
                        the collar.

           Oates feels his molecules snap into alignment.

                                 OATES
                        Thank you, Agent Whurlitzer.
                            (to tour group)
                        So long, kids. 

           Oates turns to leave.  A NERDISH 8th GRADER whines, points to 
           the car.

                                 NERD
                        What about the dummy?

           Oates turns back, drawing his gun.  TWO SHOTS.  A second 
           apart.  The first skips off the pavement beneath the car, 
           SHATTERS the dummy’s ankle, causing it to topple.  When the 
           dummy’s head hits the ground, the second skipping bullet 
           leaps to greet it, SPLINTER-BURSTING it to sawdust.

           INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE/BEDROOM - MORNING

           Charlie lies wide awake in bed, next to a slumbering 
           Caroline.  His eyes are red webs.  He has not slept at all.   
           Birds tweet.  Sun shines.  The alarm clock BLARES.  Fuuuuuck. 

           EXT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - DAY 

           A Time Warner van is parked across from Charlie’s house.

           INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

           A three-man FBI SURVEILLANCE TEAM scans video monitors and 
           parabolic mic frequencies.  They watch as Caroline exits the 
           front door, hugs Charlie, walks to her 1971 Plymouth 
           Barracuda and drives away.

           An FBI agent clicks a hand radio and says...

                                 FBI #1
                        Princess Peach is leaving the 
                        castle.

           INTERCUT - Ward Oates

           standing alone in the center of what looks like an honest-to-
           God, wild-west corral.

                                 OATES
                        Copy that.  Stay on the Plumber.

           Oates talks to a young LAPD SWAT CAPTAIN standing beside him.

                                 OATES
                        Soon as Decker and his crew appear 
                        with the car, I want your men ready 
                        for war.

                                 SWAT CAPTAIN
                        You got it.

                                 OATES
                        I once spent two years of my life 
                        chasing this kid.  For my efforts I 
                        was awarded a dead marriage and a 
                        castrated career.  Today there can 
                        be nothing left to chance.  After 
                        the deal goes down, if God tries to 
                        levitate Decker off this Earth, I 
                        want your sharpshooters to blow the 
                        supreme being’s head off.    

           EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - THAT MOMENT 

           The Range Rover is a speck, racing across a panorama of rust. 

           INT. RANGER ROVER - THAT MOMENT

           Farallon drives.  Puffing a self-rolled cigarette.  Veritek 
           sits shotgun, head slumped against the window, almost asleep.   
                                 FARALLON
                        I must warn you: when I get there, 
                        I will have to do more things, 
                        things for my job, that you should 
                        not see.  As usual, close your eyes 
                        when I say so.  Okay, my darling?

           Veritek rouses.

                                 VERITEK
                        What?

                                 FARALLON
                        What?

                                 VERITEK
                        You say something?

                                 FARALLON
                        I was talking to my wife.

                                 VERITEK
                        You’re married?

                                 FARALLON
                        No I’m not.

           They pass a big green road sign:  Los Angeles - 100 miles.

           EXT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           A yellow cab pulls up.  Underhill exits.  Rings Charlie’s 
           doorbell.

           INT. FBI VAN - THAT MOMENT

           The FBI surveillance team SNAPS A PICTURE of Underhill, 
           moments before he enters Charlie’s house. 

           INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - DAY 

           Charlie and Underhill stand in the foyer.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Stop 
                        talking.  
                            (then)
                        The fuck you mean you don’t know 
                        where he is?

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I mean...I dunno...  Last night he 
                        took the car to go get food, said 
                        he’d be back...I woke up and he 
                        hadn’t come back...
                                 CHARLIE
                        You try calling him?

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I left like fifty million messages.

                                 CHARLIE
                        We’re supposed to be there in...
                            (checks watch)
                        ...less than an hour and a half. 
                        These are serious people.  I gave 
                        them my word.  I show up with no 
                        car...  
                            (pause)
                        That is not good.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I know...I know...

                                 CHARLIE
                        Do you know?  I didn’t sleep at all 
                        last night...my contacts feel like 
                        razor wires in my eyes...and now...  
                        You’re killing me, Johnny.  You are 
                        fucking killing me with the way 
                        this is.  Why did you ever team up 
                        with that load in the first place?

                                 UNDERHILL
                        He drove for a Security Contractor 
                        in Iraq.  Said he’d make a good 
                        getaway driver.

                                 CHARLIE
                            (shakes head in dismay)
                        What are you planning with that 
                        imbecile that you need a getaway 
                        driver?

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I...  I don’t want to talk about 
                        it.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           MUCH LATER

           Charlie and Underhill sit stone still at the kitchen table.  
           Eyes Krazy glued to Underhill’s cell.  Waiting for a Gilbert 
           Blatch call.  The refrigerator hums.  Ten more seconds.  
           Something CLICKS behind Charlie’s face.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fuck all this.  I’m calling it off.

           Charlie stands, whips out his phone.
                                 UNDERHILL
                        But--

                                 CHARLIE
                        --Shut up.  I’ve already decided.
                            (then)
                        I should be lobotomized for 
                        agreeing to this in the first 
                        place.

           Charlie finds Vincent Barnes’ number in his call log.  He’s 
           about to hit dial when Underhill’s cell rings.

           Charlie thinks.  Exhales.  Nods once.  Flips his phone shut.  
           Underhill answers.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Hey, where the fuck you been?

           Underhill listens for a few seconds.  Hangs up.  Says 
           nothing.  This short silence nearly kills Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well...?  

                                 UNDERHILL
                        He said he’s going to meet us there 
                        with the car.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Wonderful.

           EXT. LEMON TREE CORRAL - DAY 

           Heat ripples across the ground in silver slashes.  Sagebrush 
           lines the dirt road leading up to the corral proper.  
           The weather-ravaged wooden sign reads: 
           Lemon Tree Corral - Est. 1887 - Burbank, California.   

           Charlie’s Acura truck turns off the paved road and onto the 
           little dirt one, winding higher into the hills above Burbank.

           CORRAL PROPER

           Vincent Barnes is already there.  He exits a blacked-out GMC 
           Denali in a air conditioned vwoosh.  Four HENCHMEN follow.

           The Acura comes to a halt just inside the fenced perimeter.  
           Charlie and Underhill exit.  Maybe 30 feet from Barnes.

                                 BARNES
                        Where’s the car?

                                 CHARLIE
                        On its way.
           They wait.  The wind blows.  An actual tumbleweed tumbles by.

                                 BARNES
                        What’s the ETA?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Soon.

           Barnes shakes his head.  Annoyed.

                                 BARNES
                        How soon?

           Before Charlie can give another non-answer, two cars crest 
           the hilltop and rumble into the corral: a purple Dub City 
           Escalade, followed by the Spyker C8, which now has an impact-
           shattered headlight, a partially crumpled front end, and a 
           spare donut tire as its front right wheel.

           These cars stop beside Charlie’s Acura.  Blatch’s body 
           extrudes out of the Spyker.  Face a red and greasy mash due 
           to some untold, all-night, hell-fueled escapade.  The sub-
           machinegun looks like a toy in his thick grip.    

           Every door on the Escalade flies open at once.  FIVE LARGE 
           BLACK MEN exit, all sub-machinegun armed.  They are what some 
           circles refer to as JACKBOYS.

           Charlie watches this with disbelief he can chew.  Barnes’ men 
           already have their guns drawn.  

                                 BARNES
                        What the fuck is this?

                                 BLATCH
                        This is my negotiating committee.

                                 BARNES
                        Who the fuck are you?

                                 BLATCH
                        I’m Gilbert Blatch.

                                 BARNES
                        Gilbert Blatch?

                                 BLATCH
                        You’ve heard of me?

                                 BARNES
                        Sort of.  Gilbert Blatch sounds 
                        like the noise a whore makes 
                        choking on a dick.
                            (then)
                        What is this, Decker?
                                 CHARLIE
                        I...I’m...  Hold on a second.

           Charlie talks low to Blatch.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What are you doing?  Who are these 
                        people with you?

                                 BLATCH
                        Part of my adventure last night 
                        took place among them.  Don’t sweat 
                        the technique.  I’m about to 
                        quadruple our money here.

                                 CHARLIE
                        The price of the car has already 
                        been agreed upon, you fuckin’ 
                        idiot.  And that was before it 
                        looked like a whale puked it up.  
                        They do not have four times more 
                        money with them.  You are going to 
                        get us all killed.  You can’t just--

                                 BLATCH
                        --Oh I can just.  This ain’t your 
                        kitchen table.  Out here, I call 
                        the rules.  
                            (glances at the jackboys)
                        Don’t make me sic the dog pound on 
                        your ass.  I say the word, they’ll 
                        twist your fuckin’ cap back.

           A Jackboy snarl-glares at Charlie.  Charlie just shakes his 
           head.  Wants to die.  Blatch breaks out of quiet conversation 
           mode, shouts across the corral to Barnes.

                                 BLATCH
                        So it’s settled then.  You pay us 
                        six hundred thousand dollars for 
                        the car.  We all go home satisfied.  

                                 BARNES
                        Are you fuckin’ kidding me, kid?  
                        Decker...?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I am very sorry about this.

                                 BLATCH
                        No I’m not kidding, see.  You give 
                        us six hundred.  I spare you from 
                        the posse’s wrath.  Satisfaction 
                        everywhere.
           Barnes doesn’t even think.  He just turns, about to climb 
           back in the Denali.  

                                 BLATCH
                            (low)
                        Hey, what the fuck...?  
                            (shouts)
                        Don’t take another step, asshole!

           Blatch aims his sub-machinegun off to the side.  
           BURST-FIRES a warning. 

           Barnes stops cold.  His men stop cold.  His men aim guns on 
           high alert.  

           Then, from somewhere: A MUFFLED SHRIEK OF AGONY.

           All eyes pan toward this noise, sweeping across the golden 
           brown corral, over the crumbling wood fence, finally stopping 
           on a long HORSE TRAILER.  FIVE FRESH AND SIZZLING BULLET 
           HOLES PUNCHED CLEAN THROUGH IT.

           AN LAPD SWAT OFFICER LURCHES OUT OF THE TRAILER, GRASPING HIS 
           NECK, BLOOD PUMPING BETWEEN HIS FINGERS.  

           He collapses, dead.

           Now everyone levels guns at the trailer, Blatch and Barnes 
           suddenly on the same team.

           Charlie and Underhill stand frozen in the background.

           A voice BOOMS from a MEGAPHONE inside the trailer.

                                 OATES (O.S.)
                        This is the FBI!  Drop your weapons 
                        and lie face down on the--

           --Blatch fires first.  Then The Jackboys.  Then Barnes and 
           his men.  All UNLOADING into the trailer.

           SWAT MEN SPILL OUT, wasps from a kicked nest, some bleeding, 
           all retuning fire.

           A buzzing maelstrom of crisscrossing lead.  Mows down men on 
           all sides.

           Charlie and Underhill dive behind the Acura, just as a bullet 
           storm RAKES ACROSS IT, reducing windows to sand particles.

           The Jackboys fire wild.  Barnes and his henchmen fire wild.  
           Oates and his two remaining SWAT MEN fire like cyborgs, 
           scoring precision chest and head shots.

           Barnes scrambles for cover, trying to reload.  Oates removes 
           most of his head with a one-armed pistol blast.
           Blatch dives into the Spyker, PEEEEELS OFF ACROSS THE CORRAL. 
           POPPING SPASTIC, THREE-ROUND STREAMS RIGHT THROUGH THE 
           WINDSHIELD.  AT ANYTHING IN HIS WAY.  There’s a Jackboy-- 
           BLAM!  A Barnes Henchman-- SPLIZZAT!  

           Blatch has gone apeshit bonkers.  SPINNING IN CRAZED DONUT 
           MANEUVERS.  TIRES KICKING UP CYCLONIC DUST CLOUDS.   

           Blatch BULLET-SPLASHES both SWAT MEN.  One in the face.  The 
           other in the shin.  He runs this wounded one over, flat.

           Oates rolls, comes up, one knee, pistol tracking the 
           supercar, which is now BARRELING DEAD AT HIM.  

           Blatch BATTLE-SCREAMS.  Channeling some type of demon rage 
           from every atom of flab.  He stomps the gas peddle into the 
           floor.  

           Oates holds his breath.  Oates target-locks.  Oates hits the 
           trigger and BLOWS BLATCH’S BRAINS OUT THE SPYKER’S REAR 
           WINDOW.  JET of pink pulp and glass.    

           The Spyker swerves, misses Oates by nanometers, slows, hits a 
           fence post and stops, maybe ten feet from a cowering Charlie 
           and Underhill.  They see the headless Blatch slumped over the 
           wheel.

           Snowfall silence.

           A tenebrous cloud of dust and gun smoke enshrouds the corral.

           Oates pistol scans, searching for targets in this swirling 
           ghost zone.  Then--  murky flashes of movement, behind 
           Charlie’s Acura.  

                                 OATES
                        Decker!

           Silence. 

                                 OATES
                        I know it’s you, Decker!  Believe 
                        me, hiding behind that car does you 
                        no fucking good!  You have till the 
                        count of--

           VWOOMP!

           The shot drops Oates horizontal.  Shocks his breath away.  
           His fingers claw the smooshed slug in his vest.  Another shot 
           ZWIPS PAST.  Muzzle flashes through the gloom.  Then dry 
           clicks.  There’s a wounded Jackboy on the ground, firing on 
           empty.  Oates SLAPS TWO ROUNDS through the top of his head.
           An ENGINE ROARS.  Oates whip-pans his gaze--  
           The Spyker.  TURBO-LAUNCHING OUT OF THE CORRAL.  
           Blatch’s corpse discarded in its smoking tire tracks.

           Oates practically teleports to his feet.  CHARGES to the edge 
           of the bluff.  The Spyker FLYING down the dirt road.

           Oates BLASTING before he stops running.
           Unleashing a wall of metal at the fleeing car.

           INT. SPYKER (SPEEDING) - THAT MOMENT

           Charlie drives.  Underhill shotgun.  Bullets EXPLODING all 
           around them.  BLOWING OUT quilted leather upholstery.  
           A SPRAY of stereo plastic.

           EXT. LEMON TREE CORRAL - THAT MOMENT

           Oates’ gun SNICKS empty.  He could give a fuck.  He jams a 
           fresh clip in at the speed of light.  KEEPS FIRING.  Even 
           after the Spyker hits the paved road and races out of sight.

           EXT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - DAY 

           Lee Farallon takes notice of the Plymouth Barracuda in the 
           carport before ringing the doorbell.

           Caroline cracks the door, chain lock strung across her face.

                                 FARALLON
                        Caroline Decker?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Yes?

                                 FARALLON
                        Hi, my name is Hank Krinkle.  I’m 
                        an old friend of Charlie’s.

           Caroline wonders why she has never heard of this man.  There 
           is something wrong about him.  Something she cannot define.  
           She feels dread swimming slowly up her spine.

                                 CAROLINE
                        He’s...  He’s napping right now.  
                            (fake laugh)
                        You know how Charlie is.  

                                 FARALLON
                        Always sleeping.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Would you mind coming back 
                        later...or calling, so...
           Farallon is systematically swiveling his head.  Eyeing the 
           neighbors’ homes.  Eyeing the street.  The Time Warner van 
           parked against the curb.  There is no one watching.

           Farallon answers Caroline by THRUST-KICKING the door open.  
           SMASHING the whole thing into her face. 

           She sails back.  BASHING over an end table.  Hits the 
           hardwood floor in a gelatinous heap.

           INT. TIME WARNER VAN - DAY 

           The three-man FBI surveillance team watches this unfold on a 
           monitor.  They gasp.  Muttering expletive-laden bewilderment.  
           Franticly RACKING their weapons.

           INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE/VARIOUS ROOM - DAY 

           Farallon has his Titanium pistol out.  Sweeping the house for 
           a napping Charlie.  Master bedroom.  Guest bedroom.  Kitchen.  
           Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Back out to the living room.  
           Scoops unconscious Caroline over his shoulder.  He hears the 
           growl before he turns.

           Comet the dog.  Fangs bared.  Yellow body flexed.  More lion 
           than canine.  Standing between Farallon and the wide open 
           front door.

           Farallon routinely raises his pistol and--

                                 FBI #1
                        Freeze!  FBI!

           Two FBI AGENTS swing into the doorway, behind Comet, guns 
           zeroed on Farallon.

           This dog has had enough.  He runs to the back of the house.

                                 FBI #2
                        Drop it!

           Farallon drops Caroline to the wood floor.  Cement sack THUD.

                                 FBI #2
                        The gun, Goddamn it!

           So Farallon drops the gun.

                                 FBI #1
                        Put your hands on top of your head!

           Farallon does this.

           The agents move in on him.  FBI #2 frisks.  FBI #2 feels 
           something weird beneath Farallon’s jacket.  He lifts it back 
           and can’t believe what he sees.    
                                 FBI #2
                        Holy shit.  Guy’s got a grenade 
                        launcher.

           The XM320 GRENADE MODULE is snub-nosed and pistol-gripped.  
           And it easily fits into Farallon’s shoulder rig, alongside 
           five ammo loops containing customized 40mm shells.  These 
           shells are labeled thusly: SPREAD; SMOKE; FRAG; NAPALM.  

           FBI #1 takes a look at the strange weapon.

           Farallon wiggles his big toe.  A TWO-INCH BLADE covertly 
           whisper-snaps out of the tip of his Wheeler cowboy boot.

                                 FARALLON
                        Close your eyes, my darling.

                                 FBI #2
                        What?

           Farallon continues talking, as though he were someplace else.

                                 FARALLON
                        Don’t open them until I say it’s 
                        safe. 

                                 FBI #2
                            (chuckle)
                        What are you, talking to yoursel--

           Farallon’s foot and hand move in simultaneous blurs.  Hand 
           flash-snaring FBI #1’s gun.  Foot embedding laser-sharp metal 
           into FBI #2’s groin.

           Farallon shoots FBI #1 twice in the face.  Shoots FBI #2 
           once, in the back of the head, as he’s curled on the floor, 
           red hands cupping his crotch.

           EXT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Farallon strides out onto the front path.  Caroline over his 
           shoulder.  Grenade launcher fully extended, like it is part 
           of his arm.

           INT. TIME WARNER VAN - DAY 

           FBI #3 bug-eyes a monitor.  Is that a grenade launcher?  
           He scrambles, rips open the sliding door.  Jumps ou--

           BLOOP!  The FRAG shell hits FBI #3.  Flush in the chest.  

           The planet SHAKES.  The van is a pillar of fire.  

           Farallon trudges a whole block with Caroline lolling on his 
           shoulder.  Dumps her in the back of the waiting Range Rover.  
           Then sits shotgun beside a stunned Veritek.
                                 VERITEK
                        Jesus Christ.  What the fuck just 
                        happened?

           Farallon catches breath.  Swallows.  Stares off into space.

                                 FARALLON
                        You can open your eyes now, my 
                        love.

           EXT. BURBANK - DAY 

           The Spyker C8 is bullet-riddled and blood-spattered.  Two 
           flat tires. It SKIDS past a Fosters Freeze, veering inside a 
           multi-level parking complex on Angeleno Ave.

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY 

           The Spyker parks in the most remote spot available.

           INT. SPYKER - DAY 

           Charlie kills the engine.  Slow burns Underhill.  Stares 
           glowing daggers at him.  

                                 UNDERHILL
                        ...I know...I know...I...I’m...

           Charlie PUNCHES the dashboard, so hard the glove box POPS 
           OPEN.  Underhill stares into it for a moment, then pulls out 
           a large PLASTIC BAG, which contains a half gallon of water.  
           And a LIVE OCTOPUS, swimming and swirling.

           As if to explain the bizarre sight:

                                 UNDERHILL
                        This is Blatch’s favorite food.

           Charlie’s cell rings.  Caller ID: pic of Caroline, sticking 
           her tongue out.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s Caroline.  Do not say a 
                        fuckin’ word.

           Underhill nods.  Charlie answers.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey...

                                 FARALLON (O.S.)
                        Charlie Decker?

           A fear vortex opens in the pit of Charlie’s stomach.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Who is this?

           INTERCUT - Farallon

           sitting shotgun in the Ranger Rover, hurtling down the sun-
           scorched 101.  Smoke peels off his face from a self-rolled 
           cigarette.

                                 FARALLON
                        I represent the man whose car you 
                        stole.

                                 CHARLIE
                        --Okay, alright, now...  You don’t 
                        have to hurt her.  You do not have 
                        to hurt her to--

                                 FARALLON
                        --She’s already hurt.  If you want 
                        her alive you will do-- 

                                 CHARLIE
                        --Yes, yes, anything... I’ll get 
                        you your car back.  I will buy you 
                        five new cars.  Just don’t--

                                 FARALLON
                        --I’d like it very much if you 
                        listened before speaking.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes.

                                 FARALLON
                        Are you listening?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes.

                                 FARALLON
                        You know it’s not the car we want.

           Charlie’s forehead crinkles confused.

                                 CHARLIE
                        ...yes, no, of course not...

                                 FARALLON
                        You...can...keep...the...car.
                            (then)
                        The package secured inside its 
                        trunk...

           Charlie is more perplexed and horrified than ever now.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes.

                                 FARALLON
                        You will return it to us before 
                        sundown or I will feed your wife to 
                        something hungry.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes.  You will get it.

                                 FARALLON
                        Keep your phone on.  We will tell 
                        you where to meet us--

                                 CHARLIE
                        --Wait, wait--  Can I talk to her, 
                        to hear her voice, to know that 
                        she’s...that she is okay?

           Caroline is still knocked out in the backseat.  So Farallon 
           flicks his cigarette.  It lands on her shirt sleeve.  It 
           burns through.  It hits skin and SIZZLES.  She JOLTS AWAKE.  
           SCREAMING.  Farallon holds his cell over her.  And then--

           --Click.  Call’s over.  Charlie is pale to the brink of 
           translucency.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Who was that?

           Charlie jumps out of the car.  FLINGS open the trunk. Mess of 
           tire changing tools.  Shoves them aside.  Finger searches 
           around.  Tears open the donut tire compartment.  Empty.  
           Finger searches more.  Finds another compartment, beneath the 
           first one.  Covered with a hinged, vacuum-sealed steel lid.  
           The lock on it has been blasted or pried off.  He lifts the 
           lid.  Already knowing what he will see:  

           Nothing.  

           Whatever was hidden here is long gone.  Underhill steps 
           beside him.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        What is it?  What’s going on?

                                 CHARLIE
                        You know this dope ride you 
                        supposedly stole from The Mandalay 
                        Bay?  Turns out there was something 
                        hidden in the trunk, something a 
                        hell of a lot more valuable than a 
                        quarter of a million dollar car.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE (cont'd)
                        And if I can’t figure out what an 
                        insane, miserable, fat-fucking-dead-
                        fatso did with it, within the next 
                        six hours, Caroline is going to 
                        die.  Also, I don’t know if you 
                        noticed, but I think the FBI is 
                        after me in full force.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        You’ll...you’ll think of something, 
                        though...right?

           Charlie sort of nods to himself.  Then PLOWS HIS FIST, SMACK 
           into Underhill’s gut.

           EXT. LEMON TREE CORRAL - DAY 

           The LAPD and FBI have invaded the Lemon Tree Corral en masse. 
           Clearing corpses.  Collecting shells.  Digging velocity-
           smashed slugs out of almost everything.

           Ward Oates moves through this semi-orchestrated chaos, 
           walking alongside a Supervising Special Agent from the Los 
           Angeles FBI office, an old war horse named DALE TRAXLE. 

                                 OATES
                        But, Sir...Sir, I can get this son 
                        of a bitch by the end of the day if 
                        you’ll just let me--

                                 TRAXLE
                        --I said no, and I mean it.

                                 OATES
                        Please, Sir... If it’s not me who 
                        takes him down after all of this...  
                        Last time they practically put me 
                        out to pasture as a lame duck tour 
                        guide...fuckin’ 8th graders...  I 
                        spent years of my life tracking 
                        this kid and-- 

           Traxle stops, turns, face to face.

                                 TRAXLE
                        --and you fucked that up! You 
                        fucked it up three years ago!  And 
                        you fucked it up again today!  Now 
                        I’m gonna do you a favor.  I’m 
                        going to prevent the completion of 
                        your fuck-up trilogy.

                                 OATES
                        Oh, eat shit, Dale.  If I wanna 
                        hunt this kid down, I’m gonna hunt 
                        this kid down!
           A small crowed has gathered, watching the confrontation.  
           Traxle pauses, nods, holds out an upturned palm, calmly says:

                                 TRAXLE
                        Badge and gun.  Give them to me.

                                 OATES
                        Badge and gun?

                                 TRAXLE
                        Hand ‘em over, right now.

                                 OATES
                        What is...?  That’s not even how 
                        it’s done.

                                 TRAXLE
                        Nevermind how it is or isn’t done.  
                        Hand ‘em over.

           A small phalanx of agents has formed behind Traxle, hands on 
           their hip holsters, primed to pounce.

           Oates chokes back molecular acid.  Relinquishes his badge and 
           gun with everyone watching.  Turns, stares off into the 
           plunging vista of downtown Burbank.  Something in the wind 
           stings his eyes as he walks toward it.

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY

           Charlie and Underhill stand beside a silver, 1985 Toyota 
           minivan, deep within the shadowy reaches of the parking 
           complex.  Underhill holds the sore spot on his stomach where 
           Charlie socked him.  Charlie pops the driver’s door with his 
           Swiss Army knife.  He goes to work hot wiring.  

                                 UNDERHILL
                        We didn’t know anything was in the 
                        trunk, honest.  We were just 
                        sitting in my car, in the 
                        McDonald’s lot eating dinner, when 
                        two hundred and fifty thousand 
                        dollars rolled by.  We followed it 
                        to a gas station and...  I’m sorry.

           Long silence.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Are you gonna not talk to me or...?

           As he hot wires...

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t have the luxury of ignoring 
                        you.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE (cont'd)
                        Whatever was in that trunk, we have 
                        to find out what Blatch did with it 
                        and get it back.  We have 
                        six...less than six hours to figure 
                        out where that maniac went last 
                        night.  But I have no idea 
                        where...how to even begin.

           The van’s engine grumbles awake.  Drowns out something 
           Underhill says.  Charlie wiggles out of the car, looks at 
           him.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What?

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I do.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You do what?

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I know how we can maybe find out 
                        what Blatch did last night.

                                 CHARLIE
                        How?

           Underhill holds up the octopus bag.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Follow the octopus.

           EXT. LEMON TREE CORRAL - DAY

           Oates sits alone on a split wooden beam at the outskirts of 
           the corral.  Shoulders slumped.  Watching all the activity 
           humming along without him.  Traxle smiling and sipping 
           coffee, barking orders, gesticulating with great authority.  
           Oates spits into the dirt, mumbles something. 

           Oates watches CORONER’S TECHS handle bodies.  SWAT MEN.  
           JACKBOYS.  Filling evidence bags with personal items found on 
           the corpses.

           Oates causally walks over to the row of EVIDENCE BAGS, all 
           stored on a long folding table, in wooden crates that once 
           held Napa wine.

           Oates rummages through the boxes.  Oates sees WALLETS.  Oates 
           sees full AMMO CLIPS.  Oates sees GUNS and a blood-splattered 
           LAPD BADGE.  Oates’ smile is almost invisible.  He grabs TWO 
           BIG BAGS.  

           A TECH eyes him.  Sees Oates’ FBI windbreaker.  Oates smiles, 
           nods.  The Tech goes back to work.
           Oates leaves the corral, lugging the two evidence bags over 
           his shoulder, never to return.

           INT. LAS VEGAS OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 

           FRANCIS GALVAN is 33 years old, but still dresses like he is 
           16.  Track pants.  Nikes.  A Jinx T-shirt which says “The 
           cake is a lie.”  He sits at his desk, in his office, on the 
           27th floor of The American Plexar Building.  Behind him a 
           blue-green window wall makes the Vegas sprawl look like a 
           deep sea metropolis.  An 80” PLASMA plays news footage of the 
           aftermath at Charlie’s house.  The exploded van.  Body bags.  
           An armada of cops.  And, most disturbing to Galvan, a clear, 
           12 megapixel surveillance snapshot of Lee Farallon walking up 
           to Charlie’s front door.

           As he talks on the phone, Galvan raises and lowers the room 
           temperature from a touch pad built flat into his desktop.     

                                 GALVAN
                        What the fuck are you doing?  
                        You’re all over the TV!

           INTERCUT - Ken Veritek

           Phone pressed to a cauliflowered ear, standing in the kitchen 
           of an unfurnished “SAFE HOUSE” in some barren no man’s land, 
           northwest of Rancho Cucomunga, on the rim of the Angeles 
           National Forest.  Caroline is hog-tied and with handcuffs on 
           the living room floor.  Through a sliding glass door, Veritek 
           watches Farallon, who is sitting in the backyard, smoking in 
           a deck chair, back turned, beside a pool half-full of black 
           rain water. 

                                 VERITEK
                            (sharp and low)
                        It’s not me!  It’s him!  The guy is 
                        fucking whacked-out crazy.  So if 
                        you wanna yell at me, I’m just 
                        going to leave.  I’m just going to 
                        walk out, right now.  I’m going 
                        home.  I’m...  Bye.

                                 GALVAN
                        No wait!  Kenny...listen...Bro!  
                            (then)
                        Okay...I get it, I get it...  This 
                        is a bad situation.  For both of 
                        us.  He’s out of control.  FBI got 
                        a snapshot of him...they’ll ID him 
                        for sure...I can’t have him traced 
                        back to me...  Fuck!
                            (pause)
                        I’m going to send a team to your 
                        location.  3 to 4 men.  Men my Dad 
                        use to use. 
                                 VERITEK
                        What do you mean, men?  To do what? 

           Silence.  Veritek gets the gist.

                                 VERITEK
                        I don’t want to be around when shit 
                        like that goes down.  No.

                                 GALVAN
                        What is all this squeamishness? 
                        I’ve seen you rake a man’s face 
                        across the cage like it was a 
                        cheese grater.

                                 VERITEK
                        That’s completely different.  MMA 
                        fighters do not carry grenade 
                        launchers, Francis.  Or feed women 
                        to rabid dogs.  Or constantly make 
                        nonsensical comments to their wives 
                        when their wives do not exist.  How 
                        could you team me up with a person 
                        like this?   

                                 GALVAN
                        Farallon is the best tracker I 
                        have.  It’s just, recently...
                            (then)
                        Look, you shouldn’t know this, 
                        but...  Six months ago, just after 
                        Daddy passed...there were some who 
                        believed they should be in charge 
                        of things, instead of me.  So one 
                        night I sent Farallon to a party 
                        where these conspirators were all 
                        in attendance. 

           FLASH TO:

           Cloud-forms moving across the desert moon.  Farallon strolls 
           across the lawn, toward the SPANISH VILLA.  People are dark, 
           cocktail-sipping shapes beyond the gigantic picture window.  

           Farallon cracks the breach of his grenade launcher.  Loads a 
           shell labeled NAPALM.  Aims into that picture window--

           AND THE HOUSE BLOSSOMS FIRE.

           Farallon ejects the spent shell.  Loads one labeled SPREAD.  
           It looks like a MASSIVE SHOTGUN SHELL.  And when the burning 
           people begin to lurch and stagger from the inferno, some 
           tumbling from second floor windows, the grenade launcher 
           SPITS A BLASTWAVE OF BALL BEARINGS.  Just like a GIANT 
           SHOTGUN.  Scattering the burning people to ash.

                                 GALVAN
                        Dental X-rays confirmed Farallon’s 
                        wife was at the party.

                                 VERITEK
                        ...Christ...

                                 GALVAN
                        Dad always said she kept him sane.  
                        He almost had to put Farallon down 
                        a dozen times himself, because 
                        before she came along there 
                        was...difficulty containing him.  
                        She never knew what he really did.  
                        And he never wanted her to know.  
                        That was part of it, I think.  
                        But...  I’m getting a sense, now 
                        that he accidently murdered her, he 
                        might be sliding back into his old 
                        ways.

                                 VERITEK
                        Oh you fuckin’ think so?

                                 GALVAN
                        You don’t understand, there were 
                        things he liked to do, before she 
                        domesticated him...things that make 
                        that grenade launcher look like a 
                        water-squirting daisy.

                                 VERITEK
                        Things?  What kind of things?

                                 GALVAN
                        Forget what I just said.  He’s an 
                        old man now.  Just wait for the 
                        team.  They’ll take care of him for 
                        you.  
                            (then)
                        And the package...  Please, at 
                        least tell me one little fuckin’ 
                        thing of good news.  Please tell me 
                        that’s still under control.

                                 VERITEK
                        Nothing’s changed.  Decker has it.  
                        We just have to arrange the... 
                        whatever you call it...the drop.
                            (then)
                        Seriously, though, what kind of 
                        things did he do?
                                 GALVAN
                        When Farallon’s solved, call 
                        Decker.  I want the team to take 
                        out him and his wife soon as the 
                        drop is made. 

                                 VERITEK
                        How am I gonna know when this team 
                        is here?  Do I have to let them in 
                        or...?

                                 GALVAN
                        Fuck no, bro.  You won’t know 
                        they’ve arrived until the smoke 
                        clears and that old bastard’s a 
                        corpse.

           EXT. KOREA TOWN - DAY

           The Toyota van pulls to a stop in front of a restaurant 
           called CHA SUSHI, a Korean sushi bar hidden on a tiny 
           backstreet.  

           There’s a “closed” sign on the door.  There’s a sheet of 
           plywood where a large front window should be.  Specks of 
           broken glass shimmering on the sidewalk below it.  Since the 
           window is gone, there is no restaurant name or address. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        This it?

           Underhill checks the article in the L.A. Weekly, which 
           features a pic of the restaurant's facade in pristine 
           condition.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Yeah, it’s gotta be.

           INT. CHA SUSHI - DAY

           A very tired teenage boy named JUNG TAE CHA sweeps the 
           restaurant floor.  In the corner is a mound a broken glass 
           and busted furniture, as well as a shattered sea food tank.  

           The door opens.  Jung Tae Cha looks up, sees Charlie and 
           Underhill in the doorway, does not stop sweeping.

                                 JUNG TAE CHA
                        We’re closed.

                                 CHARLIE
                        We’re not hungry.  We’re looking 
                        for somebody.

                                 JUNG TAE CHA
                        Who?
                                 CHARLIE
                        Somebody who ate here last night.  
                        White.  Fat.  Extremely disgusting.  
                        Ordered live octopus.

           Jung stops sweeping, looks up with a start, almost 
           frightened.

                                                              FLASH TO:

           LAST NIGHT

           GILBERT BLATCH, alone at a table, plate of octopus squirming 
           in front of him.  He wraps one around a pair of chopsticks.  
           Jams it in his mouth.  CHOMPS.  Swallows.  Black tentacles 
           slithering into his mouth like Medusa hair. 

           There’s an L.A. X...Press open on the table before him.  Two 
           full pages of hooker ads.  Blatch whips out his cell.  Dials 
           an actual hooker.  Right there in the busy restaurant.  
           Before he can finish dialing, Jung Tae Cha approaches.

                                 JUNG TAE CHA
                        Excuse me, sir.  No cell phones, 
                        please.

           Blatch recoils in confusion.  Jung points to a large message 
           board on the wall.  Written on it, in red magic marker, is a 
           list of rules diners must obey.  At the top of the list, in 
           handwriting twice as big: NO CELL PHONES.

           Blatch shakes his head and smiles, as if to assure young Jung 
           everything is a-okay.

                                 BLATCH
                        No, no, no...you don’t understand.  
                        I’ve been researching this all day. 

           Blatch points to a hooker ad, which he has circled with a 
           heart.

                                 BLATCH
                        This is the semen demon I’m gonna 
                        mount tonight.

           Blatch turns away from Jung, re-dials.

           Jung shrugs to his father, JUNG YUP CHA, who is behind the 
           sushi counter, watching the scene unfold, eyes blazing.

           Blatch listens to the hooker’s voicemail.  Starts to leave 
           his phone number.  

           Jung Yup Cha YANKS the phone from Blatch’s hand before he can 
           say the last digit.  A waiter flash-clears Blatch’s table.
           Blatch stands.  Eye-to-eye with the fearsome Jung Yup.

                                 BLATCH
                        What the fuck?!

           All diners stop and stare.

                                 JUNG YUP CHA
                        YOU. GO.

           He hands the phone back to Blacth.

           Blatch HEAD BUTTS.  SMASHING Jung Yup Cha’s nose in.  Jung 
           Yup Cha flails back in a spray of blood.  Diner’s SCREAM.  

           EXT. CHA SUSHI - NIGHT

           A table EXPLODES THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOW.  Through the 
           octopus tank behind it.  Spilling octopi.  Hundreds of them.  
           Wriggling on the sidewalk in a slush of broken glass. 

           Blatch leaps through the broken window, sneakers squish-
           skidding tentacles.  Without stopping, he gathers as many of 
           the sea creates as he can, then sprints off, cackling, into 
           the neon night.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Charlie and Underhill stand facing Jung Tae Cha in the empty 
           restaurant.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Did you call the police?

                                 JUNG TAE CHA
                        My father...he makes his own 
                        justice.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What does that mean? 

                                 JUNG TAE CHA
                        He is going to find the fat man 
                        himself.

                                 CHARLIE
                        How?

                                 JUNG TAE CHA
                        He left his hooker newspaper 
                        behind.  When my cousins get here, 
                        they are going to call the woman he 
                        circled in it and--

           --Jung Yup Cha walks out of a back room, nose bandaged.  He 
           barks something in Korean.  His son replies in Korean.  
           Jung Yup Cha seems to bristle, and is soon joined by three 
           KOREAN MEN, all thick as a brick shit house, brandishing 
           BUTCHER KNIVES and CLEAVERS.

           Charlie tries to graciously engage the elder Cha.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sir, please listen to me, I have--

           Jung Yup grumbles.  The THREE BLADE-WIELDING MEN advance on 
           Charlie and Underhill.  Jung Tae quietly says,

                                 JUNG TAE CHA
                        You should leave very quickly.

           Charlie and Underhill take his advice.

           INT. TOYOTA VAN (PARKED) - DAY

           Charlie and Underhill stare out the windshield of the parked 
           van, faces awash with defeat, staring at the smashed facade 
           of the Sushi Bar.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        What if we call in a bomb threat?  
                        Whole place clears out, we run in, 
                        grab Blatch’s hooker newspaper.

                                 CHARLIE
                        How about I lay my head on the 
                        street and you run it over with 
                        this van?

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I’m telling you...if we flesh it 
                        out...there’s something to this 
                        bomb idea.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No there isn’t.

           Underhill points out a homeless man pushing a shopping cart 
           filled with trash bags. 

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Okay...What if we pay that guy to 
                        strap a bunch of road flares to his 
                        chest and run in like a suicide 
                        bomber? 

           Charlie just stares blankly at Underhill.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Road flares look just like 
                        dynamite.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Your ideas fuckin’ suck.
                            (then)
                        This is ridiculous.  They’re not 
                        gonna hurt us...the man is a 
                        business owner, for Christ’s sake.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Yeah, a business owner who makes 
                        his own justice.  Korean justice.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What is that?

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I don’t know.  But it’s gotta be 
                        pretty fuckin’ horrible.

                                 CHARLIE
                        This is insane.  We can’t just sit 
                        around.
                            (then)
                        Wait here.

           Charlie hops out of the car.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        What’re you gonna do?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m gonna offer to renovate his 
                        whole Goddamn restaurant.

           INT. CHA SUSHI - DAY

           Charlie enters.  Front room’s empty.  Goes to the--

           BACK ROOM

           Everyone’s there.  Gathered near a supply closet: Jung Yup 
           Cha and son, plus the three blade-brandishing shit kickers.

           They all stop talking, snapping eyes on Charlie.  Charlie 
           opens his mouth, about to appeal to the better angels of 
           their nature, when he sees it, on a counter inches to his 
           right: Blatch’s L.A. X...Press newspaper.

           Charlie grabs it and runs.

           EXT. CHA SUSHI - DAY

           Charlie BOLTS OUT THE DOOR, onto the street, SCREAMING.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Johnny!  Start the car!!!
           Underhill scoots into the driver’s seat.  Starts the engine. 
           Sees THREE HUGE KOREANS barrel out after Charlie.  Throwing 
           KNIVES.  CLEAVERS.  Edged steel CLANGING off van metal. 

           Charlie DIVES THROUGH THE DRIVER’S WINDOW.  Across 
           Underhill’s lap.  The van lurches off, around the corner and 
           out of sight.

           EXT. GOLF ‘N STUFF/SNACK ZONE - DAY

           The Snack Zone abuts the miniature golf course and the bumper 
           boat pond.  Kids squeak and squeal.  Oates sits at a picnic 
           table.  There is an OLD PHOTO BOOTH in the background.  He is 
           examining a freshly developed photo strip from it.  Five 
           vertically stacked headshots of himself, staring forward 
           without expression.  

           He slices off his favorite pic with a pocket knife.  Opens a 
           black, bi-fold wallet.  On one inside flap: a blood-smeared 
           LAPD badge, on the other: an LAPD ID.  Oates removes the ID 
           from its plastic sleeve.  Carefully tapes his picture over 
           the face of one SERGEANT HENRY RULES.  Slides the ID back in 
           the wallet.  Looks just fine.  Quite convincing beneath the 
           transparent plastic, next to an honest-to-Christ LAPD badge.  
           Oates dunks a napkin in his extra large Coke and polishes the 
           shield to a high, blood-free shine.

           INT. TOYOTA VAN (MOVING) - DAY

           Underhill drives.  Charlie looks at the circled hooker ad.  
           Blonde pigtails and a smile clogged with braces.  The name 
           below the face: ASHLYNN BRATT.  

                                 UNDERHILL
                        So...are you gonna call her?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No, I’m gonna write her a letter.

           Charlie opens his phone.  Dials.  Hears no rings, just a 
           recording of a GIRL’S VOICE.

                                 GIRL’S VOICE
                        Hi, this is Ashlynn.  I never 
                        answer my phone.  But If you leave 
                        your name and number, I’ll call you 
                        back, fast.

           Beep!

                                 CHARLIE
                        ...um...hi, Ashlynn?  This is 
                        Ralph.  Uh, please call me back, 
                        right away, please.  My number is 
                        323-446-1087.  Thank you and 
                        uhhh...  Bye-bye?
           Charlie hangs up, slightly shaken.  

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Ralph?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m not giving out my real--

           RING!  Charlie’s heart skips.  Underhill’s heart skips.  
           Caller ID: unknown.  Charlie clears his throat and answers 
           his phone. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hello?

           The girl’s voice is different than the one from the voice 
           mail.  It’s smoother, quieter, like someone telling secrets 
           in study hall. 

                                 GIRL’S VOICE
                        Hi, Ralph.

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           Farallon is outside, smoking by the pool.  Caroline lies on 
           the living room floor, handcuff bound.  Veritek stands in the 
           kitchen, fidgeting, compulsively checking his watch, sweating 
           big wet blots through his T-shirt.  Caroline studies him for 
           a bit, then...

                                 CAROLINE
                        ...hey...
                            (sharply)
                        Hey.

           Veritek twitch-turns his head toward her. 

                                 CAROLINE
                        You look like shit.

           Veritek makes a face.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Relax...I’m sure I look way worse.
                            (then)
                        So...what do you say we get the 
                        fuck out of here...?

           Veritek is silent.  Thinking.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Also, do you know how much money I 
                        could pay you if you help me?

           Silence.
                                 CAROLINE
                        The answer is: a fuckload.
                            (then)
                        Think of how good it would feel, 
                        escaping out the front door, right 
                        now. 

           Veritek thinks: Goddamn, that would be heaven.

                                 CAROLINE
                        So what do you say?  Unlock me and 
                        let’s blow this hellhole.

           Veritek nods slightly.  Walks over to Caroline.  Kneels.  
           Grabs a roll of DUCT TAPE off the floor.  Slaps a big piece 
           of it over her mouth.

           Caroline’s eyes sink.

           Veritek lumbers back into the kitchen.

           Caroline rolls over.  Faces the wall.  There is an electrical 
           outlet, a few feet from her face.  Two small screws hold the 
           outlet’s plastic frame in place, and one of them is LOOSE, 
           protruding a few centimeters from the wall.  Caroline’s eyes 
           LOCK ON, ZOOM IN, mentally FREEZE FRAMING that LOOSE SCREW.

           EXT. VALLEYRAMA APARTMENTS - DAY 

           A metal keypad.  A finger punches buttons.  Two rings.  Then 
           a voice from the intercom speaker says...

                                 GIRL’S VOICE
                        Hello.  Who am I speaking to?

           Charlie leans close to the call box.

                                 CHARLIE
                        This is Ralph.

           BZZZZZZZZZZ.  The vine-covered gate clicks open.  Charlie and 
           Underhill walk through it, entering the courtyard of the 
           Valleyrama apartment complex in Sherman Oaks, California.

           The pool is the centerpiece of the three-tier, hacienda-style 
           complex.  And it is full of girls.  And it is surrounded by 
           girls.  The universe is suddenly in bloom with girls.  
           Backstroking.  Lounging.  Sipping brightly colored ice 
           drinks.  Smoking purple-flowering weed.  They are all under 
           twenty five.  All topless.  With skin that is smooth and tan, 
           and softly sparkling, like volcanic sand.  They splash and 
           smile and wave, giggling musical hellos to Charlie and 
           Underhill.

           Charlie and Underhill just keep walking, up to the third tier 
           of the complex, stopping before apartment 301. 
           Charlie rings the bell.  Four second wait.  The door opens.  
           Revealing a PLUMP MEXICAN WOMAN who smiles hi.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Uh, I’m Ralph.  I called... Is 
                        Ashlynn home?

                                 PLUMP MEXICAN WOMAN
                        Si, si...  Come in.  Come inside.  

           Charlie and Underhill enter-- 

           APARTMENT 301

           The Mexican woman has a cart, full of fresh towels and 
           sheets, like a maid at the Holiday Inn.

                                 PLUMP MEXICAN WOMAN
                        You wait.  She be here soon.

           The woman exits, pushing the cart.  Charlie and Underhill 
           stand alone in the lemon-fresh studio apartment with a neatly 
           made queen bed.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What the fuck is this place?

           Underhill shrugs.  Charlie checks his watch. 

                                 UNDERHILL
                        So... what do you think was in the 
                        trunk, that they want so bad...?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Diamonds, Krugerrands...who fuckin’ 
                        cares.  Whatever it is, we have a 
                        little over four hours to find it.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Maybe it was plans?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Plans?

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Like microfilm blueprints for 
                        something.  Like maybe for a top-
                        secret, invisible jet fighter.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You know, if you put the same 
                        amount of effort into the rest of 
                        your life as you put into that 
                        totally idiotic remark...we 
                        wouldn’t be in this nightmare. 
                                 UNDERHILL
                        What about when I thought to follow 
                        the octopus?  That was helpful.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That remains to be seen.  

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Look, I know I fucked up today.  I 
                        know that, but...  That doesn’t 
                        mean I am a fuck up for life.

           Charlie takes a decorative bowl of Jolly Ranchers off the 
           coffee table.

                                 CHARLIE
                        How about, from now on...  Whenever 
                        you do something right...I’ll toss 
                        you one of these?

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Jolly Ranchers?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Like giving a dog a treat.

           Underhill waves his hand: fuck off.

           The door opens.  ASHLYNN BRATT enters.  Looks vaguely like 
           the girl in the ad.  Blonde.  Tan.  Yellow sundress.  Maybe 
           19.  But no braces on her teeth.

                                 ASHLYNN BRATT
                        Hiya, boys.  I’m Ashlynn.

           And with that, she expertly whips off her sundress.  
           Exploding a shockwave of nakedness across the room. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa...put your dress 
                        back on.

           She smiles.  Bites a shiny lip.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I am serious.

           She realizes he is, and suddenly blushes, shielding her 
           breasts with her forearms.

           As she gets dressed...

                                 CHARLIE
                        We’re not here for that.  We are 
                        here because...   Were you with a 
                        man last night?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE (cont'd)
                        A fat and disturbing man?  You 
                        would remember him.

                                 ASHLYNN BRATT
                        ...?

                                 CHARLIE
                        This is incredibly difficult to 
                        explain.  We’re not cops or 
                        anything.  You are not in any 
                        trouble.  We just need your 
                        help...to tell us anything about 
                        last night and the man you were 
                        with.  Someone’s life depends on 
                        it.  My wife’s life depends on it.

           Ashlynn looks scared now.

                                 ASHLYNN BRATT
                        I...  I wasn’t with anyone last 
                        night.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You are Ashlynn Bratt, though, 
                        correct?

                                 ASHLYNN BRATT
                        Yes...well sometimes...not really.  
                        I mean, every girl here is Ashlynn 
                        Bratt sometimes now I guess, 
                        because of the ads Nigel put out.  
                        Call that number and you could get 
                        any one of us, depending on who 
                        Nigel gives the job to.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Who’s Nigel?

                                 ASHLYNN BRATT
                        He runs this place?

                                 CHARLIE
                        This...?  This whole place...this 
                        is a whore house?

                                 ASHLYNN BRATT
                            (indignant)
                        No.  This an apartment building, 
                        not a house.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m...sorry...just...I need to 
                        know, do you know anyone here who 
                        might have met, or had a date, or 
                        whatever you call it, with a very 
                        fat man last night...? 
           We can see Ashlynn think.  Nose freckles scrunching up.

                                 ASHLYNN BRATT
                        Tori did maybe.  I saw her leave 
                        with a guy like that, I think.  I 
                        was also high as fuck at the time, 
                        so...I dunno.  Have you ever smoked 
                        Purple Pie Man?  That shit’s the 
                        bomb.com.  I wonder if I have any 
                        left in my--

                                 CHARLIE
                        --Where is this Tori?

                                 ASHLYNN BRATT
                        Um... if she’s here she’s probably 
                        over in Nigel’s apartment.  They’re 
                        married.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh how sweet.

           INT. VALLEYRAMA APARTMENTS/TORI MILES’ BEDROOM - DAY

           That inert lump beneath the bed covers is named TORI MILES. 

           Charlie and Underhill stand in the doorway staring at her. 
           Ashlynn Bratt is behind them.  On the nightstand is a plastic 
           bag, full of water and a LIVE OCTOPUS.  Underhill nudges 
           Charlie.  He already sees it.

                                 ASHLYNN BRATT
                        There she is.  That’s Tori.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Can you...wake her up?

           Ashlynn walks over.  PUNCHES the slumbering lump.  SCREAMS, 
           full force into the lump’s ear:

                                 ASHLYNN BRATT
                        WAKE!  UP!

           Nothing.

           A bathroom door opens.  NIGEL SMALLS enters the scene.  Age 
           42.  Bald head like a wax orb.  He is wearing a tuxedo.  His 
           complexion is beet red from too much sun and steroid use.  He 
           eyes the sleeping Tori.  And with a Cockney accent says...

                                 NIGEL
                        She’s out like a fuckin’ log.  I’ve 
                        tried everything short of setting 
                        her hair on fire.
           Nigel reaches under his coat.  Draws an actual WALTHER PPK 
           PISTOL.  Looks right at Charlie and Underhill.

                                 NIGEL
                        Hello, boys.  Might want to protect 
                        your eardrums.

           Ashlynn slaps her hands over her ears.  Charlie and Underhill 
           don’t, having no idea what the fuck is going on until--

           Nigel BLASTS A ROUND into a mountian of dirty laundry.  The 
           gunshot is a planet of noise.

           Tori doesn’t move.  Nigel looks at her, shakes his head, 
           thoroughly disappointed.

                                 NIGEL
                        Lesson learned: never let your wife 
                        loose with a demented lard ass the 
                        night before she has a booking in 
                        Palm Springs.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Do you know where they went?

                                 NIGEL
                        ...? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        The lard ass...where did he take 
                        her?

                                 NIGEL
                        He took her up the fuckin’ ass!  
                        How should I know!
                            (then)
                        The bloody hell are you doing in my 
                        house anyway?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Is there anything about the lard 
                        ass that you remember?

                                 NIGEL
                        What the fuck is this...?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Please...  Look where my life has 
                        taken me.  I’m a Goddamn freak.  It 
                        is futile to question my motives.

           Ashlynn nods in agreeance.
                                 NIGEL
                        I do remember his car, a Spyker C8.  
                        Because he refused to shut up about 
                        it.  And because Tori wanted to go 
                        for a “quick spin” in it.  That was 
                        the last I saw of her until nine 
                        o’clock in the fucking morning!!  

           Nigel SHOOTS the laundry pile again.  Everyone jumps, except 
           Tori.  Nigel checks his watch.

                                 NIGEL
                        Fuck it all!  Sweetheart, grab a 
                        suitcase.  We gotta be in the 
                        desert in two hours.  Gonna have to 
                        dump her in the backseat again.

           Ashlynn and Nigel grab luggage.

                                 NIGEL
                        Boys, it’s been a joy.  But if 
                        you’re still here when I get back, 
                        I’ll fucking kneecap the both of 
                        you.

           Charlie and Underhill are suddenly alone with Tori Miles. 
           They talk in urgent whispers.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You grab her feet.  I’ll grab her 
                        arms.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Kidnap her?  Are you nuts?  She’s 
                        not a newspaper.  Fifty girls will 
                        see us hauling her out.  That guy 
                        will shoot us to death.

                                 CHARLIE
                        She was with Blatch for sure.  She 
                        could know everything.  It’s my 
                        only chance.  We have to take her. 

                                 UNDERHILL
                        How?  We have minutes...less than 
                        that.  We’re fucked.  We’re 
                        screwed.  We’re fucked.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shut up!!

           Charlie thinks for five seconds.  Something blinks behind his 
           face.  He points-- the window!
                                 UNDERHILL
                        We’re three floors up.  The fall 
                        will kill her.

                                 CHARLIE
                        We’re not gonna drop her, idiot.  
                        Come on.

           Charlie and Underhill work fast.  They strip the covers off 
           Tori.  She is wearing full body pajamas with the feet 
           attached (aka footie pajamas).  They un-tuck the king-size 
           sheet she is sleeping on and envelope her in it, tying all 
           four corners together.

           Charlie’s eyeballs dart across the room.  There-- speaker 
           wires.  Running along the perimeter of the ceiling, part of a 
           10,000 dollar, 7.1 channel sound system. 

           Charlie YANKS the wires clean off.  Ties them together.  
           About 30 feet worth.  Ties one end to the sheet sack in which 
           Tori Miles is encased.

           They open the window.  They pop out the screen.  They survey 
           the alley below.  All clear.  They push the sheet sack out 
           the window.  And lower it.  Inches per second.  Passing the 
           second floor...

           A MECHANIZED RUMBLE.

           They stop the sack’s descent.  Charlie looks down.  A GARAGE 
           DOOR has opened, almost directly below the dangling Tori.

           A black ASTON MARTIN DB9 backs out of the garage.  Stops.  
           The trunk POPS OPEN.  

           Nigel exits the driver’s seat.

           Tori swaying 20 feet overhead.

           Charlie and Underhill wrap the speaker wire around their 
           hands.  It constricts.  It digs in. 

           Ashlynn walks out of the garage carrying luggage.  Puts it in 
           the trunk.  Talks to Nigel for a few moments.  Then goes back 
           into the garage.  Nigel moves to follow.  But then...  

           His phone RINGS.  He stops.  He answers.  HE BEGINS TO TALK.  
           JUST STANDING THERE.  Smack below his pendulous wife.

           The speaker wire digs deeper.  Cutting circulation.  
           Fingertips bulge purple-white.  Charlie and Underhill fight 
           sharp slicing pain.

           They feel it before they see it.  Vibrations shooting up the 
           speaker wire.  Tori is slipping.  
           Slowly sliding out of the sheet sack.  Legs, arms, elbows, 
           knees...everything folding and unfolding and pouring out in 
           slow motion.

           A GASP.  It’s Ashlynn Bratt!  It’s Ashlynn Bratt in the 
           bedroom doorway!  Staring freak-eyed at the stripped and 
           empty bed.  Those strange men at the window.

                                 ASHLYNN BRATT
                        OHMYGOD!  HELP!  HEL--

           --WHAM!  Underhill SLUGS her.  FLAT IN THE FACE.  KNOCKING 
           HER COLD.

           Charlie can’t hold the wire alone.  It buuuuuuuurns through 
           his hands.

           NIGEL

           hears screams.  Looks up.  A plummeting body.  FLATTENS HIM.

           CHARLIE

           looks down.  Sees Nigel and Tori.  Motionless in the alley.

           Underhill stands over an unconscious Ashlynn.  He is sad.  

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I’ve never hit a girl in my life.

           Charlie tosses him something.  Underhill instinctively 
           catches it.  Opens his stinging hand and sees-- 

           A Watermelon Jolly Rancher. 

           EXT. ALLEY - DAY 

           Charlie and Underhill run out of the garage and into the 
           alley.  Tori sleeps comfortably on her husband’s prone body. 

           They lift her.  Stuff her in the back of the Aston Martin.

           Nigel groans.  Eyes fluttering.  Charlie stomps his head.  
           Slams him back to sleep.

           Then he and Underhill slide inside the Aston Martin.  Charlie 
           jams it in gear and fishtails out of the alley at warp speed.

           INT. FBI SEDAN (PARKED) - DAY 

           Ward Oates sits behind the wheel of a tan Chevy Caprice, 
           parked against the curb, next to a field where kids are 
           playing a heated game of blam ball. 

           Oates is pouring LIQUID URETHANE FOAM into a 4-inch length of 
           PCV PIPE.  He caps the pipe and sets it in a cup holder.
           Oates reaches into the HOME DEPOT bag on the passenger seat.  
           Pulls out a cordless, super compact POWER DRILL.  Slaps in 
           the lithium ion battery.  Attaches a 6-inch drill bit.

           He uncaps the plastic pipe.  Now full of hardened foam.  
           Drills a hole clear through the foam center.  Swaps drill 
           bits.  Bores four small holes along the pipe’s side.

           EVIDENCE BAG in the passenger footwell.  Oates retrieves a 
           SWAT-issue, KIMBER CUSTOM II PISTOL from it.  Dabs Krazy Glue 
           around the muzzle.  Affixes the 4-inch pipe.

           He rolls down the window.  He slow pans the gun’s sight 
           across the park: joggers, dog walkers, the blam ball game-- 
           the batter SMACKS the red rubber ball into a HIGH SOARING 
           ARC. Oates tracks its trajectory.  Oates hits the trigger.  
           His pistol WHISPERS FIRE.  The ball EXPLODES ACROSS THE SKY.  

           The kids GASP.  The kids LAUGH.  The batter rounds the bases, 
           arms raised in triumph.  None of them notice the tan Caprice 
           pull away from the curb and speed off down the street.

           INT. SAFE HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           Ken Veritek opens a bottle of water.  Sips.  Fidgets with the 
           cap.  Squeezes it in his hand.  Indents a red ring in his 
           skin.  His eyes darting window to window.  Tall palms sway 
           against a bright sheet of carcinogenic grey.  Nothing else.

           His eyes shift to the floor.  Caroline.  Bound and gaged.  
           Peering up through sweat-matted hair.  Big eyes pleading, 
           locked on Veritek’s Arrowhead bottle.

           Veritek avoids eye contact, moves out of her sight line.

           Caroline turns her body like a compass needle, eye-locks the 
           water bottle once more.

           Veritek moves.  Caroline pivots.  Eye-locks.  Eye-pleads.

           Veritek hangs his head.  Looks through a doorway.  Makes sure 
           Farallon’s still sitting and smoking by the pool.  Takes a 
           knee.  Folds his jacket into a pillow for Caroline’s head.  
           And that’s when we notice: there is a SCREW MISSING from that 
           wall socket cover. 

           KA-CHANK!

           Handcuffs, SNAP-LOCKING, one loop-- around Veritek’s wrist!

           KA-CHUNK!

           Other loop-- on his ankle!
           Veritek is bowed in a Quasimodo hobble.  Staggering.  
           Lopsided.  Circling.  He strains his neck.   Looks up.  Sees 
           a FIST.  Caroline’s.  SMASHING HIS FACE DEAD CENTER.

           The screen FLASHES.  NEURO-SHOCK WHITE.  Veritek hits the 
           floor.  On his back.  An upturned bug.

           Caroline at the door.  Knob twisting.  Hand on her ankle.  
           Veritek’s.  RIPPING HER BACKWARD.  FWOOOSH-CRACK!  MECHANICAL 
           FORCE.  Sprawling her flat.  

           She kicks.  Spastic.  Hits body.  Shoulders.   Face.  Veritek 
           grunts.  Tries to hold her.  Absorbing face kicks.  Can’t. 

           Caroling wriggles free.  On her feet.  STOMPS Veritek’s head.  
           Darts to the door.  Throws it open, and--

           Lee Farallon.  

           On the other side.  Poised on the font stoop.  Aiming his 
           grenade launcher.  Point-bang.

           Caroline GASPS.

           Farallon FIRES.  

           INTO THE SOLAR PLEXUS.  LAUNCHES HER, FLYING, SOARING, BACK 
           INTO THE HOUSE, ON A BALLISTIC TRAJECTORY, ACROSS THE LIVING 
           ROOM AND INTO A WALL...where she seems to stick for a moment, 
           before sliding to the floor in a quivering mound.

           Farallon steps inside.  Cowboy boots clip-clopping on the 
           maple floor.  He cracks his grenade launcher.  He drops the 
           spent shell.  The label on it says BEAN BAG.

           Veritek, face bloody, on his back, body tangled, looks up at 
           Farallon, eyes pleading: unlock me!

           Farallon drops the handcuff key on the floor, several feet 
           beyond Veritek’s reach, and makes him crawl for it.

           EXT. LEMON TREE CORRAL - DAY

           Dale Traxle and FOUR FBI AGENTS stand beside the Coroner’s 
           van.  Traxle is grilling the poor Coroner’s Tech who last saw 
           Oates rummaging through evidence bags.

                                 TRAXLE
                        You just let him waltz away with 
                        two evidence bags?!

                                 TECH
                        I...I thought...he looked like he 
                        was...
                            (deep breath)
                                 (MORE)
                                 TECH (cont'd)
                        Yes.  I did.  Okay.  But let me 
                        explain.  He--

           --Traxle turns his back on the babbling Tech, mid-sentence, 
           and addresses the four agents standing behind him. 

                                 TRAXLE
                        Looks like one of our cowboys has 
                        left the ranch.  Oates is trying to   
                        nab Decker, all by himself.  And 
                        he’ll slide down a razor blade into 
                        a pool of rubbing alcohol to do it.

           A young agent named MIMI HOGAN runs up.

                                 MIMI
                        Quantico just came back with the 
                        identity of Man X. 

           She hands Traxle a file.  He thumbs through it.  Sees the pic 
           of Farallon outside Charlie’s house, along with others that 
           are grainy and old and out of focus.  Traxle’s face darkens.  
           He mumbles something.  One of the agents standing beside him 
           speaks up.

                                 FBI #1
                        Who is it?

           Traxle hands him the folder.  He reads for a second.

                                 FBI #1
                        Lee Farallon?  Lee Farallon is an 
                        actual human?  And he really used 
                        to...he really used to do that?

           Traxle nods once.

                                 FBI #1
                        I always assumed those stories were 
                        bullshit, made up to scare Vegas 
                        cops.
                            (then)
                        Where did he learn to do that?

                                 TRAXLE
                        I’m sure it comes naturally to him, 
                        like other curious things.

                                 MIMI
                        What’s he doing with Decker, 
                        though?

                                 TRAXLE
                        Farallon spent the last 30 years 
                        working for Stanton Galvan.

                                 TRAXLE (cont'd)
                        But Galvan shot himself last 
                        Christmas when the chemo didn’t 
                        take.  His half-wit son is running 
                        things now.

                                 FBI #2
                        Running them straight into the 
                        ground, from what I hear.

                                 TRAXLE
                        Wouldn’t surprise me if Farallon 
                        jumped ship and hooked up with an 
                        industrious boy like Decker.

                                 MIMI
                        But Decker has no prior history of 
                        Farallon-scale violence. 

                                 TRAXLE
                        That’s the funny thing about 
                        people, Mimi.  They always seem to 
                        be changing into murdering pieces 
                        of shit.

           EXT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY 

           The safe house sits alone atop a windswept hill.  No other 
           man-made structures in sight.  A red GMC utility van stops at 
           the hill’s base.  The doors open.  3 MEN and 1 WOMAN exit.  
           SUB-MACHINEGUNS and Rolex dive watches.  The driver leaves 
           the key in the ignition.  Leaves the engine running.

           THE ASSASSINS rack their weapons.  Then move up the hill, low 
           and fast through the brush

           INT. SAFE HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           Veritek holds a Ziploc bag filled with ice cubes to his head.  
           Sips a new bottle of water. 

           Caroline is on the floor again.  Hog-tied with handcuffs, 
           same as before.  Only now she is thoroughly shredded.

                                 VERITEK
                        You still...want some water?

           Her eyes burn up at him.  Nevertheless, he kneels beside her, 
           gently peels the duct tape off her mouth.  Twist-wipes the 
           water bottle clean on his shirt.  Holds it to her lips so she 
           can drink.  She resists for a few moments.  But then gives 
           in, gulping mouthfuls.  He pulls the bottle back.

                                 VERITEK
                        Don’t...not too fast.  You’ll make 
                        your stomach sick.
                            (pause)
                        Trust me.  I know from experience.

                                 VERITEK (cont'd)
                        I used to be a fighter.  A 
                        professional one, if you can 
                        believe that.

           He holds the bottle back to her mouth.  She sips.

                                 VERITEK
                        This I am not a professional at.  I 
                        am not...  If it were up to me, I’d 
                        let you go right now, but....
                            (then)
                        You see I owe a lot of money and...  
                        A lot of money.  And this 
                        friend.... This friend I’ve had 
                        since second grade, he said if I 
                        did some work for him he’d... 
                        Forget it...it’s meaningless.  I 
                        just want you to know that I will 
                        not hurt you.  I don’t hurt people 
                        like that.  Never in my life.  
                            (then)
                        Things might go crazy...and seem 
                        crazy...very soon.  But we’re about 
                        to get out of this, okay?  Trust 
                        me.  You are going to be okay.  We 
                        both are.  Okay? 

           He takes the bottle from her mouth.  Wipes her chin with his 
           shirt sleeve.  Puts the ice pack back on his forehead

                                 VERITEK
                        By the way, you hit like a fuckin’ 
                        mule kick.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I know.

           EXT. SAFE HOUSE/POOL DECK - DAY 

           Farallon sits on a deck chair.  Legs crossed.  Face oozing 
           cigarette smoke.  Expression remote as a Jupiter moon. 

           A group of crows SQUAWK, somewhere nearby, then flap over the 
           tall shrub hedge which surrounds the backyard.

           Farallon snaps alert.  What disturbed those birds?

           He stands.  Grabbing his shoulder rig off a side table.  Pans 
           his head 180 degrees.  Hears something.  Soft and rustling.  
           Beyond the hedge wall.  But he can’t see.  Zero visibility 
           through the calligraphic squiggles of twigs and little green 
           leaves.  He loads one of his customized, super-shotugn-like 
           SPREAD SHELLS into his grenade launcher.  He whispers: 

                                 FARALLON
                        Close your eyes.  Close them tight.
           ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEDGE WALL, 

           the 4 assassins have the backyard surrounded.  Flat on their 
           stomachs.  ASSASSIN #1 snakes a FIBER OPTIC SPY CAMERA 
           through the hedge.  Sees the pool deck: void of humans.  The 
           sliding glass door to the house: wide open.  

           Assassin #1 hand signals the other three.  Then stands.  Back 
           flush against the hedge wall.  He boosts his three fellow 
           assassins over the hedge.  They land ninja silent on-- 

           THE POOL DECK

           They move toward the open glass door in stealth mode.  
           Skirting the perimeter of the pool.  

           They hear a gentle splash.  They stop.  They look down.  

           The old man laying flat on the bottom of the pool is a murky 
           outline.  His grenade launcher barely breaking the surface of 
           black rain water.

           BWAAAAAAAM!  SPREAD SHOT.

           BLASTWAVE OF BALL BEARINGS.  Liquefies all three assassins.  
           Gouges out ten pounds of pool wall.  

           ASSASSIN #1

           on the other side of the hedge, saw this on his fiber optic 
           spy cam.  He takes off at top speed.  Bolting down the hill.

           FARALLON

           waist deep in the concrete swamp, glimpses the fleeing 
           assassin, through small holes blasted in the hedge. 

           Farallon slosh-charges out of the pool.  Heaves his grenade 
           launcher.  Onto the roof of the single story house.  

           He leaps onto the wrought iron table, then on top of the pool 
           shed, then, finally, onto the roof of the house, wet boots 
           skidding, knee scuffing, knocking clay tiles loose. 

           The last assassin is a dot.  Speeding down the barren 
           hillside.  Farallon cracks his grenade launcher.  Loads a 
           standard, explosive FRAG shell.  Extends the butt stock.  
           Unfolds the ladder sight.  Aims...aims... 

           BLOOP!

           The shell flies invisibly.  Silently.  For almost 2 seconds.

           Farallon sees the assassin vaporize before he hears the 
           echoing pop.
           INT. SAFE HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Veritek lies on the floor, shielding Caroline with his body.

           Farallon enters the living room, dripping wet, grenade 
           launcher curling smoke.

           Veritek’s face drops--  Farallon is still alive!

                                 VERITEK
                        What...happened?

                                 FARALLON
                        Double cross. 

                                 VERITEK
                        What...?  What do we do?

           Farallon reloads his launcher, flips the breach shut with a 
           solid metal CRUNCH.

                                 FARALLON
                        Triple cross.

           INT. ASTON MARTIN (MOVING) - DAY

           Charlie drives.  Underhill shotgun.  Tori Miles dead asleep 
           in the backseat.  Underhill shakes her, to no avail. 

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I think she’s in a vegetative coma.  

           Charlie’s cell rings.  Caller ID: Caroline’s face.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey, shut up.
                            (he answers)
                        Hello?

           INTERCUT - Farallon

           in the living room of the safe house.  Caroline bound on the 
           floor behind him.  Veritek on a knee next to her.

                                 FARALLON
                        Charlie Decker?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m listening.

                                 FARALLON
                        Sundown.  El Mirage Cemetery.  
                        Victorville.  Be there.

           Click.  Call’s over.  Charlie checks his watch.
                                 UNDERHILL
                        What’d they say?

                                 CHARLIE
                        We have 3 hours and 29 minutes to 
                        get to Victorville and trade 
                        something we do not have for 
                        Caroline’s life.

                                 UNDERHILL
                            (looks back at Tori)
                        What if we bought an air horn, and 
                        blasted it right in her ear?  That 
                        would wake anyone up.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Or we could crash her head between 
                        two gigantic cymbals.  
                            (then)
                        This isn’t a Tom & Jerry cartoon.  
                        There is something chemical keeping 
                        that girl asleep.  We need to 
                        inject her with saline, or try 
                        smelling salts.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        What if we threw her in a freezing 
                        cold swimming pool?

                                 CHARLIE
                        She’d drown.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        What if we electrocuted her? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Stop talking.  We’re going to Rite 
                        Aid.  We are going to Rite Aid and 
                        buying smelling salts. 

                                 UNDERHILL
                        But we just passed a Big 5 Sporting 
                        Goods two blocks ago.

                                 CHARLIE
                        So fuckin’ what?

                                 UNDERHILL
                        They sell air horns.

           This sentence hangs in the air a moment.
                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s amazing I actually used to 
                        feel bad about leaving you in Vegas 
                        like I did.  Now I’m just upset you 
                        were never hit and killed by a bus.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I’m just trying to help...to make 
                        things up to you, you know...

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh, you think there’s something you 
                        can pull from the depths of your 
                        mongoloid brain that can make up 
                        for what you’ve done today? 

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I thought...I thought maybe, back 
                        there, when you gave me the Jolly 
                        Rancher, that that was--

                                 CHARLIE
                        --There is nothing, nothing you can 
                        ever do that will...
                            (pause)
                        Fuck it.  Forget it.  You’re an 
                        idiot.
                            (then)
                        ...jolly ranchers...  Goddamn 
                        bullshit.  You don’t deserve it 
                        anyway.  Give it back.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I...ate it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Of course you did.  Retards crave 
                        candy.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I am not retarded.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What were you doing with Blatch, 
                        then?  Solving geometry problems?

                                 UNDERHILL
                        We had a good plan when we started.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Which was...?

                                 UNDERHILL
                        We were....
                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes...?

                                 UNDERHILL
                        We were gonna rob a casino.

           Charlie can’t help but laugh.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I suppose you were gonna assemble a 
                        crack team of rakish dickheads to 
                        help you.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        It could have worked.  With the 
                        money from selling that car, we 
                        could have set up a major score.  
                        We would have been bigger than you 
                        and me ever were.  We would have 
                        been legends.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Brad Shit and George Assfuck.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Fuck you.  You know how many people 
                        I asked to help me move that car?  
                        You were the only one stupid enough 
                        to agree.  You were the only one 
                        stupid enough to believe it 
                        actually came from a valet at the 
                        Mandalay Bay.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You think I didn’t suspect 
                        anything?  I was trying to be a 
                        good friend.  That’s what I’m 
                        stupid for doing.  A fuckin’ loser 
                        like you could never get anything 
                        past me.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Oh, really?

           Underhill pulls out a watermelon Jolly Rancher.  Holds it 
           aloft like a prized ruby.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        I was saving it for later.

           Underhill unwraps it with a flourish.  Pops it in his mouth. 

           Charlie SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.  The car SCREECHES.  Shimmies.  
           Stops.  In the middle of Moorpark.  Charlie starts WAILING ON 
           UNDERHILL.  Awkward, oblique, seat belt-hampered punches to 
           the head and chest.  Underhill tries to block.  
           Tries to hit back.  Both men screaming, swearing.  Flood of 
           motorists honking, weaving around the Aston Martin.  When a 
           VOICE rises over the din... 

                                 VOICE
                        Guys...guys...guys...guys!

           Charlie and Underhill ease down their assaults, heads turning 
           in unison toward the backseat, where Tori Miles is sitting 
           up, WIDE AWAKE, staring bright-eyed at them.

                                 TORI MILES
                        There’re better ways to vent your 
                        anger, you know.  Whenever I get 
                        super mad, I just always remind 
                        myself: “I’m sucking these big 
                        black cocks for you, daddy.”  

           EXT. WATTS/STREET - DAY 

           The FBI sedan parks.  Against a curb.  On a residential 
           street in Watts, California.

           INT. FBI SEDAN - DAY 

           Ward Oates flips open a wallet from an evidence bag.  Name on 
           the drivers license: CHAUNCEY DEAKENS.  Who we recognize as 
           one of the JACKBOYS from the Showdown at the Lemon Tree 
           Corral.  Oates crosschecks the address on the ID with the 
           address on a house across the way.  It’s a match.  So he--

           EXITS THE CAR

           Pops the trunk.  Pulls out a long, grey DUSTER COAT.  Puts it 
           on.  Checks chamber on his silenced .45.  Slips it in his hip 
           holster.  SLAMS the trunk.  Turns.  THREE BOYS, maybe 14 
           years old, stand watching him.  Nervous after seeing the gun.

                                 OATES
                        Don’t even think about fuckin’ up 
                        this car.

           He flashes his counterfeit LAPD badge.

                                 OATES
                        Know what this is?  This is a 
                        license to kill car-fuckeruppers.

           Oates takes a quick step toward them.  The boys run off at 
           top speed.  Oates feels pretty good about himself.

           A DOORBELL

           Oates rings it.  Waiting on the front porch of a little two 
           story house.
           The door opens a crack.  A young man named JAMES DEAKENS 
           peers over a chain lock.

                                 DEAKENS
                        Fuck you want?

           Oates badges him.

                                 OATES
                        My name is Detective Rules.  Do you 
                        know a Chauncey Deakens?

           Silence.  Blank stare.

                                 OATES
                        Chauncey is in a great deal of 
                        danger.  I need your help to get 
                        him out of it.

           More silence.  More blank staring.

                                 OATES
                        You don’t feel like talking, that’s 
                        fine.  I’d be happy to arrest you 
                        right now, question you at the 
                        station.

                                 DEAKENS
                        Arrest me for what?

                                 OATES
                        For inhuman stupidity.  I smell 
                        enough weed in there to float a 
                        zeppelin.  
                            (then)
                        Do you know what a zeppelin is?

                                 DEAKENS
                        Motherfuckin’ dirigible.

                                 OATES
                        That’s right.  So, what’s it gonna 
                        be?

           Pause.  Deakens hangs his head, mutters:

                                 DEAKENS
                        ...fuckin’ bullshit...

           He opens the door fully, allowing Oates--

           INSIDE THE HOUSE

           There’s a couch, a coffee table, and a 60” TV, on which is a 
           paused game of NCAA FOOTBALL 09.  TWO YOUNG THUGS sit on the 
           couch holding Xbox controllers.  They are MARVIN and TRACY.  
                                 MARVIN
                        Fuck is he?

           Oates flashes his badge.

                                 OATES
                        I’m that sinking feeling in your 
                        stomach.

           Marvin’s eyes go from the badge, to the gigantic Skeletor 
           bong on the coffee table.

           Deakens, standing beside Oates, gets a good hard look at the 
           badge.  His eyes narrow.

                                 DEAKENS
                        It’s cool, Marvin.  He just wants 
                        to ask some questions about 
                        Chauncey.  It’s cool.
                            (then, to Oates)
                        So what you wanna know?

                                 OATES
                        It seems Chauncey has gotten 
                        himself involved with a thief.  A 
                        very dangerous thief named Charlie 
                        Decker.  And I need to know--

                                 DEAKENS
                        --Charlie Decker?

                                 OATES
                        You know him?

                                 DEAKENS
                        Motherfucker was just through here.

           Oates’ pupils flare.

                                 OATES
                        When?

                                 DEAKENS
                        Couple hours ago.  Needin’ money 
                        and shit.

           Tracy and Marvin share a look: what the fuck is Deakens 
           talking about?

                                 OATES
                        Do you know where he is now?

                                 DEAKENS
                        No.  But I know where to reach him 
                        at.  He left a number.  I can call 
                        him and try to find out.
                                 OATES
                        You would do that?

                                 DEAKENS
                        Shit yeah.  I barely know the 
                        motherfucker.  I ain’t going out 
                        for his ass.
                            (then)
                        Hold up.  Number’s on the fridge.

           Deakens walks into the kitchen.  Oates stuffs his hands in 
           his coat pockets, looks at the Xbox 360, the Wii, and the 
           Playstation 3, all lined up next to each other below the TV.

                                 OATES
                        You guys like Metroid?

           Marvin and Tracy nod/shrug.  Deakens speaks from the kitchen.

                                 DEAKENS (O.S.)
                        I got a question for you now, 
                        though.

           When Deakens walks out of the kitchen, the hammer on his .44 
           BULLDOG PISTOL is already cocked.  He’s got Oates dead bang 
           locked.

                                 DEAKENS
                        Why is your picture taped onto that 
                        motherfuckin’ badge?
                            (then)
                        You know you fucked up, right?

           Oates smiles.  Oates chuckles.  Deakens smiles.  Deakens 
           chuckles.  Even Tracy and Marvin join in, smiling then 
           chuckling.  The room swells with strange, giddy laughter.  

           Until Oates’ duster coat WHISPERS FIRE.  And Deakens’ THUMB 
           BLOWS OFF.  And his gun clatters.  Then another WHISPER.  And 
           another thumb disappears.  Dropping Deakens to his knees.

           Marvin and Tracy are running.  Oates’ coat whips open.  His 
           hand runs through a slit in his coat pocket.  Allowing him 
           covert access to his pistol.  Which he FIRES again.  BLASTING 
           Tracy’s head out.

           Marvin bolts upstairs.  Silent shot.  SPLINTERS BANISTER 
           WOOD.  Microseconds after he dashes above ceiling level.  

           Oates hears Marvin’s footsteps.  Oates aims up at the sound.  
           Oates UNLOADS.  There is a muffled THUD.  

           And blood POURS through ceiling holes.  
           Oates sidesteps the red waterfall, stands over Deakens, who 
           is trying to pick up his pistol with a pair of thumbless 
           hands.  Oates kicks the gun away.  Kneels.  Aims.  Silencer 
           plastic hits Deakens’ groin. 

                                 DEAKENS
                        ...please...I don’t...I don’t even 
                        know no Charlie Decker...I...

                                 OATES
                        Chauncey did.

                                 DEAKENS
                        Chauncey don’t live here no more.  
                        He don’t--

                                 OATES
                        --Where did he live?

                                 DEAKENS
                        He...he stay up in Bel Air...with 
                        Tat Spector...

           Oates eyes flare again, bigger this time.

                                 OATES
                        Tat Spector?  Tat Spector and 
                        Charlie Decker have joined forces?

                                 DEAKENS
                        Man, I told you...  I don’t even 
                        know no--

           --THWAP!  Oates shoots him through the mouth.

           EXT. MULHOLLAND DR. - NIGHT 

           The SPYKER C8 TURBO-BOOSTS around a blind curve, ACCELERATING 
           RIGHT AT US.  The car SNARLS.  SKIDDING off the road.  Flying 
           up, into a banking hillside, then down, skipping across the 
           road, BATTER-RAMMING a metal guard rail, beyond which is a 98 
           foot drop into the midnight depths of Studio City.    

           The rail holds.  The Spyker backs up and stops.  GILBERT 
           BLATCH ejecting through the driver’s door, cackling like a 
           monkey in a banana factory. 

                                 BLATCH
                        Now that was awesome!

           He zips up his pants.  Tori Miles staggers from the passenger 
           side, vibrating with terror. 

                                 TORI MILES
                        Fucking asshole! 
                                 BLATCH
                        What’s wrong?

                                 TORI MILES
                        You almost killed us!  You’re lucky 
                        I didn’t accidently bite your dick 
                        off!

                                 BLATCH
                        Oh please.  We’re both 
                        professionals.  Me at driving, and 
                        you at slobbin’ fuckin’ knobs.

           Flat tire.  Blatch kicks it.  Pops the trunk.  Opens the 
           donut tire compartment.  Lifts the tire out.  Freezes.  
           Stares.  At the strange compartment underneath.  There is a 
           lock on the stainless steel lid.  Blatch pulls a compact .357 
           Magnum from an ankle holster.  BLASTS the lock.

           Tori Miles, who is now standing on the side of the road with 
           her thumb out, jumps at the sound.

           Blatch slowly lifts the stainless steel lid.  A hiss as the 
           vacuum seal breaks.  And just as we are about to see what’s 
           inside, we CUT TO:

           TORI MILES

           in the back of the parked Aston Martin, relating her story to 
           Charlie and Underhill.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What was it?

                                 TORI MILES
                        He wouldn’t say.  After that, he 
                        seemed kinda...weird.  Which was 
                        weird...spooky.  He just wanted to 
                        know if I knew anyone who would be 
                        interested in buying something that 
                        was like majorly expensive.  So I 
                        took him here.

           Charlie looks out the window.  They are parked in front of a 
           sprawling, walled estate in Bel Air.

                                 CHARLIE
                        How do you know someone like Tat 
                        Spector?

                                 TORI MILES
                        He’s always paying for girls to 
                        come over, to just hang out and 
                        party with.  He loves me.  I’ll get 
                        us in there...tell him what 
                        happened.  He’s a great guy.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 TORI MILES (cont'd)
                        Whatever it is, he’ll give it back 
                        to you.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Tori, a man like Tat Spector isn’t 
                        gonna give me shit but a bullet to 
                        the brain.

                                 TORI MILES
                        No.  You don’t know the real Tat.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Are you sure you know what you’re 
                        even saying?  Because the stories 
                        I’ve heard...

                                 TORI MILES
                        I’m not stupid, okay?  I finished 
                        three semesters at Cal State 
                        Fullerton.  I’m aware of the world 
                        around me.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Twenty minutes ago you were a 
                        drugged-out zombie who I dropped 
                        out of a window.

                                 TORI MILES
                        I don’t do drugs.  I only take 
                        stuff to help me sleep...and for 
                        anxiety attacks...and for my 
                        restless leg syndrome.  But nothing 
                        real.

           Charlie raises an eyebrow.

                                 TORI MILES
                        Listen, trust me...you tell Tat 
                        about your wife, just like you told 
                        me...  His heart will dissolve.  
                        He’ll help you, I promise.  The man 
                        is a complete sweetheart.

           EXT. TAT SPECTOR’S MANSION/BACKYARD - DAY 

           TAT SPECTOR (35.  NBA tall.  Flannel suit.  Huge, perfectly 
           round afro) stands on a flagstone patio.  He is flanked by 
           BODYGUARDS, all of whom wield platinum plated AK-47 
           machineguns.  Partygoers hangout everywhere.  Music thumps.  
           Girls slink through the crowd, some carrying trays of burgers 
           and hotdogs and opaque plastics cups overflowing with ice-
           cold Miller High Life.  

           FRONT GATE

           Charlie, Underhill, and Tori Miles walk through the front 
           gate and onto Tat Spector’s 100-meter-long driveway.
           Tori smiles at the GUARD in the booth beside the gate.

                                 TORI MILES
                        Thanks, Reggie.

           Old cars line the driveway, all the way up to the house.  
           Many are dimpled with rusty bullet holes.  Tori points to 
           these cars like a tour guide.

                                 TORI MILES
                        This is Tat’s car museum.  He 
                        collects cars from famous American 
                        crimes and displays them for all 
                        his guests to marvel at.

           She points to a very old, gunfire-saturated Ford V8.

                                 TORI MILES
                        That one was Bonnie and Clyde’s.

           BACKYARD

           Tat feels a finger poke his ribs.  He looks over and down and 
           sees Tori Miles standing there, in her footie pajamas, beside 
           two strange white men.

                                 TORI MILES
                        Hi, Tat.

                                 TAT SPECTOR
                        Who are they?  More bitch-ass 
                        tricks fittin’ to sell me shit? 

                                 TORI MILES
                        No, no, no.  They’re....
                            (turns to Charlie)
                        What are your names again?

                                 TAT SPECTOR
                        Whoa.  Whoa.  Trudie...  

                                 TORI MILES
                        Tori.

                                 TAT SPECTOR
                        Don’t be bringin’ motherfuckers 
                        through you don’t even know their 
                        Goddamn names.

                                 TORI MILES
                        But I--

                                 TAT SPECTOR
                        --Where you know ‘em from?
                                 TORI MILES
                        They just kidnapped me, but...

           Tat shakes his head in disgust.  Charlie steps in.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Mr. Spector.  It’s not what you--

           --Tat waves a finger.  A bodyguard SLAMS the butt of his 
           Platinum AK into Charlie’s face.  Drops him cold.

           EXT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           We see the world as GLOWING BLOBS OF COLOR.  Hot reds phasing 
           into cool blues, and all the gradations between, a 
           CinemaScope landscape of this, panning from left to right.

           Lee Farallon is crouched on the roof of the safe house, HEAT 
           VISION GOGGLES strapped to his face, like a Medieval Gargoyle 
           with electric eyes.  Scanning miles of desolate hills for 
           enemies.  Grenade launcher resting on his shoulder. 

           INT. SAFE HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Caroline bound on the floor.  Veritek on his cell, talking 
           low and fast.  

                                 VERITEK
                        He thinks you meant to kill both of 
                        us.  His plan is to sell the 
                        package, split the profits with me, 
                        and then, as he put it, 
                        dematerialize.  He already set the 
                        meeting place with Decker.  

           INTERCUT - Francis Galvan

           on the phone in his office, pacing in and out of FRAME.

                                 GALVAN
                        Where is it?  When?

                                 VERITEK
                        Someplace...  El Mirage Cemetery.  
                        Near Victorville.  At sundown.

                                 GALVAN
                        Cock.  Sucker.

                                 VERITEK
                        You know, at this point, I think 
                        you should just be happy you’re 
                        getting back fifty percent of 
                        whatever this shit is worth.
                                 GALVAN
                        Bro, if I don’t get the genuine 
                        article back by tomorrow night, I 
                        am a dead man.

                                 VERITEK
                        What are you talking about?  What 
                        is in this package?  Plutonium?  
                        The body of a dead alien?

                                 GALVAN
                        It’s a skull.

                                 VERITEK
                        A skull?

                                 GALVAN
                        The skull of a man named Jesus 
                        Malverde. 

                                 VERITEK
                        Who the fuck is Jesus Malverde?

                                 GALVAN
                        To you and me, he is no one.  But 
                        to the the Mexican Mafia chieftains 
                        who are expecting to pick up the 
                        skull tomorrow night, Jesus is God.
                            (then)
                        Sounds stupid, but these fuckin’ 
                        beaners from Culiacan are fanatical 
                        about him.  He was some sort of 
                        folk hero bandit.  Hundred years 
                        ago.  Has shrines all over Mexico.  
                        Drug runners pray to him like he’s 
                        their narco-saint.  They leave him 
                        stacks of dope and money.  Some 
                        leave Ferraris. 
                            (then)
                        You see, there is a massive network 
                        of Mexican drug smugglers that has 
                        always been closed off to the white 
                        man.  But Daddy knew that if 
                        someone were to offer these 
                        smugglers the lost skull of Jesus 
                        Malverde, gringo or not, they would 
                        accept him as one of their own.  
                        It’s a relationship that is 
                        potentially worth hundreds of 
                        millions of dollars.  For years my 
                        dad had men scouring North Western 
                        Mexico for this nonsense.  But 
                        then, just last week...
                            (then)
                        To be safe we snuck it over the 
                        border using one of our French 
                        Connection cars.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 GALVAN (cont'd)
                        But someone must have talked.  
                        Tipped off Decker.  And now...If 
                        these guys arrive and find me 
                        without a skull...  They don’t have 
                        a sense of humor about this shit.  
                        Mexicans love a bloodbath.  
                        Farallon knows this.
                            (then)
                        You have to stop him.  You have to 
                        kill him.  Soon as possible.

                                 VERITEK
                        No fuckin’ way, Francis.  I don’t 
                        even have a gun.

                                 GALVAN
                        He’s old as fuck.  You’re a Goddamn 
                        wrecking machine.  Go put your fist 
                        through his head and call me back. 

                                 VERITEK
                        Can’t you give them a fake skull?

                                 GALVAN
                        A man tried that once, to gain 
                        access to the smuggling network.  
                        Cops found this man and his family 
                        nailed to the walls of their living 
                        room. 
                            (then)
                        Plus the skull’s face is bonded in 
                        Aztec gold with red diamonds set in 
                        each eye socket.  Hard to fake.

                                 VERITEK
                        Send more assassins.

                                 GALVAN
                        You know how much money you owe me? 
                        All I’ve done for you...?

                                 VERITEK
                        How...how about I grab the skull 
                        from Decker and run?  Just run away 
                        with it before Farallon knows 
                        what’s happening?  I’m fast.  I’ll--

                                 GALVAN
                        --Goddamn it, Kenny!
                            (then)
                        If you don’t kill Farallon and stop 
                        this... They are going to crucify 
                        me.  Do you understand?

                                 VERITEK
                                 GALVAN
                        Kenny?!

                                 VERITEK
                        Yes.  Yes.  I understand.  I got 
                        it. 

                                 GALVAN
                        Do you?  Then call me when it’s 
                        done.

           Click.  End of call.  Then...  

           FOOTSTEPS.  From above.  Farallon moving across the roof.  
           Veritek stares at the ceiling.  It’s quiet again.

           INT. CHAUNCEY DEAKENS’ HOUSE - DAY

           Chauncey Deakens’ living room.  Fresh crime scene area.  
           Clockwork of LAPD.

           Dale Traxle and his FBI team enter.  Immune to the gore.  
           Traxle approaches the OFFICER IN CHARGE.

                                 OFFICER IN CHARGE
                        Girlfriend called it in.  Came back 
                        from Smart & Final and found ‘em.
                            (then)
                        All three victims were known 
                        associates of Tat Spector. 

                                 TRAXLE
                        Where are the witnesses?

           EXT. CHAUNCEY DEAKENS’ HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY

           THREE TEENAGE BOYS, the ones Oates frightened away from his 
           car, stand with some cops near a detached garage.

           Traxle pulls a picture from his pocket: Ward Oates, grinning 
           by a lake, holding a large mouth bass next to his head.

                                 TRAXLE
                        Look at this closely.  Look hard.  
                        Is this the man you saw?

           The kids look hard.  The kids nod.

                                 TRAXLE
                        This is the man who identified 
                        himself to you as a Los Angeles 
                        police officer and then entered 
                        this house?  You are sure?

                                 KID #1
                        That’s him.  I remember.
                                 KID #2
                        He had that smile even.

           Traxle puts his palm on his forehead.  Shuts his eyes.  
           Thinks.  Then talks, without removing his palm or opening his 
           eyes.

                                 TRAXLE
                        Mimi, get HRT.  I want a tactical 
                        assembly at Tat Spector’s house in 
                        ten minutes.  If Oates tracked 
                        Decker here, he is going there.

           Mimi whips out her phone.  Traxle opens his eyes.  Sees the 
           teenage boys still standing there.

                                 TRAXLE
                        Get these kids out of here.

           A cop escorts them off.  As they go, Traxle notices BRIGHT 
           ORANGE SPLOTCHES on the cuffs of the kid’s shirt sleeves.  He 
           points this out to the officer in charge.

                                 TRAXLE
                        What’s all that orange shit on ‘em?

                                 OFFICER IN CHARGE
                        That’s spray paint.

           EXT. TAT SPECTOR’S MANSION - DAY

           The FBI sedan pulls to a stop.  Across the street from Tat 
           Spector’s house gate.  SPRAY PAINTED on the sedan’s hood in 
           big thick DayGlo-orange letters: HOMO COP.

           Oates exits the defaced car.  Walks to the GUARD BOOTH beside 
           the house gate.  Reggie the guard inside.  Oates flashes his 
           LAPD badge for a microsecond.

                                 OATES
                        My name is Detective Rules.  I need 
                        to speak to Mr. Spector.

                                 REGGIE
                        Can I see your badge again, please, 
                        sir?

                                 OATES
                        What for?

                                 REGGIE
                        I barely got a look at it.

           Oates just stands there.
           INT. TAT SPECTOR’S MANSION/STUDY - DAY

           Charlie lies on a couch.  Unconscious.  Bloody bandage on his 
           forehead.

           SOMETHING inches INTO FRAME, right beside Charlie’s head.  
           Right beside Charlie’s EAR.  This something unleashes a 
           SHOCKWAVE OF SOUND.  

           Charlie’s eyes SNAP OPEN.  Whole body JERKING like an 
           electrocuted frog leg.  He sees Tat Spector, two bodyguards, 
           and Tori Miles standing over him, fingers in their ears, all 
           gravely concerned.

                                 TORI MILES
                        He’s awake!  He’s awake!

           The SOUND CUTS OFF.  Charlie slowly sits up.  Tat giving him 
           some help.  Charlie feels the bandage on his forehead, then 
           blinks at Underhill, who is kneeling beside him, holding an 
           AIR HORN. 

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Told you it would work.

           EXT. TAT SPECTOR’S MANSION - DAY

           Dale Traxle and his 5-man team, now joined by 8 HRT COMMANDOS 
           in HARD-SHELL ARMOR, stand outside the guard booth.  Guard 
           Reggie is a bloody, bullet-riddled mess on the floor.  Mimi 
           checks Reggie’s pulse.  Shakes her head: stone dead. 

           Traxle looks at Oates’ defaced sedan, then at his team.

                                 TRAXLE
                        Ward Oates might be the best 
                        gunfighter alive...and he has gone 
                        totally insane.  If you have to 
                        shoot, shoot to kill.  Go for the 
                        shit shot and he will drop you like 
                        a fuckin’ penny.

           EXT. TAT SPECTOR’S MANSION/BACKYARD - DAY

           Oates moseys into the massive backyard party scene.

           INT. TAT SPECTOR’S MANSION/STUDY - DAY

           Charlie sits on the couch.  In Tat’s study.  Still a bit 
           dazed.  Sipping a can of Coke.  Tat Spector, two bodyguards, 
           Tori Miles, and Underhill stand over him.

                                 TAT SPECTOR
                        Don’t you worry ‘bout a thing.
                            (motions to Underhill)
                                 (MORE)
                                 TAT SPECTOR (cont'd)
                        He explained everything while you 
                        was knocked out.  Talked me out of 
                        killing both you on the spot.

                                 CHARLIE
                        He did?
                            (then)
                        How?

                                 TAT SPECTOR
                        He’s gotta be one of the craftiest 
                        motherfuckers alive.

           Charlie gives Underhill a look.  Underhill shrugs.

           A third bodyguard enters.  Hands Tat a BLACK, HARD-SHELL 
           PORSCHE SUITCASE, with a collapsible handle and rollers, 
           small enough to be a carry on item.

                                 TAT SPECTOR
                        Got the shit the fatso sold me in 
                        here.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        What is it?

           Tat opens the case.  Inside, snugly secured in neoprene 
           packing foam, is the skull of Jesus Malverde.  Face a gold 
           devil’s mask.  Eyes flaming diamonds.  White jawbone frozen 
           in a gaping, gold-fanged death howl.  Charlie is speechless.

                                 TAT SPECTOR
                        Means nothing to you, right?  
                        Didn’t to the fat boy, neither.  He 
                        thought it was just some fancy 
                        fuckin’ museum junk.  Low-balled 
                        him at two hundred thousand.  But 
                        to folks in my line of work...folks 
                        who know things...  Well, it’s a 
                        long story, but this skull is the 
                        key to some highly profitable 
                        business relationships...worth 
                        millions.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sounds like you might be reluctant 
                        to part with it.

                                 TAT SPECTOR
                        If I have one weakness, it’s 
                        empathy.  I’ve had my fair share of 
                        bitches kidnapped from me.  Worst 
                        pain there is.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 TAT SPECTOR (cont'd)
                        So, I’m prepared to return it to 
                        you, right now, temporarily, on one 
                        condition: I want you to allow me 
                        and a squad of my most evil-hearted 
                        niggers to follow you out to the 
                        drop, size-up the motherfuckers who 
                        snatched your wife, and then, when 
                        the time is right... We will swarm 
                        down on them like a jigaboo jihad.

           Just then, TWO MORE BODYGUARDS exit an open, walk-in CLOSET, 
           which has been converted into a small ARMORY.  RACKS of 
           pistols and machineguns stretch back and out of sight.  The 
           BODYGUARDS are wearing Kevlar vests, replete with HUGE AMMO 
           CLIPS, and carrying M4 CARBINE MACHINEGUNS.  They hand out 
           GUNS and VESTS to the other bodyguards.

                                 TAT SPECTOR
                        So...what you say to that?

           Charlie thinks.  Extends his hand.  Tat shakes it once.

                                 TAT SPECTOR
                        Fuck yeah.

           INT. SAFE HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Veritek paces.  Wringing his giant hands.  Caroline bound on 
           the floor.  Farallon’s footsteps on the roof.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Listen to me.  The man is insane.  
                        You can’t trust a word he says.  He 
                        is going to kill both of us if you 
                        don’t do something.

           Veritek continues to pace, seemingly oblivious.

                                 CAROLINE
                        You might not be a professional at 
                        this.  But I am.  If you don’t do 
                        something, we are fucked.

                                 VERITEK
                        I know...I know....

                                 CAROLINE
                        You don’t have to kill him.  Just 
                        knock him out.  And we’ll make a 
                        run for it.

                                 VERITEK
                        It’s not...It’s not that easy.  I 
                        do that, my best friend will die.  
                        People will come after me.  I can’t 
                        just run away.
                                 CAROLINE
                        I don’t know him, but I promise 
                        you: your best friend is a piece of 
                        shit who deserves death.  Listen... 
                        If you help me, me and my 
                        husband...we can protect you.  We 
                        know people.  We have a house we 
                        keep in Peru for this kind of 
                        thing.  We could get you there...

           Veritek stops pacing, looks down at her.

                                 CAROLINE
                        It’s easy to disappear.  Trust me.  
                        I did it as a kid.  All it takes is 
                        the right motivation.  Like your 
                        step dad trying to pour Drano down 
                        your throat.  Or your best friend 
                        throwing you to the wolves.    

                                 VERITEK
                        I need to think about this, okay?

                                 CAROLINE
                        There’s no time to think, Goddamn 
                        it!  You have to get your fuckin’ 
                        head out of your ass and--

           --Veritek puts the duct tape back over her mouth.

                                 VERITEK
                        Just let me think, okay?  Sorry.  
                        I...I just need time to think.  

           EXT. TAT SPECTOR’S MANSION/BACKYARD - DAY

           Oates.  Amid the massive backyard party.  Searching for Tat.  
           Then, quite suddenly, Oates freezes in place.

           The first HRT OPERATOR he sees is at the far end of the yard, 
           near the tennis court.  Oates knows where the others will be.  
           Seven more of them.  Hidden behind bushes and trees.  Arrayed 
           in a tactical perimeter.  A semi-circle of trained, expert 
           killers drawn across the unpopulated outskirts of the yard.  

           Oates knows they don’t see him yet.  So he pulls his pistol.  
           Partially draping his coat over it.  Takes subtle aim at the 
           HRT operator near the tennis court.  About to fire... 

                                 TRAXLE
                        EVERYONE DOWN!!  DOWN! DOWN! DOWN!

           Some partygoers mumble confused.  Most don’t seem to care.
           Oates turns, just his head, sees Traxle and his team, maybe 
           25 meters away, speeding at him, in SLOW MOTION, close to the 
           house, guns up.  They have no shot.  Too many people in the 
           way.

           Oates locks eyes with Traxle, while still aiming at the HRT 
           Operator.  Oates grins and--  

           --THWAP!  

           No-look shot.  HITS HRT #1.  In the neck.
           Body spasm.  Involuntary trigger squeeze.  
           Sub-machinegun SPRAAAAAAAAAY!  THUNDER-BOOM LOUD.  
           BLASTING FISTFULS OF STUCCO OFF THE HOUSE FACADE.  
           BLASTING PALM LEAVES TO AIRBORNE MULCH.  

           BLASTING BYSTANDERS TO PIECES.  

           Partygoers SCREAM.  Scatter.  Tat’s Bodyguards aiming 
           platinum-plated AK-47s through the chaos.  Seeing nothing.  
           FIRING at everything.

           Oates throws his aim over to Traxle and his team.  
           UNLOADS.  BULLET-SMASHES one team member, 
           two fleeing party people, and an air-conditioning unit.  

           Oates runs/reloads.  Traxle and his team charge out from 
           behind cover.  In full pursuit.  

           Oates kicks through a patio door, enters the house.  
           Traxle and his team follow, into the--

           KITCHEN

           Oates has vanished.

                                 TRAXLE
                        Spread out.

           The FBI unit splits into TWO SEARCH TEAMS.

           INT. TAT SPECTOR’S MANSION/STUDY- THAT MOMENT

           Stray gunfire from the backyard PUNCHES OUT WHOLE WINDOWS.

           Tat pops just his eyes above a couch back, like a hippo about 
           to surface for air.  His bodyguards crouch beside him.

           Charlie peeks over a couch, five feet away from Tat’s.  
           Underhill and Tori Miles crouch beside him.

                                 TAT SPECTOR
                        Decker, don’t move!  We’re gonna 
                        smoke these motherfuckers and then 
                        we’re gonna save your--
           --VWAP!  BULLETS SLASH ACROSS TAT’S COUCH.  
           OBLITERATING HIM AND HIS FIVE BODYGUARDS.
           OBLITERATING A SALT WATER FISH TANK BUILT FLAT INTO THE WALL

           TORI MILES SCREAMS.  RUNS, FLAILING, OUT OF THE ROOM.

           Charlie and Underhill are alone.  A wave of saltwater fish 
           washes around their knees.  Colorful mouths gasping.  An 
           OCTOPUS slither-slides right into Charlie’s knee.  He stares 
           at it, transfixed amid the chaos.  Then looks up, at the 
           BLACK PORSCHE SUITCASE on the coffee table, between the two 
           couches.

           Charlie dashes.  Grabs the case.  Bullets ZWINGING like 
           Amazon insects.  He and Underhill sprint out of the Study.  
           Zoom through a maze of rooms. They enter a LONG HALLWAY LINED 
           WITH DOORS, they round a corner and see-- 

           Traxle and an FBI agent.  Coming at them.  Traxle’s face 
           drops into shock.  He SHOUTS INTO HIS RADIO.

                                 TRAXLE
                        Decker’s here!  Charlie Decker is 
                        Here!!  He is--

           --Charlie and Underhill 180, back around the corner, only to 
           see a MAN IN A LONG GREY DUSTER COAT, 15 feet before them, a 
           gun-wielding BARRICADE in the narrow corridor of doors.

           Ward Oates’ eyes flash like Hiroshima.  

                                 OATES
                        Decker.

           Oates raises his pistol and--

           --Traxle and his men enter the hall, behind Charlie and 
           Underhill.  Oates blinks.  Traxle blinks.

           Charlie and Underhill BARGE THROUGH THE NEAREST DOOR.  TUMBLE 
           DOWN A CARPETED FLIGHT OF STAIRS.

           Mimi, two FBI agents, plus two HRT Operators swing into the 
           hallway behind Oates.  Sights zeroed on the rogue agent.

           Oates feels time freeze, sandwiched between all those armed 
           agents.  Traxle snorts a laugh at him.

                                 TRAXLE
                        Smoke him.

           Oates LUNGE-DIVES at the nearest door.  BASHES through. 
           BULLETS SEARING air at his feet, CHEWING the doorway to bits.  

           Oates lands, rolling.  He’s in a--
           GAME ROOM

           He runs, past a pool table, through another door, entering a--

           HOME THEATER

           Massive wall screen.  Four rows of chairs.  No more doors.  
           No windows.  No escape.

           BASEMENT

           Charlie and Underhill lie in a tangled heap at the bottom of 
           the stairs.

           They get to their feet.  Charlie grabbing the suitcase.  
           Just as THE M84 STUN GRENADE comes bouncing down the steps.

           Charlie and Underhill run, deeper into the basement.  
           PULSE WAVE OF MAGNESIUM-WHITE CRASHING OVER THEIR BACKS.  
           Then, from out of the ringing flash-- 
           TWO HRT OPERATORS, BARRELING DOWN THE STAIRS.  

           WHILE UPSTAIRS, IN THE HOME THEATER 

           Oates slam-locks the door leading to the game room.  Aims at 
           it, crouching behind a row of oxblood leather chairs.  There 
           is a TOUCH SCREEN REMOTE laying on an arm rest.  Oates 
           punches buttons.  The room lights dim.  A cool, radium-blue 
           STAR FIELD twinkles across the ceiling.  Oates mashes more 
           buttons.  A 4K digital projector blinks on.  A WALL PANEL 
           SWINGS OPEN, exposing a shelf of AV components.  Oates stares 
           into the LITTLE CLOSET.  Thinks...thinks...  Crawls to it. 

           MEANWHILE, IN THE BASEMENT

           Charlie and Underhill race through a series of rooms:

           A room with a cave-like swimming pool.

           A room that looks like a 1950s hamburger stand.
           A gym with a rock climbing wall and half a basketball court.
           A room with nothing but beer kegs stacked to the ceiling.
           A two lane firing range.
           And, finally--

           A LAUNDRY ROOM

           It is a dead end.  No more rooms to run to.

           THE TWO HRT OPERATORS

           are hot on their trail, stalking through the hamburger stand.

           IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM
           Charlie is standing on one of five washing machines.  Looking 
           out a basement window.  The front yard is green and quiet.

           The window is covered with bars.  He gives them a two-handed 
           YANK.  Then another.  No use.  He turns to Underhill.  Face a 
           twisted nerve.  They talk in adrenaline-soaked whispers:

                                 UNDERHILL
                        Can we smash ‘em off?

                                 CHARLIE
                        With what?

           Charlie eye scans.  He jumps off the washer.  Over to the 
           wall.  To the ELECTRIC DUMBWAITER built into it.  He pulls a 
           laundry basket out.  Says to Underhill,

                                 CHARLIE
                        Come here.

           UPSTAIRS, IN THE GAME ROOM

           Traxle and his team flank the locked door which leads to the 
           home theater.  Mimi aiming a SHOTGUN at the top door hinge.
           SHE BLOWS IT OFF.  THEN THE LOWER ONE.  THEN THE KNOB.

           The door falls FLAT FORWARD.
           FIVE FBI AGENTS STORM OVER IT, into-- 

           THE HOME THEATER

           Splinter-shafts of light from the 4K digital projector blip 
           through gun smoke a metallic hinge dust.

           There’s a movie playing.  Something with a zombie, a zombie 
           who is underwater, battling an actual shark.

           Traxle and his team sweep the room.  No sign of Oates, until, 
           out of the corner of his eye, Traxle sees a scrap of DUSTER 
           COAT, caught in the almost imperceptible door of the AV 
           component closet, hanging like a flag on a windless day. 

           Traxle stops, thinks, no time to think, no time to signal a 
           warning, so he whirls, UNLOADING, into the AV closet.  His 
           team follows suit.  CAPPING ENDLESS ROUNDS INTO THE DOOR.

           The zombie movie GLITCHES.  STOPS.  
           THE MASSIVE WALL SCREEN WASHES PURE WHITE. 

           Big silence. 

           An electric motor HUMS.  The wall screen OPENS UPWARD.  
           LIKE A GARAGE DOOR.  The alcove behind it is just big enough 
           to hide two Wilson Audio X-2 speakers.  A WATCH Dog 
           subwoofer.  And Ward Oates.  
           He has the touch screen remote in one hand, .45 in the other.

           He steps into the room through clouds of shimmering white 
           particle matter.

           Traxle and his team look at the AV closet, beyond the 
           thinning smoke.  There is but a LONG, GREY DUSTER COAT amid a 
           pile of wood and blasted chunks of electronics.

           Traxle and his team truly unloaded into that closet.  The 
           slides on their pistols are all snapped back into the empty 
           position.  Oates snorts a laugh at Traxle.

                                 OATES
                        Nice shooting.

           Oates FIRES, so fast it sounds like a machinegun.  
           The agents EXPLODE BLOOD.  SPLATTERING the 4K projector lens.  
           Plunging the room into a glowing realm of the DEEPEST RED.

           The slide on Oates’ pistol SNAPS BACK.  Empty.  
           One agent remains standing and un-shot: Dale Traxle.

           He and Oates stare, frozen, each at the other’s waist.  
           They both have FULL AMMO CLIPS ATTACHED TO THEIR BELTS, 
           BESIDE THEIR HIP HOLSTERS.

           In the center of the Universe, the clock spring tightens.  
           The clock spring strains.  The clock spring BREAKS.

           Oates and Traxle POP into motion.

           Simultaneous clip grabbing.  Simultaneous pistol loading.  
           Simultaneous KLACKING-- gun slides SNAPPING FORWARD.  

           BANG! 

           HIGH-VELOCITY SPLASH OF BLOOD.  Hits the wall.  Behind Oates.
           Who falls back.  Dropping his gun.  Shoulder oozing.

           Traxle towers over him.  Beaming in triumph.  In relief.  

           In joy.  

           Traxle lowers his aim for the head shot.  His face WARPS INTO 
           A DUNGEON OF PAIN.  He drops his gun.  Too heavy.  He teeters 
           back.  Equilibrium a sloshing, punctured yolk sac.  

           Traxle clutches his side, below the armpit.  The part the 
           Kevlar vest does not cover.  BLOOD HOSES between his fingers.  
           Pumping out in double-thump cardiac spurts.  He falls to his 
           knees.  Folding onto his side.   

           The wound on Oates’ shoulder is a muscle hit.  Clean through.  
           He stands.  Grabbing his gun off the floor.  
           Tendril of smoke curling from the homemade silencer.  Puff of 
           air from his mouth.  Scatters it invisible. 

           Traxle lays dying on the floor.  Groaning and squirming.

           Oates walks past him.  Oates does not break stride.  Oates 
           aims his .45 pointblank and BLOWS TRAXLE’S HEAD OFF.

           Oates walks out of the home theater, then out of the game 
           room, and into--

           THE HALL

           He’s almost running when he goes down the basement stairway.

           IN THE BASEMENT

           Charlie and Underhill climb into the DUMBWAITER.  They climb 
           on top of the plastic suitcase, which is already situated 
           flat inside.  They look like a pair of canned fetuses.

           Charlie reaches out to a panel of buttons in the wall: 1st 
           Floor; 2nd Floor; 3rd floor.  Charlie hits the button for the 
           3rd floor.  And the dumbwaiter car ascends.  Just as the HRT 
           OPERATORS ENTER THE LAUNDRY ROOM.  Everyone’s eyes meet, 
           nanoseconds before the car disappears up into the wall.

           INSIDE THE DUMBWAITER CAR

           Pitch dark.  Cables ECHO-TWANG in the metal shaft.  Charlie 
           and Underhill breath panic.

           BASEMENT

           An HRT operator jams his gun into the dumbwaiter shaft.  
           EMPTIES A 30 ROUND CLIP INTO THE ASCENDING CAR.

           IN THE BASEMENT FIRING RANGE

           Oates, snooping around, hears this.  Head SNAPPING ALERT like 
           a deer in the woods.

           WHILE INSIDE THE DUMBWAITER CAR

           Charlie and Underhill SCREAM. HELL STORM OF BULLETS BOUNCING 
           OFF THE HARD-SHELL SUITCASE BENEATH THEM. 

           THE 3rd FLOOR ATTIC

           is a vast, open space.  Vaulted ceiling.  Furniture covered 
           with sheets.  BIG WINDOWS WITH NO BARS.

           The dumbwaiter car arrives.  Charlie and Underhill scramble 
           out of it.  Gunfire still exploding up the shaft.

           Charlie and Underhill are a heap on the floor.
           They wobble to their feet.  They see the dumbwaiter car.  
           Suitcase still inside.  GOING DOWN.

           Charlie HAYWIRES to the dumbwaiter.  Just as the car dips out 
           of sight.  Charlie hits buttons.  Nothing.   Grabs steel 
           cables.  They SHRED through his hand.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Help me!  Help!  

           Underhill grabs cables too.  They yank till their palms 
           bleed.  And then yank more.  No use.  The suitcase is gone.  

           Charlie punches the cable.  Punches the wall.  Kicks the 
           wall.  CRYING OUT:

                                 CHARLIE
                        GOD-FUCKING-DAMN IT!!
                            (then, softly, to himself)
                        I left it in...how could I leave it 
                        in there...she’s dead...she’s 
                        dead... Because of me.  I’m sorry.  
                        I’m so sorry...I’m--

                                 UNDERHILL (O.S.)
                        --Charlie.

           Charlie turns.  Underhill is already chest deep in the 
           dumbwaiter shaft.  Jacket wrapped around his hand.  Holding 
           the cable like a kid on a rope swing.

                                 UNDERHILL
                        You owe me a bag of Jolly Ranchers.

           Before Charlie can utter a sound, Underhill SLIDES DOWN.

           IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM

           HRT #1 presses the dumbwaiter button again.  Like he’s 
           waiting for a stubborn elevator.  HRT #2 beside him.  They 
           hear strange noises in the shaft.  HRT #1 clicks on his 
           flashlight.  Sticks it and his head into the wall hole.  

           IN THE SHAFT, ABOVE THE CAR

           Underhill ZIPS down the cable.  So fast he looses his grip.  
           Falls.  Five feet.  CRASH-LANDS.  On top of the car.  CABLES 
           SNAP.  THE CAR PLUMMETS.

           IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM

           HRT #1.  Head still in the shaft.  Hears a metallic SWOOOOSH!  
           Right before the car strikes like a guillotine.

           SMASH-WEDGING HIS HEAD DOWN INTO THE WALL.
           AIRBURST OF PLASTER.  Underhill TUMBLE-FLIES OUT OF THE WALL 
           HOLE.  Smack into HRT #2.  Sprawls him.  Underhill punches.  
           Blindly.  Spastic.  Howling like a mad animal.  Hitting 
           helmet.  Kevlar chest.  Soft face.  FIVE SOLID FIST BASHES IN 
           ROW.  Knocks him out.      

           Underhill retrieves the suitcase.  Grabs a sub-machinegun off 
           the floor.  Aims it at the window.  BLOWS OFF BARS.  
           EVAPORATES GLASS.

           Heaves the suitcase through the smoldering window frame.  
           Jumps, onto a washing machine.  Wiggles himself through the 
           window.  Clothes snagging glass shards.   

           When Oates enters the laundry room, the first things he sees 
           is a pair of rapidly kicking feet.  High on the wall, 
           sticking out the window.

           He barely considers whose feet these could be.  He FIRES.  
           SHEARS OFF UNDERHILL’S LITTLE TOE.  Underhill SHRIEKS.  
           Propels himself, arms swimming, onto the--

           FRONT LAWN

           Grabs the suitcase.  Limp-runs, across the driveway.  Diving 
           behind a beat-up Chevy Nova, part of Tat’s famous car museum.

           CHARLIE

           Climbs out the attic window, onto a little tile roof below.  
           Shimmies down a palm tree.  Moves around to the front of the 
           house.  Sirens rising in the distance.

           Charlie comes around a corner.  There’s Underhill.  30 feet 
           away.  Crouched behind the Chevy Nova.  Suitcase beside him.  
           Charlie smiles.  Astonished.  Almost laughing with relief.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Johnny!

           Underhill turns.  Sees Charlie smiling in amazement.  He 
           smiles back.  

           That’s when the first bullet SKIPS UNDER THE NOVA, TAKES OUT 
           UNDERHILL’S ANKLE, causing him to topple.  As his head hits 
           the ground, the second skipping bullet leaps to greet it. 

           Ward Oates re-aims, arm sticking out of that basement window 
           now.  Fires a third skipping shot.  Gas tank HIT.  Gas tank 
           DETONATION.  A BLAZING FUNNEL CLOUD SWALLOWS UNDERHILL AND 
           THE SUITCASE.

           Charlie reels.  FIREBALL CRUSH WAVE flattening him to the 
           grass.  Looks up.  Sees Oates.  Through rippling air.  
           Slithering out of the basement window.  BLASTING at him now. 
           Charlie rolls, behind another car museum piece, an old 
           Goodhew AMBULANCE.  Bullets skipping underneath it.  Charlie 
           leaps.  On to the rear bumper.  Then inside, through the rear 
           door.

           Oates’ gun clicks dry.  He’s halfway out of the basement 
           window.  He reloads.  Fully climbs out.  Gets to his feet.   
           Realizes an AMBULANCE IS ROCKETING AT HIM.

           Oates dives.  Face in the dirt.  

           Charlie LEAPS OUT OF THE AMBULANCE’S REAR DOOR.  TRIPS.  
           COMES UP RUNNING.  STRAIGHT FOR THE STONE WALL.

           The ambulance HITS THE HOUSE.  Inches beside Oates.  Half 
           caves in a wall.  Stops.  Wheels spinning at burnout speed.  
           Launching clumps of grass and dirt into orbit.  

           Oates gets up.  Brushing house debris off his head.  Rips 
           open the ambulance’s driver’s door.  No Charlie.  Only a 
           crude hot wire job.  And a SWISS ARMY KNIFE, jammed into the 
           gas pedal.  Pinning it flat down.  Oates yanks the knife out.  
           The inscription on the handle nearly burns out his retinas: 
           Charlie T. Decker.

           EXT. TAT SPECTOR’S MANSION/STREET - DAY

           Charlie lands on the other side of the stone wall.  Sprints 
           to the Aston Martin.  Jumps in.  Peeeeels away.

           EXT. TAT SPECTOR’S MANSION/DRIVEWAY - DAY

           Oates is behind the wheel of the ambulance.  He backs it up.  
           He speeds down the driveway, toward the front gate.  He 
           activates the sirens when the first police cars zoom through.  
           They make way.  He hits the street doing 60 and careens out 
           of sight.    

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           Farallon stands before the open rear hatch of the Range 
           Rover, packing his heat-vision goggles into a carrying case 
           which sits in the car’s way-back area.  This case contains 
           dozens of foam-packed .40mm grenade shells, a disassembled 
           UMP45 machinegun, ammo clips, knives, a grappling hook...

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Veritek stands in the foyer, peeking through a little window 
           beside the front door, watching Farallon.  Veritek steps back 
           and hides beyond the edge the door frame.  Wipes his palms on 
           his jeans.  He is holding a CRKT folding knife, 3.5-inch 
           blade extended and locked into place.  He raises it.  Ready 
           to SKULL STAB Farallon the moment he enters the house.  
           Caroline on the floor, hog-tied with two sets of handcuffs, 
           eyes huge with dread.  Veritek tries to give her a reassuring 
           nod, heart hammers pounding in his throat.  She shuts her 
           eyes, as if to avoid the worst scene in a horror movie. 

           EXT. SAFE HOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Farallon grabs a MASSIVE CAN OF GASOLINE from the back of the 
           Range Rover.  Slams the hatch shut.  Walks to the front door.  
           Opens it and steps--

           INSIDE THE HOUSE

           He walks through the foyer and into the living room, without 
           even noticing Veritek: a giant frozen in fear, hiding beside 
           the door frame, knife poised in suspended animation.

           Farallon begins drenching the living room walls with 
           gasoline.  He turns toward Veritek, who quickly hides the 
           knife behind his back.  Farallon is startled to see him 
           there.  He pauses, then says,

                                 FARALLON
                        Get ready.  We are leaving.

           Veritek nods.  Farallon continues gas drenching the living 
           room.  Veritek sort of follows him, grip tightening on the 
           knife behind his back.  

           Farallon walks through a swinging door, into the kitchen, 
           begins gas splashing the walls and counter tops.

           Veritek stops on the living room side of the door.  Watches 
           Farallon, in increasingly brief glimpses, until the door 
           stops swinging and stays closed.  He stares into the white 
           slab of wood, inches from his face.

                                 VERITEK
                            (to himself)
                        Fuck.  This.

           Veritek folds his knife away.  Runs to Caroline, sliding up 
           to her on his knees.  Pulls a HANDCUFF KEY from his pocket.

           Caroline’s eyes ask, what the fuck?

                                 VERITEK
                        We’re making a run for it.

           He leans over her, about to jam the key in a handcuff.  She 
           squeals thinly into her gag.

           Veritek doesn’t even have to turn.  He knows why she’s 
           squealing.  He can feel Farallon’s face, rising over his 
           shoulder like a dead sun.
                                 FARALLON
                        What do you think you’re doing?

           Veritek swallows.  Then SHOOTS HIS WHOLE BODY STRAIGHT UP.  
           PISTON FORCE.  TOP OF HIS HEAD PULVERIZING FARALLON BELOW THE 
           CHIN.  SENDING THE OLD MAN SOARING.  

           Farallon lands on his ass.  Titanium pistol already coming 
           out.  Veritek charging.  Front kick MOTION BLURRING.  
           STRIKING Farallon’s pistol as the muzzle blooms pale yellow.  
           The gun goes flying.  So does a bullet.  Into a wall SOAKED 
           WITH GASOLINE.  Fire spreads in a hissing blue wave.

           Caroline rolls away from a burning wall.  Stops.  Double 
           blinks.  The HANDCUFF KEY is on the floor, a foot in front of 
           her nose.  Her hands are bound to her back.  So she rolls.

           VERITEK

           ensnares Farallon in a Jujitsu HEADLOCK.  Begins SLAMMING HIS 
           KNEE INTO THE CROWN OF FARALLON’S SKULL.

           Farallon mashes his face into Veritek’s stomach.  AND BITES.  
           Blood pools around his mouth.  Veritek HOWLS.  

           Smoke alarms SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

           CAROLINE

           Fingers brushing the handcuff key.  Fingers PINCHING THE 
           HANDCUFF KEY.  

           FARALLON 

           is a PARASITIC SUCKER FISH, MOUTH ATTACHED TO VERITEK’S 
           ABDOMEN.

           Veritek grabs Farallon’s head with both hands.  Punches.  
           Twists.  No good.  

           Veritek HURLS himself and Farallon across the room in a 
           tumbling melee-- 

           --BASHING INTO CAROLINE.  She drops the key.  Gag screams.  
           Two animals on top of her.  Fighting to the death. 

           Veritek THUMB HOOKS Farallon’s EYES.  Starts to GOUGE THEM 
           OUT.  

           The old man comes loose, scraps of shirt and skin hanging 
           from a lunatic maw.  Two-inch blade WHISPER SNAPPING out of 
           the tip of his cowboy boot.  KICKING.  SINKING IT INTO 
           VERITEK’S KNEE.  RUPTURING A NERVE CLUSTER.  DROPS HIM.

           A glint of black metal.  GRENADE LAUNCHER coming up.  
           Veritek grabs it. 
           BWAAAAAAAM!

           SPREAD SHOT.  INTO THE CEILING.  RAGGED HOLES.  SUNLIGHT 
           THROUGH SMOKE SWIRLS.

           Farallon kicks again.  Toe blade STABBING INTO Veritek’s 
           sternum.  THE BOOT STICKS THERE.  Farallon’s leg along with 
           it.  

           Veritek CLUTCHES THE BOOT.  HAMMER KICKS back.  LAUNCHING 
           Farallon, out of his bladed boot, across the room, slamming 
           into a wall of fire.

           CAROLINE

           pivots, eyes searching for the dropped handcuff key.  Finds 
           it.  In the middle of a floor AIR CONDITIONING VENT.  
           Teetering on the mesh pattern like a shiny little seesaw.

           VERITEK

           has a boot stuck in his chest.  Just hanging there.  He pulls 
           it out.  Throws it.

           Farallon on his knees.  Back on fire.  

           Veritek charging at him.

           Farallon yanks off his flaming coat.  Wields it like a FIRE 
           WHIP.  Barely keeping Veritek at a distance with it. 

           CAROLINE

           ever so delicately, inches her fingers toward the teetering 
           handcuff key.

           FARALLON

           backs up, through the swinging door, into the-- 

           KITCHEN  

           his fire whip LASHING out at Veritek, who follows, eyes 
           roving for an attack opening.

           Farallon backs into the GAS CAN, sitting in the middle of the 
           kitchen floor.  He nudge-kicks it with his heel.  The can 
           slides.  Stopping inches from a flaming breakfast nook. 

           And that’s when Veritek moves.  Arm swinging up and under 
           Farallon’s whip arm.  Getting leverage and--

           PANCAKE SMASHING THE OLD MAN TO THE FLOOR.

           Veritek straddles him.  Knees pinning his arms flat down.  
           UNLEASHING AN ARMADA OF PUNCHES.  CRUSHING FARALLON’S FACE.   
           Farallon SCREAMS.  PSYCHOTIC.  BLOOD GURGLING OUT OF HIS 
           MOUTH IN PARANORMAL GASPS.

           Veritek vice-grips his neck.  SQUEEEEEZES.  The gurgling 
           gasps stop.  Farallon’s face BULGES.  Eyes purple-black.

           BOOOOOOM!

           The FLASH BLINDS.  The house QUAKES. 

           CAROLINE

           reaching for the handcuff key, rocks forward.  Key flying up 
           and off the vent, landing on the floor in front of her.  She 
           must roll her body again.

           IN THE KITCHEN

           We realize the GAS CAN Farallon kicked toward the fire just 
           EXPLODED.

           SPRAAAAAAYING LIQUID FLAMES.  Engulfing Veritek’s head and 
           shoulders.  He thrashes.  A dumb behemoth.  Bumping into 
           counters.  Fire eating him alive.

           Farallon bats a few flames off his legs.  Catches breath.  
           Rises.  Slow.  Fire everywhere.  Drawing the GERBER MARK II 
           FIGHTING KNIFE from a sheath at the small of his back.  

           Veritek tears off his flaming shirt.  Swats his head with it.  
           Dousing flames.  Hair crispy, spewing smoke.  He opens his 
           eyes.  

           The kitchen is a BLAST FURNACE.  Air writing.  
           Farallon’s dagger ARCING through the distortion field. 
           SLASHING Veritek’s throat.

           Veritek crashes to his knees.  Hands cupping his neck, trying 
           to hold in all the blood.  Farallon behind him now.  Blade 
           SLICING.  TWICE.  PARALLEL INCISIONS, FROM HAIRLINE TO 
           JAWLINE, DOWN EITHER SIDE OF THE FACE, INTERSECTING THE 
           HORIZONTAL THROAT SLASH, LIKE A BLOOD-DRAWN CHINSTRAP. 

           Veritek catches his own reflection in the black glass of an 
           oven door.  Just as Farallon reaches into his throat wound, 
           gets a firm grip...and YANKS UPWARD, screaming....   

                                 FARALLON
                        Oh my God!  Close your eyes, my 
                        darling!  Close your EYEEEEEEES!

           IN THE LIVING ROOM, MOMENTS LATER

           Farallon enters, kicking through a swinging door of fire.  

           VERITEK’S FACE IN HIS HAND.
           He stops cold.  Caroline is gone.  Handcuffs strewn across 
           the floor.  Farallon drops the face.  It hits the floor with 
           a Jell-O SMACK.

           EXT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           Caroline SPRINTS down the hill.  Bare feet pounding brush.  
           Farallon barges out of the burning house.  Pistol up.  
           Bullets CAROOOOM past Caroline. 

           She skids.  Behind the assassins’ red utility van.  Still at 
           the hill’s base.  Engine still running.  Key in the ignition.

           She ducks in.  Puts it in drive.  Covertly jumps back out.  
           Uses the idling van as moving cover as she goes a little 
           farther down the hillside.

           Farallon loads a FRAG SHELL into his grenade launcher.  
           Unfolds the ladder sight.  Targets the van he thinks Caroline 
           is driving and...

           BLOOP!

           ...BLOWS IT APART. 

           Caroline lies hidden beneath an oleander bush.  Smoldering 
           van chunks everywhere.  She doesn't move until Farallon’s 
           Range Rover rumbles past and roars around the bend. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           EXT. DESERT TRUCK STOP - DAY

           The Aston Martin swerves into a Truck Stop lot.  Parks.

           INT. ASTON MARTIN (PARKED) - DAY

           Charlie kills the engine.  And just sits there.  Staring off 
           into space.  Face a pit of blood and grime, drying tears and 
           inhuman exhaustion. 

           MEMORY FLASH:

           3 years ago, in Charlie’s living room.  Caroline showing off 
           her disguise for the big safe-grab caper.  She pulls the 
           black wig off her head.  Puts it on Underhill, backwards.  
           Everyone laughing.  There is no sound.

           INT. GALVAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Galvan dials his phone.  Gets Veritek’s voicemail.

                                 GALVAN
                        Kenny, what the fuck?  What’s going 
                        on?  I need to know.  Call me back.
           He hangs up.  He fidgets.  He picks up the phone.  Dials *67.  
           Hears three BEEPS followed by a solid tone.  Dials a number.

           INT. RANGE ROVER (MOVING) - DAY 

           Farallon drives.  Sucking a self-rolled cigarette.  Smoke 
           seeping from his battle-mangled head.  His cell rings.  
           Caller ID: unknown.

           INTERCUT - Galvan

           phone pressed hard against his face, listening to rings, and 
           then...click...Farallon answers without saying a word.  

           Galvan’s heart floods with cement.  In an instant he knows 
           Veritek is dead.  All his plans have failed.  He slumps, eyes 
           clenched, listening to Farallon’s steady breathing until...  

                                 FARALLON
                        Francis.

           Galvan’s eyes SNAP OPEN WIDE: He can’t know it’s me.      

                                 FARALLON
                        Francis.

           He knows.

                                 GALVAN
                        Oh, hey...Thought I had a wrong 
                        number for a second.  How’s every--

                                 FARALLON
                        --Francis.  
                            (then)
                        Pray...for...death.

           Click.  Farallon’s gone.  Galvan sits shock still.  Then 
           dials his phone once more.  One of his underlings must have 
           answered, because Galvan says...

                                 GALVAN
                        Fuel the jet.

           EXT. STRIP MALL - DAY

           Caroline wanders into a strip mall on the fringes of some 
           town.  Barefoot and soot covered.  She looks like refugee 
           from a bombed out city.

           A MINUTE LATER

           She is dialing a pay phone in front of Von’s.
           INT. TRUCK STOP - DAY

           Charlie takes a large bottle of Arrowhead water from a wall 
           cooler.  Chugs half of it.  Right there in the aisle.

           His cell rings.  He pulls it from his pocket.  He doesn't 
           recognize the number.  He flips it open to answer.  And the 
           thing simply BREAKS IN TWO.  Stops ringing.

           He turns the battered pieces over in his hand.  Thoroughly 
           fucked by the day’s endless brutalities.

           EXT. STRIP MALL - DAY

           Caroline, on the pay phone, listens to Charlie’s voicemail, 
           after which she cups the mouthpiece and speaks softly, voice 
           quivering...

                                 CAROLINE
                        ...Charlie...where are you....?  
                        Whatever’s happening...I got away.  
                        I’m safe.  I got away.  Whatever 
                        you do, don’t go to that graveyard 
                        in the desert.  They are going to 
                        kill you.  Ohh, where are you...?  

           INT. TRUCK STOP - DAY

           Charlie stands at the truck stop’s register counter.  There 
           is a WIRY OLD MAN behind it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Do you know where El Mirage 
                        Cemetery is?

           The old man nods, unfolds a map on the counter.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Lots of twists and turns.

           He thumb-clicks a green pen from his breast pocket.  Draws 
           the route.  As he does, Charlie’s eyes wander, then stop, 
           then narrow, then ZOOM IN ON a box of EMERGENCY ROAD FLARES, 
           behind the counter. 

                                 OLD MAN
                        Here you go.  Buck and a quarter 
                        for the water.  Map’s on me, on 
                        account I scribbled all over it.  
                        Can I get anything else for you?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Road flares. 
           INT. VON’S PARKING GARAGE - DAY

           Caroline walks through Von’s underground parking garage.  
           Spots an old, 1989 Toyota Camry, parked in a distant corner.  
           She swivels her gaze.  It stops on a FIRE EXTINGUISHER, 
           attached to a wall and encased in breakaway glass.

           INT. TOYOTA CAMRY - DAY

           A FIRE EXTINGUISHER SMASHES THROUGH THE PASSENGER WINDOW.  
           Caroline reaches in.  Unlocks the door.  Wiggles herself, 
           head first, beneath the steering wheel.  Yanks out wires.

           EXT. VON’S PARKING LOT- DAY

           A 1989 Camry VROOOMS up and out of the underground garage.  
           Caroline behind the wheel.  SPEEDING AWAY.

           EXT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Perimeter of crime scene tape, strung tree to tree.  Two cop 
           cars in the driveway, next to Caroline’s Barracuda.  Caroline 
           slows, stops the stolen Camry in front of her house.  

           INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Caroline walks through the front door.  Hears sounds.  She 
           follows them, into--

           THE KITCHEN

           where she sees a UNIFORMED COP, back facing her, standing 
           over a little desk area, flipping through her address book.

           She breaks down crying.  Collapsing on the floor, like a 
           marathon runner falling across the finish line.  

           The cop kneels beside her.  Hand on her shoulder. 

                                 CAROLINE
                        Please...you have to help me... 
                        Charlie...I know he didn’t do 
                        anything...but...they are going to 
                        kill him...you have to get help...I 
                        know where he’s going but--

           --The hand on her shoulder TIGHTENS LIKE A HYDRAULIC CLAW.

           Caroline looks up into Ward Oates’ homemade silencer.  His 
           eyes wild beneath the brim of his new policeman’s hat.

           Caroline sees a pair of bare, bloody feet, poking out from 
           behind an island counter.  There are THREE COPS BODIES 
           stacked behind it.  One stripped of its uniform.
           Caroline PUNCHES Oates in the face.  Knocking his hat off.  
           Oates laughs.  Oates SLAMS HIS FIST INTO HER SOLAR PLEXUS.  
           KNOCKING HER WIND OUT.  She doubles over, wheezing.  

                                 OATES
                        Let’s go help your husband.

           CONVERGENCE MONTAGE:

           EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

           The Aston Martin pounds through desert air.  Charlie 
           squinting into an unfurling planetscape of alkali dunes. 

           EXT. SKY - DAY

           A Gulfstream 550 jet streaks through the clouds. 

           INT. GULFSTREAM JET - THAT MOMENT

           Galvan and SIX HENCHMEN fill the cabin.  The Henchmen sip 
           drinks and play cards.  Galvan sits silently, gnawing the 
           inside of his cheek, staring out a window.

           INT. RANGER ROVER (MOVING) - DAY

           Farallon steers with his knee, as he finishes rolling a 
           cigarette, pops it in his mouth, lights it with a Zippo.

           EXT. 10 FREEWAY - DAY

           A 1971 Plymouth Barracuda BARRELS east on the San Bernardino 
           Freeway.

           INT. BARRACUDA (MOVING) - THAT MOMENT

           Oates drives.  One hand on the wheel.  The other languidly 
           aiming a pistol at Caroline, who is slumped next to him, 
           hands cuffed behind her back.

           THE SCREEN SPLITS, FOUR WAYS:

           showing all of the above mentioned vehicles, each in its own 
           screen section, hurtling right at us, faster and faster, 
           until they hit us head on with a NUCLEAR POW. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           EXT. EL MIRAGE CEMETERY - SUNDOWN

           El Mirage Cemetery lies roughly ten feet below the flat dry-
           lake surrounding it, within a sunken, bowl-shaped acre of 
           Earth, thought to be a prehistoric astroid crater.  

           Angel statues and obelisks.  Time-savaged.  Loom cracked and 
           crumbling in the last ribbons of light. 
           The Aston Martin turns off a dirt road and rolls down a 
           sloping access path, into the cemetery proper.  Charlie 
           exits.  Wind warbling between stones.  He is all alone.  

           He opens the Aston Martin’s trunk.  Luggage inside.  
           Belonging to Tori Miles and her husband Nigel.  Charlie lifts 
           out the smallest suitcase.  It’s carry-on size and hot pink.

           Charlie walks to the center of the graveyard.  Waits.  Turns 
           when he hears the rumbling... 

           TWO DODGE DURANGOS, moving down the sloped entrance path.  
           Aiming headlights at Charlie.  Stopping.  Doors opening.  
           Headlights staying on.  Francis Galvan exiting.  Along with 
           SIX ARMED HENCHMEN.  They slowly advance on Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Where’s my wife?

                                 GALVAN
                        Close.

                                 CHARLIE
                        How close?

                                 GALVAN
                        Where’s my skull?

           Charlie raises the pink suitcase a little.

                                 GALVAN
                        Open it.  Let’s see it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Let’s see Caroline.

           Galvan and his men are about ten feet from Charlie now.

                                 GALVAN
                        Open it for him.

           A Henchman moves on Charlie.  Charlie steps back.  Lets his 
           jacket fall open, revealing TEN STICKS OF DYNAMITE* TAPED 
           ACROSS HIS CHEST, WIRED THROUGH HIS SLEEVE, TO A DETONATOR** 
           IN HIS HAND.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Don’t take another step, asshole.

           The Henchman takes several steps...backwards.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Any of you wanna orbit Pluto...

                                 GALVAN
                        Take it easy, Decker.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Fuck easy.  Where’s my wife?

                                 GALVAN
                        Listen, Decker...  
                            (pause)
                        How’d you like a job?

                                 CHARLIE
                        ...?

                                 GALVAN
                        Come work for me.  Have you seen 
                        the news today?  You’re gonna need 
                        help laying low.  And I need people 
                        like you right now.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Who the fuck are you?

                                 GALVAN
                        I’m Francis Galvan.

           *Actually road flares.
           **Actually a tire pressure gauge.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No thanks.  If I wanted to watch a 
                        monkey shit himself, I would have 
                        been a zookeeper.

                                 GALVAN
                        The fuck does that mean?

                                 CHARLIE
                        It means where’s my wi--

           BLOOP!

           The .40mm SMOKE GRENADE hits the ground bouncing.  BILLOWING 
           chemical clouds.  Slowly swallowing Charlie, Galvan, and the 
           henchmen.

                                 GALVAN
                        Farallon.

           The henchmen scramble, using gravestones as cover, aiming 
           machineguns, guarding Galvan.

           Charlie spins, confused.  Trying to see where the shot came 
           from.  BLOOP!  Ducks down.  BLOOP!  Two more grenades.  The 
           world PHASES INTO A DIMENSION OF SOLID WHITE.

           EXTREME CLOSE UP: Farallon’s eyes.

           HEAT VISION GOGGLES SNAP DOWN OVER THEM.
           HEAT VISION POV:  descending into the graveyard crater.  
           Advancing on the humanoid color blobs.  They are frantic.  
           Smoke blinded.

           The ice-blue GRENADE LAUNCHER rises into FRAME.

           BWAAAAAAAAM!

           Spread shot.  Like a Sci-fi PARTICLE BEAM CANNON.
           SHREDS TWO HENCHMEN.  INTO SPECKS OF ELECTRIC DUST.

           The remaining four henchmen OPEN FIRE.  Every direction.  
           Machinegun bullets are laser bolts.

           Farallon reloads the GLOWING RED launcher.  Aims....

           HIGH ABOVE THE CEMETERY, LOOKING DOWN, WE SEE:

           Stroboscopic FLASHES through a puffy Nimbus storm cloud.

           BWAAAAAAAAM!

           BLOOD SHOWERS OUT, SPLATTERS THE DESERT LIKE DRIVING RAIN. 

           BACK TO HEAT VISION POV:

           Farallon reloads. 

           Last two henchmen.  Crouching behind a gravestone.  Blind 
           firing photon streams.

           BWAAAAAAAAAM!

           Even the gravestone atomizes. 

           BACK TO OUR NORMAL, OPTICAL SPECTRUM:

           CHARLIE

           is flat on the ground.  The smoke is thinning.  Spiraling 
           like a phantom galaxy.  Then, somewhere, nearby...

           SCREAMS.  RISING.  STRETCHING OUT INTO A DELIRIUM BEYOND 
           SOUND.  ECHOES OF DOOM.  RIPPING INTO SILENCE.

           The smoke churns.  Charlie sees a man materialize out of it, 
           head broken and twisted, towering over him.  This man holds 
           Francis Galvan’s dripping face in his hand.  This man’s eyes 
           are black rifts. 

                                 FARALLON
                        Charlie Decker.

           Charlie’s brain circuits crossfire.  Synaptic meltdown.
           Farallon tosses the disembodied face.  Kneels.  Grabs Tori 
           Miles’ pink suitcase.  Opens it.  Stares into it.  Turns it 
           upside-down.  Spilling its contents across the ground: 
           approximately THIRTY POUNDS OF DILDOS.  Every shape and size.

           INT. BARRACUDA (MOVING) - THAT MOMENT

           Oates drives up to the sunken graveyard.  Sees nothing but 
           the faint glow of headlights through smoke.  So he stops the 
           car.  Cuffs Caroline’s hands to the steering wheel.  Exits.  

           Caroline watches him walk off.  And when he is adequately 
           obscured in the smoke, she inverts her body, so that her head 
           is in the driver’s footwell.  There is a plastic panel below 
           the steering wheel.  She bites at it.  Catches a front tooth 
           on a release latch.  POPS IT OFF.  Exposing a nest of wires. 

           EXT. EL MIRAGE CEMETERY - THAT MOMENT

           Farallon tosses the pink suitcase aside.

           Charlie has scramble-crawled away from him.  Grabbing a 
           machinegun off a henchmen’s corpse.  Aiming it up at 
           Farallon.  Hitting the trigger.  CLICK.  Empty.

           Charlie crawls back more.  Toward another dropped gun.

           Farallon walks toward Charlie, casually opens the breach of 
           his grenade launcher.  Plucks out a spent shell. 

           Charlie aims-- CLICK. 

                                 FARALLON
                        Why don’t you tell me where the 
                        skull is, right now?
                            (then)
                        Road flares will not save you this 
                        time.

           Farallon jams a fresh SPREAD SHELL into his launcher.
           Charlie, crawling back, picking up another machinegun.
           Farallon, flipping his launcher closed with a hollow THUNK.
           Charlie hits the trigger-- CLICK.
           Farallon aims his launcher down at Charlie.  

           Charlie grabs A FOURTH DROPPED GUN.  AIMS-- CLICK.  Hits the 
           trigger again-- CLICK!  And a third time-- CRYING OUT:

                                 CHARLIE
                        GODDAMN--

           --THWAP!  The grenade launcher goes PINWHEELING out of 
           Farallon’s hand.

           Farallon reflex grabs for his hip holster, gets a hand on the 
           pistol grip, but can’t draw it, because-- 
           Ward Oates, emerging from the smoke, has him bullseye locked.

                                 OATES
                        What an excellent night for a 
                        showdown.
                            (then)
                        Decker, get your ass up.  You’re 
                        coming with me.

                                 FARALLON
                        No he isn’t.

                                 OATES
                        Now, Decker.

                                 FARALLON
                        He is staying.

                                 OATES
                        Sorry.  But I’ve had a certain kind 
                        of day.  And there’s no way in fuck 
                        I’m leaving without that kid 
                        strapped to the hood of my car.

           Oates, about to fire into Farallon’s forehead, notices--

           --Farallon’s hand, still on his holstered titanium pistol-- 
           subtly rotating it, upward on his belt, so that the barrel, 
           though holstered, is now aiming at Oates’ stomach.  

                                 OATES
                        Take your hand off the gun.

                                 FARALLON
                        You should drop yours.

                                 OATES
                        Or what?  You wound me in the gut?  
                        I’ll blow your fuckin’ head off, 
                        old man.

                                 FARALLON
                        I don’t wound things.

           Silence, eons worth, compacted into this thin sliver of time.

           BANG!  

           Charlie has finally found a loaded firearm.  A hideaway 
           revolver from a henchmen’s ankle holster.  First shot was a 
           warning.  Charlie is kneeling behind a stone Cherub, several 
           feet behind Farallon, at an angle where no one can get a fast 
           shot off on him.  He swivels his aim between the two men.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Both of you, shut the fuck up!  Lie 
                        down and tell me where my wife is!

                                 FARALLON
                        I have her.  Shoot him and I’ll 
                        take you to her.   

                                 OATES
                        You fuckin’ liar!  I have her.  
                        Shoot him and I’ll--

                                 FARALLON
                        --I have her.

                                 OATES
                        This is insane.  I have her.

                                 FARALLON
                        No.  I do.

                                 OATES
                        Okay, you demented shit-cock, then 
                        where is she?  Astonish me. 

                                 FARALLON
                        She is--
           -VRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOM!

           IN MID-AIR.  RIGHT BEHIND OATES.  

           A STREAKING MASS OF DETROIT STEEL.  BELLY FLOPPING OFF THE 
           RIM OF THE CRATER.  SQUASHING HIM FLAT INTO THE GROUND.   
           BACK TIRES SPITTING HIM OUT IN WOOD CHIPPER CHUNKS.

           THE BARRACUDA ROARS FORWARD.  IMPACT-SHATTERING FARALLON’S 
           HIP.  VELOCITY STICKING HIM TO THE FRONT BUMPER.  A GIANT 
           HOOD ORNAMENT.  CRASHING THROUGH ROWS OF HEADSTONES.  
           SMASHING THEM TO DUST.  FARALLON WIDE EYED.  RAISING HIS GUN.  
           AIMING INTO THE WINDSHIELD.  INTO CAROLINE’S FACE.  

           Caroline STOMPS THE GAS.  SLAMS HEADLONG INTO A TOWERING 
           OBELISK.  JOLTS TO A STOP.  PINNING Farallon between the car 
           and the stone monument. 

           Blood ERUPTS FROM HIS THROAT IN A SHOUT.  His gun flies.  
           Lands by the windshield wipers.  He hyper-extends for it.

           Caroline throws the car in reverse.  Rear tires spinning in 
           divots of sand.  Zero traction.

           Farallon’s fingers brush the gun.
           Caroline cuffed to the wheel.  Wrist skin bunching purple-
           white.  Trying to wrench free.

           Farallon, gun in hand, getting a firing grip as...

           Charlie steps beside the car, leveling the grenade launcher.  
           Flush against Farallon’s foaming red mouth.  Charlie looks 
           down at Caroline, says...

                                 CHARLIE
                        Close your eyes.

           She does.  Tight.  SHOCKBURST fluttering through the pink of 
           her eyelids.  Lee Farallon EXPLODING FROM EXISTENCE.

           Caroline opens her eyes.  Charlie floods through the driver’s 
           door.  Engulfs her in his arms.  Kissing her, all over her 
           face.  There is blood trickling from her lip.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re bleeding.  Are you okay?

                                 CAROLINE
                        I’m fine.  I just had to hot wire 
                        this car with my face.

           She touches the flares on his chest. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s a fake bomb I made.

           They look at each other.  Study each other.  As though 
           discovering curious new life forms.  They hold each other.  
           And kiss each other.  The way married couples always do after 
           annihilating two hellbent psychopaths, then realizing they 
           are finally safe and alone and at the bottom of a corpse-
           filled astroid crater.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. MEXICAN GAS STATION - DAY

           A tiny gas station.  Its signs hand-painted in Spanish.  
           Endless scrub desert in every direction.  Blazing white.

           A PLYMOUTH BARRACUDA, caked with a thousand miles of wind-
           streaked filth, pulls to a stop alongside a pump.

           Caroline exits the driver’s seat, dressed in jeans and a Baja 
           surfer poncho.  Starts filling up the gas tank.  Charlie 
           exits the passenger side.  Stretches, good and long.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ve been thinking.
                                 CAROLINE
                        About what?

                                 CHARLIE
                        We should stop paying for gas.  
                        We’re getting low on cash.  And 
                        it’s a long way to Peru.

                                 CAROLINE
                        We’re outlaws.  Not petty gasoline 
                        thieves.

                                 CHARLIE
                        But the best thing about being 
                        outlaws is we can just steal 
                        whatever we want.

                                 CAROLINE
                        No.  Not all outlaws steal and 
                        kill.  Especially not wrongfully 
                        accused ones like us.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Uh...in the last couple days, 
                        between the two of us, we’ve stolen 
                        three cars, kidnapped a prostitute, 
                        and killed two men.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Okay, starting right now...no more 
                        stealing.  Definitely no more 
                        killing.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Starting right now?

           She looks at her watch.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Starting right...  Now.

           Charlie nods.  Watches an old, desert-beaten pick-up truck 
           grumble into the gas station lot.

                                 CAROLINE
                        You know what...there’s a gas can 
                        in the trunk.  Let’s fill it 
                        up...just in case.  Seems Mexicans 
                        prefer about a billion miles of 
                        road between each of their gas 
                        stations.

           Charlie opens the trunk.  His jaw drops through the ground.
           FLASH TO:

           Ward Oates, standing outside TAT SPECTOR’S MANSION, just 
           after Charlie escaped.  EXPLODED CHEVY NOVA burning in the 
           background.  The one that took out Underhill and the case.

           Fire DRIPS FROM ABOVE.  Oates looks up.  SOMETHING is caught 
           in a palm tree.  Something partially on fire.   Oates aims 
           up.  Oates shoots at this something.  It falls.  

           A BLACK, HARD-SHELL, PORSCHE SUITCASE LANDS AT OATES’ FEET.  

           BACK TO GAS STATION

           Charlie lifts the semi-charred suitcase out of the trunk.  
           Shows it to Caroline, who is sitting half-in and half-out of 
           the driver’s door, waiting for the tank to fill.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Where’d this come from?

           Caroline shrugs, bewildered.

                                 CAROLINE
                        He must have put it in there.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You didn’t notice?

                                 CAROLINE
                        I was handcuffed and doubled over 
                        in pain from being punched in the 
                        stomach.  Sorry.
                            (then)
                        What is it?

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s the--

           --BANG!

           Charlie whirls.  TWO MEXICAN BANDITS advancing on him.  
           Bandanas masking their faces.  Six-shooters up.  Barking in 
           Spanish.  Their unmanned PICK-UP TRUCK rumbling behind them.  

           The Bandits motion to the suitcase: throw it to us.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay...okay...relax...rela--

           --BWAAAAAAAM!

           The Bandits DISINTEGRATE INTO A BLIZZARD OF RED CONFETTI.

           Charlie turns.  Dumbstruck.  
           Caroline, arm extended over the roof of the Barracuda, is 
           still aiming the SMOKING GRENADE LAUNCHER.  She checks her 
           watch. 

                                 CAROLINE
                        Starting right... now.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                         THE END
