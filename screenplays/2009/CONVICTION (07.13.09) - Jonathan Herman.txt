                      My Daddy was a bank robber 

                      But he never hurt nobody

                      He just loved to live that way

                      And he loved to steal your money

                      THE CLASH
           INT. MAHOGANY BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN

           A YOUNG WOMAN lies on her side in bed, asleep.  She’s 
           beautiful, olive-skinned, late twenties.  This is ROSALIE.    

                             PATRICK’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Don’t wake up.  

           A MAN’S HEAD leans in-- we can’t see him, it’s too dark-- and 
           kisses her forehead.  Kisses her hair.  Disappears.  

           INT. BRIGHT ROOM - MORNING

           The following SEQUENCE will be CROSS-CUT: 

           TWO MEN sit, side-by-side, in tall, barber-style chairs.  

           PATRICK GAUTREAUX is Caucasian, 45, salt and pepper, ruggedly 
           handsome, glinting green eyes, crows feet.  

           BOBBY “BOMB” HARDAWAY is Black, 25, baby-faced, shaved head, 
           large brown eyes that see everything, yet reveal nothing.  

                             PATRICK
                        Hit me. 

           Hands reach into frame, a brush applies adherent to Patrick’s  *
           nose.  The hands press a LATEX FACIAL PROSTHESIS into place--     *

           INT. SMALL PINK BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN

           A small pink BED, where a curly-haired 3-YEAR-OLD GIRL is 
           curled into a ball, clutching a purple blanket.  GIGI.    

           PATRICK leans down, kisses his daughter softly on the head.  
           Gigi stirs, and makes a happy, sleepy noise.  

           EXT. BROADWAY - CHINATOWN - DAY

           A big brown LINCOLN idles at a meter spot on the bustling 
           Downtown Los Angeles thoroughfare.  

           The STREETS and SIDEWALKS are clogged with Chinese vendors, 
           tourists, locals, immigrants, of all creeds and colors.    

           In the background, there’s a large REGENCY TRUST branch, 
           designed PAGODA-STYLE, like all the buildings around here.   

           And rumbling outside the branch, an idling BRINKS TRUCK, an 
           ARMED GUARD standing beside, hand resting on his sidearm.  
           INSIDE the LINCOLN-- seen in quick CLOSE-UPS-- 

           An EAR with an EARPIECE inside.  A POLICE RADIO mounted to 
           the DASH.  FINGERS punch a message into an IPHONE.  

                             BOMB’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Nine minutes to Larry.  Solid.     

           INT. BRIGHT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Bomb now wears a short, conservative Afro.  It’s a WIG.  A 
           BRUSH applies a DARKER SKIN TONE to his face.  

                             PATRICK (O.S.)
                        You always do me proud, Bobby.  

           The brush applies adherent to Bomb’s upper lip.  A thin 
           stripe of MOUSTACHE is pressed into place.   

           INT. BROWN LINCOLN - CHINATOWN - DAY

           Close on the Driver: DORCHESTER, mid-40s, pale-skinned, 
           thickly built, ruddy creased face, too much time in the sun.    *

           He pops a Nicorette in his mouth, chews.  The police radio 
           SQUAWKS a call.  Dorchester turns it down.      

                             PATRICK’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        We’re all up to speed, Dorch?  All 
                        the chutes and ladders?   

                             DORCHESTER
                        (bit of a twang)
                        Shit yeah, Boss.  Two alternate 
                        exits, easy-flow to the Secondary.  

           OUTSIDE, we see the BRINKS TRUCK pull out of the parking lot 
           and disappear into traffic-- 

           INT. BRIGHT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           We see Patrick and Bomb from behind, side by side, as the 
           unseen MAKE-UP ARTIST applies finishing touches.  

                             BOMB
                        I’m still too good-lookin.

                             PATRICK
                        Like Bill Cosby’s retarded nephew.  
           They both start laughing.  It’s familiar banter.  

           INT./EXT. - BROWN LINCOLN - CHINATOWN - DAY

           Patrick emerges from the Lincoln, carrying a briefcase.  He 
           walks up the incline toward the bank. 

           Compared to the Patrick we met in the first frame of this 
           movie, he is a stranger.  Unrecognizable.  

           INT. REGENCY TRUST - DAY

           DISGUISED PATRICK stands at the counter, filling out a 
           deposit slip, his eyes clocking the BANK LOBBY:

           The line of CUSTOMERS.  The TELLERS.  The SERVICE DESKS.  The  *
           bored-looking GUARD by the door-- doughy, crew-cut, late 30s.   *

           Patrick stares at the Guard a moment.  Smiles.    

           DISGUISED BOMB enters the lobby.  Wanders over to where 
           Patrick is standing, starts filling out his own slip.  

           When they talk, it’s sotto, and they don’t make eye contact.   *

                             BOMB
                        Guard looks extra-sleepy today.  

                             PATRICK
                        Perfect.  Let’s keep it puckered.  
                        Parade kicks off in five.  

           FOLLOW Patrick as he peels off from the counter and 
           approaches one of the Service desks--  

           INT./EXT. BROWN LINCOLN - CHINATOWN - DAY

           Dorchester sits adjusting the volume on the police radio.  

           He digs around inside a small backpack beside him.  He pulls 
           something out-- a fat, chunky GLOCK.  

           He lays the pistol on the seat, digs further through the 
           backpack, comes up with a Snickers.  He grins, because he’s 
           hungry, and Snickers always satisfies.   
           INT. REGENCY TRUST - DAY

           Patrick sits at the desk of LARRY DENNIS, 33, the red-headed, 
           fresh-faced CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER.    

                             LARRY DENNIS
                        It’s terrific, finally putting a 
                        face to the name, Doctor Hodge.  

                             PATRICK
                        Likewise, Mr. Dennis.  

                             LARRY DENNIS
                        Please, call me Larry.  

                             PATRICK
                        Okay, Larry.  Only my patients call 
                        me Doctor.  You can call me 
                        Nicholas.  Or just... Nicky.    

           Larry’s smile is full of twinkles and dimples.    

                             LARRY DENNIS
                        Well.  That should be easy to 
                        remember!  That’s my son’s name.   

           Patrick returns Larry’s exuberant grin.  

                             PATRICK
                        I know.  

           Larry’s smile falters a bit.  

                             LARRY DENNIS
                        Oh.  Did I tell you about him?   

                             PATRICK
                        No, Larry.  You’ve never told me 
                        any of the numerous things I know 
                        about your son Nicky.  

           Larry tries to maintain his smile, even though the 
           conversation has somehow... taken a turn.  

                             LARRY DENNIS
                        I’m sorry?  

                             PATRICK
                        No need to apologize.  Just relax,   
                        and breathe through the nose.  

           Larry’s eyes begin to dart around.  
                             PATRICK
                        Keep your eyes on me, Larry.  

           From Larry’s computer, a CHIME sounds.  

                             PATRICK
                        You got an E-mail.  Open it.   

           Larry’s hand trembles as he points and clicks.  

           On his SCREEN, a PHOTO loads:  A ranch-style suburban HOUSE.    *

                             LARRY DENNIS
                        Oh.  (beat)  Jesus. 

           Another picture LOADS:  A PLAYGROUND, a YOUNG WOMAN pushing a 
           TOW-HEADED BOY on a swing.  

                             PATRICK
                        Your wife, Denise.  Used to be a 
                        lawyer.  Now she’s just a Mommy.

           Larry groans softly.   

                             PATRICK
                        But you prefer it that way, right?  
                        You’re the bread-winner now.     

           Larry just stares at him, glazed, numb.  

                             PATRICK
                        I’ve done this many times before.  
                        There’s a system.  It’s tested, 
                        it’s perfect, and I’m not alone.  
                        My friend, black fellow, glasses, 
                        he’s over by the slips.  See him?  

           Larry’s eyes flick over to where BOMB is standing.  Bomb 
           SMILES at him, and gives him a little SALUTE.   

                             PATRICK
                        Good, you see him.  Now, you’re 
                        gonna have to hold your shit 
                        together for the next few minutes.  
                        Or else one of us is gonna have to 
                        make a call.  Nod yes if you 
                        understand, Larry.  

           Larry slowly nods.  
                             PATRICK
                        And you’d never do something silly 
                        like punch the 2-11 button under 
                        your desk, or that pager on your 
                        hip, right?  (beat)  Hey, isn’t it 
                        Nicky’s birthday next Wednesday?  
                        Whatcha gonna get the little guy?   

           Larry THROWS UP IN HIS MOUTH, just a little bit, but manages 
           to swallow it back down.  

                             PATRICK
                        Wow, Larry.  Nicely done.    

                             LARRY DENNIS
                        Oh God.  

           BOMB appears behind Patrick, smiling warmly at Larry.   

                             PATRICK
                        Larry, this is my friend, Smokey.  

                             BOMB
                        Hi, Larry! 

           Larry stares blankly at Bomb.  

                             PATRICK
                        We’re gonna play pretend.  Smokey’s 
                        a tourist, and you’re the ever-so-
                        helpful tour guide.  You’re gonna 
                        show him all the sights.  

                             LARRY DENNIS
                        Please.  I can’t--

                             BOMB
                        Starting with the Counting Room.  
                        That’s where you’re holding all the 
                        tasty, crispy depo paper that 
                        Brinks dropped off ten minutes ago.  
                        (beat)  So whadaya say?  Will you 
                        be my tour guide?  

           EXT. BROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Dorchester still idles at the curb, chewing the Snickers, 
           fiddling with the police radio dial.  Outside, the sound of 
           RHYTHMIC DRUMMING begins, quietly at first, growing LOUDER.

           In the background, a small CROWD has amassed-- it’s a PARADE 
           of Chinese and Chinese-Americans, beating DRUMS and CYMBALS.   *
           Dorchester speaks into a tiny TRANSMITTER on his collar. 

                             DORCHESTER
                        Starting up now.  

           He puts the Lincoln into gear, and slowly ROLLS into the 
           PARKING LOT adjacent to the BANK. 

           INT. REGENCY TRUST - CONTINUOUS

           Patrick puts a finger to his earpiece, and NODS to Bomb.  

                             BOMB
                        On your feet, Larry.  Here we go.    

           INT. REGENCY TRUST - VAULT - CONTINUOUS

           Bomb follows a drawn Larry Dennis past rows of safety-deposit  *
           boxes, which line the wall adjacent to the VAULT.

           Passing bank EMPLOYEES, who barely notice them-- it’s not 
           uncommon for the CSM to escort clients back here--

           They find a DOOR, and Larry fumbles his keys--

                             BOMB
                        Easy, Larry.  Easy--  

           Larry lets out a tiny moan, finally opens the door--

           Into the COUNTING ROOM--

           Where four shrink-wrapped BRICKS OF CASH sits upon a STEEL 
           TABLE next to a COUNTING MACHINE and several double-locked 
           steel BURGHER BOXES which stand OPEN, waiting to be filled.  

           Bomb’s eyes SPARKLE at the CHUNKS OF GREEN-- all HUNDREDS-- 

           He opens his briefcase on the steel table, SWEEPS open a 
           COLLAPSED DUFFEL, like a pillowcase--

           EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Dorchester slowly inches forward, positioning himself beside 
           an EMPTY ALLEY that leads beneath the elevated RED LINE.  

           Behind him, the CROWD has SWELLED, joined by LION DANCERS and  *
           black-masked DRUMMERS, and the din grows LOUDER--
                             VOICE (O.S.)
                        Can’t park there, guy.  

           Dorchester turns to see a young, red-vested PARKING ATTENDANT  *
           standing just outside the passenger window.  

                             DORCHESTER
                        Say what, Brother?  

                             ATTENDANT
                        You’re in a red...uh--

           The Attendant starts to BACK AWAY, because he’s just noticed 
           Dorchester’s GLOCK laying on the seat.  

                             ATTENDANT (CONT’D)
                        Oh.  Shit.      

           Dorchester quickly grabs the Glock, AIMS it at the Attendant.

                             DORCHESTER
                        How bout you stand right there and 
                        don’t move an inch.  

           The Attendant freezes, stares at Dorchester, eyes popped.  

           Dorchester keeps one hand on the wheel, the other on the 
           Glock pointed at the Attendant, brain ticking--

                             DORCHESTER
                        (into transmitter)
                        Got a wrinkle out here, Boss.     

           POP-POP-POP as FIRECRACKERS start going off in the parade, 
           and the Attendant flinches--

           INT. REGENCY TRUST - CONTINUOUS

           Patrick hears the news, but his demeanor stays cool.  He sees  *
           the GUARD across the lobby strolling toward the VAULT. 

           He quickly approaches the Guard, gets in front of him--

                             PATRICK
                        Sir, what’s going on out there?  

           The Guard shrugs, rolls his eyes, exasperated--

                             GUARD
                        Every time someone gets married, 
                        opens a shop, or farts, these folks 
                        blow shit up and have a parade.  
           Patrick taps his transmitter as he continues--

                             PATRICK
                        I should get out of here before 
                        things really start tipping over!

           The Guard frowns at Patrick, confused, like huh? 

           INT. VAULT - CONTINUOUS

           Bomb HEARS Patrick’s warning, and quickly SHOVES the last 
           bricks of CASH into the duffel, but SETS ONE ASIDE--

                             BOMB
                        Alright, now, let’s hit it--

           Bomb ZIPS the bag and PUSHES LARRY out the door ahead of him-- *

           EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Dorchester’s still COVERING the wobbly-kneed Attendant, while  *
           still clocking the bank entrance--

                             ATTENDANT
                        Please don’t shoot--

                             DORCHESTER
                        I’m still deciding.      

           INT. REGENCY TRUST - CONTINUOUS

           Larry Dennis emerges, robotic, from the rear of the bank, 
           followed by BOMB, who hauls a bulging DUFFEL slung across his  *
           shoulder, he searches the lobby--

           And sees PATRICK standing by the DOOR, looking at him, 
           tapping his watch--

                             BOMB
                        It’s time for that thing we talked 
                        about, Larry. 

           Bomb slides a thick BAND OF CASH into Larry’s hands--

                             LARRY DENNIS
                        I really don’t want to--

                             BOMB
                        Yeah, I know.  Don’t fuck it up.  
           Bomb peels off from Larry, picks up speed as he crosses the 
           lobby toward Patrick, who is holding the door open--

           Find the GUARD as he notices Bomb hauling the duffel rapidly 
           toward the front door.  He frowns, instinct kicking in, and 
           he strides toward Bomb--

                             LARRY DENNIS’ VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey, Joey--

           The Guard turns to see LARRY standing in front of him, his 
           face pale, holding the CASH-BAND.  

           Larry abruptly SLIDES THE CASH-BAND into the Guard’s front 
           shirt pocket, and quickly backs away--  

           The Guard pulls out the CASH, looks at it, baffled--  

                             GUARD
                        Larry, what the fuck--

           Larry hits the 2-11 PAGER on his BELT, and there’s a high-
           pitched WHINE as the SILENT ALARM is TRIGGERED--

                             LARRY DENNIS
                        I’m sorry!

           POP!  The DYE PACK inside the cash EXPLODES in a BRIGHT RED 
           MIST that BLASTS the Guard and KNOCKS him onto his back--

           EXT. REGENCY TRUST - CONTINUOUS

           Patrick and Bomb make it OUTSIDE, where it’s REALLY LOUD with  *
           the DRUMS and the CYMBALS and the CHEERS of the crowd--

           Dorchester sees them coming, so he quickly HOPS OUT, keeping 
           his GLOCK pinned on the ATTENDANT, he OPENS the DOORS--

                             DORCHESTER
                        Exits still clean, boss--

           Bomb HURLS the duffel into the back of the Lincoln, and 
           suddenly the Attendant starts HOLLERING--

                             ATTENDANT
                        Over here, over here, HELP!

                             BOMB
                        Shut the fuck up--

           Bomb SMASHES the Attendant with a vicious ROUNDHOUSE to the 
           jaw, and the dude crumples to the ground--
                             GUARD (O.S.)
                        ALL OF YOU FUCKING FREEZE! 

           Reveal the GUARD, staggering out into the parking lot, wiping  *
           the RED DYE from his burning eyes--

                             GUARD
                        I swear to fucking Christ I’m gonna 
                        SHOOT ANYTHING THAT MOVES--

           He’s AIMING his SIDEARM at them, half-blind, trembling with 
           rage and we never thought this doughy chump had it in him--

           Patrick and Bomb DUCK behind the car, while Dorchester 
           CROUCHES behind the driver-door, using it as a SHIELD--

                             DORCHESTER
                        Take it easy, Cochise--

           Suddenly some FIRECRACKERS go off nearby, BANGBANGBANGBANG! 

           The Guard, confused, dizzy, thinks they’re SHOOTING at him, 
           so he FIRES WILDLY AT THE LINCOLN POW-POW-POW!

           The BULLETS pepper the car, and Dorchester pops up from 
           behind the door and BLASTS a round at the Guard, catching him  *
           in the side--

           The Guard GRUNTS and collapses to the pavement, still 
           clutching his sidearm--

           And now dozens of BYSTANDERS have noticed the GUNFIRE and 
           they start to SCREAM and SCATTER off of BROADWAY--

                             PATRICK
                        NOW, before we lose the exits--

           Dorchester climbs back behind the wheel--

                             DORCHESTER
                        We’re good, Boss, we’re good--

           BLAM!  DORCHESTER’S HEAD POPS OPEN, SPRAYING THE INTERIOR--

           Reveal the GUARD, flat on his back, his SMOKING SIDEARM 
           pointed where Dorchester’s head used to be--

           Dorchester SPASMS as he DIES, his foot MASHES the gas pedal, 
           and the Lincoln LURCHES FORWARD, screeches across the lot and  *
           SMASHES into a row of parked cars--

           Patrick and Bomb find themselves suddenly EXPOSED as they 
           RACE across the lot toward the smashed Lincoln--
                             BOMB
                        THE PAPER--

           They reach the Lincoln, Bomb yanks open the back door, grabs 
           the DUFFEL while Patrick feels for Dorch’s pulse, finds none-- *

                             PATRICK
                        Shit, Dorch, I’m sorry--

           BLAM! BLAM!  The Guard is SHOOTING AGAIN-- 

           Patrick TAKES TWO ROUNDS in his BACK-- He TOPPLES AGAINST THE  *
           CAR, smearing BLOOD all over the windows--

                             BOMB (CONT’D)
                        GOAT!

           CLUNK.  The Guard’s SIDEARM LANDS on the PAVEMENT, he blinks 
           at the sky, blood bubbling from his lips--

           Bomb grabs Patrick, GRUNTING with exertion as he attempts to 
           haul both Patrick and the Duffel into the TEEMING CROWD--

                             BOMB
                        Gotta keep moving, gotta keep--

           Now there is a PHALANX of POLICEMEN forcing their way through  *
           the crowd, weapons drawn, making their way toward them--

           Up ABOVE, the sound of an ELEVATED RED LINE TRAIN grinding 
           into the CHINATOWN STATION, Bomb SEES it--

           They reach the STAIRS that lead to the PLATFORM, and there’s 
           a lot of them, but Bomb still tries to haul Patrick up--

                             PATRICK
                        Bobby....  

           Patrick’s bleeding like mad, quickly going into shock, he 
           CRUMPLES onto the stairs--

           Bomb looks up, sees the TRAIN sliding into the platform--

                             BOMB
                        I got you.  Come on.  

           Patrick shakes his head, levels a look at Bomb that is 
           absolute ice-cold Business.  

                             PATRICK
                        You can’t help me.  Bobby.  You 
                        have.  Five.  Seconds.  
           Bomb gapes at him, disbelieving.  His eyes fill with tears.  

                             PATRICK
                        GO.  

           They HOLD their locked-eyed STARE-- 

           Bomb HAULS the Duffel up the rest of the stairs, as the COPS 
           push their way toward him, guns out, SHOUTING--

           Patrick opens his PALM, and we see he’s holding a tightly-
           wadded CHUNK OF CASH, which he FLICKS into the air--

           The MONEY FLUTTERS outward, and suddenly all the bystanders 
           are DIVING for the bills, teeming, squealing, making it all 
           but impossible for the COPS to get past--

           Hold on Patrick, amidst the chaos of humanity, as he gazes up  *
           at the RED LINE TRAIN, as the doors close, and it PULLS AWAY 
           from the station--

           And the COPS finally push through and surround him, and try 
           to pile up the stairs, but it’s too late, and Patrick almost 
           manages to smile, just before he loses consciousness--

                             PATRICK
                        God damn.  

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Patrick lies in a hospital bed, his body wrapped in BANDAGES, 
           with TUBES draining fluids, his eyes dope-glazed.  

           A bored UNIFORMED OFFICER sits in a chair in the corner.  
           Hard RAIN pounds against the window.  

           A muscular black MALE NURSE bends over Patrick, checks the  
           tubing.  Patrick’s eyes swim over to him.  

                             PATRICK
                        Rosalie.  (beat)  My wife.     

           The Nurse shakes his head, offers a sad smile.  

                             MALE NURSE
                        No visitors allowed, cuz.  It’s 
                        bullshit, but it is what it is.

           The Nurse lays a sympathetic hand on Patrick’s shoulder, 
           leaves, and Patrick’s eyes drift to the wall-mounted TV--
           Where a NEWSCAST is playing, and a picture of PATRICK fills 
           the screen-- fully EXPOSED to the world--

                             NEWSCASTER
                        ...assisting the FBI in the 
                        nationwide search for Patrick 
                        Gautreaux’s as-yet-unidentified 
                        accomplice who escaped the scene 
                        undetected.  The deadly South Bay 
                        bank heist claimed the life of one 
                        robber and left a moonlighting off-
                        duty police officer with two-year 
                        old twin daughters in a coma... 

           Patrick’s bleary eyes stutter closed, as consciousness fades.

                             PATRICK
                        Rosalie...

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           RAIN pours from the sky, unrelenting.  The Hospital glows 
           dimly in the background.  

           Find BOMB crouched in the bushes, pelted by rain, shivering.   *
           He watches the building.  And then suddenly, without a sound-- *

           He’s gone.  

                             VOICE (O.S.)
                        Good morning, Sunshine.   

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Patrick GRUNTS AWAKE in bed.  About a week has passed, and he 
           looks healthier.  

                             VOICE (O.S.)
                        Heard they took out your spleen.   

           Now Patrick sees the TALL MAN standing in the doorway.  Lean,  *
           hungry-looking, pale blue eyes, thinning, wispy blond hair, 
           charcoal suit.  AGENT JACOB PLANT, 32, F.B.I.   

                             PATRICK
                        That comb-over.  Young fellow like 
                        you?  Go with the Kojak.  Folks 
                        might take you more serious.  

           Plant clenches his jaw.   
                             PLANT
                        Thanks for the advice.  

                             PATRICK
                        My pleasure, Agent Plant.    

           Plant nods, gives Patrick a good, long look.  

                             PLANT
                        Been waiting a long time to see you 
                        all opened up like this.    

           Patrick stares back at Plant, inscrutable.  

                             PATRICK
                        Seem pretty proud of yourself.    
                        Like you actually had something to 
                        do with it.   

                             PLANT
                        I’d say I had plenty to do with it.  
                        Because here I am.  Halfway to the 
                        biggest collar of my career.  After 
                        you help me with the other half, 
                        things might get softer for you.  

           Patrick chuckles, amused, stoned on pills.   

                             PATRICK
                        You gotta be kidding me.   

                             PLANT
                        Look, Patrick--

                             PATRICK
                        I’m your elder, son.  Show some 
                        respect.  Mr. Gautreaux would be 
                        fine.  Sir would be better.  

           Plant glares.  He cracks his knuckles, pop, pop, pop.   

                             PLANT
                        Got a lot of cheek for someone 
                        about to stand before the Man.  
                        You’re gonna get fifteen years, 
                        easy.  That pretty wife of yours, 
                        how long you think she’s gonna wait 
                        around?  No man in her bed?  

           Patrick stares back, impassive.  

                             PATRICK
                        That’s some real tough talk.  
                             PLANT
                        Whatever.  This was just a courtesy 
                        call.  Truth is, I don’t need you 
                        to catch him.  Do it on my own. 

           Patrick studies him, grins.  

                             PATRICK
                        Let me know how that works out.  

                             PLANT
                        You don’t believe me?

                             PATRICK
                        Please.  I don’t even think you 
                        believe you.  You’re too green, and 
                        you don’t have the sand for it.  

           Plant stands up, heads for the door.  He’s had enough.  

                             PLANT
                        You’ll be transferred to Men’s 
                        Central to await your arraignment 
                        and trial.  You’ll be riding the 
                        bus Upstate by month’s end.   

                             PATRICK
                        I’ll send you a postcard.  

                             PLANT
                        Yeah, you’re such a hero.  (beat)   
                        Pathetic.      

                             PATRICK
                        That’s right, kid, get in your 
                        licks.  Make it count.    

                             PLANT
                        You’re fucked.  You’re gonna watch 
                        your kid grow up from behind 
                        Plexiglas.  And you better hope to 
                        God that cop doesn’t die.  

           And Plant is gone.  Patrick lays there, jaw clenched. 

           EXT. CONTAINER SHIP - OPEN OCEAN - DAY

           A gigantic RED CARGO SHIP, carrying 10,000 T.E.U. containers,  *
           churns through the rough black water at 20 knots.  
           MOVE CLOSER, toward the aft end of the ship, where BOMB is 
           leaning against the railing.  Thick black parka, black knit 
           cap, eyes hard, determined, with a knife edge of fear.  

           He SPITS over the side, watches it fall--

           EXT. MEN’S CENTRAL JAIL - DAY

           A Department of Corrections BUS slowly rumbles out of the 
           gates of L.A. MEN’S CENTRAL JAIL.  

           Find PATRICK in the back of the BUS, staring through the mesh- *
           covered window at a WOMAN standing on the sidewalk outside. 

           It’s ROSALIE, holding GIGI in her arms.  

           Patrick touches his lips, puts his fingers to the mesh on the  *
           windows.  Rosalie holds Gigi tighter, and nods.  

           Even without words, their communication is visceral, potent.   *

                                                SMASH TO BLACK.

           EXT. LOMPOC - DAY

           Establish a low-slung PRISON, few windows, sun-blasted glare.  

           TITLE BURN: 

           Maximum Security Penitentiary, Lompoc, California

           Slowly, slowly, we CREEP IN toward the grim compound.  

           NEW TITLE BURN:        EIGHTEEN MONTHS LATER

           INT. CELL - LOMPOC 

           An 8 x 10 foot CELL.  One tiny slit of a window.  

           On the narrow bed, PATRICK reclines, reading a book.  Hard 
           eyes, full salt & pepper beard, PRISON INK on his forearms.  

           Taped to the walls: a few postcards and a child’s DRAWINGS:  
           Stick figure families, a house with a chimney, smiling suns.  

           A CLANK as a METAL FLAP in his cell door opens, and a tray of 
           food slides in.  Patrick sets down his book.  
           EXT. YARD - LOMPOC 

           Patrick is escorted into the SEGREGATED YARD.  A small area, 
           surrounded by tall cement walls.  He’s the only one there.  

           He closes his eyes, tilts his face upward, into the sun--   

           EXT. CITY OF COMMERCE - EARLY IN THE MORNING

           Establish the COMMERCE CASINO, the sparsely-filled parking 
           lot, late-night gamblers staggering out into the morning 
           light, while early-risers arrive at the doors.  

           INT. COMMERCE CASINO - CONTINUOUS

           It’s SHIFT-CHANGE time at the CASHIER CAGE, and TWO ARMED 
           GUARDS stand watch while a female CASHIER unlocks the cage 
           from the inside. 

           A professorial-looking BLACK MAN-- moustache, thick glasses, 
           afro-- wanders over, smiling, it’s none other than BOBBY 
           HARDAWAY, fully disguised, unrecognizable to everyone but us.  *

                             BOMB
                        Hello.  Where’s the poker room? 

           The Guards glance at Bomb, bored, tired, failing to notice 
           the TALL, GORGEOUS REDHEAD striding up behind them--

                             GUARD ONE
                        Across the lobby over there.  But 
                        it ain’t open until eleven--   

           SNICK-SNICK.  The REDHEAD is now standing behind them, 
           brandishing TWO PISTOLS, one barrel for each Guard’s HEAD.     *

           The CASHIER’s eyes go wide, she tries to CLOSE the cage, but 
           Bomb’s already WEDGED himself inside, brandishing a PISTOL--

                             BOMB
                        Lie down on your belly, please.  

           The Cashier obeys, shivering--

                             GUARD TWO
                        Are you friggin crazy?  Can’t rob 
                        this place, there’s eyes everywh--

           The Redhead CLOCKS the Guard’s skull with the Pistol, and he 
           DROPS to the ground.  
                             REDHEAD
                        (Euro accent)
                        Shut your gob, sweetie.  

           Bomb bends to the Cashier, unhooks the KEYS from her belt, 
           quickly goes about UNLOCKING several mesh-covered GRATES 
           which cover rows of DRAWERS containing banded STACKS OF CASH.  *

                             BOMB
                        Ringa-ding-ding.  

           Outside the CAGE, two more GUARDS are approaching, trailed by  *
           two tight-suited PIT BOSSES, holy shit that was fast--

                             REDHEAD
                        (to Bomb)
                        Ten seconds. 

           Bomb is now piling the banded stacks into a bulging SACK--

           The approaching GUARDS, visibly amped-up are now brandishing 
           SIDEARMS and maneuvering into COVERING STANCES--

                             ARMED GUARDS
                        FREEZE RIGHT THERE!  DON’T MOVE!

           Suddenly a LARGE MUSCULAR DUDE wearing a BALACLAVA pops up 
           behind the armed guards, brandishing an ASSAULT RIFLE--

           POW-POW-POW-POW-POW-POW!  He unleashes a FUSILLADE of SEMI-
           AUTOMATIC FIRE over their heads--

           The ARMED GUARDS and the PIT BOSSES hit the deck, covering 
           their heads as DEBRIS rains down upon them, and now the 
           assorted PATRONS start SCREAMING and SCATTERING--

           ALARMS start BLARING, and BALACLAVA DUDE tosses a FLASH-BANG 
           SMOKE GRENADE into the fray--

           BOOOSH!  The GRENADE EXPLODES in a BLINDING FLASH, more 
           SCREAMS from the PATRONS as the THICK SMOKE unfurls through 
           the air, obscuring everything--

           INT. CASINO - HIGH ANGLE

           The SOUND DROPS OUT as we assume a GOD-LIKE PERSPECTIVE of 
           the casino floor, the mayhem unfolding below--

           As BOMB and the REDHEAD and BALACLAVA DUDE make their way 
           toward the exit, out of frame--
                             PLANT’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Freeze it right there.  

           The image FREEZES on BOMB, in full DISGUISE, momentarily 
           LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO THE CAMERA, flashing his TEETH.

                             PLANT’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Am I seeing things, or is that 
                        douchebag smiling at me?   

           PULL BACK to REVEAL:  

           AN FBI TECH LAB.  

           AGENT PLANT, his skull now SHAVED CLEAN, hovers over the 
           shoulder of a Junior Agent, TAK KIYOSHI, 27.  

           Eyes glued to a large FLATSCREEN showing a PLAYBACK of the 
           CASINO SECURITY CAMERA.    

                             KIYOSHI
                        Back in the Southland.  Looks like 
                        he’s diversifying.   

                             PLANT
                        Banks just don’t get his rocks off 
                        anymore.  Or he’s got himself a 
                        death wish.  Either way, our friend 
                        has audacity. 

           INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Up on the 17th floor, in the FBI’s L.A. BUREAU--  

           Plant hurries down the hallway to a large OFFICE, occupied by 
           BUREAU CHIEF SAMUEL ZORN, 52, ginger hair, glasses.  He’s in 
           the midst of paging through a thick DOSSIER.  

                             PLANT
                        There’s a window here, sir.  It’s 
                        not staying open for long.  

           Zorn stares off, tapping a pen against his forehead.  

                             ZORN
                        Jacob, I like you.  You’re 
                        tenacious as a barnacle.  But he’s 
                        been making assholes out of us for 
                        a long time.  Especially you.  
                        Maybe you’re a little too close--
                             PLANT
                        Sir--

                             ZORN
                        I’d love to have you down in El 
                        Paso, we’ve got a string--

                             PLANT
                        Fuck Texas, Sir.  I want him.  
                        (beat)  And we both know he’s not 
                        gonna stop.   

           Zorn studies Plant, the fire behind his eyes.  

                             ZORN
                        We won’t be able to just pick him 
                        up off the street.  If his hand 
                        isn’t in the cookie jar, we’re 
                        sunk.  And by “we”, I mean you, and 
                        your career.  Still with me?   

           Pop, Pop, Pop, Plant cracks his knuckles, stares.     

                             ZORN
                        Oughtta cut that out.  Give 
                        yourself carpal tunnel.   

                             PLANT
                        Sir. 

           BEAT.  

                             ZORN
                        I’ll make some calls.  

           Plant slaps the desk, vindicated, eyes glittering.  

           INT. LOMPOC - VISITING ROOM - DAY

           Small windowless room, steel picnic table bolted to the 
           floor.  On one side, Patrick sits, arms crossed, and on the 
           other, Agent Plant, with the DOSSIER in front of him.   

                             PLANT
                        How’s Rosalie holding up?  And 
                        Gigi?  What’s she now, about five?  

           Patrick narrows his eyes, cocks his head, smiles.  

                             PATRICK
                        Came all the way up here to talk 
                        about my family?    
                             PLANT
                        Actually, I’d like to talk about 
                        your boy, Bomb.  

                             PATRICK
                        My “boy”?  Really, Plant.  Some 
                        folks might think you’re a racist.  

                             PLANT
                        Not you, though.  You’re no racist.  
                        More like a...savior.  Plucked him 
                        straight out the ghetto, when he 
                        was just a shawty.  Taught him how 
                        to steal like a white man.   

           Patrick chuckles amiably.    

                             PATRICK
                        You sure do talk like an asshole.       

           Plant opens his dossier and slides a SECURITY-CAM STILL 
           across the table.  Patrick looks at it.   

                             PLANT
                        That’s six months ago.  Winston-
                        Salem.  Walked out with 260 large.   

           Patrick can’t help but smile.  Plant notices, but says 
           nothing.  Lays out more STILLS, one after the other. 

                             PLANT
                        Five weeks later.  Nashville West 
                        S&L.  That was 320.  Here’s 
                        Jefferson City, three weeks later.  
                        Here’s Tulsa.  Amarillo.  Tempe.   

           Plant eyeballs Patrick for a moment, then lays out ONE MORE 
           STILL.  This one... we’ve seen before.

                             PLANT
                        Eight days ago.  Your protege hit 
                        the goddamn Commerce Casino, can 
                        you believe that shit?  Got himself 
                        quite the little crew, too.       

           Patrick studies the picture, looks back up at Plant.    

                             PATRICK
                        Every time he makes you look like a 
                        punk, my heart swells with pride.   

           But Plant’s smile hasn’t diminished one bit.   
                             PLANT
                        Yeah, I know.  You love him.  That 
                        thieving prick who’s been 
                        stockpiling millions while you rot 
                        away in this hole of piss.   

           Patrick slowly nods, defiant, resigned. 

                             PATRICK
                        I’m gonna explain it real slow, 
                        like I would to my kid.  (beat)  
                        I’m not.  Going.  To help you.  

           Plant leans forward on his elbows.  Eyes blazing.  

                             PLANT
                        Actually, I think you will.    

           Plant pulls out a DOCUMENT, lays it on the table.  

                             PLANT
                        Remember that off-duty cop, in a 
                        coma since your last gig?  He threw 
                        a blood clot five days ago.  That’s 
                        his Death Certificate.  You’re a 
                        murderer now.  How’s that feel?         

           Patrick blinks, his face loses color.  

                             PATRICK
                        I never killed anybody.  Ever.   

                             PLANT
                        Irrelevant.  With the Felony Murder 
                        Rule in place, you’re gonna get 
                        life.  (beat)  At least your Daddy 
                        had the courtesy to get killed on 
                        the job, right?    

           Hold on Patrick’s face, his eyes, as the wheels spin steadily  *
           behind them.  He studies the Document.  He studies Plant.  

                             PATRICK
                        This is the part when you pull out 
                        your ace.  So let’s have it.     

                             PLANT
                        I’m gonna spring you.  You’re gonna 
                        get yourself next to Hardaway.  And 
                        when the time’s right, I’ll be 
                        there waiting with the chains.   

           Patrick stares at him, calculating.  
                             PATRICK
                        That’s absurd.  I’m not up for 
                        parole for another four years.  
                        Bobby’s not that stupid.  

           Plant smiles, shakes his head.  

                             PLANT
                        Spin it however you like.  Truth 
                        is, cons get sprung all the time on 
                        technicality.  Maybe that cop had 
                        illegal hollow-points in his piece.  
                        Which is why you almost died. 

                             PATRICK
                        Is that fucking true?

           Plant shrugs with an exaggerated cluelessness. 

                             PLANT
                        See?  It could be true.  That’s my 
                        whole point.  Even you don’t know.  

           Patrick frowns, seethes, disturbed.    

                             PATRICK
                        If this goes down, then what?  I go 
                        back to being a private citizen? 

                             PLANT
                        Carry Gigi on your shoulders 
                        through the gates of Disneyland.

            Patrick absorbs this, deeply skeptical.  But even so...Damn.   *

                             PLANT
                        Bomb’s got something big.  And if 
                        you don’t help me, I’ll pull the 
                        trigger on your Felony Murder and 
                        you’ll sit in the Max until you’re 
                        120 years old.  

           Patrick sits there, staring at Plant. 

                             PATRICK
                        I want my family with me.  Wherever 
                        you put me, I want them there.  

                             PLANT
                        You’re really not in any position 
                        to negotiate.  
                             PATRICK
                        Then maybe I’ll take my request 
                        straight to your Boss.  Unless you 
                        wanna keep playing hard-ass?          

           Plant grits his teeth.  

                             PLANT
                        Let’s say I might be able to make 
                        that happen--

                             PATRICK
                        Make it happen.  Or else fuck you.            

           INT. PATRICK’S CELL - LOMPOC - DAWN

           Patrick stands in front of his tiny slit of a window.  The 
           sun is rising.  The COLORS, outside, are so god damn 
           gorgeous.  Red, orange, purple.  They play across his face.  

           He watches the colors.  He doesn’t blink.  

           INT. LOMPOC - CORRIDOR - DAY

           Patrick walks down the narrow corridor, holding a box full of 
           five years’ worth of personal shit. 

                             PLANT’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        You will hereby place yourself 
                        under the control and supervision 
                        of the Federal Government.   

           INT. LOMPOC - SMALL ROOM - DAY

           Patrick sits at a table, signing his name, over and over, on 
           a series of papers.  His BOX OF STUFF sits beside him.   

                             PLANT’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        And when I say Federal Government, 
                        what I mean is me.  You are not a 
                        citizen, and will not possess the 
                        rights of a citizen. 

           INT./EXT. BLACK SUBURBAN - DAY

           A sleek black SUBURBAN with tinted windows speeds along a 
           mostly-empty roadway.  
           PATRICK sits in the back, wearing an ill-fitting suit.  
           Beside him, a stoic, hard-featured BLACK WOMAN types into a 
           laptop.  AGENT ALTHEA POE, 32.  

                             PLANT’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Agent Poe will share your 
                        controlled residence, and will 
                        handle you at all hours of the day.  
                        Her cover is immaculate, and her 
                        skills are exceptional.     

           Up front, two other stone-faced AGENTS in sunglasses.    

                             PLANT’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Do not take advantage.  She has 
                        been given full authority to fuck 
                        you up, should you choose to 
                        diverge from the mandate.

           Patrick stares out the window, in wonder.  So much space, so 
           much sky.  They pass by farmlands, and a small herd of cows.   *

                             PATRICK
                        Agent Poe, look.  Cows.  

           Agent Poe does not look at the cows.  

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

           The Suburban slides up a narrow, winding street in the 
           Hollywood Hills, just underneath the lip of MULHOLLAND, 
           stopping at the foot of a GATED DRIVEWAY.  

                             PLANT’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Just keep it simple.  All of this 
                        is merely a means to an end.  

           The GATE swings open, and the SUV climbs the steep drive. 

           EXT. MID-CENTURY HOUSE - HOLLYWOOD HILLS - CONTINUOUS

           Patrick climbs out of the Suburban, followed by Agent Poe and 
           two other FEDS.  A WHITE TAHOE is already parked in the port.  

           Everyone approaches a boxy, Mid-Century-modern HOUSE at the 
           foot of a long, steep EMBANKMENT, with the Mulholland TRAFFIC 
           zipping by, a hundred yards or so up the incline.   

                             PLANT’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        The End is Bobby Hardaway, and the 
                        Means is You.
           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Three DISPLAY SCREENS embedded in the wall show the GATE, the  *
           COURTYARD, and the brush-covered EMBANKMENT beyond. 

           Patrick sits on a leather couch in the sparsely-decorated, 
           open-plan living room, fidgeting, restless, while Poe 
           consults her laptop nearby.   

                             PATRICK
                        You a Laker fan, Agent Poe?  

           Poe looks up, glares at Patrick, doesn’t answer.  She returns  *
           her attention to the laptop.      

                             PATRICK
                        Talk my ear off, why don’t you.    

           Poe huffs, annoyed, doesn’t look up.  A CHIME sounds, and the  *
           SCREENS come to life.  The GATE OPENS, a BLACK SEDAN slides 
           through, proceeding up the DRIVEWAY.  

           Poe closes her laptop and stands, tall and straight.  

                             POE
                        They’re here, Mr. Gautreaux.  Are 
                        you prepared?

           Patrick stands up, smooths his pants. 

                             PATRICK
                        Call me Goat.  (beat)  And no, I’m 
                        not the slightest bit prepared.  

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

           Patrick stands in the foyer, and opens the door for ROSALIE, 
           carrying a dead-asleep GIGI in her arms.  

           They just stand there for awhile, looking at each other.  

                             ROSALIE
                        (whispered)
                        She fell asleep on the way over.  

           Patrick leans down to stroke Gigi’s hair.  He whispers--

                             PATRICK
                        God, she’s so pretty.  (beat)  I 
                        wish we knew each other better.    
           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Rosalie walks, arms crossed, toward the window, which offers 
           a spectacular, sparkling, city-scape view.  

                             ROSALIE
                        I like the view.  (beat)  They’re 
                        probably listening, aren’t they.       

           Patrick hangs back, watching her.  He whispers:   

                             PATRICK
                        They could be.    

                             ROSALIE
                        You made it back to me.  

                             PATRICK
                        Sound like you had doubts.    

           Ever so slowly, she turns, showing her delicious silhouette.    *

                             ROSALIE
                        Doubt is for the weak, and the 
                        pathetic.  People who aren’t like 
                        us.  People who fail.      

                             PATRICK
                        Come over here.  

                             ROSALIE
                        Be patient.  It’ll taste better.    

           Patrick’s eyes have taken on a desperate, crazed gleam. 

                             PATRICK
                        Come over here faster.  

           She takes a step.  Smiles coyly.  Damn, she’s sexy.   

                             PATRICK
                        I swear to Christ, Ro.  

           Rosalie RUSHES to Patrick, he crushes her in his arms, smells  *
           her hair, her neck, his senses overloading, it’s too much--

                             PATRICK
                        Thank you, thank you--

           They kiss, and don’t stop kissing--
           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - MUCH LATER

           Agent Poe walks through the empty house.  All is quiet.  

           She moves silently into a small BEDROOM.  Stands over little 
           Gigi, who sucks her thumb in sleep, her covers kicked away.  

           Poe reaches down, re-covers Gigi with the blanket.  

           INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - FBI HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           It’s very late, everyone’s gone home, except for PLANT, who 
           sits behind his desk, staring at the WALL across from him--  

           The WALL is COVERED in a dense, complex MOSAIC of DOCUMENTS 
           and BLUEPRINTS and PHOTOS and TIME-LINES.  

                             POE’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        It’s time to point the way.    

           SECURITY STILLS from the various BANKS and also the CASINO.  
           Blurred BLOW-UPS of barely-recognizable figures we’ve seen 
           before, including THE REDHEAD and BALACLAVA.  

                             PATRICK’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        We’re gonna get a word to Bobby.  

           Images of the SAFE HOUSE, ROSALIE, GIGI and PATRICK himself.    *

                             POE’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Let’s hear the angle.    

           And in the middle-- a blown-up BLUR of BOBBY-BOMB HARDAWAY.  
           Flashing his TEETH.  Grinning at PLANT, who stares back at 
           the image, his eyes pure, crystalline focus--

                                                 CUT TO BLACK. 

           INT./EXT. WHITE TAHOE - MORNING

           Poe behind the wheel, Patrick riding shotgun.  The gate 
           swings open, and they pull forward.  

                             PATRICK
                        Gonna say hello to some people.  
                        South of Florence.  West of Fig.  
                        In the Eighties.  

           Poe raises an eyebrow.  
                             PATRICK
                        Yeah, I know.  It ain’t Bel Air.  

           INT./EXT. TAHOE - SOUTH CENTRAL - DAY

           Poe, in sunglasses, drives the Tahoe down a grim side street 
           West of Figueroa.  DENIZENS eye them as they roll past. 

           Patrick clocks the tangled GRAFFITI on the buildings.  

                             PATRICK
                        Slow up a minute.  Tags on that 
                        wall.  Barber shop. 

           Poe slows the Tahoe, and they see the TAGS thrown up on a 
           wall beside a BARBER SHOP.  H G R C.  

                             PATRICK
                        We’re neck-deep in Hoover Gardens 
                        Rollin Crip.   

           Poe nods to a secondary TAG (G S C), CROSSED OUT in BLUE.

                             POE
                        Hoover Gardens still beefing with 
                        Grape Street.  Hatfields and McCoys 
                        of South Central.  Hardaway rolled 
                        with Hoover as a Baby-G until you 
                        brought him to the Big Time.          

           Patrick grins at Poe, impressed.  

                             PATRICK
                        Quite a bag of tricks, Agent Poe.  

           Poe pushes her shades up on her head, glares at Patrick. 

                             POE
                        I’m up in your world now, convict.  
                        I’m your Wheel, we rollin’, and you 
                        best see me like I need to be seen.  
                        What you see is Althea, not Agent 
                        Fuckin Poe, and you best believe 
                        Althea is a stone bitch.   

           Patrick looks at her appreciatively, his eyes a bit wide.  

           INT. BARBER SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Patrick enters the shop, into a blue haze of blunt-smoke.  A 
           BELL JANGLES above the door.  
           Instantaneously, ALL EYES are on him.  The MEN inside-- three 
           BARBERS and eight “CUSTOMERS”-- are straight-up HGRC BANGERS.  
           Ink, scars, thousand-yard-stares. 

           Still, Patrick smiles a toothy, cheerful grin.  

                             PATRICK
                        The answer is no, I actually don’t 
                        have an appointment.      

           A linebacker-built BARBER calmly approaches. 

                             BIG BARBER
                        Looks like we rollin one-time, 
                        boys.  Show from the po.  

                             PATRICK
                        I promise you, I am not the police. 
                        Just need to get a word-- 

                             BIG BARBER
                        Move your ass on out, cracker.  
                        This ain’t your spot.  

           The dudes in the shop start CAT-CALLING at Patrick.

                             PATRICK
                        All of you, pipe the fuck down.  
                        There’s no call for this 
                        inhospitable shit. 

           The Big Barber actually stops in his tracks, wearing an 
           expression like what the FUCK did you just say?

                             PATRICK
                        I need to get a word to Bobby-Bomb 
                        Hardaway.  He a friend of yours?   

           At the mention of the name, a HUSH falls across the shop.  

                             BIG BARBER
                        You say you ain’t the po-lice?   

                             PATRICK
                        Glad you’re paying attention.   

           The Big Barber grins, and it’s not heartwarming.  

                             BIG BARBER
                        Then I’m a’ put you to sleep, cuz.  

           The Barber RUSHES, but Patrick doesn’t hesitate.  He KICKS 
           him so hard in the balls, the big dude’s eyes go CROSSED--  
           Before the Big Barber hits the floor, Patrick’s already 
           GRABBED a super-sharp pair of SHEARS from a blue jar of 
           BARBICIDE, which he holds out, prison-style, like a shank.  

           But that doesn’t stop TWO BANGERS from rushing RIGHT AT HIM 
           from BOTH SIDES--

           Patrick SPINS and JAMS the SCISSORS deep into Banger One’s 
           THIGH, and homeboy SCREAMS--

           Just as the other Banger Two SMASHES his fist into the side 
           of Patrick’s head, KNOCKING him sideways against the WALL--

           Patrick still manages to grab that glass jar full of 
           BARBICIDE and he SMASHES the JAR against his assailant’s HEAD 
           and the BLUE LIQUID goes SPLATTERING along with the BLOOD--

           Now EVERYONE is out of their chairs, RUSHING the entrance, 
           and several BIG DUDES start PILING on top of Patrick, 
           throwing wild HAYMAKERS--

           The BELL JANGLES over the door--

           AGENT POE slips inside, UNSEEN, and she’s got BRASS KNUCKLES 
           on her LEFT FIST and a LEATHER SAP in her RIGHT--

           A tall, lanky BANGER strides toward her, gets one word out--

                             LANKY BANGER
                        Bitch--

           THWAP-THWAP-- Poe NAILS him TWICE in the HEAD with the SAP, 
           and the BANGER DROPS to the FLOOR--

           And then she SETS UPON the PILE OF DUDES on top of Patrick, 
           WHACKING them mercilessly with the SAP, and sending quick, 
           deadly PUNCHES with the KNUCKLES--

           SMASHING all the TENDER SPOTS-- KNEES and ELBOWS and 
           COLLARBONES-- every fierce IMPACT hitting its mark perfectly 
           until the dudes are HOWLING in pain, trying to get away from 
           her, but she keeps coming-- WHACK WHACK WHACK WHACK--

           Holy shit this lady has some moves--

           Poe HAULS a dazed, banged-up Patrick to his feet, DRAGS him 
           toward the DOOR--

           CLACK-CLACK.  Everyone FREEZES, because the big BARBER is 
           pointing a SHOTGUN straight at Patrick and Poe, chest 
           heaving, eyes murderous. 
           Poe stares back at him, baring her teeth, clenching her fist 
           around the smeared, bloodied KNUCKLES--

           Patrick leans toward Poe, whispers to her--

                             PATRICK
                        Never thought I’d get us killed 
                        this quick, Althea.  Sorry.   

           CLUNK-- Poe’s KNUCKLES hit the floor, and now she’s pointing 
           a big silver H&K .44 dead-center at the Big Barber’s GROIN.

                             POE
                        I will make you a girl, see?   

           Barber’s eyes BUG, and he TIGHTENS his grip on the GAUGE--

           The BANGERS are peeling themselves off the floor, forming a 
           tight semi-circle, the stink of anger in the air--

                             VOICE (O.S.)
                        All y’all back the fuck up.  

           It’s like all the air just leaked out of the room.  The 
           Bangers retreat, cowed, their weapons disappear back into 
           pockets and waistbands and Timbs.   

           REVEAL an imposing BLACK MAN in a WHEELCHAIR.  This is ROPE, 
           40, rocking a 4-inch-deep afro, temples flecked with gray.  

           His arms, shoulders and chest are thick with muscle, but his 
           legs are thin, wasted-- he’s PARALYZED from the waist-down.  

           Rope rolls closer, joint hanging from his lip, his expression 
           hard, all power, all confidence.    

                             ROPE
                        Girl, where you learn to chop shit 
                        up like that? 

                             POE
                        Kindergarten.   

           Rope rumbles an easy, stoned laugh, nods at her piece, which 
           is still aimed at the freaked-out Barber’s crotch.   

                             ROPE
                        My boy Josiah just protecting my 
                        game.  But he got himself a heart 
                        murmur, and you pointin that .44 at 
                        his nuts ain’t helpin none.  Feel?  

           Poe lowers her weapon, and Rope shifts his gaze to Patrick.   
                             ROPE
                        Been a long time, yo.  We both got 
                        some greys upstairs.        

           Patrick nods, rubs his aching jaw.  

                             PATRICK
                        Passage of time, Rope.  At least 
                        we’re still walking the Earth.    

                             ROPE
                        You was up in Lompoc, right?  

                             PATRICK
                        For about a minute, yeah.  I got 
                        lucky on the appeal.       

                             ROPE
                        Pulled a three-bid up in that hole.  
                        Jacked an El Dorado from a Grape 
                        Street OG.  God damn Lo-Jack.    

           Rope grins with pride, until his smile fades to hardness.  

                             ROPE
                        Grapes come back for me, though.  
                        Soon as I gated out.  Blasted me 
                        and my cousin.  He dead.  Now I got 
                        my G’s building ramps for my ass.     

           Patrick nods, says nothing.  Respect.  Rope takes a long hit.   *

                             ROPE
                        So you wanna get next to Bomb.  

                             PATRICK
                        That’s about the size of it.  

                             ROPE
                        Why you think he still fuckin with 
                        a nigger like me anyhow?  Boo’s 
                        rollin nationwide.  With whitefolk.  

                             PATRICK
                        He’s still earning for you though, 
                        isn’t he.  The community.  Because 
                        that’s what I do, and that’s what I 
                        taught him.          

                             ROPE
                        That boy always had a gift for 
                        twistin.  
                             (MORE)
                             ROPE (cont'd)
                        Even though he was too soft to 
                        Bang.  (beat) You an old-school G.  
                        Taught him real good.      

                             PATRICK
                        He always knew where he came from.  

           Rope slowly nods.

                             ROPE
                        Alright then. 

           EXT. ELYSIAN PARK - SUNSET 

           The TAHOE winds its way through the quiet, desolate hills of 
           Elysian Park.  At a small turn-off, Patrick climbs out.

           He picks his way down to the flat mesa of ANGELS POINT, 
           dominated by a large, 1980s SCULPTURE, covered in TAGS. 

           Poe hangs in the background, keeping her distance, but 
           watching with hawk-like focus.  

           That’s when BOMB steps out from behind one of the wide 
           PILLARS of the sculpture.  Dodger cap, Dodger satin jacket, 
           stone-washed jeans, glasses-- a tourist dork.  

           And for a few moments, they simply look at each other.  

                             BOMB
                        Imagine my surprise. 

                             PATRICK
                        You’ll get over it.      

           Bomb gestures over to where POE is standing in the distance.   *

                             BOMB
                        You gated out, what, a minute ago?  
                        And you already hooked up your own 
                        personal Pam Grier? 

           Over Bomb’s shoulder, Patrick catches a glimpse of a terribly  *
           muscular Latino MAN, standing at a distance, eyeballing them.  *

                             PATRICK
                        See you brought a friend, too.  

           Bomb smiles quizzically, lights up a smoke.  
                             BOMB
                        How did you get out, Goat?  Thought 
                        they had you wrapped up in twelve 
                        kinds of bullshit.  

           Patrick crosses his arms, cocks his head.  

                             PATRICK
                        Glad to see you were following my 
                        case.  From that sandy beach in 
                        Spain or Africa or wherever the 
                        hell you skated off to.  

                             BOMB
                        Still waitin on your answer.    

                             PATRICK
                        That guard who plugged me.  Tested 
                        positive for methamphetamine.  Plus 
                        he used dum-dums on the job.  Lost 
                        my goddamn spleen, Bobby.  You find 
                        a loophole, you chase it.  Ever 
                        heard of the Appellate Court?  
                        Didn’t they teach you that shit at 
                        Yale?  Oh, that’s right.  I’m the 
                        one who went there.  You washed out 
                        of East Crack-town Junior High.  

                             BOMB
                        When Yale calls you up for alumni 
                        donations, do you send them 
                        exploded dye-pack bundles?  

           Patrick nods, narrows his eyes, doesn’t smile.  

                             PATRICK
                        You know all about those exploders, 
                        don’t you, Bobby.  

                             BOMB
                        And you know all about suckin on 
                        big black Lompoc dicks.  

                             PATRICK
                        We finished with the dozens now?  
                        If we’re not, I’m gonna go home and 
                        play Candyland with my daughter.     
                        You don’t like having me around, 
                        fine.  I don’t need this shit.     

           Bomb stomps his cig.  Offers Patrick a sincere smile.  
                             BOMB
                        You know it ain’t like that.  
                        (beat)  Been missin you like a 
                        motherfucker.  

           They both relax a bit, while still keeping their distance. 

                             PATRICK
                        Same here, Bobby.  

                             BOMB
                        You look good, Goat.  Who you 
                        supposed to be? 

                             PATRICK
                        No skins.  This is just me.  

                             BOMB
                        Come on, that ain’t you.  You never 
                        go out without skins.  Check me 
                        out.  I look like Urkel.    

           Patrick just shrugs. 

                             BOMB
                        Maybe you don’t have yourself a 
                        skins-man yet.  Just the Wheel.   

                             PATRICK
                        Maybe I don’t know what the hell I 
                        feel like doing.  

           Bomb looks out at the city, then steps closer to Patrick.  

                             BOMB
                        Might have a little freelance 
                        project for you.  And your new 
                        girl.  Maybe see how that goes.  

           Patrick looks Bomb in the eyes, wheels turning.  

                             PATRICK
                        It’s really good to see you, Bobby. 

           Bomb waits for Patrick to go on.  Then finally just shakes 
           his head, grins, bemused.  

                             BOMB
                        Alright.  If that’s how it’s gotta 
                        be, that’s how it’s gotta be.   

                             PATRICK
                        I’m glad you understand.     
           Bomb nods, but looks at the ground, his mood darkened.   

                             BOMB
                        For the record.  Not a day goes by 
                        I don’t think about all the shit 
                        that went wrong.  Not a day, Goat.

                             PATRICK
                        You hadn’t left, we’d both be 
                        upstate.  I was running the gig.  
                        Sometimes the cards just fall 
                        sideways.  That’s on me, not you.        

           Bomb considers this, nods, then walks away.   

                             BOMB
                        All my love to Rosalie, and little 
                        Gigi.  You pass that along.    

           HOLD on PATRICK as he watches Bomb disappear.  

           INT./EXT. TAHOE - STREETS - LATER

           Poe and Patrick cruise along in silence.  Patrick glances 
           over, sees Poe rubbing her sore, swollen knuckles, picking at  *
           a stray drop of dried blood on the cuff of her blouse. 

           She catches him looking, glares at him.  Patrick looks away.   *

                             POE
                        He offers a gig and you say no?  
                        You trying to blow this on purpose?  

           Patrick just stares out the window, stoic, in thought.  

                             PATRICK
                        I didn’t say no.  But I didn’t say 
                        yes either.  Eagerness sends the 
                        wrong message.  Might as well fire 
                        off a signal flare. 

                             POE
                        Just better hope he calls back.  

           Patrick sees a BLACK YOUTH, about 14, bopping down the 
           street, all swagger, without a care.  Patrick smiles. 

                             PATRICK
                        Thank you for your concern, Althea.  
                        But I’m aware who I’m dealing with.    
           As the Tahoe cruises past the Youth, Patrick follows him with  *
           his eyes, and we--

                                                 FLASH BACK TO:

           EXT. HANCOCK PARK - NIGHT - 15 YEARS AGO

           A silver Range Rover pulls into the driveway of a beautiful 
           yet modest Spanish-style home.  

           Two MEN hop out-- one of them is PATRICK GAUTREAUX, and the 
           other is DORCHESTER, both 15 years younger.  

           As they pass by a small GARDEN SHED, Patrick PAUSES-- the 
           DOOR is ever-so-slightly AJAR, and there’s a SMEARED RED HAND- *
           PRINT on the door handle.  

           Patrick looks at Dorchester, indicates the DOOR, puts his 
           finger to his lips, Shhhh.  Dorchester draws a PISTOL.  

           They carefully approach the door.  Patrick gives Dorchester a  *
           nod, and he swiftly KICKS THE DOOR IN, while Patrick reaches 
           in and FLICKS ON THE LIGHTS--

           INSIDE, hiding in the corner, there’s a SKINNY BLACK BOY, 14,  *
           his face and clothes SPLATTERED WITH RED, clutching a RED-
           SPLATTERED SACK.  It’s LITTLE BOBBY HARDAWAY.  

           Little Bobby immediately JUMPS UP and tries to SHIMMY past 
           them, but Dorchester easily GRABS him, SLAMS the boy against 
           the wall, PINS him there, draws back his large FIST--

                             PATRICK
                        Come on now, Dorch.  He’s a baby. 

           Dorchester holds his fist there.  Keeps the boy pinned. 
           Patrick walks closer, studies Little Bobby.  

                             PATRICK
                        Where you from, kid?

                             BOBBY
                        City of Fuck You, Bitch.  

           Patrick laughs.  Steps forward, unzips Bobby’s hoodie, sees 
           the BLUE BANDANA around his neck.  

                             BOBBY
                        The fuck offa me--

                             PATRICK
                        Yeah, I know, tough guy. 
           Patrick yanks the bandana to the side, sees the small TATTOO 
           on Bobby’s neck, underneath his ear: HGRC.  

                             PATRICK
                        You’re a long way from Hoover 
                        Gardens, Baby-G.   

           Bobby looks at Patrick, frowns, confused.

                             PATRICK
                        Lemme see what you got there. 

           Patrick grabs the red-stained SACK from Bobby’s grip, pulls 
           out some banded-stacks of CASH, all of it splattered RED.

           Patrick laughs, shows the ruined money to Dorchester, who 
           shakes his head, smiles.    

                             PATRICK
                        (to Bobby)
                        Here’s a tip, kid.  Before you take 
                        the paper?  Bend the stacks.  If 
                        they bend, they’re clean.  If they 
                        don’t, there’s either a transmitter 
                        or a dye-pack inside.  Either way, 
                        you’re fucked with your pants on.   

           Patrick tosses the sack to the side.  

                             PATRICK
                        Heard about the West Mutual on 
                        Larchmont getting hit this morning.  
                        That was you, huh?    

           Bobby stares at the floor, nervous, ashamed.  He nods.  

                             PATRICK
                        Don’t worry.  I’m not the po-po.  
                        And you’re damned lucky you picked 
                        my house to hide.  Otherwise you’d 
                        never get back to Crip-city, 
                        looking like that.  (beat)  So 
                        where’s your strap?      

                             BOBBY
                        Don’t need that shit.  

                             PATRICK
                        Yeah?  How’d you get all that paper 
                        from the teller? 

           Bomb looks at Patrick, studies him real good.
                             BOBBY
                        Told her I had a bomb, yo.  Blow 
                        everyone up, because I’m poor and 
                        black and I don’t give a fuck.  

           Patrick laughs.  Likes this kid.  

                             PATRICK
                        A bomb.  That’s real good.  You got 
                        some sand, which means you’re not 
                        as stupid as I thought.  Which 
                        means you got potential.     

           Bobby continues to stare at Patrick, sizing him up.    

                             BOBBY
                        You a thief, too, huh.    

           Patrick cocks his head, grins.   

                             PATRICK
                        Got some great eyes in that little 
                        head.  Give you that.  But here’s 
                        the thing.  

           He steps forward, pokes Bobby in the chest.  

                             PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        You are a thief.  I am something 
                        else entirely. 

           He leans closer to Bobby, and whispers--

                             PATRICK (CONT’D)
                        I don’t get caught.  

           INT./EXT. INGLEWOOD - NIGHT - 15 YEARS AGO

           The Rover pulls up across from an immaculate GREEN CRAFTSMAN 
           on an otherwise run-down, dumpy residential street.  

           Patrick, riding shotgun while Dorchester drives, leans over 
           to the back, where Bobby is sitting, all cleaned up.    

                             PATRICK
                        So this is where I can find you?  
                        The clubhouse?   

                             BOBBY
                        Or the barber shop on eight-trey.  

           Patrick hands Bomb a tight little roll of CASH. 
                             PATRICK
                        Give that to your OG.  Tell him 
                        what we talked about.  You have any 
                        problems, you call me.  Right?  

           Bomb feels the cash, sniffs it.  It smells good.  He jumps 
           out of the car, trots across the street to the GREEN HOUSE--

                                                      BACK TO:

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - NIGHT - BACK TO PRESENT

           Patrick is trying to put a sour-faced, surly Gigi to bed.  He  *
           flips through a pile of storybooks. 

                             PATRICK
                        How bout this one, Cookie?

           Gigi frowns, shakes her head.  Patrick selects another.     

                             PATRICK
                        This one looks really good.  

                             GIGI
                        I want Mommy to read.  

                             PATRICK
                        Gimme a break, will ya?  Mommy’s 
                        busy.  And I’ve been wanting to 
                        read you a story all day long.  

           Gigi looks at him pensively.  Like she’s going to relent.  

                             GIGI
                        No.  Get Mommy.  

           Patrick sighs, deflates.    

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Patrick closes the door behind him.  Turns on the faucets.  
           He goes to the TOILET and gently LIFTS the TANK LID, and 
           places it quietly on the sink.  

           He rolls up his pant leg, reaches into his sock, and pulls 
           out a small PACKAGE, tightly wrapped in PLASTIC.  

           He plunges his hand into the tank, and WEDGES the PACKAGE 
           into the bottom.  Then he replaces the lid.    
           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

           Rosalie enters the bedroom, wearing a long t-shirt and 
           panties, finds Patrick reclining on the bed, watching CNN.

                             PATRICK
                        So how long I gotta wait until she 
                        stops hating my guts?

                             ROSALIE
                        You were gone a long time, Patch.  
                        She’ll come around.  

                             PATRICK
                        (unconvinced)
                        Yeah...

           Rosalie comes to the bed, straddles Patrick, leans over him, 
           her hands on his chest.

                             ROSALIE
                        I’ve been thinking a whole lot 
                        about that Fed.  

                             PATRICK
                        Who, Althea?  She been mad-dogging 
                        you?  She does that to everybody.  
                        Don’t pay no mind.      

           Rosalie shakes her head, speaks in a whisper: 

                             ROSALIE
                        Not her.  I mean the other one.  

           Patrick’s hands slide up her calves, her thighs, whispers:   

                             PATRICK
                        Got Plant handled just fine.  

                             ROSALIE
                        All the things he says to you.  All 
                        the promises.  You trust him?  

           His hands slide over her ass, and her eyes flutter closed. 

                             PATRICK
                        You know me better than that.  

           They kiss.  Rosalie comes up for air, breathless.  
                             ROSALIE
                        As long as you know.  If he crosses 
                        us, I’ll cut his head off.  

           Patrick beams at her in admiration and arousal.   

                             PATRICK
                        God damn.  

           They get back into it.  Until Patrick’s CELL starts ringing.

           He grabs for it, checks the display.  Their faces are only an  *
           inch apart, and they speak in the most intimate of whispers.    *

                             PATRICK
                        It’s Bobby.  

                             ROSALIE
                        Guess you’d better take it.  

           When she slides off of him, she takes her sweet time.  

           EXT. KOREATOWN - NIGHT 

           A red-stripe METRO LOCAL BUS cruises down Olympic, east of 
           Wilton, in the neon heart of Koreatown.  It pulls to a STOP, 
           where PATRICK and POE are standing against a storefront. 

           INT. METRO LOCAL BUS - CONTINUOUS

           Patrick takes a seat across the aisle from Plant, who sits in  *
           the rear of the bus.  Plant appraises Patrick’s bruises.  

                             PLANT
                        Not as pretty as the last time.  

                             PATRICK
                        I can take a punch.  

                             PLANT
                        How’s our friend doing?  Are we on?  

                             PATRICK
                        He’s been in touch.  But the door’s 
                        not all the way open yet.  

                             PLANT
                        What’s that supposed to mean?  
                             PATRICK
                        He wants to run me on something 
                        first.  Side gig.      

                             PLANT
                        So he doesn’t trust you.    

                             PATRICK
                        What did you expect?  A welcome 
                        home party?  Besides it’s not just 
                        me.  Don’t forget the babysitter. 

           Patrick nods his head toward Poe, who stares out the window, 
           a few rows ahead, discreetly pretending not to listen. 

                             PLANT
                        We don’t have all fucking day, 
                        Gautreaux.  Keep jacking me off, 
                        and your little field trip’s over.  
                        We’ll take a ride back Upstate.  

           Patrick snorts, shakes his head.  

                             PATRICK
                        With all due respect, Agent Plant, 
                        you came to me.  Keep playing your 
                        “back to jail” card all you want, 
                        but the better option would be to 
                        pull your head out of your ass. 

           Plant narrows his eyes, but takes the hit.  

                             PLANT
                        I assume you’ve been listening, 
                        Agent Poe.  

           Poe approaches, stands in the aisle, doesn’t sit.  

                             POE
                        Either we roll it, or we’re on the 
                        outside, permanent.  

                             PATRICK
                        I think you’re right, Plant.  He’s 
                        planning something big.  But I’m 
                        not getting a sniff of that until I 
                        earn my nut.  This is how it is.

           Plant runs his hands over his shiny-smooth dome.  

                             PLANT
                        Please get the fuck off my bus.

           A large ROOM, with tables, chairs, coffee, Krispy Kremes, a 
           dry-erase board scribbled with SCHEMATICS. 

           Patrick eyes some PHOTOS on the board: one of an enormous 
           YELLOW TRUCK, outfitted with three tiers of Carrier Track. 

           Another PHOTO is of a dapper, white-bearded OLDER MAN in an 
           overcoat and fedora.  

           Bomb notices Patrick examining the photos, and he gently 
           pulls him away, guides him over to meet some PEOPLE: 

                             BOMB
                        That’s Cilla.  She’s on Intel.  
                        She’s also my girl.  

                             PATRICK
                        Pleasure to meet you, Cilla.  

           CILLA, 27, tall, white-blonde, model-gorgeous, ice-grey eyes, 
           all fucking business.  The REDHEAD from the Casino, sans wig.        *

                             CILLA
                        Yeah.  Fantastic.  

                             BOMB
                        The sad sack is Arthur Stills.  
                        He’s my Wheel.  

           STILLS, 43, stooped posture, melancholy eyes, pores over a 
           set of STREET MAPS.  He looks up, stares at Poe openly.   

                             STILLS
                        You must be Althea?  

           Poe just stands there, arms crossed. 

                             STILLS
                        Althea’s a nice name.  I think 
                        Felicia used to have an aunt named 
                        Althea.  Or maybe a grandmother.  
                        Or a cousin. (beat)  Or a maid.   

                             POE
                        The hell you just say? 

                             CILLA
                        Christ, Arthur.  You have the 
                        social skills of a fucking toddler.       
           The GARAGE DOOR suddenly opens, and a lime-green EXPLORER 
           HYBRID comes rolling in, with the MUSCULAR LATIN behind the 
           wheel.  This is BERTO, sans balaclava.  

                             BOMB
                        That’s Berto.  Venezuelan.  He’s on 
                        hardware and acquisition.  Looks 
                        like he just pulled a new G-ride.  

           Berto hops out of the SUV, smiling cheerfully.  Stills rises, 
           scowls at the vehicle with disgust.  

                             STILLS
                        A hybrid?  Are you kidding me?

           Berto shrugs, steps up to Patrick, offers his massive hand.  

                             BERTO
                        Can’t wait to rock with you, Mr. 
                        Gautreaux.  Heard the good things.  

           Patrick shakes Berto’s hand, nods. 

                             PATRICK
                        Real kung-fu grip there, Berto.  

                             BOMB
                        Alright, alright, let’s get 
                        focused.  Work to be done.

           Patrick pulls Bomb to the side, leans in, speaks low--

                             PATRICK
                        What kind of gig is this?  

           Bomb looks at Patrick, stone-faced.  Gently frees his arm.  

                             BOMB
                        All due respect, Goat, you’ll find 
                        out along with everyone else.

           INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - ZORN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Agent Plant stands in front of a dubious Zorn’s desk. 

                             ZORN
                        This is getting a little too grey 
                        for my taste.  Your reports are so 
                        bare-bones, they’re practically 
                        blank.  Plus, you’re not using full 
                        Bureau resources--   
                             PLANT
                        Sir, this is a street-level 
                        operation.  If I put too much out 
                        on the wires, we’re gonna get 
                        compromised.  This has to be tight 
                        to the point of invisibility.  No 
                        way I’m letting Hardaway get the 
                        jump on us again. 

                             ZORN
                        I understand.  But I just got off 
                        the phone with Maynard at Justice, 
                        and the concerns remain.  Lotta 
                        concerns.  Mostly about you.  
                        (beat)  All illegal activities must 
                        be reported on.  Even if they’re 
                        tangential to your operation.     

                             PLANT
                        Of course.  We’re in the pipeline, 
                        Sir.  Won’t be long now.       

           Zorn grimaces, chews some Tums. 

                             ZORN
                        This whole thing is starting to 
                        exacerbate my acid reflux.  I don’t 
                        like the feeling, Jacob.  It burns.   

           INT./EXT. COVINA - GREEN EXPLORER HYBRID - DAY

           The Explorer Hybrid is parked at the side of a quiet street, 
           within sight of the humming 10 Freeway.  

           Stills is at the wheel, Patrick sits shotgun, and in back, 
           Poe is sandwiched between Berto and Cilla, who aims a pair of 
           high-powered BINOCULARS in the direction of the Freeway.  

                             STILLS
                        Shoulda been four minutes ago.  Why 
                        can’t Bobby be here?  

                             CILLA
                        Are you running this, Arthur?  
                        Fucking hell, you’re a Wheel.  

           Stills looks away, chastened.  
           EXT. ANOTHER STREET - CONTINUOUS

           A junky, rust-stained MINIVAN with tinted windows sits, 
           seemingly abandoned, in an alley.  

           Reveal BOMB behind the wheel, in sunglasses, baseball cap 
           pulled low.  From afar, he has a VIEW of the ensuing SCENE--

           EXT. 10 FREEWAY - COVINA - DAY

           Ten lanes of TRAFFIC roll steadily along the 10.  

           And...here she comes: the HUGE YELLOW AUTO-CARRIER TRUCK, 
           loaded up HEAVY with EIGHT CADILLAC ESCALADES. 

           INT. EXPLORER HYBRID - CONTINUOUS

           Cilla SEES the CARRIER TRUCK exiting the FREEWAY--

                             CILLA
                        There’s my fat bitch--   

           Berto immediately jumps out of the car, runs to the opposite 
           side of the street, followed by Stills.

           EXT. COVINA - SIDE STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           The Yellow AUTO-CARRIER cruises down the SERVICE ROAD, full 
           of warehouses and industrial buildings, minimal traffic, 
           almost no pedestrians.  

           About fifty yards down, the Carrier SLOWS DOWN, because the 
           ROAD IS BLOCKED by the HYBRID.  

           CILLA is crouched next to the FLAT rear tire, holding a tire 
           iron, struggling with the lug nuts--  

           INT. AUTO-CARRIER - CONTINUOUS

           TWO MEN are riding in the cab-- the DRIVER is large, bearded, 
           barrel-chested, and the SKINNY DUDE in the passenger seat is 
           pock-marked, fidgety, like he’s SPUN.  

                             DRIVER
                        Fucking perfect.  
           The Driver BLARES the horn, and Cilla pops up from the tire, 
           smiles at the men in the truck, arches her back, rolls her 
           neck, and there’s no doubt she looks delicious--  

           Meanwhile, at the REAR, Berto and Stills emerge, trot over to 
           the truck, and immediately CLIMB UP onto the TRACK RIG--

           While UP FRONT,  Cilla saunters over to the Driver’s window, 
           wearing a sexy-pouty embarrassed grin. 

                             CILLA
                        Not to worry, I called Triple-A, 
                        I’m such a dumb-dumb. 

                             DRIVER
                        Lady, I don’t care.  

           SKINNY DUDE glances in his SIDE MIRROR and catches a sudden 
           glimpse of STILLS CLAMBERING up the carrier grid--

                             SKINNY DUDE
                        The fuck is that guy--

           Just as Cilla JUMPS onto the STEP below the Driver’s door, 
           leans right into the cab--

                             CILLA
                        Wow, it smells like beef jerky and 
                        piss in here! 

           DRIVER and SKINNY look over to see Cilla is pointing a big 
           silver PISTOL at them.

                             DRIVER
                        You gotta be shittin’ me.   

           Skinny’s eyes widen as he POPS OPEN the GLOVE COMPARTMENT--

                             POE’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Time to vacate, boys.

           Skinny’s eyes shoot to POE, who has MATERIALIZED right 
           outside his window, and just as she PULLS OPEN THE DOOR--

           Skinny’s hand comes out of the glove compartment, holding an 
           ugly-looking SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL--

           In one quick motion-- Poe GRABS ONTO Skinny’s gun-arm, YANKS 
           it backward, and SLAMS THE DOOR on his WRIST--

           Skinny’s EYES BUG-- and he SCREAMS LIKE HELL--

           Poe re-opens the door, DRAGS Skinny out onto the PAVEMENT--
                             DRIVER
                        Goddamn Whore--

           The DRIVER suddenly PUNCHES CILLA in the FACE--

           She goes FLYING off the side of the truck, lands hard, her 
           PISTOL goes SKITTERING--

           At the TRUCK SIDE, Poe FLIPS Skinny onto his stomach, YANKS 
           his arms behind his back, whips some PLASTIC CUFFS onto him--

           The DRIVER quickly THROWS THE TRUCK INTO GEAR, starts to PULL 
           FORWARD, gaining SPEED--

           Poe looks up to SEE, up on the CARRIER GRID, BERTO and STILLS 
           grasping onto the rigging as the ESCALADES BOUNCE AROUND--

           But they’ve already UNHOOKED one of the ESCALADES, and it 
           starts to ROLL BACKWARDS--

                             STILLS
                        Watch your back end!   

           INSIDE THE CAB, the DRIVER grins crazily, aiming for the 
           NARROW ROADSPACE between the HYBRID and a tall WIRE FENCE---

           PATRICK suddenly LEAPS through the open PASSENGER DOOR, and 
           CHOPS a hard ELBOW into the Driver’s THROAT--

           The Driver GASPS, can’t breathe, his foot slides off the 
           clutch, and Patrick YANKS UP on the EMERGENCY BRAKE--

           But the Truck still has some momentum going, and it SCRAPES 
           and SCREECHES violently against the Hybrid--

           The Truck JOLTS and GRINDS to a halt-- 

           Berto and Stills look up to see the released Escalade ROLLING  *
           toward them, They DIVE out of the way, CLING to the RIGGING--

           But Berto can’t get a good grip, and he FALLS from the 
           rigging, landing HARD on the pavement-- 

           INSIDE THE CAB, PATRICK reaches across the still-choking 
           Driver, pops open the door, HEAVES him outside--

           And looks up to see the loose Escalade SAILING OFF THE BACK 
           OF THE CARRIER--

                             PATRICK
                        Holy shit-- MOVE!  MOVE!  MOVE!  
           Berto’s dazed eyes open and he sees the ESCALADE PLUMMETING 
           TOWARD HIM, it’s going to crush him like a grape--

           But suddenly POE IS THERE, and with a HOWL she HAULS HIM 
           ACROSS THE PAVEMENT to safety, and a half-second later--

           The ESCALADE SMASHES into the pavement, rear-end first, so 
           it’s pointing up at the sky, before TIPPING OVER BACKWARDS-- 

           CRUNCHING onto its roof, belly exposed, wheels spinning--  

           Poe collapses on top of Berto, both gasping for breath--

                             BERTO
                        (winded croak)
                        Muchas.  Gracias.  Sexy black.

           The Driver looks up to see CILLA straddling him, bleeding 
           from the mouth, aiming her PISTOL, looking pissed as hell--

                             DRIVER
                        I’m sorry Lady--

           She SPITS blood to the side, then CRACKS him in the head. 

           EXT. COVINA - SIDE STREET - LATER 

           SIX ESCALADES have been off-loaded from the Carrier, lined up 
           in a row behind the truck.  The BELLY-UP ESCALADE lies in the 
           street like a dead animal, steaming, hissing.

           STILLS is behind the wheel of Escalade #8, REVERSING off the 
           lowest Carrier grid, guided by BERTO.  

           DRIVER and SKINNY are bound and gagged, hidden from view, 
           covered by Poe, while PATRICK and CILLA are hard at work 
           attaching TOW LINES between alternating Escalades.  

           Patrick notices Cilla touching her swollen lip, grimacing.    

                             PATRICK
                        You alright, Cilla?     

                             CILLA
                        Lovely.  Barely felt it, really. 

           Patrick nods, respectful.  Cilla gazes at the dead Escalade. 

                             CILLA
                        I hate to lose merchandise.  I 
                        don’t fuck up like this.  Not ever.  
                        (beat)  Thanks for the step-in.       
           Patrick just shrugs. 

                             PATRICK
                        You’re Bobby’s girl.  

           INT./EXT. COVINA - SIMULTANEOUS

           The junky MINIVAN discreetly reverses back into the alley, 
           and disappears from sight.  

           INT./EXT. UNMARKED FORD FALCON - COVINA - DAY

           About two hundred yards away from the Auto Carrier situation, 
           an unmarked FORD FALCON hides between two buildings.    

           Inside the vehicle, PLANT and KIYOSHI stare through BINOCS.  

                             KIYOSHI
                        Half a million bucks worth of 
                        Escalade going bye-bye.  You sure 
                        we’re not supposed to be reporting 
                        on this?  Zorn’s gonna--      

                             PLANT
                        You let me worry about Zorn.  At 
                        least nobody decided to get shot.  
                        Now get the fuck down.  

           Plant and Kiyoshi drop low into their seats.  Seconds later, 
           TWO ESCALADES WHOOSH PAST.  ONE TOWING THE OTHER BEHIND IT.   

           Then TWO MORE.  And TWO MORE.  And, finally, ONE MORE.  

           Four Drivers.  Seven Escalades.  Gone.  

                                                 CUT TO BLACK. 

           INT. LOCK HOUSE - EVENING

           Bomb sits at his desk, littered with PHOTOS and STENO PADS 
           filled with OUTLINES and LISTS.  

           He focuses intently on his LAPTOP.  As he CLICKS through 
           various PAGES, his face is hard, taut, pure focus. 

           He consults a series of hand-drawn MAPS and DIAGRAMS, filled 
           with SYMBOLS and X’s and O’s and ARROWS, like football plays.   *

           He’s been at it for hours.  He’ll be at it for hours more.  
           INT. CHOP SHOP - SOUTH CENTRAL - DAY

           WORKERS and MECHANICS-- all of them HGRC-- cluster around the 
           SEVEN ESCALADES, like ants attacking rotting fruit.  

           Off to the side, Bomb and Cilla stand watching, with ROPE 
           sitting in his chair beside them, smoking a joint.  

                             BOMB
                        I know it was supposed to be eight.  
                        But I got seven.  Sorry, Rope.  

           Rope waves it off, smiles stonily at the Escalades. 

                             ROPE
                        Easy, breezy, beautiful, 
                        motherfucker.     

           INT. UNDERGROUND NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           At a plush booth in the back, all of our friends are 
           drinking, smoking, living Life, bass-heavy music POUNDS.  

           Bomb cuddles with Cilla, Berto has a model-grade FEMALE on 
           his lap, Stills fidgets, preoccupied, Patrick nurses a single-
           malt, and Poe, per usual, is stoic as a sculpture.    

           Bomb leans close to Patrick, puts his arm around him--

                             BOMB
                        Did real good today, Old Man.   

           Patrick swirls his whiskey, sips it, shrugs.  

                             PATRICK
                        Couple hiccups.   

           Bomb smiles, shakes his head, stoned, happy, sincere.  

                             BOMB
                        You got my back.  And you got 
                        Cilla’s back, too.  I’m feeling 
                        this, Goat.  For real.     

                             PATRICK
                        Feels good, Bobby.  Got my sea legs 
                        back again, you know?   

           Bomb laughs, gives Patrick a kiss on the cheek.  
                             BOMB
                        Look at you.  Eager beaver.
                        (turns to Poe)
                        How about you, homegirl?  Drink 
                        something, maybe shake that ass?      

                             POE
                        No poison goes in this body.   

                             BOMB
                        Damn.  All business all the time 
                        with this one.   

           Just then, a pretty but slightly mousey BRUNETTE slides into 
           the booth, next to Stills, who brightens, kisses her.      

           This is FELICIA, 35.  For the first time, Bomb’s smile drops.   

                             BOMB
                        Thought I said no hang-ons, Stills.    

                             STILLS
                        Come on, Bobby.  She’s my wife.  

           Felicia smiles dreamily, oblivious, while Bomb continues to 
           glare, until he shakes it off, smiles again at Patrick.  

                             BOMB
                        Time to dance with my girl.  You 
                        gonna bring your creaky-ass bones 
                        out on the floor or what?  

                             PATRICK
                        You kids have fun.   

           Bomb stands, gathers Cilla in his arms, and they make their 
           way to the crowded Dance Floor.  

           Patrick watches intently as they dance, clinging tightly to 
           each other, eyes locked, their intimacy potent.   

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATE

           Patrick lies in bed, wide awake, while Rosalie sleeps beside 
           him.  He looks at the clock-- it’s 3:30am.  

           He slips silently out of bed.  Tiptoes to the door.  
           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Patrick tip-toes down the hallway, peers around the corner 
           into the living room. 

           POE is in a recliner, open laptop resting on her thighs.  Her  *
           head dangles loosely to the side as she sleeps.  

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Patrick enters, closes the door silently behind him.  He 
           stands at the sink, and stares at his reflection.  

           He turns on the faucet, and the sound of rushing water fills 
           the room, along with billows of STEAM.

           Patrick gingerly removes the lid of the toilet tank, places 
           it on the sink.  He reaches inside, and pulls out the PLASTIC- *
           WRAPPED PACKAGE.  He sets it on the sink.  

           He unwraps the package.  Inside is a BURNER-- a stolen, 
           cloned CELL PHONE.  He flips it open, powers it on, dials.  

                             PATRICK
                        Yeah.  It’s me.  

                                                 CUT TO BLACK. 

           INT. ALVARADO WAREHOUSE - DAY

           The whole CREW is gathered for the BRIEFING.  Bomb is at the 
           helm, before a BOARD filled with the football-style DIAGRAMS.  

                             BOMB
                        Here we are at Location A.  Fairfax 
                        and Beverly.  Western Trust.  Goat, 
                        this is your gig.  Gonna be working 
                        the CSM, black dude called Ronald 
                        Sands.  All his buttons are in the 
                        profile, so get it memorized.   

           Patrick nods, flips through some DOCUMENTS, and we 

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

           Where Patrick and Poe sit across from PLANT and KIYOSHI, who 
           transcribes everything into a laptop. 
           NOTE: We will intercut between these two locations throughout 
           the following sequence.  

                             PATRICK
                        ...Western Trust on Beverly.  I’m 
                        taking the Customer Service guy at 
                        that location.  Poe’s my backup.    

                             PLANT
                        Okay, so what about Hardaway--

                             PATRICK
                        I’ll get to that in a minute.  

           INT. ALVARADO WAREHOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Bomb indicates a familiar PHOTO up on the Board-- the burly, 
           white-bearded OLDER MAN in an overcoat and fedora.

                             BOMB
                        Terrence Hartley.  Multi-
                        Billionaire from Utah, owns half of 
                        Salt Lake.  He’s moving a massive 
                        pile to Western to establish a Cali-
                        based foundation.  Needs the cash 
                        in-state for tax exemption.  Plus, 
                        Western gets all that capital.  Win-
                        win, right?       

           Patrick raises his eyebrows, impressed.   

                             PATRICK
                        How long you been sitting on him?

                             BOMB
                        Six months.  It’s beyond solid.   

           INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

                             PLANT
                        How big’s the pile? 

                             PATRICK
                        Sixteen million, cash.  

           Plant whistles, rubs his hands together, hungry, and Kiyoshi 
           looks up from his keyboard, stunned.  
                             PLANT
                        Even bigger than I thought.  But 
                        there’s no fucking way a load that 
                        size won’t be protected.  

                             PATRICK
                        That’s the wrinkle.  

           INT. ALVARADO WAREHOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Bomb pulls out a large BOX, sets it on the table.  

                             BOMB
                        All that weight, they’re probably 
                        gonna have a sentry in the Counting 
                        Room.  Luckily, Berto hooked us up 
                        with a little Christmas gift.     

           He opens the box, pulls out a slim silver CANNISTER, and some 
           GAS MASKS.  Stills perks up in his seat.   

                             STILLS
                        Cool.

                             POE
                        Looked like Fentanyl.  The Russians 
                        use it to put terrorists to sleep.    

                             PLANT
                        Wait a minute.  We can’t have any

                             PATRICK
                        Nobody’s dying, Plant.  Relax.  

           Plant doesn’t look convinced.  Poe pipes in.  

                             POE
                        It’s nasty stuff, Sir.  But it’s 
                        not lethal.   

           Plant stares at Patrick for a little while.  Patrick stares 
           right back, doesn’t blink.     
                             PLANT
                        Let’s go over the timeline again.  
                        I want everything tight.       

           Patrick nods thoughtfully, stares out the window.

                        Disneyland.  

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - EVENING

           Patrick, Rosalie and Gigi sit at the table for a meal which 
           Rosalie has clearly spent a long time preparing.  

           Everyone clasps hands, closes their eyes, except for Gigi-- 
           who is focused intently on a Dora the Explorer book.  

                             ROSALIE
                        Please, God, keep your Watch just a 
                        little bit longer.  Amen.     

           Rosalie opens her eyes, sees Poe standing across the room, 
           looking in their direction.  

                             ROSALIE
                        Come sit with us, Althea.  There’s 
                        so much food.    

           Poe smiles politely, shakes her head no. 

                             POE
                        Thank you, Ma’am.  I’m just fine.  

           Poe quickly exits the room.  Rosalie watches her go.   

           Gigi, deadpan, hangs two string beans at the sides of her 
           mouth, like green tusks, and stares at Patrick.    

                             ROSALIE
                        Sweetie, don’t play with your food.  

           Gigi removes the beans, so Patrick makes a pair of string 
           bean tusks for himself, and GROWLS.  And Gigi finally smiles.   *

           Cutest smile you ever saw.  Kills Patrick dead on the spot.  

                             ROSALIE
                        Told you she’d warm up.  

           Patrick smiles, his eyes get a little wet.  He leans over and   *
           starts planting kisses on Gigi’s head.  
                             GIGI
                        (loving it)
                        Daddy, eww.  

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Patrick and Rosalie lay on their sides facing each other.  

                             ROSALIE
                        Are you ready?     

                             PATRICK
                        Let’s not talk business, Ro.      

           She leans closer, nuzzles his neck, whispers.   

                             ROSALIE
                        Don’t give me that shit.  Business 
                        is all there is, until it’s done.    

           Patrick sighs, plays with her hair, kisses her softly.  

                             PATRICK
                        Yeah I’m ready.  Are you?         

                             ROSALIE
                        Been ready since they took you 
                        away.  Never stopped.  

           OUTSIDE, the SOUNDS of the night city.  A never-ending HUM of 
           life, of electricity, of inevitability--

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A DARK FIGURE stands silhouetted at the foot of the DRIVEWAY. 

           Moving closer, we see that it’s JACOB PLANT.  Staring up at 
           the house, where all the lights are OUT.  

           He CRACKS his knuckles, one by one.  Pop.  Pop.  Pop.

           He busts out his cell phone.  Puts it to his ear.

           He pockets the cell.  Cracks his knuckles.  Pop.  Pop.  Pop--

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD - DAY

           Follow a BRINKS TRUCK as it makes its way through Noontime 
           traffic.  It stops at a red light, and, randomly, a SEAGULL 
           alights on the roof.  It stands there, upright and proud.  

           EXT. BEVERLY BLVD & FAIRFAX - DAY

           Establish the bustling INTERSECTION, a steady snarl of 
           traffic, a WESTERN TRUST BANK at the NORTHEAST corner, the 
           vast sprawl of the FARMER’S MARKET to the SOUTH.  

           Among the many PEDESTRIANS, we find THREE of our friends-- 
           PATRICK, POE and BOMB, fully DISGUISED, approaching the 
           entrance of the BANK.  

           ACROSS THE STREET: A BROWN U.P.S. TRUCK sits at the CURB.  

           INT. U.P.S. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           The interior of the truck is outfitted for SURVEILLANCE.  
           PLANT is up front, in the passenger seat, wearing a HEADSET.  
           His TECH is beside him, plugged into all kinds of EQUIPMENT.   

           In the REAR of the TRUCK: SIX HEAVILY-ARMED and ARMORED 
           STRIKE AGENTS ARE WAITING, amped, veins popping.  

                             PLANT

                        Sitting on the marked Escalade.

           A nondescript light blue MINIVAN sits near the SOUTHEAST 
           CORNER of PAN PACIFIC PARK, due east of the GROVE MALL.  

           Inside, KIYOSHI sits, wearing a HEADSET, eyeballing the BLUE 
           ESCALADE parked about a hundred feet ahead.  
                             KIYOSHI
                        No movement.  

           In the REAR of the MINIVAN-- FOUR MORE ARMED & ARMORED AGENTS 
           are waiting and sweating.  

                             PLANT’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Let’s all keep it frosty.  No 
                        activation until Hardaway has his 
                        hands on the paper.   

           INT. WESTERN TRUST BANK - DAY

           Patrick enters the bank LOBBY, carrying a briefcase.  He is 
           soon followed by Poe, and then Bomb.  

           Bomb and Patrick pause briefly at a small KIOSK.  

                             BOMB
                        Ready for Ronald, Dr. Hodge?

                             PATRICK
                        You betcha.  

           Bomb puts his hand on Patrick’s shoulder, squeezes it, gives 
           him a sincere look, whispers--

                             BOMB
                        Let’s turn it on.   

           Bomb peels off into the lobby.  Patrick glances toward POE 
           standing nearby, gives her a wink.  He approaches a DESK 
           where a barrel-chested Black MAN, 35, sits.

                             PATRICK
                        Mr. Sands?  

           RONALD SANDS turns toward Patrick, ushers him into the seat 
           across from him, unsmiling.  

                             RONALD SANDS
                        Yes.  Ronald Sands.  You must be 
                        Dr. Hodge.  Please have a seat.   

           Patrick takes his seat, grins, pulls an IPHONE from his 
           pocket, sets it on the desk.  

                             PATRICK
                        Only my patients call me Doctor.  
                        You can call me Lewis.  

           Ronald doesn’t react, just digs through some papers.  
                             RONALD SANDS
                        Dr. Hodge sounds just fine to me. 

           Patrick presses on, displays his most charming grin. 

                             PATRICK
                        You don’t like the name Lewis?

                             RONALD SANDS
                        I like it just fine.  But my mother 
                        taught me some manners.  A doctor 
                        should be called Doctor. 

           Patrick pushes a button on the iPHONE, and an IMAGE pops up:

           A YOUNG BLACK BOY at a PLAYGROUND, sliding down a SLIDE.  

                             PATRICK
                        Mr. Sands, you have a son named 
                        Lewis, don’t you?  

           Ronald looks at Patrick.  His brow furrows.  

                             RONALD SANDS
                        Excuse me?  

           Patrick TURNS the IPHONE on the desk, so that Ronald can get 
           a good look at the PICTURE--

                             PATRICK
                        I have a system, Ronald.  And it’s 
                        a perfect system.  Your son, Lewis, 
                        is only a minor component.      

           Ronald stares at the PICTURE on the phone.  Then he looks 
           back at Patrick, cocks his head.  

                             RONALD SANDS
                        Dr. Hodge, I’m confused.  

                             PATRICK
                        I’m sure you are.

                             RONALD SANDS
                        Because I have no idea what the 
                        hell you’re talking about.  I don’t 
                        have any children.  I’ve never seen 
                        this boy in my life.  

           Patrick’s smile freezes on his face.  His eyes shoot over to 
           where Bomb was standing... But HE’S NOT THERE ANYMORE.  

                                                     SMASH TO:
           EXT. BEVERLY & FAIRFAX - CONTINUOUS

           HOLD on the EXTERIOR of WESTERN TRUST.  Our POV TRAVELS, at 
           HYPER-SPEED, away from this corner, FLYING OVER the PARKING 
           LOT of the FARMER’S MARKET--

           FLYING SOUTH, in a BLUR, until we settle at the corner of 
           FAIRFAX AND THIRD, where ANOTHER BANK is situated, the UNION 
           BANK OF HOLLYWOOD.  

           And guess who is walking into the Union Bank...it’s CILLA, 
           wearing KEVLAR, carrying TWO HUGE DUFFELS--

           INT. UNION BANK - CONTINUOUS

           Cilla strides into the lobby, and without missing a beat, 
           walks RIGHT UP to the SECURITY GUARD and--

           ZAPS HIM with a STUN GUN-- he CRUMPLES, and within seconds, 
           Cilla has his HANDS and FEET tied with PLASTIC CUFFS-- 

           She DROPS the DUFFELS, UNZIPS one, and comes up with an M-16 
           ASSAULT RIFLE strapped across her SHOULDER--

                             CILLA
                        EVERYBODY ON THE FUCKING GROUND!

           There are SCREAMS of PANIC and TERROR as the CUSTOMERS 
           throughout the lobby DROP to the GROUND--

                             CILLA
                        I don’t wanna see any FUCKING FACES 
                        so put your FUCKING FACES in the 
                        FUCKING CARPET--  

           Cilla STRIDES through the lobby, and approaches one of the 
           CUSTOMER SERVICE DESKS, where a familiar BRUNETTE is sitting.

           And Guess What.  The Customer Service Manager is FELICIA. 

           She immediately STANDS UP, GRABS one of Cilla’s DUFFELS, and 
           within seconds she’s slung her own M-16.

                             CILLA
                        (to Felicia)
                        We’ve got 160 seconds--

           Felicia quickly straps on a GAS MASK, brandishes the FENTANYL 
           CANISTER, and STRIDES quickly toward the BACK--
           Using her KEYS, she quickly passes through the DAY GATE which 
           leads behind the PLEXI “BANDIT-BARRIER” guarding the TELLERS--

           A female TELLER stares at her wide-eyed from the FLOOR--

                             TELLER
                        Felicia...what the hell--

           Felicia points the BARREL of the M16 right in her FACE--

                             FELICIA
                        (muffled through mask)
                        You or anyone else pops a 2-11 I 
                        will COME BACK for your ass. 

           Felicia strides toward the VAULT, where an ABSOLUTELY 
           ENORMOUS PILE OF FRESH CASH sits on the counting table--

           An ARMED SENTRY is standing there, but before he can raise 
           his sidearm, Felicia BLASTS him with the FENTANYL--

           The Guard COUGHS, STAGGERS, PUKES, then his EYES ROLL BACK as 
           he TOPPLES OVER--

           INT. WESTERN TRUST BANK - CONTINUOUS

           Patrick slowly stands up, and when Ronald Sands also rises, 
           we had no idea he was so SCARY BIG-- 

                             RONALD SANDS
                        You think I haven’t been held up 
                        before?  Guess again, motherfucker.  

                             PATRICK
                        I need to use your restroom--

                             RONALD SANDS
                        The hell you do--

           As Patrick SPEED WALKS over to POE, we see RONALD SANDS 
           PUNCHING THE 2-11 BUTTON UNDER HIS DESK--

                             PATRICK
                        It’s tipping over.  We are gone.  

           Poe’s eyes are fixed on RONALD who is signaling the GUARD--

                             PATRICK
                        It’s a burn.  Bobby slipped us.

           Patrick and Poe quickly make their way toward the EXIT--
           INT. U.P.S. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           From inside the truck, PLANT sees Patrick and Poe emerge from 
           the bank, EMPTY-HANDED, both looking FREAKED--

                             PLANT
                        Wait a minute--

           Plant’s TECH pipes up beside him--

                             TECH
                        Sir, there’s a 2-11 reported--

                             PLANT
                        No shit, I’m looking right at it, 
                        but where the fuck is Hardaway--

                             TECH
                        Wait a minute, there’s two, sir. 
                        Two bells, two locations--

           EXT. WESTERN TRUST BANK - CONTINUOUS

           Patrick and Poe on the sidewalk, looking in ALL DIRECTIONS--

                             PATRICK
                        There.  

           They see the distant figure of BOMB disappearing into the 
           FARMER’S MARKET PARKING LOT across the street--

                             PATRICK
                        Gotta go after him, Poe--

           Just as the WESTERN TRUST SECURITY GUARD appears, right 
           behind them, pointing a GUN--

                             SECURITY GUARD
                        DON’T YOU FUCKERS MOVE--

           Poe SPIN-KICKS the Guard, and his GUN GOES FLYING, and 
           another KICK and she lays him on the ground, COLD.  

           Poe pulls Patrick close, growls low--

                             POE
                        You stay right next to me and don’t 
                        even think about testing me. 

           Patrick and Poe start SPRINTING across BEVERLY, toward the 
           PARKING LOT, and VEHICLES SWERVE and SCREECH to AVOID them--
           INT. U.P.S. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Plant REACTS to the sight of Poe and Patrick sprinting from 
           the scene, he JUMPS out of the truck--

                             PLANT
                        I have Gautreaux heading towards 
                        the Farmer’s Market--

           The Strike Team PILES out of the back of the truck and FANS 
           OUT across Beverly, stopping traffic, PURSUING Patrick and 
           Poe, who are a HUNDRED YARDS further along--

           Plant GRABS his TECH, and gets right in HIS FACE--

                             PLANT
                        Where’s the second 2-11??

                             TECH
                        Still awaiting location--

                             PLANT
                        I NEED IT NOW, FUCKHEAD!

           INT. UNION BANK - CONTINUOUS

           FELICIA is in the VAULT, working CRAZY FAST-- as only someone 
           with On-Site experience possibly could--

           She’s got an insane amount of LOOT-- BLOCKS of CASH and 
           JEWELS and DIAMONDS, and those DUFFELS are BULGING with it--

           Felicia is so pumped full of adrenaline, she’s been waiting 
           for this moment for so long-- she’s high as a fucking kite--

                             CILLA’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Twenty-five seconds, Fifi!!--

           EXT. FARMER’S MARKET - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           PATRICK and POE are running as fast as they can through the 
           crowded NORTH PARKING LOT-- dodging VEHICLES and PEDESTRIANS--

           Up AHEAD Patrick catches a GLIMPSE of BOMB disappearing into 
           one of the ENTRANCE GATES into the bustling COVERED MARKET--

           Meanwhile, the STRIKE TEAM is still in pursuit, hustling 
           through the PARKING LOT, closing in on Patrick and Poe--
           The CROWDS of BYSTANDERS finally catch a glimpse of the 
           heavily-armed STRIKERS, and they SCATTER and SCREAM and shit 
           is starting to get hectic--

           INT. UNION BANK - CONTINUOUS

           CILLA stalks through the bank, keeping everyone COVERED with 
           her M-16, checks her WATCH--

                             CILLA
                        Eight seconds, God Damnit!

           FELICIA emerges from the rear, M16 strapped across her BACK, 
           HAULING the two bulging DUFFELS upright on WHEELS--  

                             FELICIA
                        (pure adrenaline)
                        This is so totally awesome--

           Cilla grabs one of the duffels, looks askance at Felicia-- 

                             CILLA
                        For fuck’s sake, hold your cookies--

           Felicia re-holsters, catches a glimpse of a CUSTOMER slowly 
           pulling himself to his feet, she SPINS toward him--

                             FELICIA
                        LIE DOWN FUCK-FACE!  

           POCKAPOCKAPOCKAPOCKA-- She unleashes a SPRAY from the M16, 
           hitting the CEILING above the CUSTOMER, he DIVES for COVER--

           Everyone starts SCREAMING, Cilla looks PISSED, she grabs 
           Felicia and they RUSH for the EXIT DOORS--

                             FELICIA
                        (guilty)
                        I’m sorry, Cilla, I just--

                        (hissed)
                        Who told you to improvise?  If you 
                        muck this up, I swear to Christ--

           AGENT PLANT hears the BURST OF GUNFIRE from down on THIRD-- 
           and his eyes shoot to the UNION BANK--
                             PLANT
                        Gotta be fucking KIDDING ME--

           He DRAWS a S&W 4506 and starts SPRINTING LIKE MAD down 
           Fairfax, SCREAMING into his headset--

                             PLANT
                        2-11 IN PROGRESS AT UNION BANK 
                        THIRD AND FAIRFAX--

           EXT. UNION BANK - CONTINUOUS

           Cilla and Felicia emerge from the bank, Cilla checks her 
           watch, and then she sees a GREEN ESCALADE rounding the CORNER 
           at FAIRFAX-- and it’s STILLS behind the wheel--

           The Escalade JAMS to a stop at the curb, cars HONKING, the 
           Women HAUL their Duffels toward the Escalade--

                             STILLS
                        Move, Ladies, MOVE, MOVE--

           BLAM! BLAM! STILLS’ HEAD SNAPS to the side and BLOOD SPRAYS--

           Felicia starts SCREAMING like a BANSHEE.  

                             FELICIA
                        OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY

           REVEAL AGENT PLANT, at the OPPOSITE CORNER, still AIMING at 
           the Escalade, and Cilla’s EYES GO WIDE--

                             CILLA
                        Fuck me--

           Stills SLUMPS against the wheel, totally DEAD, and the 
           Escalade ACCELERATES WILDLY INTO TRAFFIC-- 

           And gets T-BONED by a U-HAUL TRUCK, and there’s a CHAIN 
           REACTION as MORE CARS COLLIDE with the GIANT OBSTRUCTION--

           PLANT now LOSES SIGHT of the WOMEN as the CARS PILE UP--

           Cilla grabs Felicia, who’s still SCREAMING her HEAD OFF, and 
           drags her around the edge of the pile-up-- 

           They head for the Southwest GATE of the MARKET, hauling their 
           bags, with PLANT CHASING two hundred feet behind--
           INT. FARMER’S MARKET - WEST PATIO - CONTINUOUS

           PATRICK and POE rush into the Market-- which is PACKED with 
           the LUNCH HOUR RUSH--

           They WEAVE their way through the MAZE of STANDS and SHOPS--

           Patrick glimpses BOMB disappearing behind a TACO STAND--

                             PATRICK
                        BOBBY!

           And that’s when CILLA and FELICIA burst through the GATE into 
           the Market from the SOUTH SIDE--

           Felicia spins, sees PLANT closing the gap from outside--

           Her expression CRAZED, she DROPS her DUFFEL, shoulders the M-
           16, and starts BLASTING in Plant’s direction--

                             FELICIA
                        KILL YOU FUCKING FUCKER!

           POW-POW-POW-POW-POW!  Plant DIVES for cover as the rounds 
           RICOCHET off the pavement around him--

           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!  FELICIA is ROCKED by BULLETS--

           Reveal the STRIKERS, just entering the Market, FIRING AT HER--

           Felicia, shredded, is DEAD before she hits the ground--

           And once those guns starts Blasting, all sense of normalcy 
           and decorum goes FLYING OUT THE FUCKING WINDOW--

           It’s ABSOLUTE MAYHEM as HUNDREDS of SHOPPERS and EATERS and 
           EMPLOYEES start SCREAMING and SCATTERING and TRAMPLING THE 
           HELL OUT OF EACH OTHER as they FLEE--

           Cilla, panting, sweating, quickly grabs Felicia’s DUFFEL and 
           SPRINTS OFF, dragging BOTH behind her--

           Find PATRICK & POE, hiding on the ground behind a FRUIT 
           STAND.  They notice CILLA heading East through the SWARM--

                             POE
                        It’s Cilla--

                             PATRICK
                        We stick to her, she’ll take us 
                        right to Bobby--
           Poe sees the STRIKE TEAM barreling in their direction through 
           the screaming MASSES of PEOPLE, so she grabs Patrick and they 
           head East through the Market, parallel to CILLA--

           Who is huddled behind a SWEETS SHOP, catching her breath--

                             CILLA
                        Keep it tight, keep it tight...

           Suddenly BOMB APPEARS next to her, clutching a WALKIE.  Cilla 
           gasps in relief, but there’s no time for sweet talk--

                             BOMB
                        I got this, Cil, we good, now gimme 
                        your stick--

           Bomb SLINGS the M-16, POPS UP from behind the SWEETS and 
           FIRES over the HEADS of the CIVILIANS, in the direction of 
           the encroaching STRIKERS--

           POP! POP! POP! POP! POP!

           GLASS SHATTERS and DEBRIS FLIES as a FRESH WAVE OF PANIC 
           sweeps through the teeming Market--

                             BOMB
                        (into WALKIE)
                        ROLL them shits, cuz--

           Bomb takes advantage of the CROWD FRENZY and GUIDES Cilla 
           deeper into the EASTERN HALF of the Market--

           Find PLANT, SHOVING his way through the throngs--

                             PLANT
                        Kiyoshi, they’re headed your way, 
                        but the intel is compromised, the 
                        Secondary could be bullshit, do NOT 
                        let Hardaway get past you--  

           Plant comes up against a SCRUM of FLEEING SHOPPERS and he 
           can’t squeeze past, so he BLASTS a ROUND into the AIR--

                             PLANT
                        BACK THE FUCK UP!

           More SCREAMS as the PEOPLE CLEAR A PATH, Plant rushes through 
           it, approaching the EAST PATIO of the Market--

           Amidst CROWDS of FLEEING PEOPLE, find BOMB and CILLA RUNNING 
           FULL SPEED out of the Market’s EAST EXIT, hauling DUFFELS--
           They keep RUNNING, obscured by the CROWDS as they continue 
           down the central THOROUGHFARE of the GROVE MALL--

           Igniting FRESH PANIC in the crowded outdoor MALL when 
           BYSTANDERS see their WEAPONS and the SWARMING PEOPLE--

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT./EXT. PAN PACIFIC PARK - CONTINUOUS 

           KIYOSHI in the MINIVAN, searches the area through BINOCS and 
           sees the BLUE ESCALADE suddenly PULL AWAY from the curb--

                             KIYOSHI
                        Secondary is in motion-- wait--

           Because Kiyoshi now sees FIVE MORE BLUE ESCALADES heading in 
           his direction, and they all look IDENTICAL.  

                             KIYOSHI
                        Fantastic, now there’s fucking FIVE 
                        of them out here--

                             PLANT’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Activate your strikers and cover 
                        every last one--

           The CROWDS OF PEOPLE are now STREAMING out of the EASTERN END 
           of the GROVE, and a frazzled Kiyoshi STEPS OUT of the 
           Minivan, gripping a PISTOL--

           He BANGS on the side of the van, and THE STRIKERS JUMP OUT 
           and begin MANEUVERING their way toward the line of ESCALADES.

           A quick BIRD’S EYE, OVERHEAD SHOT of PAN PACIFIC PARK--

           TRAFFIC completely BACKED UP on BEVERLY and THIRD, the NORTH 
           and SOUTH BORDERS of the Park--

           POLICE and AMBULANCES and EMERGENCY VEHICLES try to squeeze 
           through the morass, SIRENS BLARING and LIGHTS FLASHING--

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT./EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Rosalie enters the living room, holding hands with Gigi.  

           A BLOND AGENT watching a DISPLAY SCREEN, which shows the 
           DRIVEWAY GATE OPENING and SIX HEAVILY-ARMED AGENTS, wearing 
           KEVLAR and HELMETS, making their way up the hill.   
                             ROSALIE
                        Who the hell are they? 

           The Blond Agent turns to Rosalie, expression icy.  

                             BLOND AGENT
                        Ma’am, you were asked to remain in 
                        the bedroom--

                             ROSALIE
                        I could give a shit what I was 
                        asked to do.  Tell me who those men 
                        are, did something happen?

           The FRONT DOOR suddenly opens, and FOUR MORE HELMETED AGENTS 
           enter the living room, and fan out throughout the house.  

           Rosalie reflexively picks up Gigi and holds her tight.  

                             ROSALIE
                        Tell me what’s going on now.  

           The Blond Agent slides his hands in his pockets in such a way  *
           that he reveals the PIECE in his shoulder holster.  

                             BLOND AGENT
                        I’ll only ask nicely once more.  
                        Take your daughter into the 
                        bedroom.  Close the door.  And do 
                        not come out.  Are we clear?    

           Rosalie pulls Gigi closer to her.  Holds the Agent’s gaze, 
           and slowly, lethally, mouths the words: Fuck. You.  

           Then she turns her back and disappears down the hall.  

                                                      BACK TO:

           EXT. PAN PACIFIC PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Back to ground level, find PATRICK & POE crouched by a row of  *
           cars as the FLEEING CROWDS flow past them--

                             PATRICK
                        Can you see them, can you see?

                             POE
                        All I see are Plant’s strikers, 
                        making a goddamn spectacle--

           Indeed, a hundred yards away, we can see a DOZEN SWATS begin 
           to ROUST the line of ESCALADES--
           HAULING the DRIVERS out of the vehicles-- they’re all HOOVER 
           GARDENS ROLLIN’ CRIPS, but they don’t fight back, they LAY 
           DOWN on the pavement obediently.  

                             POE
                        Hoover Gardens... The hell are they 
                        doing here--

           Patrick watches Poe, as she watches the scene.  

                             PATRICK
                        Althea.  

                             POE
                        Don’t worry, Goat.  He won’t get 
                        past.  Too many eyes.    

                             PATRICK
                        What if he’s already past?

           Poe shoots a glare at Patrick, while still searching--

                             POE
                        You’d better hope he’s not.  If he 
                        slips, it’s all over for you.  

           Patrick grimly shakes his head.  

                             PATRICK
                        Althea.  I’m trying to tell you 
                        something here.  (beat)  And I’m 
                        never going back Upstate.  

           Poe stares at Patrick, confused, pissed--

                             POE
                        Why are you talking this shit? 

           The SIREN of an AMBULANCE grows CLOSER as Patrick slowly 
           RISES TO HIS FEET.

                             PATRICK
                        It isn’t because you’re lousy at 
                        your job.  Because you’re good.  
                        Insanely good, I’d say.  But our 
                        time together is coming to an end.      

           Suddenly, Poe is AIMING A PISTOL AT PATRICK’S FACE.  

                             POE
                        Keep talking like that, you’re 
                        gonna make me do something.  
                             PATRICK
                        When the time comes, Althea, you 
                        tell them you didn’t have any other 
                        choice.  They’ll believe you.       

           She TIGHTENS her grip on the pistol, as an AMBULANCE JAMS UP 
           TO THE CURB BESIDE THEM--

                             POE
                        I will put you down.  

           Patrick’s eyes remain fixed on Poe, he can see from her eyes 
           that she’ll squeeze it, no question about it--

           The REAR DOORS of the AMBULANCE POP OPEN--

                             BOMB’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Please stop pointing that jammy at 
                        my partner, Agent Poe.

           Poe looks over to see BOMB standing in the AMBULANCE CABIN, 
           pointing an M-16 at her, with CILLA crouched beside him--

                             BOMB
                        Hop in, Goat.  Time to go.

           Poe’s eyes flash rage at Patrick, and she COCKS the hammer--

                             POE
                        No way I’m letting this happen.  
                        Get on your knees NOW.          

           Patrick smiles at Poe.  Because he really does like her. 

                             PATRICK
                        Althea, we both know Plant was 
                        never gonna let me skate.  All his 
                        promises were for shit.  I did what 
                        I had to do.  And now we’re gonna 
                        say goodbye to each other.  

                             POE
                        (as if she heard nothing)
                        GET ON YOUR FUCKING KNEES.  

           BERTO HOLLERS from the DRIVER’S SEAT, Bomb glares at Patrick-- *

                             BERTO
                        Gotta fuckin GO, man!
                             BOMB
                        Come on, Goat.  We’re in a goddamn 
                        hurry.  Just tell me.  She wearing 
                        Kevlar like she’s supposed to?    

           Patrick levels an authoritative gaze at Bomb.  

                             PATRICK
                        Don’t miss, Bobby.  

           Poe’s eyes DART between them, filled with alarm--

                             POE
                        The fuck did you just--

           BLAM! BLAM!  Bomb FIRES two carefully-aimed ROUNDS--

           POE is ROCKED in the CHEST, and she FLIES BACKWARD into a 
           car, CRACKING the WINDSHIELD.

           Patrick hops into the back of the ambulance, pausing to look 
           back at Poe--

                             PATRICK
                        I’m sorry, Althea.  

           And the ambulance doors SLAM SHUT--

           EXT. PAN PACIFIC PARK - SIMULTANEOUS

           PLANT leads the STRIKERS as they RAID the ESCALADES when he 
           hears the GUNSHOTS--

           He starts SPRINTING, his face a rictus of AMPED PANIC, 
           because it’s all going to shit and he fucking knows it--

           He comes upon POE, felled in the street, CLUTCHING her chest-- *

                             POE
                        (gasping it out)
                        Am...ambu...ambulance--

           Plant crouches beside her, pulls open her shirt, revealing 
           the KEVLAR VEST beneath, and the crushed, embedded ROUNDS--

                             PLANT
                        Yeah, we’re getting you an 
                        ambulance, Althea, you’re good--

           Poe grits her teeth in pain and frustration, HISSES at Plant--
                             POE
                        Stupid.  No.  Gautreaux.  Hardaway.  
                        They’re in.  An ambulance--  

           Plant jumps up, searches the chaotic crowd desperately, and 
           there’s gotta be a DOZEN AMBULANCES hurtling every which way--

           Move close into Plant’s EYES, filling with rage, because he 
           knows he’s lost them.  He closes his eyes, breathes.    

                             PLANT
                        Okay.  He wants to play.  So that’s 
                        what we’ll do.  We’ll play.      

           He opens his eyes, and the deafening clamor of the scene 
           begins to fade and muffle, like the world is UNDERWATER--

           He cracks his knuckles.  Pop, pop, pop, pop.    

           He pulls out his cell phone.  Speed-dials.      

                             PLANT
                        It’s me.  (beat)  Yes.  Exactly 
                        like we discussed.  Shock and awe.        

                                                 CUT TO BLACK.

           INT./EXT. LOS FELIZ BLVD - DAY

           The AMBULANCE cruises discreetly along the thoroughfare, 
           sirens off.  Inside, Patrick has his cell phone to his ear, 
           his expression concerned, while Bomb and Cilla watch.  

           Patrick shuts the phone, visibly frustrated.  

                             PATRICK
                        I can’t get Ro on her goddamn cell.   

                             BOMB
                        It’s cool, Boss.  Don’t stress it.  
                        They got what, two Feds sitting on 
                        that house?  Maybe three?  I’d put 
                        my money on the platoon of Crips I 
                        got rollin up there as we speak.

           Patrick grits his teeth, white-knuckles the phone.  

                             PATRICK
                        Really not happy about using 
                        Bangers for this operation.    
                             BOMB
                        I’ll take that dis in stride, Goat.  
                        But it ain’t like you gave me a 
                        hell of a lot of advance notice.  

                             PATRICK
                        You know I had Poe clinging to my 
                        back like a goddamn koala bear.  I 
                        made my plans with the time that I 
                        had, okay?  You, on the other hand, 
                        had all the time in the world.  

                             BOMB
                        Your plans got my Wheel’s head 
                        fuckin blown off!  And Felicia--

                             CILLA
                        Jesus Christ, ENOUGH.        

           Patrick and Bomb look at her, stunned.        

                             CILLA
                        I was there, okay?  Fifi wrote her 
                        own ticket by acting a fool.  Now 
                        we’ll ride in peace until we get 
                        the call.  We can manage that, yes?  

           Patrick and Bomb nod obediently, like guilty schoolboys.  

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

           At the foot of the DRIVEWAY, TWO VEHICLES pull to the curb, 
           both BIG LINCOLN SEDANS with hydraulics and tricked-out rims.

           SIX YOUNG MEN, dressed DARK, climb out of the sedans.  All of  *
           them armed, hard-core HGRC SOLDIERS.  

           They immediately SCALE THE GATE and DROP to the other side--    *

           FOLLOW with them as they hurry up the DRIVE. 

           They reach the COURTYARD at the top, and FAN OUT into 
           POSITION, COVERING the area, brandishing PISTOLS and AK-47s.

           And that’s when THE TEN HELMETED STRIKERS POP UP from where 
           they’ve been HIDING around the PERIMETER of the driveway--

           It’s an FULL-SCALE AMBUSH--

           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM--
           A FUSILLADE OF GUNFIRE is unleashed at the Bangers, who TAKE 
           POSITIONS and FIRE BACK at the STRIKERS--

           But the STRIKERS’ FIREPOWER is TOO INTENSE, and the Bangers 
           soon realize it’s a lost cause--

           One DUDE gets HIT in the THIGH, and he CRUMPLES to the 
           ground, starts DRAGGING himself away--

           Until one of his HOMIES picks him up, hauls him toward the 
           GATE, while another DUDE takes a ROUND in the SHOULDER, and 
           he HOWLS in pain, but KEEPS ON RUNNING--

           Pretty soon all the BANGERS are FLEEING for the Gate, 
           unleashing quick SPRAYS back at the Strikers--

           Another DUDE takes a ROUND in the ARM but he keeps running--

           The DUDES sprint and LIMP, finally they LEAP UPON the GATE, 
           start SCALING IT as BULLETS WHIZ all around them--

           The CRIPS make it over the gate, they’ve all been SHOT but 
           their adrenaline keeps them going to the LINCOLNS where they 
           PILE IN and the vehicles PEEL AWAY--

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - LATER

           The empty AMBULANCE is parked at the side of the road.  The 
           rear doors hang open.  

           EXT. CITY OF COMMERCE - EVENING

           Establish a grim, low-slung, graffiti-tagged BUILDING in the 
           shadows of the intersecting 5 and 710 Freeways.  A BLACK 
           VOLVO is parked in front.  

           INT. SAFE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           On a small TV, the news plays the chaotic AFTERMATH.  

           Berto uses a COUNTING MACHINE for all the CASH, while a 
           drained-looking Cilla packs the money tightly into several 
           large duffels.  It’s a literal MOUNTAIN of money.  

           Meanwhile, in an ADJACENT ROOM--
           Patrick paces, sweating, in a rising panic, while Bomb sits 
           on a beat-up couch, staring at his cell phone.  Take-out 
           containers are spread across the room.  

                             BOMB
                        Oughtta eat somethin. 

                             PATRICK
                        Not until I know they’re safe.  

           BOMB’S CELL VIBRATES.  Everybody LOOKS at him expectantly.  

                             BOMB
                        See?  It’s all good.  
                        (into phone)
                        Yo.  (beat)  Wait.  Hold up-- 

           Patrick watches as Bomb’s eyes begin to widen, and glisten, 
           like a young boy’s.  

                             BOMB
                        Goat.  Something happened.  

           Patrick freezes in place, goes pale.  

                             PATRICK
                        Jesus.  

                             CILLA
                        What’s going on, baby.    

           And that’s when PATRICK’S CELL starts to RING.  He closes his  *
           eyes.  He already knows who it is.  

                             PATRICK
                        (into phone)
                        Yeah.  

           It’s PLANT’S VOICE we hear on the other end.     

                             PLANT’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        You’ve always underestimated me, 
                        Patrick.  From the beginning.  You 
                        thought I was so easy, but you were 
                        wrong, weren’t you.   

           Patrick closes his eyes, breathes through his nose.  

                             PATRICK
                        Do you have them? 
                             PLANT’S VOICE
                        You tried to hurt me.  Tried to 
                        make me look like an asshole.  You 
                        failed, Patrick.  

                             PATRICK
                        Do.  You.  Have.  Them.  

                             PLANT’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        I’m not sure I know what you’re 
                        talking about, Patrick.    

           Patrick struggles to maintain. 

                             PATRICK
                        My wife.  And my daughter.  

                             PLANT’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Tell me something.  Are you with 
                        him right now?  

           Patrick opens his eyes, looks at Bomb, who stares back at 
           him, desperate, almost trembling. 

                             PATRICK
                        Yes.  

                             PLANT’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Go somewhere private.  

           Patrick walks into the SIDE ROOM, and SHUTS the door behind 
           him.  Cilla and Berto look to Bomb for a reaction, but he can 
           only stare at the door.

           INT. SIDE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Patrick paces across the room, phone pressed to his ear. 

                             PLANT’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Someone wants to say hello.   

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. WINDOWLESS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           PLANT sits in a small room, KIYOSHI stands by the wall, arms 
           crossed, and Plant hands the phone to ROSALIE, who is scared,  *
           but she’d never give Plant the satisfaction of showing it.  

                             ROSALIE
                        I’m okay, Patch.  We’re both okay.  
           We INTERCUT between these TWO LOCATIONS--

           Patrick’s eyes glisten when he hears his wife’s VOICE--

                             PATRICK
                        Don’t say a word to them, Ro.  It’s 
                        gonna be alright.  

                             ROSALIE (O.S.)
                        All these fucking goons.  There’s 
                        so many of them.  I’m sorry, Patch, 
                        they cut all the phone lines and 
                        locked me in the room--

           Plant TAKES the phone from Rosalie, nods to KIYOSHI, who 
           USHERS her out of the room, SHUTS the door behind him. 

                             PATRICK (O.S.)
                        It’s not your fault, baby. I’m 
                        taking care of this--

                             PLANT
                        Sorry, it’s me again.  Baby.   

           PATRICK rubs his forehead, paces the room.  

                             PATRICK
                        Let’s see what we can work out 
                        here, Jacob.  

                             PLANT (O.S.)
                        That’s a real nice touch, calling 
                        me by my Christian name.  Like 
                        we’re old friends sharing a six-
                        pack.  But I’m pretty bored with 
                        this conversation.  So I’ll make it 
                        real simple.  You’ve got two 
                        choices.  One, you bring him to me.  
                        Two, you disappear and suffer the 
                        consequences of your actions.   

           Patrick finds himself in front of the mirror, staring at his 
           clenched, drawn reflection.  

                             PATRICK
                        Consequences.  

                             PLANT (O.S.)
                        If you run away, I’m gonna make 
                        sure your wife gets popped for 
                        aiding and abetting.  
                             (MORE)
                             PLANT (O.S.) (cont'd)
                        She’ll go to prison, Patrick, and 
                        little Gigi’s gonna go into foster 
                        care, and it’s gonna wreck her.  
                        It’s gonna ruin her.  You know 
                        that, right?  When a little girl 
                        gets ruined, you see it in her 
                        eyes, it’s a stain that never, ever 
                        goes away.     

           Patrick fights the urge to scream, to go berserk, to crawl 
           through the phone and choke the very life out of Plant.  

                             PATRICK
                        Alright.      

           INT. NEXT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Patrick emerges from the room.  Bomb, Cilla and Berto STARE 
           at him expectantly. 

                             CILLA
                        What did he say?  

           Patrick looks at Bomb, nods toward the outside. 

           EXT. SAFE BUILDING - ALLEY - NIGHT

           Patrick and Bomb stand outside, under the black, starless 
           sky.  They’ve been out here a bit, Bomb has already smoked 
           his cigarette down to the nub, which he tosses to the side.  

                             BOMB
                        Fuck it.  You did your bid, now 
                        it’s my turn.  

                             PATRICK
                        Bobby, it’s not like that anymore.    
                        We’re a package deal now.  We’re 
                        both gonna do time unless we start 
                        using our heads.  

                             BOMB
                        Just let me jump on this grenade, 
                        Goat.  I can hack it.      

                             PATRICK
                        You won’t like being locked up, 
                        Bobby.  It’s the loneliest place on 
                        Earth, and it smells like shit all 
                        year round.  Your mind won’t last.       

           Bomb drags deeply on his cig.  His face hardens, determined.   *
                             BOMB
                        Don’t matter anyhow.  You twist, 
                        you get twisted, maybe it’s all the 
                        same damn thing.   

           Patrick looks out at the street, thinking.  His eyes seem to 
           get clearer, more potent.  

                             PATRICK
                        Remember how scared you were, back 
                        when we hooked up?  Thought you’d 
                        take a full clip in your spine for 
                        rolling with an old white 
                        motherfucker like me.  

           Bomb nods, grins sadly.  

                             BOMB
                        Didn’t sleep much that first year. 

                             PATRICK
                        But it worked out perfect.  Because 
                        all of us-- your people, my people-- 
                        the shade didn’t matter once the 
                        elements got proven.  You trusted 
                        me like the daddy you never had.  
                        And I trusted you like a son.  
                        That’s what made us so good.  
                        (beat)  Plant wanted me to roll 
                        over on you before.  And I made him 
                        believe I was prepared to do it.  
                        Because that asshole actually 
                        thinks he knows us.  But he’s 
                        wrong, Bobby.  He doesn’t know us 
                        at all.  But he’s gonna learn.         

           Bomb looks at Patrick, and we can see the scared, brave, 
           cunning little boy still in there.  

                             BOMB
                        Fuck yeah he’s gonna.    

           EXT. SAFE BUILDING - NIGHT

           Patrick stands by the Volvo while, out of earshot, Bomb says 
           goodbye to Cilla.  She clings to him, weeping.  He soothes 
           her, kisses her.  We don’t hear what they say.  

           Patrick nods to Berto, who wheels TWO DUFFELS over to him, 
           and hefts them into the trunk.  
                             PATRICK
                        All set, Berto?

                             BERTO
                        We good.  (beat)  It was a pleasure 
                        to rock with you, Mr. Gautreaux.   

           Berto gives Patrick a little salute, then strides over to a 
           BEIGE MINIVAN parked nearby, climbs behind the wheel.  

           Patrick slams the trunk closed, glances over to the doorway, 
           where Cilla and Bomb finally break apart.

           Patrick gets behind the wheel of the Volvo, and Bomb gets the 
           passenger seat.  Cilla gets into the Minivan with Berto.  

           The Volvo and the Minivan take off, in opposite directions.  

           EXT. TRUCK DEPOT - NIGHT

           The MINIVAN pulls up outside the huge, fenced-in LOT 
           containing dozens of 18-WHEEL TRACTOR TRAILERS. 

           Berto hops out, and Cilla slides into the driver’s seat.  The 
           Minivan ZIPS away, as Berto approaches the FENCE--

           INT./EXT. VOLVO - HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

           The Volvo winds its way up Laurel Canyon, higher and higher, 
           until the turnoff for LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN looms ahead.  

           At the INTERSECTION, there are THREE BLACK SUVs parked at the 
           roadside, and a HALF DOZEN ARMED FEDS standing amongst them.  

           The Volvo slows to a stop about fifty feet away.  

           INSIDE, Patrick and Bomb exchange a final, tense glance. 

                             PATRICK
                        Remember the buttons. 

           Bomb nods, then steps out of the car, hands raised above his 
           head, and a few moments later, Patrick does the same.   

           Almost instantly, the two men are SWARMED by the Feds, who 
           shove them up against the car, frisk them roughly.  

           A Fed moves to the trunk of the Volvo, pops it, finds the 
           Duffels inside, unzips one of them, and the tightly-packed 
           bundles of cash almost burst through the opening-- 
           The Fed grins, stuffs the cash back in, zips it back up, 
           slams the trunk closed, whips out a walkie--

                             FED
                        Good down here.   

           PLANT’S VOICE CRACKLES through the Walkie:

                             PLANT’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Bring ‘em up.  

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

           Plant sets down the Walkie, paces in anticipation, until he 
           notices a worn-looking POE standing there, arms crossed.     

                             PLANT
                        Agent Poe, you’re just in time.  
                        This is our cigar moment.  

           Poe rubs her aching sternum, struggles to find the words.  

                             POE
                        Sir, I wanted to know. (beat)  I’d 
                        like to know how.  How you’ll be 
                        assessing my performance.  

           Plant smiles magnanimously.  

                             PLANT
                        Look.  You did incredible work.  
                        Solid, magnificent work.  Right up 
                        until you lost our man.  

           Poe looks like she just got slapped.  

                             POE
                        Is that what you’re gonna write up?  
                        That I lost him?     

                             PLANT
                        It was a very complicated 
                        operation.  Truth is, I always had 
                        a sense I couldn’t trust him.  So I 
                        put in my own contingency.        

           Poe nods, clenches her jaw, cocks her head. 
                             POE
                        Sir, that deal you made with him.  
                        That he’d be released if he brought 
                        in Hardaway.  (beat)  How much of 
                        that was true? 

           Plant walks closer, shakes his head, smiles, bemused. 

                             PLANT
                        Come on, Poe.  Don’t be so green. 
                        He’s a criminal.  Nothing’s sacred 
                        to a lying scumbag like Patrick 
                        Gautreaux.  And criminals are 
                        predictable.  You’ll learn, in 
                        time, that in order to catch them, 
                        you have to think like them.      

           Poe looks at him with thinly-veiled disgust.  

                             POE
                        Maybe you don’t just think like 
                        one.  Maybe now you are one.   

                             PLANT
                        Step lightly now.     

                             POE
                        (undeterred)
                        I bet Zorn doesn’t even know half 
                        of what you’ve been up to.  All 
                        your bullshit-ass reports.   

           Plant walks closer to her, speaks low--

                             PLANT
                        My bullshit-ass reports have the 
                        juice to have you demoted back to 
                        trainee status, Althea.  Is that 
                        what you want?  

           Poe shakes her head, breathes through her nose.  An act of 
           will not to crush Plant’s windpipe with one quick chop.  

                             POE
                        I’ve always done right by this gig.    
                        Every minute of every day.     

           A beat while Plant studies her defiant expression.      

                             PLANT
                        We all have our weaknesses.

           With a wink, he exits the room.  Poe stands there, seething.   *
           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           The gate swings open, and the convoy of vehicles winds its 
           way up to the top, and everyone climbs out.  

           Patrick rolls the kinks out of his neck, glances up the steep 
           embankment at the headlights zipping along Mulholland--

                             FED
                        Let’s go, pal--

           The Fed shoves Patrick forward, toward the front door--

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - FOYER

           Patrick and Bomb are ushered inside, where they’re greeted by  *
           a smirking PLANT, his head gleaming as if freshly polished.  

                             PLANT
                        Welcome home, friends!    

           Patrick stares at the sweaty, jittery Federal Agent.

                             PATRICK
                        You alright, Agent Plant?  

           Plant ignores him, instead gazes at Bomb like a prized pig.  

                             PLANT
                        Bobby-Bomb Hardaway.  As I live and 
                        breathe.  I’ve waited so long for 
                        this.  This moment right now.   

           Plant STARES openly, aggressively at Bomb, who frowns, turns 
           away, fully creeped-out.  

                             BOMB
                        Whatever.      

           Plant steps forward, cocks his head, leans close to Bomb.  

                             PLANT
                        You’re not tough at all, are you.  
                        Just a skinny little piece of 
                        Inglewood trash who likes to play 
                        dress-up and steal.   

           Bomb wrinkles up his nose, grimaces.  
                             BOMB
                        Ever brush your teeth?  Your breath 
                        stink like grandmama pussy.  

           Patrick snorts.  Plant bristles, nods to Kiyoshi--

                             PLANT
                        The library.  

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - BEDROOM

           A FED leads a CUFFED Patrick down the hall to the BEDROOM, 
           where AGENT POE sits slumped in a chair with her laptop.  

                             PATRICK
                        Althea.  

                             POE
                        Got nothing to say to you.     

           He steps closer, cautiously.    

                             PATRICK
                        I know you find me despicable.  But 
                        I’m glad you’re okay.      

           Finally, she looks up at him.  Her face is colder than cold. 

                             POE
                        I’m the despicable one for failing 
                        at my job.  I don’t feel nothin at 
                        all for a dirty, low-down, lying 
                        convict thief like you.     

           Patrick nods, accepts it.  He bends close to her, speaks low:

                             PATRICK
                        You didn’t fail.  You’re one of the 
                        sickest operators I’ve ever seen.  
                        I’ll never forget.  Another life, 
                        we would’ve been on the same side.    

           The Fed shoves Patrick into the bedroom, shuts the door 
           behind him.  Poe frowns, rubs her sore chest. 

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Patrick enters, and finds Rosalie sitting in an easy chair, 
           with Gigi asleep in her lap.  
           Rosalie looks at him with tired, strained eyes.  He bends 
           down, kisses her softly, careful not to wake Gigi.  

                             ROSALIE
                        How long.    

           Patrick walks to the window, looks out at the DOZEN FEDS 
           milling about.    

                             PATRICK
                        Soon.      

           EXT. LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT

           A HUGE PETERBILT 18-WHEEL SEMI is GROANING and RUMBLING as it 
           makes its way up the steep, winding grade.  

           We see that it’s Berto behind the wheel.  The Semi passes the 
           Lookout Mountain turnoff, rumbles on up the hill--

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - LIBRARY - NIGHT

           Bomb sits in a chair, HANDCUFFED, while Plant paces across 
           the room.   Kiyoshi lingers in the corner.  

                             PLANT
                        Look on the bright side.  You’ll 
                        probably have plenty of friends 
                        waiting for you in the Max.     

           Bombs smiles, checks his watch, shakes his head.  

                             BOMB
                        Yeah, I don’t think so.  I might be 
                        a piece of Inglewood trash, but I’m 
                        not stupid.  I know all about you, 
                        Plant.  You’re doing some pretty 
                        hard-core freelancing and nobody 
                        even knows it.  Your boss, Zorn?  
                        He sure as hell doesn’t know.  You 
                        might be a Fed, but deep down, 
                        you’re just like any deadbeat 
                        gambler who doubled down too many 
                        times and still doesn’t know when 
                        to quit the game. 

           Kiyoshi frowns, shifts uncomfortably against the wall. 

                             PLANT
                        Kiyoshi, would you mind giving us a 
                        minute alone?  
                             BOMB
                        Naw, let him stay.  Hey, Kiyoshi, 
                        when’s the last time you were 
                        briefed by someone other than your 
                        Boss here?  Ever file a Bureau 
                        report on those Escalades?   

                             KIYOSHI
                        Actually, uh--

                             PLANT
                        (to Kiyoshi)
                        Don’t answer him. 

                             BOMB
                        Let the nigga talk.  

                             PLANT
                        Shut your fucking mouth.  

                             BOMB
                        God damn it’s easy to hit your 
                        buttons.  I’ve had a lot of 
                        practice, though.  You were always 
                        easy.  You’re still easy.  Back in 
                        my set, we’d call someone like you 
                        a Buster.  All talk, no heart.   

           Plant crosses his arms, stares at Bomb like a specimen.. 

                             PLANT
                        You know what?  I think you might 
                        not live through the night.  

           Bomb laughs, but unsteadily, not sure he heard right--

                             BOMB
                        Hell you say?

           But Plant just continues to STARE.  Kiyoshi shifts around, 
           disconcerted, disturbed--

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Poe walks toward the door to the LIBRARY--

           She can hear Plant’s VOICE coming from inside, she quietly 
           slips through the door--
           EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT

           The PETERBILT winds along the treacherous hairpins of 
           Mulholland, cars have to SQUEEZE around it, because it almost 
           takes up the entire road--

           The sound of hydraulics HISSING as the semi slows down, 
           approaching a wide dirt turnout that faces South--

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - LIBRARY

           Bomb and Plant still facing off--

                             PLANT
                        Agent Kiyoshi, please uncuff Mr. 
                        Hardaway, and leave the room. 

                             KIYOSHI
                        You sure that’s a good idea--

                             PLANT
                        I suggest you do as you’re told.  

           Kiyoshi obeys, removes Bomb’s cuffs, and exits, confused.  

           Plant pulls out his Smith & Wesson.  Barrel to the floor.  He  *
           goes to a bookshelf, shoves a bunch of books to the floor.  
           Then he pushes over a lamp.   

                             PLANT
                        Wanna know how it happened?

           Bomb’s eyes dart to the window, back to Plant, nervous--

                             BOMB
                        How what happened.  

                             PLANT
                        How you died, Bobby.  Haven’t you 
                        been paying attention? 

           Bomb freezes, eyeballing Plant as he UPENDS a coffee table.   

                             BOMB
                        The hell are you doing? 

                             PLANT
                        I’m creating the scene of our 
                        struggle.  Our fight to the death.    
                             BOMB
                        (nervous)
                        You can put my cuffs back on, dude.  
                        I don’t mind.  

                             PLANT
                        Anyway, it was just so awful.  I 
                        was careless, and you moved so 
                        quickly, like.  Like a panther.  

           Plant kicks over another lamp.  

                             PLANT
                        And when you went for my weapon, we 
                        struggled, we fought, like dogs.  

           Now Plant aims his pistol right at Bomb’s HEAD--

                             PLANT
                        And when you went for my weapon, I 
                        had no choice.  

                             BOMB
                        You can’t do this--  

                             PLANT
                        Do what?  Haven’t you been 
                        listening?  It was self defense.  

           Plant walks closer to Bomb, grinning, pointing the pistol--

                             POE’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Agent Plant.  

           Plant turns to see POE STANDING THERE, looking severe, 
           because she’s been watching all along--

                             PLANT
                        Get out of here, Poe.  NOW.  

                             BOMB
                        He’s gonna fucking kill me--

           Plant WHACKS Bomb in the head with the GUN, and he SPRAWLS to  *
           the floor, dazed--

                             POE
                        Don’t do that, Sir--

           He turns to Poe, eyes wild.  

                             PLANT
                        I told you to GET THE FUCK OUT.  
           Poe stands there, face hard, defiant.  

                             POE
                        No.  

           Plant SWINGS HIS WEAPON TOWARD HER, and she DIVES behind a 
           BOOKSHELF--

           Bomb TACKLES Plant from behind, and they both CRASH to the 
           floor, throwing PUNCHES and KICKS as they both STRUGGLE--

           Plant gets a GRIP on the gun, but Bomb HEAD-BUTTS him, and 
           forces his hand to the floor, where Plant manages to squeeze 
           off two WILD SHOTS-- 

           BLAM-BLAM!  The rounds SHRED the bookshelves--

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Patrick, Ro and Gigi HEAR the GUNSHOTS-- and Gigi SCREAMS--

                             ROSALIE
                        It’s okay, sweetie-- we’re gonna 
                        lie down on the floor now.  

           Patrick, hands cuffed behind him, gently nudges Rosalie and 
           Gigi to the FLOOR--

                             PATRICK
                        Get ready--  

           EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE - TURNOUT - CONTINUOUS

           A quick glimpse of the SEMI on the dirt turnout, the huge 
           tires CRUNCHING the pebbles as they slowly ROLL FORWARD--

           And BERTO JUMPS OUT of the CAB-- starts RUNNING--

           INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           BOMB and PLANT continue to FIGHT VICIOUSLY--

           Plant takes an ELBOW to the TEMPLE, but quickly counters with  *
           a withering series of BODY BLOWS--

           Bomb falls to his knees, clutching his gut, while Plant 
           SCRAMBLES across the floor, reaches for the GUN--

           But it’s KICKED AWAY by POE, who now covers both Plant and 
           Bomb with her own GLOCK--
                             POE
                        Enough.  

           Plant gapes, panting, as she whips out a pair of CUFFS--

                             POE
                        I’m gonna cuff both of you, then 
                        we’re gonna figure this shit out--

           But Plant gets his hand around a HEAVY GLASS PAPERWEIGHT and 
           HURLS it at POE, and it THUNKS off her HEAD--

           She TOPPLES OVER with a GRUNT, and in a flash, Plant’s got 
           her GLOCK in his hand, and he makes his way over to Bomb--

           And from outside, a RUMBLING, a VIBRATION that quickly grows 
           STRONGER and LOUDER--

                             PLANT
                        Good night.  

           As Plant jams the Glock into Bomb’s face, Bomb keeps his eyes  *
           open, sneers confidently, defiant, unafraid.  

                             BOMB
                        Buster.  

           As Plant COCKS BACK the HAMMER--

           INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

           The RUMBLING growing louder still, as one of the Feds checks 
           the DISPLAY SCREENS--

           The driveway is clean... The front door is clean...

           But the COURTYARD screen... is FILLED WITH THE GIGANTIC SEMI 
           HURTLING DOWN THE EMBANKMENT--

                             FED
                        Holy SHIT--

           EXT. EMBANKMENT - COURTYARD - HOUSE

           The stunned Feds look up to see--

           TWENTY TONS OF STEEL MONSTER coming CRASHING DOWN into them--

           The Feds SCATTER like ROACHES--

           The Semi SMASHES HEADLONG INTO THE HOUSE--
           CAVING IN THE WALLS, SHAKING the ENTIRE STRUCTURE to its 
           FOUNDATION, the SOUND is DEAFENING--

           In the LIBRARY:  PLANT and BOMB are THROWN across the ROOM as 
           the WALLS RUPTURE and the CEILING IMPLODES--

           In the HALLWAY: Rosalie and Gigi SCREAM as the HOUSE SHAKES 
           and PIECES OF CEILING RAIN DOWN, but they land crumbling on 
           PATRICK’S BACK, as he SHIELDS THEM--

           In the LIVING ROOM: the SEMI CAB PUNCHES SIDEWAYS THROUGH the 
           WALLS, finally coming to rest in the middle of the ROOM--

           The Cab HISSES and FLUIDS LEAK and SPURT from the WRECKAGE--

           ROSALIE hurries to an unconscious FED, grabs the CUFF KEYS 
           from his utility belt, quickly UNLOCKS Patrick’s CUFFS--

                             PATRICK
                        Thanks, gorgeous--

           PATRICK quickly gathers up his girls-- he HUSTLES them 
           through the WRECKAGE of the house, to where the Front Door 
           used to be--

           He passes by the wreckage of the LIBRARY, where BOMB is 
           CRAWLING OUT from under heavy chunks of CEILING--

                             PATRICK
                        Quickly now, quickly--

           The FLUIDS from the mangled Semi suddenly CATCH FIRE, and the 
           FLAMES LICK HUNGRILY along the floor and ceiling--

           Patrick moves to Bomb, FLINGS chunks of plaster off his back, 
           HAULS him to his feet, guides everyone toward the outside, 
           circumventing the growing FLAMES--

           EXT. COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

           The shell-shocked FEDS-- the ones still on their feet-- GAPE 
           at the wreckage, SEARCH the debris for their comrades--

           Patrick leads Rosalie and Gigi to the TAHOE, loads them into 
           the back seat, FASTENS their BELTS, then SHOVES a dazed Bomb 
           into the back next to them--

                             PLANT (O.S.)
                        Not going...anywhere...

           Patrick turns to see PLANT approaching, BLOOD trickling down 
           his face, into his EYES, aiming Poe’s GLOCK--
                             PLANT
                        I didn’t want to... I didn’t want--

           Patrick instantly WRAPS HIMSELF around Gigi--

                             POE (O.S.)
                        You DO NOT do that, Sir.  

           POE EMERGES from the darkness, BLEEDING, and SPIN-KICKS the 
           PISTOL right out of Plant’s hands--

                             POE
                        Mother-FUCKER.  You DON’T.  

           WHAP--WHAP--WHAP--WHAP!  She unleashes a FLURRY of KICKS to 
           Plant’s CRANIUM, and a final VICIOUS PUNCH to his solar 
           plexus KNOCKS him to the ground, he GASPS for air--

           Patrick gapes at her, stunned and grateful--

                             PATRICK
                        Come with us.  We need you.  

           Poe almost smiles, shakes her head, then winces, because her 
           head still hurts like hell.    

                             PATRICK
                        We could say I took you hostage.  

                             POE
                        You’re a sweet man, but you know I 
                        can’t do that.   

           Patrick nods, accepts it.  

                             PATRICK
                        Damnn shame.  None of us can drive 
                        worth shit.  

                             ROSALIE
                        Speak for yourself.  

           And ROSALIE climbs behind the wheel, starts her up--

                             POE
                        There’s a tracer in that Tahoe, 
                        Goat.  You won’t lose them.     

           Patrick nods, and jumps in the shotgun seat.  

                             PATRICK
                        Counting on it.  Goodbye, Althea.  
           The Tahoe SCREECHES down the Driveway--

           Many of the FEDS have now regained their senses enough to 
           give CHASE, and several of them bust out FIREARMS--

           BLAM! BLAM! They FIRE at the departing Tahoe--

           And from within the wrecked house, the SEMI SUDDENLY EXPLODES 
           in a MASSIVE FIREBALL--

           BLOWING some FEDS off their feet, while others are piling 
           into the SUV’s, preparing to GIVE CHASE--

           Agent Poe stands off to the side, watching them go.  

           As the TAHOE BARRELS down the Driveway, doesn’t slow for the 
           GATE, instead SMASHES RIGHT THROUGH IT--

           The THREE SUV’s SCREECH down the DRIVEWAY, in close PURSUIT--

           Nearby, Plant peels himself off the ground--

                             PLANT
                        Agent Poe!  Agent Fucking Poe!

           He’s battered and bloody, but his eyes still full of fire as 
           he searches the area, but now, she’s NOWHERE to be found.  

           EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

           Plant, rubbing his sore chest, limps over to the VOLVO, and 
           pops the trunk.  Inside, the DUFFELS.  He UNZIPS one of them, 
           ALL THE WAY OPEN, and sees that the CASH is nothing but a 
           THIN OUTER LAYER, covering BULLSHIT STACKS of COPY PAPER.  

           His expression is oddly calm, even though he’s battered, 
           bruised, face full of blood.  

                             PLANT
                        Oh, yes.  Of course.  Yes.  

           He UNZIPS the SECOND DUFFEL.  It’s the EXACT SAME THING.   

           He walks slowly over to his Unmarked FALCON.  There’s a piece  *
           of BURNING WRECKAGE leaning against the door, and he KICKS it  *
           away, and climbs behind the wheel.  

           He reaches into the glove compartment, pulls out a GPS 
           RECEIVER, flicks it on, and starts up the vehicle.  
           INT./EXT. TAHOE - HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

           The TAHOE speeds down the steep, twisting angles of Lookout 
           Mountain, and we can see the FIVE PURSUING SUVs about TWENTY 
           SECONDS behind them--

           And just before they reach the bottom of Lookout Mountain, at  *
           the intersection with Laurel Canyon--

                             PATRICK
                        (to Rosalie)
                        Flash the headlights, Ro--

           The Tahoe’s LIGHTS FLASH as it speeds past a row of HEDGES, 
           and as soon as it’s gone by--

           CILLA emerges from behind the hedges, and she quickly DRAGS A   *
           CHAIN OF SPIKE-STRIPS across the STREET--

           As soon as the SPIKES have stretched the entire width, Cilla 
           quickly DIVES into the thick BRUSH on the opposite side--

           Seconds later, the PURSUING SUV’s come ROARING down the hill,  *
           and as the FIRST VEHICLE hits the SPIKES--

           The TIRES EXPLODE with a BOOM and a SHOWER OF SPARKS, and the  *
           SUV SPINS SIDEWAYS, and is RAMMED by the SECOND SUV--

           The FIRST SUV FLIPS OVER while the SECOND SUV SPINS WILDLY 
           and COLLIDES with an enormous TREE--

           The REMAINING THREE SUVs are forced to SLOW DOWN while one of  *
           the FEDS must jump out and CLEAR AWAY the SPIKES--

           And then the THREE REMAINING SUV’s are in PURSUIT again, but 
           they’ve lost some valuable time--

           Find the TAHOE careening down Laurel Canyon, VEERING around 
           slower-moving VEHICLES, SCREECHING around tight turns--

           Up AHEAD, there is a RED LIGHT, and a LINE OF CARS WAITING--

                             ROSALIE
                        Everybody hold onto something--

           She VEERS into the ONCOMING LANE, and SPEEDS PAST the LINE OF  *
           CARS, and VEERS BACK into the LANE, just BARELY MISSING a 
           PICKUP descending the HILL to the RIGHT--

           One of the SUVs tries the SAME MOVE, and DUCKS the LIGHT--

           But HORNS BLARE as the PICKUP SLAMS on its BRAKES--
           SCREEEEE-- the PICKUP fucking T-BONES the SUV, SMASHES it 
           CLEAR ACROSS THE ROAD, into a LINE of CARS-- 

           The TAHOE keeps SPEEDING down the incline, DISAPPEARS around 
           a tight curve, hotly PURSUED by the TWO REMAINING SUVs--  

           INT./EXT. TAHOE - LAUREL & SUNSET - NIGHT

           The Tahoe comes HURTLING through the INTERSECTION, pursued by 
           the TWO SUVS, and they CUT THROUGH TRAFFIC and head WEST on 
           SUNSET, WEAVING around CARS and PEDESTRIANS--

                             PATRICK
                        Someone called the cavalry--

           Because there are now a DOZEN LAPD CRUISERS on their tail, 
           sirens WAILING, lights FLASHING, along with the SUVS--

                             BOMB
                        Don’t forget the goddamn Sky Team--

           And yes indeed, there’s an LAPD CHOPPER OVERHEAD, shining its 
           SPOTLIGHT DOWN upon them--

           The Tahoe RUNS A RED and takes a HARD LEFT down LA CIENEGA--

           The pursuing SQUAD CARS try to FOLLOW but TWO of them are 
           CRUSHED by ONCOMING TRAFFIC--

           INT. FORD FALCON - CONTINUOUS

           PLANT drives through the night, windows down.  He checks the 
           GPS, drops it on the seat, spits BLOOD out the window--

           INT./EXT. TAHOE - INGLEWOOD - NIGHT

           The Tahoe has LOST many of the pursuing vehicles, but there’s 
           still at least 10 WAILING CRUISERS following close behind.

           And of course the CHOPPER overhead, ILLUMINATING everything--

                             PATRICK
                        We don’t lose that Bird, they’re 
                        gonna follow us all the way there--

                             ROSALIE
                        Got something in mind for that--

           Rosalie suddenly CUTS ACROSS THE STREET, and starts DRIVING 
           RIGHT INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC--
           Horns BLARE, tires SCREECH as the TRAFFIC SWERVES to avoid 
           them, many cars SMASHING INTO the pursuing SQUAD CARS--

           Gigi SCREAMS from the back, Patrick tries to comfort her--

                             PATRICK
                        It’s okay, cookie, just close your 
                        eyes, pretend you’re Dora the 
                        Explorer, it’s an adventure--

           Gigi closes her eyes, furrows her brow.

           Rosalie CUTS SHARPLY into an alley, leaving behind a MASSIVE 
           PILEUP, but still a half-dozen CRUISERS are following--

           After a few more SHARP TURNS, the Tahoe emerges onto 
           MANCHESTER BLVD, heading WEST, toward the AIRPORT--

                             ROSALIE
                        Should be under the canopy of LAX 
                        airspace in about thirty seconds--  

           She GUNS IT, and they’re FLYING down Manchester at about 
           NINETY, running LIGHTS and WEAVING through TRAFFIC--

           Who would’ve thought it... Rosalie Gautreaux is a SICK WHEEL-- *

                             PATRICK
                        Once we’re in the flight canopy, 
                        nobody else can be in the sky--

           And sure enough...the SPOTLIGHT surrounding them suddenly 
           SHUTS OFF, and the CHOPPER overhead VEERS OFF--

           Bomb grins, leans out the WINDOW, and FLIPS OFF the 
           disappearing Bird--

                             BOMB
                        That’s right.  Fuck you, bitch!

           Rosalie SWERVES the Tahoe and Bomb is JERKED back inside--

           She CUTS HARD across ONCOMING TRAFFIC and ACCELERATES into a 
           darkened, tree-lined SIDE STREET with NO STREET LIGHTS--

           MORE of the CRUISERS are T-BONED as they try to FOLLOW HER 
           across to the side street--

           The WRECKAGE of the CARS goes SPINNING across MANCHESTER, 
           creating another EPIC PILE-UP--
           INT./EXT. SIDE STREETS - INGLEWOOD - CONTINUOUS

           The Tahoe speeds down the dark street, blowing through stop 
           signs, quick LEFT, then RIGHT, LEFT--

           They’re still being chased by TWO CRUISERS and a FED SUV, who  *
           trail about two hundred yards behind, sirens WAILING--

           Finally they SCREECH to a stop in front of a GREEN HOUSE 
           where a MAD PARTY is going on, MUSIC THUMPING with BANGERS 
           and DIMES and HOMIES spilling out onto the porch--

           And yes, it’s that SAME GREEN CRAFTSMAN where Patrick dropped  *
           off Little Bomb 15 YEARS AGO--

           Everyone PILES OUT of the Tahoe, led by BOMB, and the sea of 
           REVELLERS opens up a PATH for them to get through--

           EXT. GREEN CRAFTSMAN - SECONDS LATER

           The two CRUISERS and the SUV JAM to the CURB outside the 
           house, the LAW floods out, ARMED and SHOUTING--

           Some PARTIERS SCATTER, some FLEE into the HOUSE, while others  *
           STAND THEIR GROUND and even BRANDISH THEIR OWN WEAPONS.

                   VARIOUS COPS
           Everyone FREEZE!  Turn that 
           FUCKING MUSIC OFF!  HANDS IN 
           THE AIR!  I’ll blow your 
           fucking HEAD OFF! 
                                             VARIOUS BANGERS
                                       Got a Warrant, Motherfucker?  
                                       This is private property, 
                                       Bitch!  Po-Po gonna get 
                                       BLASTED.  

           It’s a STAND-OFF as MORE POLICE CRUISERS arrive on the scene 
           and MORE COPS pile out of the vehicles, assuming FIRING 
           POSITIONS behind their open doors--

           And now a black SWAT VAN arrives, and seconds later there’s 
           TWO CHOPPERS overhead, shining SPOTS down onto the scene--

           More COPS pull around into the ALLEY BEHIND the house, pretty  *
           soon they’ve got it SURROUNDED, all exits BLOCKED, and it’s 
           abundantly clear there’s NO WAY OUT--

           INT./EXT. FORD FALCON - CONTINUOUS

           PLANT arrives at the house, climbs out of the Falcon, surveys  *
           the SCENE, where the HEAVILY-ARMED SWATS are now working 
           their way toward the HOUSE--
           And now the BANGERS, seeing the SWATs’ ridiculous ARTILLERY, 
           start TOSSING their weapons into the bushes, and putting 
           their hands over their heads--

           The SWATS and COPS now start STREAMING into the HOUSE--

           But PLANT hangs back, his eyes narrowed, scanning the crowd, 
           because he just knows something’s off--

           INT. CRAFTSMAN - CONTINUOUS

           The SWATS and UNIFORMS are busy SUBDUING the PARTIERS to 
           their KNEES, and SEARCHING through all the ROOMS--

           It’s CHAOS with the SHOUTS and THREATS of LAW ENFORCEMENT 
           blending with the SCREAMS and PROTESTS of the PARTIERS, and 
           the CRASH of BROKEN-IN DOORS and BREAKING GLASS--

           We FOLLOW a PHALANX of SWATS as they BREAK THROUGH a DOOR 
           leading down a set of STAIRS to the BASEMENT--

           They RUSH down the stairs, and come upon a BANGER and his 
           LADY on a BED in the corner, MOANING and HUMPING CRAZILY--

                             SWAT
                        YOU TWO.  

           The HUMPING COUPLE find themselves looking down the BARRELS 
           of about a DOZEN GUNS and they start to SCREAM and PROTEST--

                                               NAKED CHICK
                    NAKED DUDE
           This is BULLSHIT I’m trying 
           to get my SEX on down here!  
                                       Yeah you LIKE clockin this 
                                       fine chocolate ass, DON’T 
                                       you?

           The Cops COVER them while the rest of them FAN OUT across the  *
           basement, FLASHLIGHTS out, searching--

           A tall, beefy SWAT barks into his shoulder-walkie--

                             BEEFY SWAT
                        Basement’s clear, just a couple 
                        hood rats goin at it--

                             NAKED CHICK
                        The fuck you callin a hood rat, 
                        trick-ass-pig-motherfucker?  
           EXT. CRAFTSMAN - CONTINUOUS

           While the hectic RAID goes on in the background, find PLANT 
           stalking along the edge of the Chopper-Spotlit perimeter, 
           sweating, until he’s in a dark part of the pavement.

           He finds himself staring at the row of HOUSES on the OPPOSITE  *
           side of the street.  Halfway down the block, there’s a small 
           YELLOW HOUSE with a LIGHT on inside.  

           And there’s a DARK SHAPE at the window, like there’s someone 
           STANDING there, watching--  

           Plant squints, and takes a few steps toward the house-- 

           And the LIGHT in the window suddenly FLICKS OFF.  

           He PAUSES, then starts toward the house again--

           INT. CRAFTSMAN - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           A few COPS are still COVERING the sheet-covered COUPLE on the  *
           bed.  The BEEFY SWAT notices the edge of a RUG poking out 
           from under the edge of the BED FRAME--

                             BEEFY SWAT
                        Get ‘em off-- there’s something 
                        under the bed--

           The couple STRUGGLES and CURSES as the Cops DRAG them from 
           the mattress, and SHOVE the bed to the side, revealing a RUG 
           underneath, which they YANK aside to REVEAL--

           A FLOOR HATCH--

           They WRENCH OPEN the HATCH, and discover a LADDER leading 
           down into a fucking man-made TUNNEL:

           About 6 feet by 6 feet, strung with BULBS and BUTTRESSED by 
           two-by-fours, and it’s clearly been here for YEARS--

           And now we FOLLOW THE COPS as they DROP DOWN into the TUNNEL 
           and RACE THROUGH, as it CURVES and STRAIGHTENS AGAIN and they  *
           keep FOLLOWING it, one hundred feet, two hundred, three--

           Until they reach the END finding ANOTHER LADDER and the BEEFY  *
           SWAT climbs up, tries to OPEN the HATCH in the CEILING but it  *
           WON’T OPEN so he starts POUNDING on it--

           And now POV RISES UPWARD, passing THROUGH THE TUNNEL, upwards  *
           through DIRT and FLOORBOARDS until we find ourselves in--
           INT. YELLOW HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           In the KITCHEN of a completely different HOUSE, and we can 
           see the FLOOR HATCH SHUDDERING as it’s POUNDED from 
           underneath, and we PULL BACK to reveal:

           All our friends-- PATRICK, BOMB, ROSALIE holding GIGI in her 
           arms-- are HUSTLING out of the kitchen--

           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!  A series of BULLETS punch through 
           the HATCH from underneath as the COPS FIRE up into it--

                             PATRICK
                        Help me with the fridge!

           Patrick and Bomb rush to the FRIDGE and they HEAVE across the  *
           floor, and with a mighty GRUNT they TIP IT OVER and it 
           CRASHES DOWN over the hatch, covering it completely--

           Everybody RACES to the back, out into the ALLEY behind the 
           property, where the MINIVAN is idling, and CILLA is behind 
           the wheel... and in the back, TWO ENORMOUS DUFFELS OF CASH.

                             PATRICK
                        Everybody in, everybody in--

           Follow ROSALIE as she carries GIGI toward the Minivan--

           But before she even knows what’s happening SOMEONE RIPS GIGI 
           RIGHT OUT OF HER ARMS, and Gigi SCREAMS--

           Everyone TURNS TO SEE--

           AGENT PLANT, eyes wild, and he’s HOLDING A SQUIRMING GIGI in 
           front of him, and as he backs away, he PUSHES A PISTOL 
           against her little body--

                             PLANT
                        Okay now everybody just RELAX and 
                        PUT YOUR HANDS where I can see--

           Patrick’s eyes burn with terror and rage--

                             PATRICK
                        Piece of shit.  YOU DON’T HURT HER.  

                             PLANT
                        YOU DON’T MAKE ME HURT HER.  

           Bomb, wide-eyed, has to physically RESTRAIN Rosalie from 
           LUNGING after Plant, she looks like she’s ready to KILL--
                             ROSALIE
                        What kind of MAN ARE YOU?

           Gigi CRIES as she struggles against Plant, so he GRIPS her 
           tighter against him--

                             PLANT
                        Thought you could make an ASSHOLE 
                        out of me.  No more.  NO MORE.  
                        It’s over and I WIN.  ME.   

           Patrick can’t stop looking at Gigi, the terror in her eyes--

                             PATRICK
                        Okay.  You win.  You’re hurting 
                        her.  Please just stop.  

                             PLANT
                        I want everyone to slowly get down 
                        on your KNEES and then lie on the 
                        GROUND with your FACES DOWN.  

                             GIGI
                        Daddy...

           Patrick slowly lowers himself to his knees--

                             PATRICK
                        Nobody’s gonna hurt you, Gee.  

                             PLANT
                        Oh but I will, I will.  

           ROSALIE suddenly BREAKS FREE of Bomb’s grip and RUSHES toward  *
           Plant, and he AIMS THE GUN AT HER FACE.  

                             PATRICK
                        Ro, Jesus--

                             ROSALIE
                        NOT scared of you.  

           She SLAPS Plant in the face, and doesn’t flinch at all when 
           he presses the barrel against her cheekbone.  

                             PLANT
                        (stunned)
                        Get away from me--

                             ROSALIE
                        Fucking worm, fucking COWARD--
           Plant suddenly KICKS her to the ground, Gigi SCREAMS, and in 
           a split-second PATRICK and BOMB are RUSHING PLANT--

           Patrick goes straight for Gigi, GRABS her in his arms, while 
           Bomb goes for the GUN--

           Bomb and Plant fight VICIOUSLY for the piece, while Patrick 
           carries Gigi toward the Minivan--

           Bomb and Plant are both skilled scrappers, throwing ELBOWS 
           and KNEES and JABS and HEAD-BUTTS and it’s getting BLOODY--

           Plant gets the upper hand with a sharp CHOP to Bomb’s THROAT,  *
           and he climbs on top of him, straddles him, picks up the 
           PISTOL and aims it between Bomb’s wide EYES--

           CRACK-A-LACK! 

           Plant turns to see FOUR HGRC BANGERS standing in a row, 
           brandishing evil-looking black-steel ASSAULT RIFLES.   

                             VOICE (O.S.)
                        Don’t you know where you’re at?    

           And ROPE rolls out of the shadows, alongside his homies.  

                             ROPE
                        This is my block, motherfucker.  

           Plant aims his pistol wildly, but there’s too many targets.  

                             PLANT
                        You can’t do this.  These people 
                        are wanted criminals.  

           Rope rolls closer, until he’s right beside Plant.  

                             ROPE
                        Yeah?  What’s that make you? 

           Plant AIMS the pistol, but Rope just LAUGHS-- he’s seen so 
           many gun-barrels in his life, it doesn’t even faze him.

                             PLANT
                        KEEP AWAY FROM ME.    

           Rope SNATCHES the gun from Plant.  Tosses it to his homies.  

           Bomb staggers to his feet, goes to the Minivan, reaches 
           inside, grabs a SATCHEL, and tosses it over to Rope.  

                             BOMB
                        Make sure everybody gets happy.  
           Rope feels the weight, smiles, throws up a HAND SIGN.  

                             ROPE
                        For life, little Bomb.  

           Bomb returns the SIGN.  

           Everyone piles into the Minivan.  It cruise silently, safely 
           away, disappearing down the alley into the dark--

                             PLANT
                        (its over)
                        You can’t let them.  You can’t let 
                        them.  You can’t let them.  

                             ROPE
                        Don’t cry, homie.  Ain’t your fault 
                        you were born a bitch.  

           Rope and his Soldiers disappear into the shadows of the 
           neighborhood, as the SHOUTS of POLICE approach, and the 
           CHOPPERS fly overhead, shining their SPOTLIGHTS down upon 
           Plant, alone on the pavement--

                                                CUT TO BLACK.  

           EXT. STREET TACO STAND - MEXICO - NIGHT

           Patrick and Bomb sit eating tacos at a modest stand on a 
           cobbled, dirty street.  This isn’t a tourist part of Mexico. 

                             PATRICK
                        We’re gonna lose a lot of equity to 
                        the Fences.  Got too loud out in 
                        the world.  You know that, right?  

           Bomb nods, grim but resigned, sips his beer.  

                             PATRICK
                        We’ll be lucky to keep thirty 
                        percent.  It’s the only way to be 
                        safe.  Too many assholes out there.  

                             BOMB
                        Yeah, Goat.  I know it.  

           Patrick finishes a taco, wipes his mouth, studies Bomb.  

                             PATRICK
                        And you know the rest, too.  
                             BOMB
                        Yeah.  We can’t be near each other 
                        anymore.  Gonna have to say goodbye 
                        for a little while.  

                             PATRICK
                        A long while, Bobby.  

           Bomb crosses his arms, sags.  Not happy, but resigned. 
           Patrick studies him some more.  

                             PATRICK
                        You’re just gonna keep on twisting, 
                        aren’t you.  Even if I suggest 
                        otherwise.  

           Bomb just looks at Patrick, shrugs, almost smiles.  

                             BOMB
                        What am I supposed to do in five, 
                        ten years, wait tables?  Maybe I 
                        don’t know how to do anything else.  
                        Maybe you don’t either, Goat.  

           Patrick nods, smiles sadly.  He stands up, brushes off his 
           pants.  Bomb also gets up out of his chair. 

                             PATRICK
                        Maybe you’re right.  (beat)  So, 
                        where you gonna go now?  

                             BOMB
                        Dunno really.  You?

                             PATRICK
                        I don’t have the slightest idea.  

           They both stand there, on opposite sides of the table.  

                             BOMB
                        We both just lied to each other.  

                             PATRICK
                        It’s better that way.  

           Bomb nods, looks at the ground.  

                             BOMB
                        I wish we could stay in the same 
                        place, Goat.  I really do.  
                             PATRICK
                        I know, Bobby.  And that’s why I’m 
                        gonna walk away first.  

           Patrick gives Bomb’s shoulder a squeeze, turns his back, and 
           walks off into the night.  Bomb watches him go, sadly.   

           Then he gets up, and walks off in the opposite direction.  

           Left behind on the table, a crisp, depo-fresh $100 bill, 
           pinned under a beer bottle, flutters in the warm breeze.

           The End
