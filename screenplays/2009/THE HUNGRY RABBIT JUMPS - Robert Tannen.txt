           EXT. PHILADELPHIA - SKYLINE - DAY 

           Summer heat and haze give the city a dream-like feel.

           EXT. BROWNSTONE DUPLEX - BACKYARD - DAY 

           A Labor Day barbecue in a middle class neighborhood.

           TWENTY-FIVE FOLKS (mid 20’s to 50’s, all races) mingle, 
           eat, chat, sweat. THREE KIDS (5, 8, 10) run back and 
           forth through a sprinkler in the small yard and play in a 
           kiddie pool.

           Manning the grill is NICK GERARD, solid physique, sharp 
           mind, a high school chemistry teacher. He wears a chef’s 
           apron, works the grill. Smoke billows over him, rivers of 
           sweat course down his face.

           LAURA GERARD approaches her husband with a cold beer. 
           She’s an attractive woman with a playful, intelligent 
           twinkle in her eyes.

           She holds the beer to Nick’s cheek. They look out over 
           the party, some of their closest friends in the world.

                                 LAURA
                        I’m glad we did this.

                                 NICK
                        Me, too. Sara’s kids soaked the 
                        Franklins’ cat so expect a call.

                                 LAURA
                        Maybe the monster will stop leaving us 
                        dead birds now.

           Laura kisses Nick’s neck, tastes his sweat.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Yum. I’m going to do my duty and mingle.

           Laura moves off, turns and winks at her husband. This is 
           a couple in love.

           Nick watches Laura join her best friend TRUDY (20’s, 
           white), Trudy’s husband, MAX (30’s, white), ANNABEL 
           (40’s, black) and Annabel’s HUSBAND (40’s, black).

           Nick turns his attention back to the grill. He prods a 
           burger. Blood oozes.

                        Jimmy, rare, blue cheese, with your name 
                        on it!

           JIMMY (40’s, white), an ex-Philly cop, approaches.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Is that too bloody?

                                 JIMMY
                        I call it flavorful, Nicky. That’s 
                        perfect.

           Nick plops the burger on Jimmy’s plate/bun.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, brother. So how are you 
                        feeling about tomorrow?

                                 NICK
                        I’m in denial. I’ve got a few more hours 
                        of summer left.

                                 JIMMY
                        I don’t know how you do it year after 
                        year. It’s people like you, Nick, who 
                        give us all hope.

                                 NICK
                        You did your part, too, officer.

                                 JIMMY
                        And what am I now? Chopped liver? I 
                        secure a very important cultural 
                        institution. “High profile target” is the 
                        operative word.

                                 NICK
                        Here’s to you.

                                 JIMMY
                        Here’s to both of us.

           The men toast with their beers, drink.

           A spray of water hits Nick and Jimmy. The older boy has 
           taken the hose off the sprinkler and holds it with a sly 
           grin.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        On three, Nick. You take the left flank, 
                        I got the right. Three.

           with the hose.

           The five year old child grabs Nick by the leg, “tackles” 
           him. Nick mock-falls into the kiddie pool. Nick lies on 
           his back in the water, puts his arms behind his head. The 
           water feels like heaven.

           He stares up at the leafy trees and the cumulus clouds 
           which billow across the sky.

           INT. ATTIC BEDROOM - NIGHT

           An air conditioner HUMS in the window. Beyond, there’s a 
           flash of heat lightning.

           Nick and Laura make love on their bed, sweating, 
           grunting. There’s a CLAP OF THUNDER (O.S.)--the couple 
           flinch, startled, their rhythm interrupted. They roll off 
           each other, LAUGHING.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Nick drives a mid-90’s Honda Civic through the streets of 
           southwest Philly, one of the rougher areas of the city. 
           He stops at a red light. He’s the only white face to be 
           seen.

                                 JUNKIE (O.S.)
                        Hat for the heat, hat for the sunshine! 
                        Five dollars, five dollars!

           A JUNKIE (30’s, black) works the interchange, selling 
           “vintage” (read: used), Phillies baseball hats. He 
           balances a half-dozen on his head, sweats heavily as the 
           heat wave continues.

                        Hat for the heat, hat for the sunshine! 
                        Hey, officer, I know you a Philly fan. 
                        These here are classics.

                                 NICK
                        No, thanks, and I’m not a cop.

                        Alrighty, officer, how about a ferret 
                        then?

           The man opens his trench coat. A ferret sticks its head 
           out of an inner pocket.

                                 JUNKIE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll give you the early bird special. Ten 
                        dollars for this cutie.

                                 NICK
                        No, thank you.

           The light turns green and Nick drives off as the junkie 
           works the cross traffic:

                        Hat for the heat, hat for the sunshine!

           Nick eyes the man in the rear view mirror, chuckles over 
           the absurdity of a man selling a ferret on a street 
           corner. Welcome to Philadelphia.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CHEMISTRY LAB - DAY

           The room is filled with basic chemistry equipment and 
           THIRTY NINTH GRADE STUDENTS (wearing black and white 
           “uniforms.”) All the students are black or Latino, poor, 
           and “at risk.”

           Nick (wearing safety goggles and gloves) stands in front 
           of his class, holding a vial in each hand.

                                 NICK
                        Potassium chlorate. Sugar.

           Nick pours the two together in a beaker.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Nothing. No reaction. But now I add one 
                        drop of sulfuric acid.

           Nick squeezes in a drop of sulfuric acid. The reaction of

           EXT. PHILADELPHIA - AERIAL - NIGHT 

           Soaring past the lights of downtown’s skyscrapers. On the 
           horizon, there’s the flickering of heat lightning.

           Among the downtown buildings, is an illuminated half 
           dome. This is the Kimmel Center, home of the Philadelphia 
           Orchestra.

           INT. KIMMEL CENTER - NIGHT 

           The Philadelphia Orchestra slugs their way through 
           Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring.”

           Among the orchestra is Trudy (violin) and Max (cello).

           LAURA, looking striking in a tux, works the violin, 
           sitting amongst the second violins.

           INT. ICE RINK - NIGHT 

           A men’s hockey league. The level of play leaves much to 
           be desired.

           Nick skates down the rink, working the puck. He winds up, 
           shoots, sends the shot high up over the boards. His shot 
           is met with ribbing from his teammates.

                        Look out for Gretzky!

           Nick smiles big (showing his mouthguard), glides around 
           the back of the net and points to the spot where he 
           whiffed.

                        We only lost by one. And I didn’t get 
                        injured. So it was a good night.

           EXT. KIMMEL CENTER - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 

           Laura’s on her cell, in a dressing room shared with other 
           performers.

                                 LAURA

                        survived another first day.

           Laura gathers her stuff, moves out of the room and 
           through the backstage area, still talking on her cell.

                                 NICK

           a LIZARD TATTOO with a flicking tongue.

           He eyes a fit woman...his gaze moves to another woman...

           Lizard’s gaze lowers, finds the window of an upscale 
           Tapas Bar. Sitting at a window table are 

           LAURA, TRUDY and MAX. They drink wine, share a plate of 
           assorted tapas, unwind after their performance. They 
           laugh at some unheard joke.

           A fat raindrop SMACKS the pavement. And ANOTHER. And 
           ANOTHER.

           EXT. TAPAS BAR - NIGHT

           Laura, Trudy and Max hug goodbye. The wind has kicked up, 
           the storm on the way. Laura hurries off in one direction, 
           Trudy and Max head in the opposite direction.

           Laura presses the call button. The elevator doors jerk 
           open and she steps inside.

           INT. ELEVATOR - MOVING - NIGHT

           The elevator descends. Laura glances at the inspection 
           report. The glass covering the report has been graffitied 
           over and the report can’t be seen.

           The doors open. Laura exits and makes her way toward her 
           car.

           A METALLIC CLICK (O.S.)--

           Laura freezes, glances behind her as the elevator doors 
           close. She scans the parking garage...

           She sees nobody, just a few parked vehicles under the 
           weak lighting.

           Laura continues to her Suburu Outback. She enters the 
           car, quickly shuts the door. She locks the doors.

           Laura’s visibly relieved, safe in her car--

           stocking-headed man--Laura SCREAMS--glimpse of a lizard 
           tattoo--she reaches for the ignition button--

           GLASS SHATTERS, rains down upon her.

           Nick’s sound asleep. The PHONE RINGS and jolts him awake.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 

           The storm has finally hit and the heavens have opened. A 
           blur in the rain, Nick, hurries into the hospital 
           entrance.

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT 

           Nick, shell-shocked, dripping from the rain, hurries down 
           a long, anonymous hallway.

           INT. ICU UNIT - NIGHT 

           A NURSE leads Nick to a patient room. She knocks once on 
           the door, opens it.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Nick is led in by the NURSE. There’s A DOCTOR, A SECOND 
           NURSE, and A DETECTIVE in the room.

                                 NURSE
                                (to the men)
                        Husband.

           Nick freezes as he sees Laura. She’s asleep and sedated. 
           There are bright red scratch marks across her neck. One 
           eye is swollen shut, the size of an apple. She’s hooked 
           up to an IV and an EKG machine. Her heartbeat BEEPS.

           Nick slowly approaches, fights tears, crouches beside his 
           wife.

                        She’s okay?

                                 DOCTOR BURDETTE
                        Her eye socket’s broken. She has several 
                        deep lacerations. We’re also very 
                        concerned that she might have internal 
                        bleeding.

                                 NICK
                        But she’s going to be okay?

                                 DOCTOR BURDETTE
                        We’re keeping a close watch. Internal 
                        bleeding is extremely serious.

           Nick turns to the detective.

                                 NICK
                        Do you know who did this?

                                 DETECTIVE
                        We’ll get there.

                                 NICK
                        What does that mean exactly?

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Your wife gave us a description earlier. 
                        We start with that, sir. It’s a process. 
                        But we take this very seriously.

                                 NICK
                        You take it seriously?

                                 DETECTIVE
                        This is a terrible thing to happen to 
                        anybody.

           Nick turns back to his wife.

                                 NICK
                        Could you all give me a moment with my 
                        wife.

           The men and nurse exit the room.

He leans in close.

                        You’re going to be okay, sweetie.

                        me?

           Nick kisses his wife’s cheek. His lips linger.

           Jimmy enters, trailed by Trudy (tears) and Max. They take

                        Is she okay?

           There’s an awkward silence. Nothing to say.

           Nick and his friends sit, drinking coffees out of 
           Styrofoam cups. In the b.g., the rainstorm continues 
           through the front windows/doors.

                                 TRUDY
                        That’s ridiculous, Nick.

           Nick sips his coffee, stares past his friends at the 
           night and the rain.

                                 NICK
                        I’m going up to stay in her room. Go 
                        home, guys, and get some sleep.

           There are unsure glances among the friends.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I’m fine.

                        We’ll be back first thing. You call if 
                        you need something before then, my cell’s 
                        on all night. Promise me, brother.

           Nick nods. Everyone hugs.

           Nick watches his friends exit, disappear into the rainy 
           night.

           shows an informercial for plots of land in some idyllic 
           valley.

           Nick, the only one in the waiting room, stares numbly up 
           at the screen.

           A MAN (40’s, white, a focused energy) enters the room. He 
           wears a generic, grey suit. This is SIMON. 

           Simon takes a seat two rows behind Nick, looks up to the 
           television.

                                 SIMON
                                (re: infomercial)
                        Where is this?

                                 NICK
                        Don’t know.

                                 SIMON 
                        Beautiful.
                                          (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)           Nick nods. The men watch.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        I went to Iceland a few months back. 
                        Stunning. It’s always good to get out of 
                        your space, get of your head. Don’t you 
                        think?

           Nick nods, still silent.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Who do you have in here?

                                 NICK
                        My wife. You?

                                 SIMON
                        A friend. His wife was raped.

           Nick eyes Simon.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        What happened tonight, to Laura, it 
                        shouldn’t have happened.

           Nick takes a hard look at Simon. Simon has the calm, 
           slightly unsettling, demeanor of a funeral home director.

                                 NICK
                        You’re a detective?

                                 SIMON
                        No. How are you doing?

           Simon doesn’t wait for an answer.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        That was a stupid question, wasn’t it?

           Simon moves to a seat closer to Nick, lowers his voice.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        The man who did this to your wife was 
                        paroled three weeks ago. He’s done it 
                        before, he’ll do it again.

           Simon glances out the small window in the door. He’s 
           making sure nobody is there, nobody listening.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        I know what you’re feeling. I’ve been 
                        there.

           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                               (cid:13)           Simon studies Nick, sizing him up.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        We can take care of the man who raped 
                        your wife. It would need to happen 
                        tonight.

                                 NICK
                        What the hell are you talking about?

                                 SIMON
                        You understand what I’m saying, don’t 
                        you?

           The two men lock eyes.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        If you want this to happen, you need to 
                        understand one thing about the way we 
                        work: we might ask something in return.
                                (pause)
                        We might ask you to watch somebody for a 
                        few hours, or break a security camera, 
                        little things like this. Or maybe 
                        something greater.
                                (pause)
                        But most likely, Mr. Gerard, you’ll never 
                        hear anything from us for the rest of 
                        your life.

                                 NICK
                        Who’s “we”?

           Simon ignores Nick’s question.

                                 SIMON
                        We could report him, hand him over to the 
                        criminal justice system. It’s up to you, 
                        it’s your choice.

                                 NICK
                        You know where he is?

                                 SIMON
                        I need an answer, Mr. Gerard. There’s a 
                        time issue.

                                 NICK
                        Where is he?

                                 SIMON
                        It can’t work like that.

                                (pause)
                        I don’t believe this.

           Simon rises, frustrated.

                                 SIMON
                        We’ll tell the authorities, he’ll be 
                        arrested.

           Simon heads toward the door.

                                 NICK
                        Wait.

           Nick says nothing more. Simon stares hard at him.

                                 SIMON 
                        There’s a row of vending machines in the 
                        Oncology Department lobby. If you want 
                        this to happen, select the Eternity Bar. 
                        Buy two of them. Do it in the next hour.
                                (pause)
                        And, Mr. Gerard, we never talked, you 
                        never met me. You will never talk about 
                        anything that went on in this room.

           Simon exits.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 

           Nick stares down at the battered face of his wife. He 
           puts a hand on her forehead, brushes back her hair.

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Nick approaches the Oncology Building. He stares across 
           the street and into the

           EXT/INT. HOSPITAL - ONCOLOGY LOBBY  - NIGHT

           Through the rain and floor-to-ceiling windows, three 
           people can be seen inside:

           (1) A NIGHT GUARD (60’s, black) mans a security desk.

           peanuts, talks on his cell.

           (3) A CANCER PATIENT (30’s, gaunt, shaved head, Latino, 
           earring, hospital gown,) stands by the windows staring 
           out.

           The entrance doors glide open and Nick enters, shakes out 
           his umbrella. He receives a nod from the security guard.

           MUZAK plays from ceiling speakers. There’s a security 
           camera trained on the entrance. The doctor CHATS IN HINDI 
           on his cell.

           Nick makes his way to the vending machines. He eyes the 
           selections, spots the Eternity Bars. He feeds a dollar 
           into the machine.

           Nick debates.

           He presses the button for the Eternity Bar. The bar 
           CLANGS down to the retainer. He buys a second one.

           Nick takes the bars. The wrapper says, “Eat Smart, Do 
           Great Things.”

                                 GUARD (O.S.)
                                (slight Jamaican accent)
                        You sure you want the healthy one?

                                 NICK
                        Excuse me?

                                 GUARD
                        The way I see it, if you’re going to have 
                        a treat, you might as well have something 
                        worth it. I get myself the jalapeno chips 
                        and a Mountain Dew and I’m cheery.

           The guard grins. Nick doesn’t know what the hell is going 
           on. Is this man just making conversation, or is he 
           involved with Simon?

                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                        I got high blood pressure so those chips 
                        are not on my approved diet, but you know 
                        what I figure? I have a heart attack, I’m 
                        in the right place.

           Nick glances at the doctor, still babbling in Hindi, then 
           at the cancer patient who stares out the window. But Nick 
           realizes the man is watching Nick in the reflection of 
           the window. Or not. It’s impossible to tell.

                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Stay dry.

           Nick nods, snaps open his umbrella and exits.

           OUTSIDE

           Under his umbrella, Nick glances back at the Oncology 
           lobby. He wonders what the hell he’s set in motion.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. THAI RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The place is a joint, nothing fancy, filled with downtown  
           artists, third shift workers, and night owls.

           A WAITRESS (Thai, 20’s, slender, bad skin) moves through 
           the room holding a bowl of soup. She places the bowl 
           before Lizard, the rapist, who sits by the windows.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Tom yum gai.

                                 LIZARD
                        Thank you, sweetheart.

           Lizard squeezes a half a lime into the soup. He stirs the 
           broth, catching glimpses of mushrooms, lemon grass 
           stalks, cilantro, spicy peppers, and several oddly shaped 
           chicken pieces.

           Lizard SLURPS the soul-comforting soup. He glances out 
           the window as he feels eyes upon him.

           A JEEP slowly passes. HIP HOP THUMPS from inside. The 
           DRIVER (black, 30’s, sideburns, with a semi-
           hipster/gangster look that could blend into any area of 
           the city) locks eyes with Lizard. And then the Jeep and 
           the man disappear into the night, the thumping music 
           lingering...then gone.

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Lizard enters the run-down apartment house where he 
           lives.

APARTMENT HOUSE - STAIRWELL - NIGHT 

           Lizard climbs the stairs toward his floor. His boots 
           CLOMP on the linoleum.

           He stops. Listens. He heard something. He peers up. Sees 
           nothing. He continues up.

           He suddenly freezes, coming face to face with two men: 
           “SIDEBURNS,” from the Jeep and “CANCER,” the man from the 
           Oncology lobby. Cancer flashes some sort of badge, shows 
           his gun in his waistband.

                                 SIDEBURNS.
                        Turn around, Mr. Hodge.

                                 LIZARD
                        What the fuck?

                                 SIDEBURNS
                        Now.

           Lizard turns around. Cancer secures his wrists with 
           plastic cuffs.

                                 LIZARD
                        What the hell is this bullshit?

                                 SIDEBURNS
                        Up.

           The men climb up the stairs.

           EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT 

           The rain has ceased--mist swirls off the rooftop. Cancer 
           leads Lizard to the edge of the roof.

                                 LIZARD
                        This is wrong, man.

           They reach the edge of the roof. Lizard glances down: 
           five stories below is a lumber supply yard. Sideburns 
           puts a gun to Lizard’s forehead.

                                 SIDEBURNS
                        Did you rape a woman in a public parking 
                        garage tonight, Frank? Tell me the truth, 
                        and you live.

           skin.

                                 LIZARD
                                (pause)
                        Yeah.

                                 SIDEBURNS
                        Yes you did.

           Sideburns pockets his gun. Then, in an instant, he 
           expertly kicks out one of Lizard’s legs, shoves Lizard 
           over the side.

           Lizard lets out a SHOUT then falls. He hits the ground 
           with a DULL THUD. Sideburns and Cancer eye the motionless 
           body below.

                        Go cut the cuffs, make sure he’s gone, 
                        I’ll meet you at the car.

           Cancer moves to the rooftop door. Sideburns takes out his 
           cell, speed-dials.

                                 SIDEBURNS (CONT’D)
                        It’s done.

           INT. DOWNTOWN LOFT - DAY

           THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS. They turn, open one by one.

           REVEAL: high ceilings, sealed cement floors, brick walls, 
           an open floor plan. The large windows reveal a slice of 
           the Philly skyline.

           Nick, sweaty from jogging, enters with the paper and two 
           coffees.

           Laura finishes dressing for a yoga class. The loft is 
           Nick and Laura’s home.

                        Actually, you’re nagging.

           Laura, peeved, grabs her yoga mat and heads downstairs. 
           Nick enters the bathroom, shuts the door a bit too hard.

           Nick leans against the door, tense, frustrated at the 
           iciness that exists between he and Laura. He hears the 
           DOOR (O.S.) SLAM as Laura leaves the loft.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 

           Nick (goggles and gloves) stands before THIS YEAR’S 
           STUDENTS. He holds a rose above a beaker of liquid 
           nitrogen. He blows the rose, the petals flutter.

           Nick drops the rose in the beaker. Removes the rose with 
           tweezers. The rose glitters. He drops the rose on the 
           floor. It shatters.

                                 NICK
                        Liquid nitrogen.

           Nick eyes his class. He focuses on one of his students 
           who slumps on the desk, head down, hands and fingers 
           palming his head.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Edwin, sit up, please.

           EDWIN (14, Latino) maneuvers his fingers on his head into 
           giving Nick the finger.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Cute. Head up, please, Edwin.

           Edwin raises his head. He’s a frail kid, very handsome. 
           Yet his eyes are ferocious. It’s as if somebody has 
           sucked the humanity out of him.

           He sticks his tongue out at Nick, waggles the tongue.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Get out. You know where.

                                 EDWIN
                        Puta.

                                 NICK
                        Out. Now.

           Edwin takes his time, shuffles out of the class.

The teaching racket is 
           wearing on him. Nick moves to the windows, gathering 
           himself, staring out.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Liquid nitrogen. Who wants to hypothesize 
                        as to a few modern uses.

           The class is silent. Nick looks out to the street beyond 
           the school fence. It’s an inner city, commercial strip: a 
           laundromat, liquor store, and take-out Chinese 
           restaurant.

           Nick’s suddenly frozen. Because there’s a man standing in 
           the laundromat, and his profile is familiar: Cancer, from 
           the oncology department. But Nick can’t be sure. The man 
           moves deeper into the laundromat, out of sight.

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. TEACHER’S PARKING LOT - DAY 

           Nick drives out of the lot.

           INT. NICK’S CAR - MOVING - DAY 

           Nick slows as he passes the laundromat. He stares in. 
           Doesn’t see any sign of Cancer. He glances in the liquor 
           store and Chinese restaurant. There’s no sign of him.

           And then a car passes. Cancer’s at the wheel. He doesn’t 
           look at Nick. But Nick’s certain it’s him.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY 

           THE OWNER (50’s, Korean) works the electronic conveyer.

           Nick stands at the counter, waiting for his tux. The DOOR 
           JINGLES open. A MAN (40’s, white, thinning hair, chin 
           scar) enters.

           The Owner finds Nick’s tux, hangs it at the counter. Then 
           punches in the order on a computer.

           Nick says nothing. Is this guy just chatting, or is there 
           something else going on here?

                        Enjoy your wedding.

           Nick eyes Scar, nods, and exits.

           EXT. STREET - DAY 

           Nick crosses the street. He glances back at the store. 
           Scar exits the dry cleaners (with no dry cleaning), walks 
           up the street away from Nick.

           Nick’s spooked, wondering if this man is following him.  
           Nick eyes the businesses on this side of the street. He 
           spots a travel agency with travel posters of vacation 
           spots. He heads toward it.

           He stops before the agency. He looks up at the posters 
           showing beautiful photos of Hawaii, Italy, Mexico, and 
           Greece.

           (cid:13)           Nick stares at the posters. But what he’s really doing is 
           staring at the reflection of the street. And in the 
           reflection he sees Scar watching him.

           Nick, fear rising, enters the Travel Agency.

           INT. TRAVEL AGENCY - DAY 

           Nick glances back out the window, through a slit between 
           posters.

                                 TRAVEL AGENT (O.S.)
                        Help you?

           Nick doesn’t answer. He’s looking for Scar. There’s no 
           sign of him.

           INT. NICK’S CAR - MOVING - DAY 

           Nick drives quickly through the city, late for he and 
           Laura’s appointment.

           He eyes his rear view mirror. It doesn’t appear that 
           anybody is following. But all the faces are starting to 
           appear suspicious to him.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. MARRIAGE COUNSELOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Nick hurries in, late. Laura sits on a couch across from 
           DOCTOR ABRAMS (50’s, female).

                                 NICK
                        Sorry I’m late. Good afternoon, Doctor 
                        Abrams.

           Nick sits beside Laura, pecks her hello.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Hi. Sorry.
                                (to Abrams)
                        That’s the right thing to say, right?

           Nobody thinks his comment is funny.

           Laura eyes her husband, sensing something is off.

                                 LAURA
                        Are you okay?
                                                  (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 NICK
                        Great. Want me to start? I think we’re 
                        doing better.

                                 LAURA
                        I disagree.

                                 NICK
                        Why do you say that?

                                 LAURA
                        You think about that night all the time, 
                        Nick.

                                 NICK
                        That’s not true.

                                 LAURA
                        You’re not being honest.

                                 NICK
                        Sometimes I think about that night. Is 
                        that wrong? Wouldn’t any normal person 
                        think about that night? We’ve been 
                        through this before, haven’t we, Doctor?

           Nick glances at Doctor Abrams. She says nothing.

                                 LAURA
                        What does that mean, “normal person?” You 
                        don’t think I think about that night? The 
                        difference is, Nick, I don’t obsess about 
                        it.

                                 NICK
                        I do not obsess about it, Laura.

                                 LAURA
                        You ask me every single day if I have my 
                        gun in my purse.

                                 NICK
                        Laura, you forget where you put your 
                        keys. You’re forgetful.

                                 LAURA
                                (to Doctor Abrams)
                        He blames himself.

                                 DOCTOR ABRAMS
                        Talk to each other.

                        You blame yourself, Nick. You think it’s 
                        your fault. Which is totally ridiculous.

                                 NICK
                        I’ll tell you what I know. If I had gone 
                        with you to get that drink, it never 
                        would have happened.

                                 LAURA
                        Well if I hadn’t been so stupid and 
                        stubborn, I would have let Trudy and Max 
                        walk me to my fucking car.

           They’re at an impasse. An uncomfortable silence fills the 
           room.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        I just miss the old Nick.

                                 NICK
                        I don’t know what that means.

                                 LAURA
                        When you were happy.

           Nick forces a smile.

                                 NICK
                        I’m happy.

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. KIMMEL CENTER - NIGHT 

           PATRONS arrive, dressed in tuxes and formal gowns.

           INT. KIMMEL CENTER - NIGHT 

           The theater fills for the opening night of Verdi’s “The        
           Masked Ball.” There’s the BUZZ OF THE AUDIENCE and the 
           DISCORDANT SOUND of the orchestra tuning up.

           Nick (tux) moves down an aisle, finds his seat. He eyes 
           Laura, tuning her violin. Then he looks out over the 
           audience. Hundred of anonymous faces. No sign of Scar or 
           Cancer.

           The CONDUCTOR enters to APPLAUSE. The center grows quiet. 
           The baton is raised and the Opera begins.

           Onstage, PERFORMERS (costumed in various masks and 18th 
           century clothes) surround RICCARDO, who wears white-face 
           and a mask.

           It’s the final scene of the opera. Riccardo has been 
           stabbed and he’s dying melodramatically while singing an 
           ARIA.

           His song ends and he’s still. The curtain falls.

           The audience rises to their feet and APPLAUDS.

           NICK’S on his feet clapping. He meets his wife’s eyes. 
           The two exchange small smiles.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 

           It’s the post-performance opening night party. The high-
           ceilinged space is filled with performers and supporters. 
           A JAZZ TRIO PLAYS. The mood is festive.

           Nick, Laura, Trudy, Jimmy, and Max stand at a table, 
           drinking and socializing.

                                 JIMMY
                        ...five years I dated Gong Wu, this is 
                        when I lived in China.

                                 TRUDY
                        You never lived in China.

                                 JIMMY
                        Trudy, please. Gong Wu was the love of my 
                        life.

                                 LAURA
                        What about your ex?

                                 JIMMY
                        People, can I tell a joke here?

           Jimmy takes a piece of folded paper out of his pocket.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        When Gong Wu broke up with me, she wrote 
                        me this long letter. Now you all don’t 
                        mind if I read to you what she said?

           (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                 MAX
                        Tell us.

           Jimmy unfolds the paper.

                                 JIMMY
                        When Gong Wu broke my heart into a 
                        million tiny pieces, this is what she 
                        wrote...

           Jimmy “reads” from the sheet of paper. He speaks CHINESE 
           GIBBERISH. It’s the punch line. Everybody LAUGHS.

                                 NICK
                        I got one.

                                 JIMMY
                        Uh oh.

                                 NICK
                        How many inner city kids does it take to 
                        screw in a light bulb?

                                 TRUDY
                        How many?

                                 NICK
                        “Fuck you, motherfucker.”

           Groans and chuckles. Laura eyes Nick, knowing the dark 
           joke reflects his dark mood these days.

           Nick downs his whiskey, holds up his empty glass.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Who’s still thirsty?

           AT THE BAR

           Nick orders from the bartender.

                                 NICK
                        ...a Kir Royale, and a Jack neat.

           The bartender moves off to make the drinks. Nick glances 
           about the crowded room: the people, the music, the buzz 
           of conversation and laughter. It’s all so civilized and 
           wonderful.

                        Hello?

                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                        Bring them the drinks, excuse yourself to 
                        go the restroom, then head outside.

                                 NICK
                        Who is this?

                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                        It’s Simon.

           Simon hangs up. Nick’s shaken. It’s the moment he’s been 
           dreading for a year and a half.

           Nick scans the room, peers out the windows to the street. 
           He doesn’t see any sign of Simon.

           EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 

           Nick exits, scans the street. There are a few 
           pedestrians, no sign of Simon. Nick’s cell BUZZES. ID 
           shows, “RESTRICTED.”

                                 NICK
                        Hello?

                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                        Do you see the liquor store on the 
                        corner?

           Nick eyes the store.

                                 NICK
                        Yes.

                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                        Meet me in there.

           Simon hangs up. Nick crosses the street, walks to the 
           liquor store and enters.

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT 

           Nick enters, passes through a metal detector. It BEEPS.

                                 CLERK (O.S.)
                        Take out your keys and cell, go through

           container. He passes through the metal detector again 
           with no problem. He collects his personals, moves down an 
           aisle.

           He stares up a bubble mirror which shows every aisle in 
           the store. There’s nobody here but him and the clerk.

                        Yes.

                        Buy a pack of gum, come back outside. 

           Nick buys a pack of gum, exits. There’s no sign of Simon.

                                 NICK
                                (to himself)
                        What the fuck?

           An SUV (tinted windows, temporary plates) turns the

           storefronts down.

           The back door opens. Nick approaches. Simon’s inside.

                                 SIMON
                        Come on in for a few minutes, Nick.

                                 NICK
                        What do you want?

           Nick glances at the driver: Cancer.

                                 SIMON
                        Get in the car. Close the door.

                                 NICK
                        No thanks.

                                 SIMON
                        Nick, please. What do you think we’re 
                        going to do to you?

           Nick enters the SUV, closes the door. They idle.

                                 NICK
                                (re: Cancer)
                        He was following me.

                        Since I saw you that night, has anyone 
                        ever talked to you about any of this? Any 
                        mention of it.

                                 NICK
                        No.

                                 SIMON
                        Nothing? Anything ever strike you as 
                        strange, didn’t feel right? An instinct.

                                 NICK
                        No...today. There was another man. I 
                        think he might have been...I don’t know.

                                 SIMON
                        What did he look like?

                                 NICK
                        White. Starting to lose his hair. Small 
                        scar here, on his chin.

           Simon hands Nick a sealed envelope. It’s addressed to, 
           “SANTA CLAUS. NORTH POLE.” A stamp is already affixed.

                                 SIMON
                        There’s a mailbox across the street from 
                        Girard and 34th street. Go there after 
                        work. I want you to mail that letter at 
                        exactly 3:30.

           Nick eyes Simon, thinking, “Is this a joke?”

                                 NICK
                        What is this?

                                 SIMON
                        It’s a letter to Santa Claus. Nick, 
                        that’s all it is to you. Now tomorrow, 
                        3:30, mail that letter.

           Nick drives home, Laura in the passenger seat. Nick chews 
           gum.

                                 LAURA
                        Did you have fun tonight?

                                 NICK
                        Yup.

           Laura puts a hand on his Nick’s, squeezes, trying for a 
           small connection. Nick forces a smile.

                                 LAURA
                        I want us to work.

                                 NICK
                        Me, too. Don’t you know that?

           Laura nods, wanting to believe it.

                                 LAURA
                        I do.

           Laura climbs up to the bedroom area. Nick waits until 
           she’s out of sight and then he takes the envelope out of 
           his tux jacket pocket. He holds it up to the kitchen 
           light. Can’t make out what’s written on the sheets of 
           paper inside.

           He eyes the seal closely, debates trying to open it. 
           Decides against it.

           He places/hides the envelope in his shoulder bag between 
           teaching folders.

NICK’S CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Nick drives through Philly. He pulls up to 34th and 
           Girard. He finds himself in front of the Philadelphia 
           Zoo.

           He scans the area. Doesn’t see any mailbox. He checks the 
           dashboard time, “3:27.” His cell BUZZES in his pocket. ID 
           shows: “RESTRICTED.”

                                 NICK
                        Hello?

                        Open the letter.

           Nick opens the envelope. There’s a sheet of legal paper 
           folded in thirds. Nick unfolds the paper. Inside is 
           another folded sheet of paper. There’s a phone number 
           (703 555-8905) and three xeroxed photos on the sheet: 

           (1) A WOMAN (40’s, white).

           (2) A MAN (40’s, white, glasses, mop of hair, intense 
           eyes).

           (3) TWO GIRLS (6 & 8, white).

                        When you’re inside you’ll see a gift 
                        shop. Buy a paperback, use cash. Sit on

           He glances at his watch, then up at the PEOPLE entering

                        They're coming. Now when the woman and 
                        the girls enter, follow them but keep 
                        your distance. If that man shows up, you 
                        call the number immediately.

           Simon hangs up. Nick eyes the entrance. He sees the woman 
           and the two girls enter.

           Nick follows the woman and girls. They come to the 
           Humboldt penguin exhibit, watch the penguins frolic and 
           BRAY like donkeys. Nick’s cell BUZZES.

                        No.

                        I want you to fold that sheet in 
                        quarters, then tear it up until it’s 
                        confetti.

           Simon hangs up. Nick takes a last glance at the paper, 
           committing the PHONE NUMBER to memory.

           He rips the sheet into tiny pieces, flutters the pieces 
           into a trash bin.

           Nick follows the woman and girls as they exit the zoo. 
           They make their way to a Volvo, get in and drive away.

           Nick is left standing alone at the edge of the parking 
           lot. The sun is setting and his cell is silent.

                        for your help. It’s appreciated.

           Simon hangs up. Nick takes a breath, visibly relaxes. 
           He’s a free man now. He’s fulfilled his obligation.

           He punches in a CD. Finds one of his favorite rock songs 
           and turns up the volume.

           Laura and other performers prep their instruments for the

           Nick enters, wearing a smile.

                        Hey you.

           The couple kiss. Nick’s in a cheery mood, feeling that

           The door bangs open and Nick and Laura enter, in each 
           other’s arm, lips locked.

           Nick shuts the door, locks all three deadbolts. Laura 
           grabs Nick by the shirt, drags him toward the living room 
           couch. The couple trip over the rug, fall to the ground. 
           They LAUGH, begin to take off each other’s clothes.

           LATER

           Nick makes himself a drink, moves to the couch.

                        Hey, you.

           Nick looks up at Laura, staring down from the bedroom 
           space.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        That was great. Just wanted you to know.

           Laura disappears with a sexy grin.

                        Thank you!

           Nick plops down on the couch. He’s feeling good. He 
           checks his cell. There’s a missed call from “RESTRICTED.” 
           No message.

           Nick hears the SHOWER (O.S.) start. He remotes on JAZZ. 
           He closes his eyes and listens.

                        to remember one sentence. The hungry 
                        rabbit jumps.

           Simon lets the sentence sink in.

                                 SIMON (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Don’t ever say it unless you need to.
                                (pause)
                        One last thing. After it’s over, make 
                        sure you get rid of the instructions, 
                        shred them.

           Simon hangs up. Nick’s slowly shuts his cell. He moves to 
           the refrigerator.

He 
           takes out an envelope from the slot on the back of the 
           fridge.

           AT THE KITCHEN COUNTER

           Nick eyes the envelope. He hesitates, glancing above the 
           bedroom area. He can still hear the shower running.

           Nick tears open the envelope. He pulls out four sheets of 
           paper. He looks through them:

           SHEET 1: A photo of one LEON WALCZAK. It’s the same man 
           who was on the sheet at the zoo.

           SHEET 2: A two paragraph bio on Walczak describing him as 
           a child pornographer.

           SHEET 3: A collage of pictures of GIRLS between the ages 
           of five and eight. Walczak’s victims.

           SHEET 4: A page of extremely specific instructions on how 
           to murder Walczak, although the words “murder” and “kill” 
           are never mentioned.

           Nick’s appalled. This is wrong. It’s wrong and very 
           messed up.

           Nick moves to the balcony and steps outside. He closes 
           the door behind him. He punches in numbers on his cell as 
           he repeats the numbers to himself:

                        703 555-8905.

           There’s one RING, then:

                        disconnected or is no longer in service.

           Nick hangs up. He stares out over the city, the WHITE 
           NOISE of the metropolis drifting up over him.

           Nick and Laura sip coffees, read sections of the paper. 
           It’s a scene of domesticity.

           Laura reads the travel section.

                        Awesome. We should really force ourselves

           Nick nods, reads his paper, his mind on the upcoming 
           task.

           Nick rides the elevator down to the parking garage.

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY 

           Nick approaches his car.

           INT. CAR - DAY 

           Nick turns the ignition. Car doesn’t start.

           He takes a moment then tries again. The battery’s dead.

           Nick is wound, a bundle of nerves. This thing’s really 
           happening.

           Nick stands shoulder to shoulder among MORNING COMMUTERS,

           The train slows to the next stop. Nick makes his way out.

SUBWAY - PLATFORM - DAY 

           Nick eyes the waiting COMMUTERS. He doesn’t see Walczak.

                                 SIMON (V.O.)
                        “We think he’ll be on the 7:12 train. If 
                        he’s not on that train, wait for the next 
                        one. If he hasn’t appeared by the 7:55 
                        train, go to work.”

           Nick glances up at two security cameras.

                                 SIMON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        “There are two security cameras, one 
                        behind you, one in front across the 
                        tracks. Neither camera will work.”

           Nick suddenly spots the back of Walczak (baseball hat, 
           scarf, rough beard) standing in front of the tracks. Nick 
           makes his way through the waiting commuters and up behind 
           Walczak.

           Nick stares at the back of Walczak’s head, his unshaven 
           neck.

           A LOW RUMBLING (O.S.). Heads turn at the sound of the 
           approaching train. The train’s headlight appears in the 
           tunnel.

           The crowd moves nearer to the tracks. Nick shuffles 
           closer to Walczak.

           BRAKES SQUEAL (O.S.) as the train enters the station.

           NICK stands very still.

           THE TRAIN powers past, comes to a SCREECHING stop.

           THE DOORS open.

           And in steps Walczak, trailed by Nick. Nick hasn’t done 
           it--hasn’t killed him--wasn’t able to do it.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Nick sits half a car down and across from Walczak. The 
           train rumbles beneath the city, the lights of the car 
           flickering on and off.

           Inquirer. He looks up from his paper (jumpy, nervous 
           eyes), glances around the car--

           Nick leans back, stares up. He finds himself looking at 
           an ad for a dermatologist, a DR. WOODMAN. “Look Like The 
           Real You!” A graffiti tagger has given Dr. Woodman bushy 
           eyebrows and a bubble caption: “The Real You is Fucking 
           Ugly!!”

           Then he glances at Walczak again. Walczak has his cell to 
           his ear. He shuts his cell and rises as the train 
           approaches the next station.

           The train stops. Walczak steps off. Nick debates 
           following...he rises, moves to the door. But he’s too 
           late as the doors close. He eyes Walczak as Walczak 
           disappears up and out of the station.

                                                               CUT TO:

           Nick skates among other SKATERS. Around and around, 
           trying to clear his head.

           And then he feels eyes upon him. He searches for whomever 
           is watching him.

           There. Simon.

           Simon’s a hundred yards away, by the Schuylkill River, 
           staring back at Nick.

           LATER

           Nick approaches Simon, who sits on a bench, watching the 
           river.

                                 SIMON

                        The girls in the zoo, we thought they 
                        were his next victims. So tomorrow 
                        morning, same everything, assuming he’s 
                        there.

                                 NICK
                        I’m not doing it.

                                 SIMON
                        You owe us.

           Simon hands Nick an envelope.

                                 NICK
                        What’s this?

                                 SIMON
                        Open it.

           Nick opens the envelope. Inside, there are Polaroid 
           pictures of a crime scene. PHOTOS of Lizard’s body (his 
           Lizard tattoo clearly visible) at the lumber yard where 
           he “jumped.”

                                 SIMON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        We did that for you.

           Nick hands the photos back to Simon.

                        There was a man, five months ago. He went 
                        back on his agreement. He was a 
                        commercial pilot. South America route. 
                        Guy has a two day layover in Buenos 
                        Aires. Heads out for a nice meal. Walking 
                        back to the hotel, he’s killed. Over 
                        what? The hundred bucks in his pocket? 
                        His wedding ring? And they never found 
                        out who did it.

           Nick clearly understands the not-so-veiled threat.

                        You come from a working class family in 
                        Pittsburgh. Your father died of 
                        emphysema. He was a mechanic, the most he 
                        ever made was ten dollars an hour. Your 
                        mother lives with your sister in 
                        Pittsburgh. You send them money.

                        Your sister drinks too much. Do you want 
                        me to continue?

           Nick stares bullets.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        You made it out of there, Nick. You got 
                        yourself a degree from Penn. You could be 
                        making a hell of a lot of money, right? 
                        But you’re not. You’re in that terrible 
                        school.

           Simon rises.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        You’re a good man. I don’t want to see 
                        anything happen to you. Or anybody close 
                        to you.

           Simon glances down at the river. Then back at Nick.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Nobody “likes” this, Nick. But we do it 
                        because it’s important. When the justice 
                        system allows animals to fall through the 
                        cracks we step in. What we do is 
                        necessary. It’s right.

           Simon heads off through the park.

                                                       FADE THROUGH TO:

           INT. METRO - STATION PLATFORM - DAY 

           MORNING COMMUTERS wait three deep. WALCZAK stands beside 
           the tracks. Nick maneuvers through the commuters and up 
           behind him.

           Walczak, feeling Nick’s presence, glances back at Nick, 
           vaguely recognizing him from the previous day.

           A moment as their eyes connect. Nick sees fear and 
           paranoia in Walczak’s eyes.

           IN THE TUNNEL there’s the light of the approaching train.

           WALCZAK turns back and faces the tracks.

           The crowd presses forward, jostling for position, bodies 
           against each other.

           Here’s the train--deafening--BRAKES SQUEAL as it hurtles 
           past.

           SQUEALING BRAKES.

           IN THE TRAIN’S SIDE WINDOWS

           The image of Nick flashes past in each window, again and 
           again, like frames of a film.

           ON THE CONDUCTOR’S WINDOW

           A splattering of blood over the glass. The CONDUCTOR hits 
           the emergency button and an EAR SHATTERING, PULSING ALARM 
           sounds in the station.

           ON THE PLATFORM

           Nick weaves his way through the waiting commuters and 
           back to the escalator. He steps aboard, stares up into 
           the blown-out morning light. A transit cop races down  
           past him.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. CAB - MOVING - DAY 

           Nick. Sweating. Breathing quickly as if he can’t get 
           enough air.

           He lowers a backseat window. Cold air streams in. The 
           DRIVER (40’s, black) eyes Nick in the rear view mirror.

                                 DRIVER
                        Close the window.

           Nick glances at the driver, locks eyes for a moment. Then 
           closes the windows.

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - REC YARD - DAY 

           Kids play basketball, gossip in groups, flirt with one 
           another.

           Nick looks out over the yard, on PE duty, trying to keep 
           it together. He’s thinking about what he’s done. It’s 
           already haunting him.

           A scuffle breaks out. Nick and A SCHOOL GUARD are on it. 
           The guard holds one kid. Nick yanks the arms back of 
           Edwin, his class troublemaker.

                                 NICK
                        Stop it. Stop it, Edwin.

           Edwin flails his arms--an elbow catches Nick’s nose.

           Blood flows--Nick releases Edwin. There’s THE MURMUR of 
           testosterone-saturated adolescents.

                                 EDWIN
                        Keep your hands off me, faggot.

           Nick locks eyes with Edwin. And Edwin sees a change in 
           Nick’s eyes, something’s off.

           Nick lashes out--throws a single, vicious punch into 
           Edwin’s face.

                                                               CUT TO:

           Nick sits across from Annabel, his principal and friend 
           (seen at the Labor Day barbecue).

                        Striking a student is a minimum three

                        thinking, Nick?

                                 NICK
                        It was stupid, Annabel.

                        Nothing. Our hands are tied because Edwin

           INT. NICK’S CAR - MOVING - DAY 

           Nick drives through a working class area of Philly. He 
           slows, stares out at a brick townhouse, focusing on the 
           basement apartment door.

           Nick parks the car down several houses and across the 
           street.

           LATER

           Nick eyes his rear view mirror. Walking down the street 
           are his student, Edwin, and Edwin’s mother (40’s, 
           Guatemalan, hotel maid’s uniform).

           They enter the basement apartment of the brownstone.

           LATER

           Night has fallen. Nick listens to a FLYERS HOCKEY GAME on 
           the radio.

He’s 
           white, in his forties, wearing the uniform of a city bus 
           driver.

           He turns at the brownstone, down the steps and into the 
           basement apartment. This is OSCAR JENKS, the man abusing 
           Nick’s student.

           Nick waits a moment. And then he gets out of his car. He 
           crosses the street, approaches Jenks’ apartment door--

           THE DOOR OPENS. It’s Jenks.

           NICK’S frozen for a split second--then starts up the 
           street. He stops before a newspaper rack, crouches as if 
           he’s reading the headlines. Jenks passes behind him.

           Nick turns and eyes Jenks as Jenks turns the corner.

           Nick follows. He reaches the corner, spots Jenks crossing 
           the street and entering a neighborhood grocery store.

           INT. GROCERY - NIGHT

           Jenks selects a box of Alka Seltzer, half gallon of milk, 
           and a quart of cheap, Neapolitan ice cream.

           He moves to a checkout line. And suddenly Nick is behind 
           him, holding a box of cereal he’s grabbed off a display.

           Jenks’ items are rung up. Nick hovers behind him, eyeing 
           the man. Jenks is solid, bulky, big hands and neck. A 
           brute.

           Jenks pays his tab, exits. Nick puts down the cereal and 
           follows.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT 

           Jenks walks home. Nick follows.

           Nick picks up his pace, getting closer, adrenaline 
           starting to course. Feeling a warped power, an immunity 
           of sorts. He’s killed a man today and now he’s going to 
           confront this asshole.

           He closes in on Jenks--Jenks oblivious to Nick’s 
           presence.

           Closer.

His nerve failing him.

           Jenks continues, turns down the basement steps and 
           disappears into his apartment.

           Nick eyes the door.

           Then he crosses the street, enters his car. He takes a 
           moment, staring at Jenks’ apartment. Then starts his car 
           and drives off.

           DOWN THE STREET

           Sideburns sits in an SUV, watching Nick. He starts his 
           engine and follows. He eyes Jenks’ apartment as he 
           passes. Then focuses his attention on Nick’s car.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. BAR - NIGHT 

           A working class bar. The mood is subdued, the bar half-
           filled with people escaping the world for a spell.

           Nick and Jimmy sit at the bar, nursing drinks.

                                 JIMMY
                        Cheer up. Shit happens. I’ve got stories 
                        from when I was on the force...but I 
                        think you’ve heard ‘em all.

                                 NICK
                        You’ve seen some crazy stuff.

                                 JIMMY
                        Hell, I’ve seen some things nobody should 
                        see, Nicky.

                                 NICK
                        And how did you handle it?

                                 JIMMY
                        One foot in front of the other, brother. 
                        You hit a kid. There’s worse things.

           Nick glances about the room. Nobody is near enough to 
           hear their conversation.

                                 NICK
                        It’s more than hitting that kid...

           Jimmy gestures, “Tell me.”

           Beat.

           And then Nick decides not to involve his best friend, not 
           to confess what he’s done.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        It’s the fucking Flyers. Can’t score a 
                        goal. How hard is it to put a puck in the 
                        back of the net?

           The men CHUCKLE. Nick downs his drink.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Bano.

           Nick heads to the restroom. He passes a TV mounted at the 
           far end of the bar. It’s the local news. A REPORTER 
           (female, 20’s) stands in front of subway tracks.

           Nick hesitates in front of the TV.

                                 REPORTER
                        ...who was Alan Marsh? He was a husband, 
                        a father, and a journalist. He was a long 
                        time employee of the Philadelphia 
                        Inquirer. Marsh had been fired from his 
                        job five weeks ago.

           A PHOTO of Marsh/Walczak appears on the screen. Marsh and 
           Walczak are the same man.

                                 REPORTER (O.S) (CONT’D)
                        Earlier today, during the height of the 
                        morning commute, Marsh jumped to his 
                        death.

           Nick is numb, paralyzed.

           And then he gets angry. He returns to the bar, throws 
           down a twenty.

                                 NICK
                        I got this. I need to go. Thanks for 
                        coming by.

                                 JIMMY

                        Just miss my wife, you know?

                                 JIMMY
                        I hear you.

           The men clasp hands. Then Nick heads out of the bar, 
           Jimmy watching him.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL - ONCOLOGY LOBBY - NIGHT 

           The lobby doors slide open. Nick enters, in a semi-rage. 
           A FEW PEOPLE, none Nick recognize, are scattered about 
           the seats inside.

           THE GUARD (40’s, white) eyes him.

                                 GUARD
                        Help you, sir?

                                 NICK
                        You tell me.

                                 GUARD
                        I’m sorry?

           Nick points to the vending machines.

                                 NICK
                        Food.

           Nick moves to the machines. He feeds in a five dollar 
           bill. He selects an Eternity Bar. And then a second. 
           Three dollar coins clang loudly to the change retainer.

           Nick sits. He rips the wrapper and takes a bite of one of 
           the bars. He chew mechanically.

           Nothing happens. Nobody arrives. He’s set nothing in 
           motion as far as he can tell. It’s ridiculous. He’ll 
           never be able to get in touch with the Organization 
           again.

           Nick throws the bars into the trash. He approaches the 
           guard. Stares down at him.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I got the Eternity Bar. Two of them.

           The guard says nothing, just eyes Nick carefully.

                        That doesn’t mean anything to you? Two 
                        Eternity Bars? Come on. You know.

                                 GUARD
                        Sir, I have no idea what the hell you’re 
                        talking about.

           Nick SLAPS the man’s desk, frustrated. He turns and exits 
           into the night.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 

           Nick cruises the streets of Philadelphia. A light snow 
           falls. Nick doesn’t know where he’s going, what exactly 
           he’s looking for. He’s just driving. He’s angry. He’s 
           guilty. He’s a rage of emotions.

           He looks out, passing the DENIZENS of late night 
           Philadelphia. There’s an anguish in their faces. 
           Struggle. Pain. Hints of madness.

           Nick pulls up to a crosswalk, the light red. There are no 
           people, no cars. A breeze kicks up a dusting of snow. The 
           snow swirls. It dances as if it’s alive. It’s beautiful. 
           And it’s gone in an instant.

           Nick glances in his rear view mirror just in time to see 
           the headlights go out on an SUV several blocks back. The 
           SUV pulls to the side of the road. Nick can’t see who’s 
           driving.

           Nick steps on the gas and U-turns. He speeds back toward 
           the SUV. The SUV pulls out from the spot, races down the 
           street.

           The cars pass. The SUVs windows are tinted and all Nick 
           can see is the profile of a man. He can’t tell who it is.

           Nick makes another U-turn, speeds after the SUV. Now 
           several blocks ahead, the SUV turns down a street.

           Nick floors it, takes the corner...

           There’s no SUV. Nobody. It’s seemingly disappeared.

           Nick continues to the next cross street. He looks up and 
           down. No sign of the SUV. Ahead, no SUV. He’s lost him.

                                                               CUT TO:

LOFT - DAY 

           Nick unlocks the door, enters, carrying the paper and two 
           coffees. He looks like hell, having been out all night. 
           And his “raccoon eyes” from his broken nose have bloomed.

           Sitting in the living area are Laura and TWO MEN (30’s, 
           one white, one black, wearing suits). The men have the 
           cocky swagger of Philly detectives. They rise.

                                 NICK
                        What’s going on?

                                 DETECTIVE RUDESKI
                        I’m Detective Rudeski, Mr. Gerard, and 
                        this is Detective Green. Philadelphia 
                        police.

           The men flash badges.

           Nick can’t hide his nerves, he glances at Laura, who’s 
           seeing him with his raccoon eyes for the first time, and 
           who has no idea where he’s been all night.

                                 DETECTIVE RUDESKI (CONT’D)
                        Do you know why we’re here, sir?

                                (pause)
                        Is it about yesterday?

                                 DETECTIVE RUDESKI
                        What happened yesterday?

                                 NICK
                        I saw a man jump in the subway. I was 
                        going to report it today but I haven’t 
                        been thinking straight. I’ve been out all 
                        night. It’s been eating me up.

           The detectives take hard looks at Nick.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I should have stayed at the scene. Right?

                                 RUDESKI
                        We’re going to need you to come with us,

                                 NICK
                        Absolutely. I’ll take a quick shower.

                                 RUDESKI
                        We need you to come now, sir.

           Nick glances at Laura.

           INT. PRECINCT STATION HOUSE - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Nick, trying to keep his nerves under control, sits

                                (pause)
                        I’ve never met him. And I want a lawyer.

                                 RUDESKI
                        Mr. Gerard. Here’s the thing. You tell us 
                        the truth, we help each other. If you 
                        don’t...

           Rudeski shrugs.

                                 NICK
                        I want a lawyer.

           There’s a TAP TAP at the one way window. Rudeski and 
           Green share a glance.

                                 GREEN
                        Don’t go anywhere.

           The two detectives exit the room.

OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

           Rudeski, Green, and their superior, LIEUTENANT DURGAN 
           (50’s, black, slim, physically unimposing, at the tail 
           end of a long career) stare in at Nick.

                                 RUDESKI
                        Nick Gerard, no priors, teaches high 
                        school chemistry. Married, no kids. Only 
                        perhaps semi-interesting thing is his 
                        wife was raped September last year.

                                 DURGAN
                        Victim?

                                 RUDESKI
                        Alan Marsh. Journalist for the Philly 
                        Inquirer. Separated. Two daughters, six 
                        and eight. He was fired eleven weeks ago.

                                 DURGAN
                        Why was he fired?

                                 RUDESKI
                        We didn’t get there yet.

                        This is our guy.

                                 DURGAN
                        Is that an opinion or a fact, detective?

                                 GREEN
                        It’s on the tape.

                                 DURGAN
                        I saw the tape. It’s inconclusive. What 
                        about a motive?

                                 RUDESKI
                        We’re getting there.

                                 DURGAN
                        Connection between him and the victim?

           Rudeski and Green are silent, not having any connection, 
           either.

                                 DURGAN (CONT’D)
                        You guys are off. I’m working it.

                        What the fuck, Rudeski? I’m working it. 
                        Because your time could be better spent 
                        working a real case, like the sixteen up 
                        on the board that you have jackshit on.

           Rudeski and Green smirk.

                                 DURGAN (CONT’D)
                        Go solve a fucking case, detectives. 
                        Thank you.

           Rudeski and Green exit. Durgan stares in at Nick.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 

           Nick.

           He glances up at the one way mirror. A KNOCK at the door 
           and Durgan enters.

                                 DURGAN
                        Mr. Gerard, I’m Lieutenant Durgan.

           Durgan sits across from Nick.

                                 DURGAN (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to ask you a few simple 
                        questions. It’s just procedure, nothing 
                        to be worried about.

                                 NICK
                        I want a lawyer.

           Durgan ignores Nick’s request. He opens his folder. He 
           reads off a standardized test, jots down Nick’s answers 
           in the appropriate spaces.

                                 DURGAN
                        “The day after Monday is...”

Through a small 
           bulletproof window they see Laura waiting in the lobby.

                        Your wife will drive you home?

                                 NICK
                        He wasn’t who they told me he was.

           Durgan takes a quick glance about the room. POLICE 
           DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL go about their business.

                                 DURGAN
                        That’s enough.

           Durgan opens the door, smiles at Laura.

                        Mrs. Gerard, you can have your husband 
                        back now. Is that what you wanted or do 
                        you want us to keep him with us for a few 
                        days?

           Nick and Laura lock eyes.

                                 DURGAN (CONT’D)
                        Mr. and Mrs. Gerard, have a great day. 
                        And thank you, sir, once again, for your 
                        help.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. LAURA’S CAR - MOVING - DAY 

           Nick drives, Laura in the passenger seat. They drive in 
           silence. Finally:

                                 NICK
                        I should have told you.

           Laura says nothing.

           They stop at a red light. A HOMELESS MAN (50’s, black, 
           beard, wild hair and eyes) approaches. He carries a 
           bucket of water and a squeegee. Nick taps the window and 
           shakes his head no.

           The homeless man throws the bucket of dirty water over 
           the windshield.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        No!
                                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)

           Nick grabs Laura’s purse, pulls out the handgun she 
           carries since she was raped.

                                 LAURA
                        Nick!

           Nick is out of the car, the gun by his side.

                                 NICK
                        I said no.

           The man MUMBLES GIBBERISH, takes a rag and rubs a trouble 
           spot.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Get away from my car.

           The homeless man eyes Nick’s gun.

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        Harkedy. Lieutenant General Harkedy, yes, 
                        sir.

           The man salutes. Nick realizes he’s mentally ill. Nick 
           gets back in his car and peels off.

                                 LAURA
                        Jesus, Nick!

                                 NICK
                        We should move from this city forever, 
                        Laura. It’s a disaster.

                                 LAURA
                        What the fuck?!

                                 NICK
                        And moving downtown was ridiculous. I 
                        don’t know why I let you talk me into it. 
                        Look at this place.

           Nick gestures outside to the barren, inner city 
           landscape.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        A fucking joke.

           Laura stares at her husband, the man she no longer 
           recognizes.

                        What’s wrong with you?

                                 NICK
                        A joke.

           They drive in silence.

           They approach their loft, pull into the complex’s

           UNDERGROUND GARAGE

           Nick parks beside Laura’s car, turns off the car. Quiet.

                                 NICK 
                        I’m sorry. I’m sorry about back there, 
                        okay?

                                 LAURA
                        No, not okay. It’s just not fucking okay.

           Laura exits and slams the door closed. Nick sits, staring 
           straight ahead at a concrete wall.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. LOFT - DAY 

           Laura practices her violin, struggling to lose herself in 
           the music.

           Across the room, Nick works his laptop. He Googles: 
           “secret vigilante organization.” He scans the results. 
           There’s nothing that might lead him to any information 
           about the Organization.

           Nick Googles: “the hungry rabbit jumps.” He clicks on the 
           first result. It leads him to a homepage with a 
           disturbing Robert Crumb-like drawing of a smiling rabbit 
           with wolf-like teeth. There are two lines of text:  “The 
           hungry rabbit jumps is just a myth perpetuated by very 
           sick people.” The second line says, “You decide.”

           Nick moves his mouse, tries to click into the website 
           from the home page. There doesn’t seem to be anyway to 
           enter the site.

           And now he looks closer. There’s a kind of pulse beneath 
           the drawing of the rabbit. But now it’s gone...
                                          (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)           ...there it is again. A brief pulse-like image beneath 
           the rabbit drawing. It’s gone...

           There. Again. Slower this time. A slow enough pulse to 
           shows the image of a man dressed in 18th century garb. 
           He’s white, middle-aged, with wavy hair and a pudgy face.

           LAURA stops playing. She approaches. Nick tries to exit 
           the web page but the computer freezes. Laura passes on 
           her way to the fridge. She glances at Nick’s screen. 
           Doesn’t say a word.

           On the screen, the image suddenly comes alive. The 
           outline of the man fades away while the rabbit’s head 
           “comes alive.” The rabbit’s smile disappears and is 
           replaced by a frown. A tear flows from the rabbit’s eyes 
           to the bottom of the screen.

           When the teardrop hits the bottom of the screen the 
           screen flares blinding white and the browser closes. An 
           error message appears: “ERROR 3248674. WOULD YOU LIKE TO 
           REPORT THIS ERROR?”

           EXT. LOFT - NIGHT 

           Middle of the night, and there’s not a soul on the street 
           in the frigid air. Steam vents breathe.

           Through the loft window, we see Nick move down the stairs 
           from the bedroom.

           INT. LOFT - NIGHT

           Nick works his laptop. He’s gotten back to the error 
           message: “ERROR 3248674. WOULD YOU LIKE TO REPORT THIS 
           ERROR?”

           Nick types, “Yes.”

           “Please enter your complete name.”

           Nick types: “Peter Smith.”

           “DENIED.”

           Nick types: “Henry Totti.”

           “DENIED.”

           “DENIED.”

           The screen goes dark and then another question appears: 
           “What is the square root of 324?”

           Nick types: “Sixteen.”

           Then: “YOU WILL BE CONNECTED IN 5...4...3...2...1--”

           The browser is sent to a web page. There’s a live Webcam. 
           It shows a gorilla troop lounging in dense jungle.

           Nick studies the screen. Dark figures in a dark world. 
           Nick can’t figure out any rhyme or reason as to what this 
           is all about. If it’s about anything at all.

                        You can always tell me anything, Nick, 
                        you know that. And I promise not to 
                        judge.

                        I know.

                        Whatever it is, we need to keep

                        You’re right. I will.

           Laura nods, gives him a look that pleads, “Tell me if 
           there’s something else you want to talk about.”

           Nick forces a smile, pecks her goodbye.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I’ll see you later.

           Nick heads down the stairs. Laura stares after him, 
           sensing, knowing deep down, that he’s still not right.

                                 LAURA
                        Good luck.

           ASSISTANT DIRECTOR.

                        Yes.

           The asst. director gestures down a hall.

                        Up on your right, sir. Yarmulkes by the

           Nick enters, adjusting his yarmulke on his head. There 
           are twenty-five people scattered about the pews.

           Nick sits in an empty row. He focuses on the front of the 
           room where a closed casket sits.

           LATER

           The room has filled. A hush overcomes the room as the 
           immediate family enters from a side door: Marsh’s wife, 
           Marsh’s two daughters, MARSH’S MOTHER (70’s) and several 
           other EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS.

           Nick tenses. Marsh’s wife and daughters are the woman and 
           girls he followed at the zoo.

           The family is followed by A RABBI, who steps up to the 
           podium.

                        A moment of silent prayer.

           The Rabbi lowers his head as do the gathered. There’s a 
           moment of silent prayer and then the rabbi addresses the 
           room:

                                 RABBI (CONT’D)
                        I know the one question we’ve all been 
                        asking ourselves since we heard this 
                        terrible, terrible news...is why? Why, 
                        God? Why?

           NICK sits very still. Feeling sick to his stomach, guilt 
           suffocating him.

It’s Laura. He sends it to voicemail.

           LATER

           The rabbi introduces the next speaker.

                        Our next speaker will be Alan’s best 
                        friend, Daniel Schulman. Daniel.

           DANIEL SCHULMAN, late 30’s, jet-lagged, wrinkled European 
           suit, rises, makes his way to the podium. He’s a compact, 
           in-shape man, used to working as a journalist in the most 
           difficult places in the world.

           Daniel looks out over the crowd. Then glances back at the 
           coffin.

                                 DANIEL
                        I miss you, Alan.

           Daniel takes a breath, composes.

                        I miss him but I know that he lives on 
                        within all of us.

           There are nods throughout the gathered.

           NICK feels eyes upon him. He glances behind him. In the 
           last row, he spots Scar, the man from the laundromat. 
           Scar meets Nick’s gaze with cold eyes.

           Nick, a wrenching feeling in his gut, turns back to face 
           the front of the room.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Jane, girls, I want you to know that when 
                        I last talked to your father, all he 
                        talked about was his family, you guys. 
                        How much he loved you all.

           Daniel nods to Alan’s wife and daughters.

           Then Daniel looks out over the crowd. His gaze lands on 
           Nick--stays there. Nick’s skin crawls. Then Daniel averts 
           his eyes, continues his eulogy.

           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        He was like a brother to me. And even 
                        though I work in Moscow now, and we 
                        rarely saw each other, we were still as 
                        close as ever. I remember when we began 
                        our journalism careers here at The 
                        Inquirer...

           LATER

           The memorial comes to a close.

                                 RABBI
                        We will now follow one another to Har 
                        Nebo cemetery where we will lay Alan to 
                        rest. After, the family asks that you 
                        join them at the Marsh home.

           The mourners rise. The pall bearers (including Daniel) 
           carry the casket down the center aisle and out of the 
           room.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 

           The mourners disperse to their cars. Nick emerges, scans 
           the area for Scar. He spots the back of a man--could be 
           Scar, but Nick can’t be sure--getting into a Town Car. 

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. MARSH HOME - DAY 

           Nick walks up to the house. Down the porch, FOUR 
           JOURNALISTS (friends of Marsh’s) smoke and chat. Included 
           among them is Daniel, who watches Nick enter the house.

           INT. MARSH HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Guests mingle, eat from a spread of catered food. The 
           room is crowded and stuffy.

           Nick steps into the house. He scans the living room, sees 
           no sign of Scar.

           He crosses the room, takes a flute of orange juice. He 
           drinks, loosens his tie. He glances at a wall of FAMILY 
           PICTURES. Stages of life. Happier times.

           voicemail. He feels eyes upon him. It’s Daniel, who’s 
           come in from outside. He makes his way to Nick.

                                 DANIEL
                        Daniel.

                                 NICK
                        Nick. I thought you did a great job.

           The men shake.

                                 DANIEL
                        Thank you. Nick...?

                                 NICK
                        Gerard.

                                 DANIEL
                        How’d you know Al?

                                 NICK
                        He spoke to my class a few years ago.

                                 DANIEL
                        You teach journalism?

                                 NICK
                        Chemistry, actually. At-risk kids. I 
                        bring in different professionals to show 
                        them...possibilities, options.

                                 DANIEL
                        Good for you. Do you smoke, Nick?

                                 NICK
                        No.

                                 DANIEL
                        Will you join me, anyway?

           Nick follows Daniel down a hall, into the kitchen, and 
           out onto a back porch.

           EXT. BACK PORCH - DAY

           Daniel lights a cigarette.

                                 DANIEL
                        Four years in Moscow as an investigative 
                        journalist will make you a smoker. That 
                        or an alcoholic.
                                                            (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)           Daniel CHUCKLES, a man with a dark sense of humor.

           The men look out over the fallow back yard. Their breaths 
           show the cold air. Daniel drags on his cigarette.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        How’d you find out that Alan died?

                                 NICK
                        I happened to see it on the news last 
                        night.

           An uncomfortable silence falls.

           There’s the SOUND (O.S.) of a door opening. Both men 
           glance back to see Jane (Marsh’s wife) emerge from 
           inside.

                                 JANE
                        There you are.

                                 DANIEL
                        Janie. Ready for your smoke?

                                 JANE
                        Just a hug for now.

           She and Daniel hug.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Brutal in there.

                                 DANIEL
                        Don’t go back in.

           Nick stands awkwardly beside them.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        This is Nick, Jane. Al spoke to his 
                        class.

                                 NICK
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 JANE
                        Thank you for being here.

                                 NICK
                        It’s the least...

           Another awkward silence.
                                                               (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                      (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 JANE
                                (to Daniel)
                        Save me that cigarette.

                        Promise.

           Jane moves back inside.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Jane’s great. I was surprised she put up 
                        with him all those years.

                                 NICK
                        What do you mean?

                                 DANIEL
                        Al was a pain in the ass. It’s what made 
                        him a good reporter. He was like me. 
                        Obsessive.

           Daniel stubs out his cigarette.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        What I said today was bullshit. The last 
                        time I talked to him we got in an 
                        argument. I told him it didn’t surprise 
                        me that he had been fired.

                                 NICK
                        No?

                                 DANIEL
                        Al had stopped being a journalist. 
                        Crossed the line into a conspiracy 
                        theorist. Guess what his latest was?

           Nick shrugs, though he has a strong, wrenching instinct 
           of what Daniel is about to say.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        A secret vigilante group. Worldwide 
                        reach. “Enforcing” justice.

           Daniel closely watches Nick’s reaction. Nick tries to 
           show nothing.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Crazy, huh?

           He lights a cigarette, moves to the far side of the 
           porch, and looks out over the yard.

                                 DANIEL 
                        It’s true, the Moscow subway system is a 
                        marvel.

           Daniel pulls out his PDA, glances down.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Work. Excuse me for a moment.

           Daniel re-enters the house. Scar moves to Nick.

                                 SCAR
                        What were you and Daniel talking about?

                                 NICK
                        None of your fucking business.

                                 SCAR
                        You need to leave this alone. You 
                        witnessed a suicide and that’s the end of 
                        it.

                                 NICK
                        That’s it, huh? Just like that. Done.

           Nick moves to the kitchen door.

                                 SCAR
                        The second camera in the subway, the one 
                        across the tracks, it was also working, 
                        shows clearly what you did. If you keep 
                        prying, it’ll be sent to the police.

           Nick stares daggers at Scar. Then re-enters the house.

           INT. MARSH HOME - DAY 

           Nick, rattled, moves through the house. He glances at 
           Daniel--their eyes meet for a moment.

           Nick continues through the living room and out the front 
           door.

NICK’S CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Nick, trying to stay calm, pulls away from the curb. He 
           glances back up to the Marsh home. Nobody’s watching him 
           as far as he can tell.

           He checks his voicemail. Three messages, all from Laura. 
           The first message plays:

                                 LAURA (PHONE)
                        Hey, it’s me, I just wanted to know how 
                        the meeting went. Call me.

           Nick deletes the message. The second message plays:

                                 LAURA (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        It’s me again. I’ll see you in few 
                        minutes at Abrams.

           Nick glances at the dashboard clock, realizing he’s 
           forgotten all about their weekly counseling meeting.

                                 NICK
                        Damn it.

           Nick deletes the message. The third message plays:

                                 LAURA (PHONE)
                                (angry, dismayed)
                        I called Annabel. She told me. You didn’t 
                        have a fucking meeting today.

           Laura HANGS UP (ON PHONE).

                                 NICK
                        Shit.

           Nick snaps closed his cell. Then speed-dials Laura.

           Laura rifles through several pairs of Nick’s pants, 
           checking pockets. Her cell BUZZES. It’s Nick. She doesn’t 
           answer.

           She checks the pockets of several of Nick’s jackets.

           She eyes the safe on the closet floor. She unlocks the 
           safe, rifles through paperwork, jewelry, passports.

She opens Nick’s shoulder bag and 
           rummages through papers and folders.

           AND FINDS the Walczak/Marsh instruction.

                        Come on and drive already.

           He glances in his rear view mirror. He studies the FACES 
           of drivers. Any one of them could be following him. 
           Nick’s paranoia is in full bloom.

           INT. LOFT - NIGHT

           Nick enters, eyes the apartment.

           He moves to the kitchen counter. There’s a Post-it note 
           from Laura on the kitchen counter: “I READ THE PAGES.”

           The Post-it is stuck atop the Walczak/Marsh instructions.

                        Shit.

           Nick speed-dials his wife. He cringes as he gets her 
           VOICEMAIL, leaves a message.

           Nick hangs up.

He 
           passes the windows, hesitates. He stares far down the 
           block, where a Town Car is parked. It looks like the same 
           one from the memorial.

           Nick moves to the kitchen, rummages through a drawer and 
           finds a pair of binoculars.

           BINOCULAR POV: the Town Car. The side mirror. And in the 
           side mirror is the reflection of Scar.

           Nick backs away from the window.

           He makes a decision. He’s had it. Fuck this. He hurries 
           out of his loft.

           INT. LOFTS - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Nick hurries down the stairs and into the

           LOBBY

           Nick moves to the entrance door. In the b.g., the 
           elevator heads up.

           Nick bursts out the lobby entrance to the street.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Nick walks purposefully toward the Town Car. It appears 
           Scar is no longer in the car.

           Nick hesitates, looks around cautiously. Then continues 
           to the car. Scar lies across the front seats. Nick flings 
           open the door.

                                 NICK
                        Hey!

           Scar doesn’t move. His eyes are vacant. Now Nick notices 
           that blood is pooling on the passenger seat beneath the 
           man’s head. He’s dead.

           Nick shuts the car door, backs away from the car, shaken. 
           He looks up and down the street. Then feels eyes upon 
           him. He scans the area...

           ...looks up to his loft. Daniel stands at the windows, 
           staring down at him.
                                    (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                    (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                             (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)           Daniel moves away from the window, disappears within the 
           loft.

           Nick walks down the street, away from his loft. He stops 
           at the corner, glances back.

           DANIEL emerges from the lofts, heads toward Nick.

           NICK turns the corner and runs through rush hour 
           pedestrians. 

           DANIEL stops at the Town Car, glances in at Scar’s body.

           Then he continues after Nick. He turns the corner. Two 
           blocks ahead, Nick runs across a major thoroughfare and 
           into a downtown park.

           NICK runs through the park. He reaches the other side. He 
           sprints across the road, dodging traffic backed up at a 
           light. There’s a row of stores. Nick ducks into a 
           florist.

           INSIDE

           Nick stares back out to the park, breathing heavily. He 
           spots Daniel in the park. He’s lost Nick. Daniel does a 
           slow 360, eyeing every person, areas of the park where 
           Nick might be hiding, and then the stores across the 
           street.

           He spots Nick--their eyes meet for a split second--Nick 
           backs away and hurries to the rear of the store.

                                 FLOWER SHOP CLERK (O.S.) 
                        Can I help you, sir?

           Nick doesn’t answer. He pushes through a rear exit door 
           and into a

           BACK ALLEY

           There’s one way out. And it’s gated, locked closed. Nick 
           glances up. There’s a fire escape ladder but it’s too 
           high to reach.

           Nick moves to the rear of the next business. He tugs the 
           door. Locked.

           He moves to the next business. Yanks on the door. It 
           opens and he enters.
                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                      (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)           INT. PRINT SHOP - NIGHT

           Nick finds himself in the rear of the small print 
           operation. He moves through the store past the SHOP OWNER 
           and a second EMPLOYEE.

                                 SHOP OWNER (O.S.)
                        Excuse me!

           The front door JINGLES as Daniel enters--Nick wheels and 
           runs through the back exit--Daniel sprints after him.

           IN THE ALLEY

           Nick sprints to the gate, jumps and climbs. He drops to 
           the other side just as Daniel arrives.

                                 DANIEL
                        Don’t.

           Daniel holds a gun on Nick through the gate. Nick 
           freezes, debates running. There’s a tense two second 
           stand off.

                                 PRINT SHOP OWNER (O.S.)
                        What the fuck?!

           Daniel glances back behind him--when he turns back, 
           Nick’s gone.

           NICK sprints down the street, dodging pedestrians.

           DANIEL runs back through the flower store, bursts out the 
           front door. 

           NICK slams into a WOMAN, the two tumble to the ground. 
           Nick scrambles to his feet, glances back as

           DANIEL sprints toward him. Nick turns and runs.

           THE TWO MEN scramble through the sidewalk crowds.

           DANIEL gains...tackles Nick--the two men fall hard to the 
           pavement. They roll, struggle for position. Daniel gets 
           the better of Nick, shoves a knee in his chest.

                                 DANIEL
                        I’ll kill you right now.

He yanks Nick 
           to his feet. He keeps a hold of Nick’s upper arm as they 
           walk up the street.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Do anything, you’re dead.

           Daniel leads them down a side alley. He pulls his gun, 
           shoves Nick against a wall, puts the gun to Nick’s head.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Who killed Alan?

                                 NICK
                        I don’t know.

                                 DANIEL
                        You’re lying.

                                 NICK
                        I swear I don’t know.

                                 DANIEL
                                (re: Scar)
                        The guy back there in the Town Car, why’d 
                        you kill him?

                                 NICK
                        I didn’t.

           Daniel shoves the gun against Nick’s cheek.

                                 DANIEL
                        You’re a goddamn liar.

                                 NICK
                        You did. I saw the body. You killed him.

           Daniel shakes his head no. No, he didn’t.

           The men eye each other, both confused, neither knowing 
           whether to believe the other.

                                 DANIEL 
                        Walk.

           Daniel shoves Nick down the alley.

           They emerge out the opposite end and another street. They 
           move down the street and up to a parked rental car.

                        Get in. Drive.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. RENTAL CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Nick drives. Daniel’s in the passenger seat, gun pointed 
           at Nick’s gut.

                                 NICK
                        Where are we going?

           Daniel doesn’t answer.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Laura?

                                 DANIEL
                        Who’s Laura?

           Nick doesn’t answer.

           Up ahead, on the other side of the street, Nick spots a 
           police car.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Don’t.

           They pass the cop car. Nick looks to the COP. He glances 
           at Nick and their eyes meet for the slightest moment.

           Nick eyes his rear view mirror, praying for brake lights, 
           for the cop car to U-turn. It doesn’t. It disappears in 
           traffic.

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. BEN FRANKLIN BRIDGE - NIGHT 

           Cars stream across the bridge from Philadelphia to New 
           Jersey. Among the cars is Daniel’s rental car.

           INT. RENTAL CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Nick and Daniel. Nick’s cell BUZZES in his pocket.

                                 DANIEL
                        Give it here.

Daniel checks the ID.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Who’s Laura?

                                 NICK
                        Nobody.

           Daniel puts the gun to Nick’s temple.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        She’s my wife. She has nothing to do--

           Nick stops himself.

                                 DANIEL
                        Nothing to do with what?

           Nick doesn’t answer. Daniel tosses the cell to the floor.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Your wallet.

           Nick pulls out his wallet. Daniel takes out Nick’s 
           teacher ID, studies it. He studies other ID’s, a PHOTO of 
           Laura.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Who’s this?

                                 NICK
                        My wife.

           Daniel glances ahead. They’re reaching the other side of 
           the bridge, entering Camden.

                                 DANIEL 
                        Left down there.

           Nick turns onto an access road. Heavy industry with a 
           post-apocalyptic feel lines both sides of the road.

           They pass warehouses, a refinery, a demolition yard, 
           empty, weed-infested loading docks.

           They approach a large warehouse: faded lettering 
           indicates, “ZOMOPOLOUS IMPORT/EXPORT.”

           A small sign just beyond the warehouse says, “SUNSHINE 
           MARINA.” An arrow points down a narrow road.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Turn there.

                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)           Nick turns. The gravel road leads down behind the 
           warehouse to a decrepit marina beside a channel.

           Daniel surveys the area. A few boats are up on stilts. 
           There’s a single dock, the boats covered for the winter. 
           The men exit the car.

           Nick’s convinced he’s about to be murdered in this 
           desolate spot.

                                 NICK
                        I didn’t have anything to do with it. I 
                        swear. Please.

           Daniel gestures toward the dock. There’s a security gate.

                                 DANIEL 
                        Fifty-two, eighty-one.

           Nick punches in the numbers and the gate clicks open. The 
           men move down the dock. They come to a 34 foot sailboat, 
           The April Rose.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Take off the cover.

           Nick pulls back the cover. There’s a lock on the hatch to 
           the cabin. Daniel tosses Nick a key. Nick unlocks the 
           hatch.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        In.

           INT. APRIL ROSE - CABIN - NIGHT

           Daniel switches on a light. The cabin contains eight 
           months of Marsh’s investigation of the Organization. The 
           walls are covered with photos, names, charts, printed 
           information from the internet. 

           A laptop sits on a fold-out chair. The screen saver 
           scrolls: “PARANOIA IS JUSTIFIED...TRUST NO ONE.”

           Daniel taps the laptop. The screen comes to life. There’s 
           a frozen image of Alan Marsh, staring out from a Webcam 
           recording.

           Daniel moves to the galley, where a small CCTV sits on a 
           kitchen counter. He clicks on the CCTV. There’s a black & 
           white view from the warehouse roof to the adjacent 
           road/entrance.

                                 DANIEL
                        Now tell me everything you know.

           Nick moves about the cabin, eyeing:

           (1) A xeroxed sketch of an old man. It’s the man who 
           pulses beneath the hungry rabbit web site. “Edmund 
           Burke.” Alan has scribbled, “Founder?” on the xerox.

           (2) A large pile of books. Among them: Dostoevsky’s 
           “Crime and Punishment,” Camus’, “The Stranger,”, and an 
           academic text, “Historical Homicidal Rate: A Statistical 
           Analysis.”

           There are also several books by Edmund Burke: “A 
           Vindication Of Natural Society: A View Of The Miseries 
           And Evil Arising To Mankind” and, “A Philosophical 
           Enquiry Into The Origin Of Our Ideas Of The Sublime And 
           Beautiful.”

           (3) A wall of photos with the heading “TARGETS?” Several 
           of the photos have been X’d through.

           (4) A second wall with a large poster board. Photos are 
           arranged like a genealogy chart: arrows point/connect to 
           various “headshots”, surveillance photos, names and 
           question marks. At the top of the chart is a photo of 
           Simon. There’s a name beside it, “Douglas Sylvester.”

                                 NICK
                        That’s the man who contacts me. Douglas 
                        Sylvester. He told me his name was Simon.

                                 DANIEL
                        Who else do you know?

           Nick eyes other photos, people in Simon’s cell. He taps 
           them one by one: Durgan (the PPD Lieutenant who asked 
           Nick the questions in the interrogation), Sideburns, 
           Cancer, and Scar.

           There are several other faces that have never been seen 
           before.

           Arrows above Simon point to five surveillance photos. In 
           each photo Simon is meeting with a different man.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Which one is Simon’s contact?

           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                 NICK
                        I don’t know.

           Daniel takes out his PDA. He hands it to Nick. Nick 
           stares down at a photo of himself. It’s Nick in the 
           subway car, when he was sitting across from Marsh. Taken 
           from Marsh’s cell phone.

                                 DANIEL
                        Who killed Alan?

                                 NICK
                        I have no idea.

           With a quick, furious motion, Daniel WHACKS Nick across 
           the head with his gun. Nick falls to the couch, bleeding.

                                 DANIEL 
                        That picture was taken the day before he 
                        was killed.

                                 NICK
                        I didn’t do it.

           Daniel presses the barrel of the handgun against Nick’s 
           bloody forehead.

                                 DANIEL
                        Then tell me who did.

                                 NICK
                        I don’t know.

                                 DANIEL 
                        Who did it. Don’t think I won’t do this.

           Daniel smirks, a semi-crazed look on his face. He’s a man 
           on the edge.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Who killed Alan?

                                 NICK
                        My wife was raped. Last year. They came 
                        to me, said they could kill the man who 
                        did it. I owed them.

                                 DANIEL
                        And?

           Nick’s silent.

                        And?

                                 NICK
                        They told me he was a child molester.

                                 DANIEL
                        Alan was a child molester?

           Nick nods.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Bullshit.

                                 NICK
                        They threatened my family. I didn’t have 
                        any choice.

                                 DANIEL
                                (pause)
                        Sure you did.

                                 NICK
                                (pause)
                        You’re right. I did. I had a choice.

                                 DANIEL 
                        You killed him.

                                 NICK
                        I didn’t know.

           Daniel keeps the gun on Nick.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t know.

           Beat.

           And another.

           Daniel rises slowly, pockets his gun.

                                 DANIEL
                        Fuck.

           Daniel moves about the cabin. Nick slowly gets to his 
           feet.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        Fuck.

Nick presses it 
           against his bleeding head.

                                 NICK
                        I’m sorry.

           There’s a moment of relief for Nick, a purging in the 
           admission of guilt.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t know.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. TRUDY’S APARTMENT - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Laura and Trudy sit on the bed. There’s an open suitcase 
           with the clothes and personal items Laura has brought 
           from home.

                                 TRUDY
                        Stay here as long as you want.

                                 LAURA
                        Thank you.

                                 TRUDY
                        Of course. Listen, I’m sure there’s a 
                        good reason he’s not himself.

           Laura debates telling Trudy about the instructions. She 
           eyes the clock on the wall.

                                 LAURA 
                        We need to get going.

                                 TRUDY
                        You are not playing tonight. You’re 
                        staying here, ordering Chinese, watching 
                        a movie, and drinking wine.

           Laura forces a small smile.

                                 TRUDY (CONT’D)
                        This thing will work itself out.

           Trudy gives her a big hug. She exits the room.

           Laura eyes her cell. She scrolls down her contacts. Stops 
           on “JIMMY”. Hits speed-dial.

APRIL ROSE - NIGHT

           Daniel works the laptop, turns it so that Nick can see 
           the screen.

                        The genius of the Organization is it 
                        appears to not exist. It doesn’t have a 
                        name, doesn’t have a leader. It’s 
                        structured in a way so that each cell can 
                        be cut off or activated at a moment’s 
                        notice.

                        This is the perfect world for them to 
                        bloom. Our world which is governed by 
                        irrational fear.

           Daniel hits a few keys, finds another recording:

                        Politician, philosopher, writer, 
                        supporter of the American colonies. I 
                        believe the Organization might have begun 
                        with Burke. But I don’t know.

           In the b.g., on the CCTV screen: two SUVS stop on the 
           access road on the other side of the warehouse. Nick and 
           Daniel don’t see them.

           ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN, Marsh closes the book, stares 
           into the camera.

                        Working in my favor is that a basic tenet 
                        of the Organization is that they kill 
                        only the most heinous and guilty.

           Nick suddenly catches movement on the CCTV SCREEN: Simon, 
           Cancer, and Sideburns hurry from their vehicles, drawing 
           guns. They make their way down the entrance drive.

           EXT. MARINA - NIGHT

           Simon, Cancer and Sideburns approach the dock. They 
           glance in Daniel’s car, eye the area.

           They hear a SMALL SPLASH (O.S.). Simon and Cancer move 
           quickly toward the dock and the noise. Sideburns keeps 
           watch on shore.

           Simon and Cancer hurry to the April Rose, where the 
           cover’s pulled back and the hatch is open.

           Simon aims his gun down the hatch.

                                 SIMON
                        Get out.

           There’s no answer. Simon starts down, followed by Cancer.

           BELOW DECK

           The men enter the cabin. A Webcam recording plays on the 
           laptop, Marsh.

                                 MARSH (ON SCREEN)
                                (with a weak laugh)
                        My friends think I’m insane. They’re 
                        worried for me.

           Simon takes it all in while Cancer checks the galley and 
           head.

                                 CANCER (O.S.)
                        Clear.

           Simon approaches the chart of his cell, stares at his own 
           face. Then he eyes the faces above his, one of whom Marsh 
           theorized was Simon’s contact/superior within the 
           Organization.

                                 SIMON
                        We need to find them.

                        Eyeball!

           Simon and Cancer scramble back up on deck. Sideburns is 
           already racing down the marina.

                                 SIDEBURNS (CONT’D)
                        Channel!

           Simon eyes the water. Fifty yards away, Nick swims.

           A SHOT (O.S.)--Cancer’s hit.

           DANIEL crouches in a boat, gun leveled at Cancer. He 
           SHOOTS him a second time. Cancer falls into the water. 
           Dead.

           SIMON PEPPERS Daniel with TWO QUICK SHOTS to the shoulder 
           and leg. Daniel crumples to the boat. Simon approaches, 
           stares down at a writhing Daniel.

           IN THE CHANNEL

           Nick powers away from the scene. He passes a demolition 
           yard where a GERMAN SHEPHERD BARKS MANIACALLY at him.

           SIDEBURNS runs down the shore, approaching the dog. A 
           SHOT--YELP--the dog is dead.

           NICK glances to shore as Sideburns aims--Nick dives 
           below.

           UNDERWATER

           Nick powers below. There’s the RIPPING SOUND of bullets 
           in water.

           Nick reaches the bottom of the channel, kicks up mud and 
           sludge. He can’t see anything. He feels his way along the 
           bottom and up to the other side of the channel.

           IN THE WEEDS/MARSHLAND

           Nick emerges, takes a quick gasp of air--then sinks as 
           low as he can into the muck.

           He eyes the channel through the weeds. On the far shore,  
           Sideburns peers out into the dark. Simon arrives. He’s 
           leading an injured Daniel.

           can’t hear. Sideburns heads back to the marina.

           Simon shoves Daniel. He falls to the edge of the water. 
           Simon puts a gun to the back of his head.

                                 SIMON
                        Your choice, Nick!

           NICK, eyes wide with panic, does nothing.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        One.
                        Two.
                        Your choice, Nick...
                        Three.

           ON NICK. A half-second of relief. Simon hasn’t done it--

           A SHOT (O.S.). Nick flinches.

           ON THE SHORE Daniel falls forward. Dead.

           ON NICK. Shell-shocked.

           And then Nick hears an ENGINE (O.S.). An outboard skiff 
           approaches, Sideburns at the wheel. He cuts the engine 
           and drifts, eyeing the marsh, gun leveled, searching.

           Nick’s frozen. The boat drifts ten yards from him...

           ...passes him. Continues further down the channel.

           SIMON stares out in the darkness of the marsh.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Do I need to go talk to your wife, Nick?! 
                        Is that what I need to do?!

           NICK eyes Simon, a wrenching feeling in his gut.

           Beat.

           SIMON heads back toward the dock.

           NICK slowly crawls deeper into the marshland.

           LATER

           Nick trudges through the marshland. He emerges at the 
           other side. The Delaware river is before him.

The lights of 
           Philadelphia twinkle beyond.

           He debates trying to swim across. No. He’d freeze to 
           death or drown.

           He moves along the shore, walking the perimeter of the 
           marshland. He hears SIRENS off in the night, back in the 
           direction of the marina.

           He reaches a far corner of the marsh, where one outlet of 
           the channel meets the Delaware River.

           Down the channel, he spots flickering yellow in the 
           night. The April Rose and the other boats burn. Emergency 
           vehicles are arriving.

           Nick looks across the channel: there’s a city salt yard. 
           Nick enters the frigid water. He breast strokes to the 
           opposite shore, trying to swim as quietly as possible.

           He emerges from the channel, crouches beside a snowplow. 
           Shaking violently from the cold. 

           He skulks across the yard and to an office. He peers in 
           the office. Spots a phone.

           He bunches his shirt over his fist and smashes the glass 
           window on the door. He reaches in and opens the door from 
           the inside.

           INSIDE

           Nick punches in Laura’s number with shaking, frozen 
           fingers.

                                 LAURA (PHONE)
                        Hello.

           Nick’s relieved to hear her voice.

                                 NICK
                        It’s me. Are you okay?

           INT. TRUDY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

           Laura on her cell.

                        You need to get out of there.

                        You didn’t tell anybody about what you 
                        saw today, did you?

           Laura doesn’t answer.

                        I told Trudy and Jimmy I was worried 
                        about you.

                                 NICK
                        But you didn’t talk to them about those 
                        pages. Right?

                                 LAURA
                        No.

                        Good. I need you to--

           A DOOR BELL (O.S.).

           Laura flinches at the sound.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

                        The door.

                                 NICK
                        Don’t answer it.

           Laura moves to the door, looks through the eyehole. It’s 
           Jimmy.

                        It’s Jimmy.

           Nick breathes a sigh of relief.

                                 NICK
                        Let me talk to him.

           Laura opens the door. She hands the phone to Jimmy.

                                 LAURA
                        It’s Nick.

                                 JIMMY
                        Nick.

                                 NICK
                        I’m in trouble, Jimmy, and there’s people 
                        coming after Laura. I need you to get her 
                        somewhere safe.

                                 JIMMY
                        Tell me what’s going on, what people?

                                 NICK
                        I can’t. Just...please.

                                 JIMMY 
                        I have a place I can take her, no one’ll 
                        find her. We’ll go there, you call me.

                                 NICK
                        Thank you.

           Nick hangs up. He looks warily out at the night. Then he 
           grabs a worker’s winter jacket and hurries out of the 
           office.

           Jimmy drives a one lane road in southwest Philly. Laura’s 
           in the passenger seat, distraught and confused.

                        It’s going to be okay.

The road is in 
           disrepair, dotted with potholes.

           They pass an auto salvage yard, then a cement yard. And 
           then the road dips down into a ravine.

           The road ends at a line of loading docks beside train 
           tracks. The docks haven’t been used in twenty years. 
           There’s several truck trailers up on blocks.

           And there’s an idling SUV. Tinted windows.

                        Sit tight.

           Jimmy exits. He approaches the SUV. The door opens--

           SIMON steps out. He glances to the SUV, to Laura. She 
           looks at the men with increasing apprehension.

                                 SIMON 
                        Thank you.

                                 JIMMY
                                (re: Laura)
                        Nothing happens to her after you’ve got 
                        him.

           Simon doesn’t answer.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Right? Nothing happens to her.

           The men lock eyes.

                                 SIMON
                        It’s not my decision.
                                (pause)
                        It’s his.

           Simon gestures behind Jimmy. Jimmy turns and looks down 
           the endless stretch of track. There’s nobody there--

           A SHOT (silencer) to the back of Jimmy’s head. Jimmy 
           crumples, shot by Simon.

           Simon turns, eyes Jimmy’s SUV. The passenger door is open-
           -no Laura--her handbag on the seat--

           THERE SHE IS. Scrambling, running away from the SUV, into 
           brush, up the ravine.

           SIMON sprints after her.
                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)           LAURA, eyes showing pure panic, runs through the thick 
           bramble. And then she stops, crouches. We now see the gun 
           in her hand. She can HEAR Simon approaching quickly.

           Laura levels her gun. Waits. There’s movement. She waits 
           a split second longer--movment--she SHOOTS.

           SIMON--hit in the lower leg--A GRUNT--falls to the earth.

           LAURA. Can’t see him now. She approaches, gun leveled, 
           moving through the thick foliage.

           Where the hell is he?

           Where is he?

           Is that blood on a patch of snow?

           AN ARM whips out of the darkness and grabs Laura around 
           the neck.

           SIMON puts her in a choke hold. Squeezes hard. 

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Drop the gun.

           Laura struggles. Simon squeezes harder. She can’t get 
           air. She drops the guns.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Stop struggling.

           Laura becomes still. Simon lessens his hold. Laura gasps, 
           wheezing in air.

           Simon grabs her gun from the ground.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        You say a word, try anything stupid, I’ll 
                        kill you.

           BACK AT THE TRAIN TRACKS/LOADING DOCKS

           Simon’s on his cell, pacing twenty yards from his SUV. 
           There’s no sign of Laura.

                                 SIMON 
                        ...yes...yes, of course. Krickland. I 
                        remember it.

           Simon shuts his cell. There’s a moment. He’s thinking 
           hard about the situation.

           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)           He limps to his SUV, glances in the rear seat. LAURA lies 
           across the seat, arms handcuffed with plastic cuffs, Duct 
           tape over her mouth, eyes petrified. She has no idea who 
           this man is, or what’s going on.

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. MARINA - NIGHT 

           The boats and docks burn--two fire trucks spray water 
           over the conflagration. There’s a dozen emergency 
           vehicles of various ilks scattered about the marina.

           INSIDE AN ARSON INVESTIGATOR’S CAR

           The RADIO CRACKLES. The car is empty.

           The door opens, Nick slides in. Keys are in the ignition. 
           Nick starts the car, drives back toward the access road.

           He turns onto the road, heads back toward the Ben 
           Franklin bridge. He speeds up.

           He eyes the rear view mirror. Nobody following. He 
           catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror--rings under 
           his eyes, wound on his forehead, matted hair, dried 
           sludge on his face. He’s a fucking mess.

           WHAM! The car is sideswiped by an SUV, Sideburns at the 
           wheel. The car skids down a bank, stops violently as the 
           front end jams in the mud. Nick’s head whips into the 
           steering wheel. He’s dazed, but he’s got enough wits to 
           throw open the door and crawl outside.

           Nick staggers away from the car and into a asphalt field 
           of rusted car parts. He glances behind him to see 
           Sideburns scrambling down the bank.

           NICK runs. He reaches a fence, climbs it, drops to the 
           other side.

           SIDEBURNS reaches the fence. Climbs and jumps over it.

           Nick sprints behind a large warehouse. He suddenly finds 
           himself hemmed in by buildings and a barbed wire fence. 
           The only way out is back the way he just came him.

           He tries the warehouse door. Locked. He spots an open 
           window above. He jumps, grabs the ledge, and pulls 
           himself in.
                                              (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                          (cid:13)           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 

           Filled with tall rows of industrial plumbing supplies: 
           toilets, piping, etc.. Nick moves quickly down a row. 
           Then stops. Listens.

           He hears nothing.

           He moves deeper into the warehouse--

           THE SOUND of BOOTS FALLING ON THE CEMENT FLOOR (O.S.), 
           someone dropping into the warehouse.

           SIDEBURNS, gun drawn, moves down a row. He stops. 
           Listens. Hears nothing.

           He moves to the end of the row. Then wheels back--Nick 
           sprints across the aisle. Sideburns FIRES, misses, runs 
           after Nick.

           He turns in the direction Nick ran. Nick’s vanished. 
           Sideburns turns back the other way--

           A flash of reflected light as a metal pipe comes down 
           viciously on Sideburns head with a DULL THUNK. Sideburns 
           crumples instantly.

           All is suddenly very quiet. Nick stares down at his 
           victim.

           Then he moves off. He finds a door, slowly unlocks it and 
           opens it. He’s wary, thinking there are probably other 
           men in the area.

           OUTSIDE

           Nick eyes the area. He hears nothing. In the distance, he 
           can see yellow in the night sky, the burning boats.

           Then he turns back and re-enters the warehouse. He finds 
           Sideburns’ cellphone. And his car keys.

           And his gun. Nick shoves the gun into a pocket of the 
           worker’s jacket.

           ON THE ACCESS ROAD

           Nick appears out of the night, glancing up and down the 
           road, looking for more trouble.
                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                          (cid:13)

           toward the Ben Franklin bridge.

           ON THE BRIDGE

           Nick speeds back into Philly. He punches in Laura’s 
           number on Sideburns’ cell.

           RING (PHONE).

           RING (PHONE).

           RIN--

                                 LAURA (PHONE)
                        Hello.

                                 NICK
                        You’re okay?

           Nick hears nothing. Then MUMBLING, people talking, but 
           Nick can’t understand a word. Someone’s got their hand 
           over the phone.

                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                        Hello, Nick.

           Nick is paralyzed at the sound of Simon’s voice.

                                 SIMON (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        We need to meet.

                                 NICK
                        Leave her out of this.

                                 SIMON (PHONE)
                        Here’s where you’re going.

           INT. SUV - MOVING - NIGHT 

           Nick crosses the Walt Whitman Bridge, leaving 
           Philadelphia, the skyline in the b.g..

           LATER

           Nick heads east. The suburbs and strip malls thin,

           Nick drives, eyeing the mile markers. He slows as he 
           passes the marker he’s looking for. There’s an unnamed 
           road just beyond it. He turns down the road.

           He’s drives through forest, a thin layer of snow on the 
           ground.

           He turns on his brights. There’s nothing out here but 
           forest.

           He drives.

           Finally, there’s a stone marker, “KRICKLAND SANATORIUM.”

           Nick turns in the entrance. An abandoned sanatorium 
           spreads before him. Massive. Built of stone. The remains 
           of several statues are scattered about the front lawn.

           There’s an SUV parked by the fence. Simon’s.

           Nick stops the SUV, turns off the car lights. The half 
           moon reflects off the snow, giving the whole scene an 
           otherworldly feel.

           Nick exits. He’s met with the deep silence of a night 
           forest in winter.

           He eyes Simon’s SUV. Nobody there. Laura’s purse in the 
           passenger seat. He tries the door. Locked.

           He moves around the perimeter of the fence, through snow 
           and mud. He finds a hole in the fence right where Simon 
           told him it would be.

           He approaches the sanatorium. The windows are either 
           boarded up or gaping, black holes. There’s scrawls of 
           graffiti on the wall. A part of the roof has caved in.

           Nick turns the corner, moves down the side of the 
           sanatorium. And now he reaches the back of the building, 
           where English gardens once thrived, their precise outline 
           still visible.

           He eyes a stone gazebo fifty yards away. Sees movement. 
           People.

           Nick approaches. And now he can see them. Simon holds his 
           gun to Laura’s head.

           A moment.

                        Let her go. She doesn’t have anything to 
                        do with this.

                                 SIMON
                        Take off your jacket.

           Nick slowly takes off his jacket.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Toss it over there.

           Nick tosses the jacket.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Turn around.

           Nick turns around. Simon eyes his pocket and waist band.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Show me your socks.

           Nick pulls up the bottom of his pants, shows his socks. 
           No gun in there.

           Simon (still with his gun to Laura’s head) moves to the 
           jacket, feels around. He feels the gun. He pulls it out 
           and pockets it.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Over there.

           Simon gestures. Nick moves toward the dark woods. Simon 
           shoves Laura in Nick’s direction.

                                 NICK
                        I thought there was a code, Simon. You 
                        don’t kill people like us. We’re not 
                        those people.

                                 SIMON
                        Tell me who’s first.

           Laura starts to sob.

                                 NICK
                        Marsh found a tape. Did you know that? It 
                        shows you killing a man. Do this and a 
                        friend sends that tape everywhere.

           Simon eyes Nick with a small look of pity. Nick’s a man 
           doing anything to save his life.

                        There’s no tape. Just like there’s no 
                        tape of you in the subway.

                                 NICK
                                (pause)
                        You let us go, we never say a word. 
                        Never.

                                 SIMON
                        You can’t jeopardize the Organization, 
                        Nick. You saw what was in the boat. Now 
                        who’s first?

                                 LAURA
                        Fuck you.

           Simon smiles a warped smile.

                                 SIMON
                        Turn around. Both of you.

           Nick and Laura don’t turn around.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        NOW!

           The couple slowly turn around. Nick looks to Laura. She 
           stares ahead. She won’t meet his gaze.

                                 NICK
                        I’m so sorry.

           For the briefest moment, their eyes meet.

           A SHOT (O.S.). Nick flinches. Laura SCREAMS.

           A SECOND SHOT (O.S.).

           Neither Nick or Laura is hit. What the hell is going on? 
           Nick turns to see Simon falling to the ground.

           Behind Simon, A MAN (30’s, white) lowers his gun. He 
           approaches Simon, stares down. Simon’s quivering. Then 
           his eyes go vacant. He’s dead.

           The Shooter looks up to Nick. Nick’s frozen, thinking 
           he’ll be shot now.

           But the Shooter throws his gun to Nick’s feet. Then takes 
           a sheet of paper out of his pocket. He approaches, hands 
           the sheet to Nick.

                        I’m done now.

           Nick is baffled, doesn’t comprehend what’s going on.

                                 SHOOTER (CONT’D)
                        I’m done, Nick.

           There’s a manic intensity in the Shooter’s voice, the 
           voice of a man on the edge, in a situation he can’t 
           control.

                                 SHOOTER (CONT’D)
                        You gave me your word. We have our 
                        agreement. Now leave me and my family 
                        alone.

           The Shooter turns and heads back toward the front of the 
           sanatorium.

                                 NICK
                        Wait!

           The man tenses, a bundle of nerves. Nick approaches.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Nick? I’m Nick?

           The shooter nods yes.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        How do you know I’m Nick?

           The Shooter doesn’t answer.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Is this what my voice sounds like? Is 
                        this what my voice sounded like when I 
                        called you?

           The Shooter doesn’t answer.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        It’s not, is it? No.

           The Shooter is frozen.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Go. You’re done.

           Shooter turns and runs. He disappears around the side of 
           the sanatorium.

It’s faxed 
           instructions. There are directions to the sanatorium. And 
           there’s a detailed outline on how and when to kill Simon. 
           It describes everything that’s just happened.

           Nick looks up from the sheet. Laura, shell-shocked, 
           stares down at Simon. Then she looks up to Nick. Their 
           eyes meet and hold.

           Nick slowly puts his arms around her. She keeps her arms 
           at her side, doesn’t hug back. He holds her tight as she 
           shakes violently.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. SUV - MOVING - NIGHT

           Nick drives, Laura in the passenger seat. They drive in 
           silence, both people staring ahead into the night.

           A beat.

           And another.

           Finally:

                                 LAURA 
                        I would have done the same thing.

           Nick looks to his wife.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        If they had asked me that night, I would 
                        have done the same thing.

           Laura reaches out, takes Nick’s hand. She squeezes. He 
           squeezes back.

                                                       FADE THROUGH TO:

           EXT. PHILADELPHIA - SKYLINE - DAY

           Framed by a low, grey sky. Winter drags on.

           EXT. KIMMEL CENTER - NIGHT 

           The half dome is lit. Several large holiday wreaths hang 
           on the front face of the building.

           (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)           INT. KIMMEL CENTER - NIGHT

           Nick sits in the audience listening to Handel’s 
           “Messiah.” A CHOIR sings on stage. Laura plays among the 
           orchestra.

           INT. KIMMEL CENTER - LOBBY - NIGHT 

           Intermission. Nick moves from the bar with a Jack neat. 
           At the windows, he looks outside. It’s begun to snow. 
           Big, beautiful snowflakes.

           Nick steps outside. The cold, the wet snow, the liquor--
           it all feels wonderful.

           A MAN (60’s, white, suit and overcoat) exits the lobby. 
           He stands several yards from Nick.

           Nick glances at the man. It’s one of the men from the 
           photos in the April Rose, one of the men who might have 
           been Simon’s superior/contact.

           Nick is frozen.

                                 MAN
                        Your fingerprints were on the Town car 
                        outside your apartment.

           Nick tenses, a sick feeling overcoming him.

                                 NICK
                        I didn’t kill him.

                                 MAN
                        No, you didn’t. Still, we made sure the 
                        prints disappeared.

                                 NICK
                                (pause)
                        What do you want?

                                 MAN
                        Simon was out of control. He bent the 
                        rules. The rules are what protects us 
                        from ourselves.

                                 NICK
                        You were in charge of Simon?

           The man nods yes.

                        There’s a protocol. Individuals don’t 
                        decide who dies.

                                 NICK
                        Who does?

                                 MAN
                        I have no idea. As I said, there’s a 
                        protocol, a chain. I don’t know any of 
                        the people at the top, the people who 
                        judge. But I do know that we would never 
                        kill someone like Daniel. Or you. Or your 
                        wife. That’s not what the Organization 
                        does.

           The man turns to Nick.

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        We take care of men like your student’s 
                        stepfather, Oscar Jenks.

                                 NICK
                                (pause)
                        You killed him?

                                 MAN
                        He killed himself.

           The man takes a hard look at Nick.

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        We believe you’d be an asset. Would you 
                        like to help us again?

                                 NICK
                        No.

                                 MAN
                        Why not? Sure, things sometimes get 
                        complicated. It doesn’t mean it’s not 
                        worthwhile. Right?

                                 NICK
                        I’m done.

           The man looks out at the night.

                                 MAN
                        Are you, Nick?

He heads down the 
           steps to the street. He gets in a waiting cab and drives 
           off into the night.

           INT. KIMMEL CENTER - NIGHT

           Nick returns to his seat. From the orchestra, Laura 
           throws him a small smile. Nick does his best to return 
           it.(cid:13)

           The house lights go down. The second half of the 
           performance begins. The heavenly sounds of “The Messiah” 
           fill the hall.

                                                              FADE OUT.
