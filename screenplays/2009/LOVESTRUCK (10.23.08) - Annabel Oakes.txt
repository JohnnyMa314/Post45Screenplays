           WAVES OF PINK TULLE AND CHIFFON sway and billow in slow 
           motion. 

           A dreamy, girly love song from the ‘60s accompanies the 
           fabric's movement. It’s heavenly, mesmerizing. Then: 

                                 AMELIA (O.S.)
                        Well fuck-my-mother. Not again. 

           The fabric stills. The music stops. And the sexy, bass-y beat 
           of The Rolling Stones’ “Miss You” fades up.

           The camera pans up to AMELIA, late 30s, a woman who has 
           embraced “intellectual” as a personal aesthetic. She’s 
           wearing a HIDEOUS PINK BRIDESMAID DRESS and a look of utter 
           contempt. She addresses someone below her, offscreen. 

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        You know, I’ve had a lot of douchebags in 
                        my bed before, but you - you are the 
                        douche baggiest. And you have fucked with 
                        the wrong lady on the wrong day.  

           No response from the off screen party. Amelia just shakes her 
           head...and yells at the top of her lungs:

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        RUTH!

           INT. RUTH’S APARTMENT - DAY 

           The Rolling Stones song is blasting from a turntable in 
           Ruth’s cluttered apartment. It’s decorated with framed album 
           covers - David Bowie, the New York Dolls, The Kinks, etc. 

           RUTH, also late 30s, the kind of woman who could both drink 
           you under the table and kick your ass at Trivial Pursuit, 
           dances in front of a mirror while applying make-up and 
           singing along to the Rolling Stones. A cigarette hangs from 
           her lips, ash-ing all over her hideous pink bridesmaid dress. 

                                 RUTH
                           (singing with Mick Jagger)
                        We gonna come around at twelve with some 
                        Puerto Rican girls that are just 
                        dyyyyyyyin’ to meet you!

           The cigarette falls out of Ruth’s mouth. Makes an ugly burn 
           on the delicate pink fabric. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Aw twatcakes.   
                           (hears Amelia calling)
                        Coming!
           Ruth tries to squeeze around her bed, which takes up the 
           whole room. No go. Her dress is too big. She goes back, rolls 
           over the bed expertly. Pops up on the other side and leaves. 

           INT. AMELIA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Amelia’s living room is decorated with surrealist art. Every 
           surface is stacked every which way with books and papers. 

           Ruth walks through the room, a bottle of pink nail polish in 
           hand, painting over the burned spot in her dress. She enters-

           AMELIA’S BEDROOM

           Amelia is staring at a corner of her bed where the covers and 
           fitted sheet are upturned to reveal black spots in the seams.

                                 RUTH
                        Oh no. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Goddamn bed bugs. Fifteen hundred bucks 
                        to get rid of the bastards last time. 
                        They must know I work in academia and 
                        don’t have the money to keep up with 
                        their continual genocide.

                                 RUTH
                        Time to start hooking. 

           Ruth blows the nail polish dry on her skirt. It doesn’t look 
           half bad. Amelia sighs. 

                                 AMELIA
                        We’re like half an hour late. We should 
                        go. 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY

           Amelia and Ruth walk down the street, their dresses 
           accessorized with old dirty snow boots and sensible coats. 
           It’s a freezing and dreary day. A woman walks by them holding 
           a red heart balloon. 

                                 RUTH
                        Do you think it was someone bitter or 
                        someone hilarious who put this holiday in 
                        the middle of the most wretched month of 
                        the year? 

                                 AMELIA
                        If those things can’t be mutually 
                        exclusive then we’re in trouble. 
           An OLD MAN EATING A CHILI DOG walks towards the two. 
           Impatient with the thick CROWD on the sidewalk, he squeezes 
           between Amelia and Ruth, muttering obscenities. 

           GIANT GLOBS of chili splatter onto Amelia and Ruth’s dresses.

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        Aw crapsticks. 

           The chili globs slide down the chiffon. Ruth tries to rub it 
           off onto a brick wall. She's only making it worse, but she 
           doesn’t seem to care. 

                                 RUTH
                        Do you think we'll be stripped of our 
                        bouquets?

                                 AMELIA
                        Dishonorable discharge is too heavenly a 
                        dream.

                                 RUTH
                        And you’re still a firm “no” on the 
                        double suicide? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Maybe next time. 

           The women walk on, stepping over mounds of grimy snow 
           sparsely populated with trash. Soiled Valentine’s Day ads 
           stick to their filthy boots. A pair of RATS scurry across 
           some laid out Valentine’s Day teddy bears, fake handbags, and 
           pirated DVDs on the street. Ah, New York in the wintertime.

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        If I go first, I want you to see to it 
                        that I'm buried in this dress. 

                                 RUTH
                        Oh?

                                 AMELIA
                        I don't want to waste anything nice. 

           Ruth nods. Noted. DIRK, a dirty homeless man, sorts through 
           the plastic bags in his shopping cart. 

                                 AMELIA AND RUTH
                        Hey Dirk. 

                                 DIRK
                        'Evening beauties, spare some change?
                                 RUTH
                        Not today, Dirk. 

                                 DIRK
                        Fat ass bitches! Fuck you!

                                 RUTH
                        Bye Dirk! 

                                 AMELIA
                        I suppose Mindy’s gonna freak out when 
                        she sees us-

                                 RUTH
                        Mindy? Nah--

           INT. CHURCH - BRIDAL DRESSING ROOM - DAY

           MINDY, the African-American bride (mid 30s), SCREAMS. 

                                 MINDY
                        EEEEEEE! Oh my GOD! You’re here! Can you 
                        believe I'm getting married! Could you 
                        IMAGINE back in the dorm that you’d be at 
                        my wedding? MY WEDDING! EEEEEE!

           Ruth and Amelia, disheveled, stand in the doorway, covering 
           their chili-stained skirts with coats. TEN STEPFORD 
           BRIDESMAIDS, perfectly coiffed, beam vaseline-big smiles at 
           the two black sheep. 

                                 MINDY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, I’m just going to use the little 
                        brides room, then the final inspection! 
                        Eee! I’m getting married!

           INT. CHURCH - HALLWAY - DAY

           A frenetic team of wedding coordinators rush Valentine’s Day 
           themed wedding decor up and down the hall. Amelia and Ruth 
           huddle in a corner, contemplate their chili stains. Not good.

                                 AMELIA
                        Inspection? Fuck me. 

                                 RUTH
                        Shit. We’re totally going to ruin her 
                        special daaaaaaaaay. 

           Silence. They’re at a loss. In lieu of action, they slip out 
           silver flasks from their skirts. CLINK them in a quiet toast. 
                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Bridesmaid's-little-helper. What're you 
                        packing?

                                 AMELIA
                        Vodka and club soda.

           Ruth's eyes LIGHT UP. Amelia catches on. 

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        A cocktail AND a cleaning agent!

           Amelia begins to pour the contents of the flask out onto 
           their skirts. Stops herself. Takes a sip first. Proceeds. 
           They rub the fabric vigorously. The stains lighten. 

                                 RUTH
                        It's times like these that you should re-
                        evaluate your position on Fate, Amelia. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I'll think about that, Ruth. 

           A WEDDING PLANNER with some serious plastic surgery 
           experience scurries up to the two. Gaudy bouquets of red 
           roses in one hand, a walkie talkie in the other. 

                                 WEDDING PLANNER
                        The tardy girls, at last. These are for 
                        you. Remember, bouquets at navel level 
                        and elbows OUT!

                                 RUTH
                        Eww, there's something on my roses. 

           Written on the roses in gold is "Mindy & Darren. True Love." 

                                 WEDDING PLANNER
                        Isn't that special? Real 24 karat gold 
                        embossing! 

           Amelia and Ruth try to smile, but it comes off like a wince. 

           INT. CHAPEL - DAY

           Amelia and Ruth are still smile-wincing, but now they’re 
           walking down the aisle together, talking through their teeth. 

                                 RUTH
                        Why are we friends with Mindy again?

                                 AMELIA 
                        Because she's nice?
                                 RUTH
                        Doesn't sound like us. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Because she was randomly assigned to our 
                        triple dorm room after that first girl 
                        dropped out to join that cult and we find 
                        her lack of introspection refreshing?

                                 RUTH
                        Vegan co-op housing isn't a cult. 

           The two reach the altar. Take their places. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Oh God. Look. 

           Ruth and Amelia watch a legion of artificially rosy-cheeked 
           FLOWER GIRLS in elaborate CUPID COSTUMES shoot "red rose 
           arrows" down the aisle with gaudy gold bows. The 500 WEDDING 
           GUESTS applaud, delighted. Ruth and Amelia are horrified. 

                                 RUTH
                        Maureen Dowd is officially downgraded to 
                        the second creepiest thing I’ve ever seen 
                        in person. 

                                 AMELIA
                        So what's your assessment of the talent 
                        here?

                                 RUTH
                        That bridesmaid Jennifer is hot. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Oh, you're gay again?

                                 RUTH
                        Amelia, you have to respect-

                                 AMELIA
                        No, of course. I respect your choice. I 
                        just need a weekly newsletter or 
                        something...you do know "bisexual" is a 
                        thing, right? 

                                 RUTH
                        Jason didn't take it well. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Well it certainly is an innovative way to 
                        get out of a third date. 
                                 RUTH
                        Anyway, look at these guys. Grade A 
                        J. Crew assholes. 

           Amelia surveys the Groomsmen and guests. Ruth's right. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I didn't shave above the knee anyway. 

                                 RUTH
                        Good. Stop bathing altogether and maybe 
                        you'll stay single for more than 24 hours- 

                                 AMELIA
                        Chill out. His toothbrush is gone, you 
                        have my spare key back- 

                                 RUTH
                        And I'm not letting it go anytime soon. 
                        Someone needs to save you from becoming 
                        the poster girl for two-month-monogamy. 

                                 AMELIA
                        And someone needs to save you from your 
                        many selves. You’re impossible. 

                                 RUTH
                        Oh darling, it’s good to have you back. 

           The doors to the chapel glide open automatically, revealing 
           Mindy in all her bridal glory. The “Wedding March” plays. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        You know this song is from a Wagner opera 
                        in a scene where the marriage is doomed 
                        to fail?

                                 AMELIA
                        Wasn't he an anti-Semite?

                                 RUTH
                        Hitler was his biggest fan. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Gross.

           Mindy, beaming a large smile, continues her long trek down 
           the aisle on her FATHER's arm. Ruth feigns excitement. 

                                 RUTH
                        Now here’s the part where her father 
                        transfers ownership of her to her new 
                        husband! 
                                 AMELIA
                        Oh Jesus, I was just temporarily blinded 
                        by her giant blood diamond. 

                                 RUTH
                        Maybe it's the spirits of the enslaved 
                        Sierra Leonean children crying out to us.

                                 AMELIA
                        We're bitches.

                                 RUTH
                        Historically accurate bitches. 

           Mindy's Father gives her away. Mindy joins DARREN (30s, 
           Latino) at the altar. Not even Amelia and Ruth are immune to 
           the joy of the moment. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Happily ever after. 

                                 AMELIA
                        If you're into that sort of thing. 

           INT. BALLROOM - EVENING

           The reception is in full swing. KIDS giggle, shove skewered 
           strawberries into a ten-foot tall chocolate fountain. Mindy 
           and Darren sit at a sweetheart table in front of a life-sized 
           ice sculpture of themselves and a 24-PIECE ORCHESTRA. 

           AT A TABLE IN THE CORNER

           Amelia and Ruth recline, their BLISTERED BARE FEET resting on 
           empty chairs. They drink champagne, scan the room. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Okay, who's hotter, Mindy's uncle Charlie 
                        or...Richard Nixon?

           On the dance floor, the homely UNCLE CHARLIE shakes his stuff 
           with abandon to an orchestral version of “The Chicken Dance.” 

                                 RUTH
                        Nixon. Nothing against Uncle Charlie but 
                        those Nixon jowls- how could you resist? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Reid?

           REID, a dour and unstylish gay man in his 40s, sits across 
           the table from Amelia and Ruth, nursing a scotch. 
                                 REID
                        Uncle Charlie. I guess.

                                 AMELIA
                        Why?

                                 REID
                        Because Nixon's dead and it’s a 
                        ridiculous question. 

           An awkward silence. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Worst. Plus One. Ever.  

                                 RUTH
                        Really. You're pretty humorless for a gay 
                        film studies professor. 

                                 AMELIA
                        He's much more fun on paper. 

                                 REID
                        Sorry to disappoint. I’m dealing with all 
                        this bull shit at work. I’m depressed.

                                 AMELIA
                        You're always depressed. What’s up?

                                 REID
                        They're trying to force me to take over a 
                        mickey mouse class. "The Romantic Comedy: 
                        Love and Laughs in the Reel World.” And 
                        yes, that’s R-E-E-L. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Ugh. 

                                 REID
                        The old phone-it-in who used to teach it 
                        dropped dead last weekend. It's wildly 
                        popular, so they don’t want to get rid of 
                        it. But I refused. I will NOT cancel my 
                        graduate seminar on Psychosexual Asian 
                        horror films of the 1960s for a trifle. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I can't believe NYU film students want to 
                        take a class on romantic comedies. 
                        Shouldn't they be studying films 
                        involving french people or communists?
                                 RUTH
                        Seriously. Romantic blah-medies are just 
                        loads of subversively anti-feminist, 
                        conspicuous-consumption, patriarchal 
                        bullshit-

                                 AMELIA
                        -dressed up in a fairy tale. 

                                 REID
                        To be fair, perhaps by exploring the 
                        conventions and appeal of the genre we 
                        can- Oh fuck me. It's a bullshit class. 
                        I’m not doing it. 

           FROM A FEW TABLES AWAY

           Mindy sees Reid, Ruth, and Amelia laughing. She heads over. 

           BACK AT THE TABLE

           Amelia raises her wine glass in a toast.

                                 AMELIA
                        To fairy tale bullshit, just like this 
                        wedding! 

                                 RUTH
                        Here, here!

           Amelia and Ruth clink glasses. Notice Reid's change in facial 
           expression. They turn around. Behind them, Mindy staves off 
           tears. 

                                 MINDY
                        Is that what you guys really think?

                                 AMELIA
                        No. Mindy-

           Too late. Mindy scurries off SOBBING HEAVILY, layers of silk 
           flowing behind her. The GUESTS and Darren act out the shock 
           that’s expected in a situation like this. Amelia and Ruth 
           exchange looks. Shit. They get up to do damage control, 
           grabbing full bottles of Dom Perignon on their way out. 

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Amelia and Ruth sit on the floor outside the "Ladies Powder 
           Room" door, passing a bottle of Dom Perignon back and forth.  
                                 AMELIA
                        C'mon Mindy. Everyone’s waiting. You 
                        still have to cut the cake! 

                                 RUTH
                           (whispers)
                        Oh God. What if we don't get cake?!

           INT. LADIES POWDER ROOM - NIGHT 

           Mindy is perched on the toilet, mascara running down her 
           face. Her dress filling the tiny bathroom. 

                                 MINDY
                        I’m not coming out ever! You guys ALWAYS 
                        thought I was lame! Just admit it!

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Ruth yawns. 

                                 AMELIA
                        We did not. I mean- we do not. Please, 
                        Mindy. We promised Darren you’d be back 
                        in a minute-

           But Mindy’s already devolved into HEAVY SOBBING again. Ruth 
           throws her hands up. This is hopeless. 

           Two blonde, blue-eyed FLOWER GIRLS skip up to Amelia and 
           Ruth. They’re still dressed in the elaborate cupid costumes, 
           with their fake gilded bows and red rose “arrows.”

                                 FLOWERGIRL 1
                        We have to go potty.

           Ruth and Amelia recoil. Not fond of children, especially 
           children in costume. Mindy’s SOBBING can still be heard 
           through the door. They lower their voices.

                                 AMELIA
                        Someone's in there. So, um, scamper off.   

                                 FLOWERGIRL 2
                        But we have to go. 

                                 RUTH
                        And I have to get my college roommate out 
                        of the john before 600 wedding guests 
                        emboldened by the open bar come after my 
                        friend and I here with oyster knives. 

           The girls look at each other. Start to chant. 
                                 FLOWER GIRL 1 & FLOWER GIRL 2
                        We have to potty! We have to potty!

                                 RUTH
                        Not the sharpest cookies in the jar-

                                 AMELIA
                        Jesus. Look how far apart their eyes are. 
                        Go on little girls, get mommy another 
                        cocktail. 

                                 FLOWER GIRL 1 & FLOWER GIRL 2
                        We have to potty! We have to potty!

           Ruth and Amelia cover their ears. They try kindness, not 
           exactly their forte. 

                                 RUTH
                        Hey. Little Girls. What are your names?

                                 FLOWERGIRL 1
                        Karma. 

                                 FLOWERGIRL 2
                        Destiny. 

                                 RUTH
                        Wow. Mommy really was drunk when she was 
                        pregnant. Or maybe mommy is a Hare 
                        Krishna? Does mommy sell books to people 
                        at the airport? 

                                 AMELIA
                        No, I’m envisioning a knocked up Sarah 
                        Lawrence undergrad who was watching the 
                        Dalai Lama on Oprah or something. 

                                 FLOWER GIRL 1 & FLOWER GIRL 2
                        We have to potty! We have to potty!

           More MUFFLED WORDS come from the bathroom. But Ruth and 
           Amelia can’t hear what Mindy’s saying. 

                                 RUTH
                           (to the Flower Girls)
                        Ok. Seriously. Shut your candy holes.  

                                 FLOWERGIRL 1
                        You made Mindy cry. You’re mean. 

                                 RUTH
                        I’ve been called worse. 
                                 FLOWERGIRL 2
                        You need to learn your lesson. You should 
                        be punished. 

                                 AMELIA
                        And you should be at least fifteen feet 
                        away but we all don’t get what we want. 

                                 FLOWERGIRL 1
                        We. Have. To. POTTY!

           Amelia and Ruth are over it. Ruth hands Amelia a bottle of 
           Dom Perignon. Amelia does a military nod. They both start 
           vigorously shaking their bottles. 

           INT. LADIES POWDER ROOM - NIGHT 

           Mindy cries, then starts to watch herself as she cries, 
           reveling in the drama just a little bit. She remembers Amelia 
           and Ruth are outside. Her face hardens in resolve.  

                                 MINDY
                        Amelia and Ruth - you know what? 

           Silence. 

                                 MINDY (CONT’D)
                        Guys?

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 

           Ruth and Amelia are SPRAYING DOWN the Flower Girls with the 
           pressurized champagne bottles. The Flower Girls run away, 
           shrieking. Ruth and Amelia watch them go, a job well done. 

                                 RUTH
                        What’s most awesome about this is that 
                        all of our problems today have been 
                        solved by alcohol. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Shh. Mindy’s saying something. What’s 
                        that, Mindy? 

                                 MINDY (O.S.)
                        I said, “you know what?” 

                                 RUTH
                        Uh, what? 

           AROUND THE CORNER
           The two Flower Girls watch Amelia and Ruth, champagne 
           dripping from their curls. They pull out their bows and red 
           rose “arrows.” 

           INTERCUT MINDY IN THE BATHROOM/AMELIA AND RUTH IN THE HALL

                                 MINDY
                        Well I happen to think-

           Amelia and Ruth listen. Out of their sight, the Flower Girls 
           raise their bows...

                                 MINDY (CONT’D)
                        what you two need-

           Ruth rolls her eyes at Mindy’s dramatic buildup. She makes a 
           ‘wrap it up’ motion with her hand. The Flower Girls pull 
           their bows even more taut. 

                                 MINDY (CONT’D)
                        Is a little-

           The Flower Girls RELEASE their red rose arrows. The arrows 
           spiral on an unexpectedly straight course straight towards 
           Amelia and Ruth...

                                 MINDY (CONT’D)
                        Fairy tale bullshit in YOUR lives!

           ...FTHHHWT! Ruth and Amelia get NAILED SQUARE IN THE EYES 
           with the arrows. 

                                 AMELIA AND RUTH
                        Oww!

           EVERYTHING GOES BLACK. AND STAYS BLACK. THEN- FADE UP:

           The Flower Girls run down the hall, giggling wildly. 

           Amelia and Ruth, still out of it, are red-faced. Their eyes 
           well up with tears as they regain a sense of their 
           surroundings. Then, they start choking out laughter, 
           realizing what’s just happened. Mindy, hearing them, steps 
           out of the bathroom. Sees them both “crying.”   

                                 MINDY
                        Aww, I knew you girls were sorry! 

           Mindy grabs them up in a tight double embrace. 

           AMELIA AND RUTH POV - OVER MINDY'S SHOULDER

           The watery vision clears and everything moves in SLOW MOTION.
           Amelia and Ruth blink in disbelief as two men cross the hall. 
           One is an IMPOSSIBLY GORGEOUS MAN, square-jawed and 
           impeccably dressed. The second is an APPROACHABLY ADORABLE 
           MAN, with sparkling eyes and an endearingly rumpled tuxedo. 

           The Men turn to Amelia and Ruth, respectively flashing them 
           gorgeous million dollar and adorably shy smiles, before 
           disappearing into the ballroom. 

           The SLOW MOTION STOPS. Amelia and Ruth try to shake it off. 
           Whisper to one another over Mindy's shoulder.

                                 AMELIA
                        Man, I am DRUNK. 

                                 RUTH
                        Me too. Cake. Now. 

           INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

           Mindy is back on the dance floor. The orchestra plays “YMCA.” 
           Amelia and Ruth run oversized hunks of cake under the 
           chocolate fountain. They stumble, drunk.  

                                 RUTH
                        Oh yeah, I need this. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I know! It was like the whole world was 
                        going in slo-mo. Literally. You think it 
                        was the Dom Perignon or the rose juice to 
                        the eyes? 

                                 RUTH
                        Oh my god. 

                                 AMELIA
                        What? 

           Ruth is staring at Amelia, in drunken awe. 

                                 RUTH
                        Right now. Right this very moment, you 
                        look so...grootiful. Wait, I mean good. 
                        Or great. Or beautiful. I dunno, you're 
                        just...glowing. 

           Amelia actually does look a little better, a little more 
           kempt, than she did moments ago. So does Ruth. 
                                 AMELIA
                        Hey. You too. 
                           (singing)
                        You. Are. So grootiful...to me-

           The Orchestra stops playing. Mindy steps up to a microphone. 

                                 MINDY
                        Alllllrighty sexy singles, it's time for 
                        the bouquet and garter toss!

           Masses of SINGLE WOMEN AND MEN flock to the dance floor. 

                                 AMELIA
                        So this is a good time to pee- 

           In the center of the ballroom, Darren retrieves Mindy's 
           garter to a chorus of lewd whistles. Mindy basks in the 
           attention. Darren looks at her adoringly. 

           In the background, Amelia and Ruth walk in zigzags the wrong 
           way, champagne in one hand, giant hunks of cake in the other. 

                                 RUTH
                        Oh wait, the door's over there. Code 
                        yellow. Let's Run. 

                                 GUESTS
                        5! 4! 3! 2!-

           Amelia and Ruth race across the slippery ball room floor past 
           the crowd, trying to escape the moment. They're cracking up. 

                                 GUESTS (CONT’D)
                        1!

           Mindy and Darren lob their items with gusto. Too much gusto. 
           The groups of single men and women watch as the THE GARTER 
           AND BOUQUET sail right over them. 

           Only the Impossibly Gorgeous and Approachably Adorable Men 
           break away from the group, running backwards like they're 
           trying to catch a pass. 

           EVERYTHING MOVES IN SLOW MOTION once again. THE MEN run 
           backwards, elbowing each other out of the way... 

           Amelia and Ruth run and slip across the room, their eyes on 
           the EXIT sign, chocolate smeared on their faces, until...

           SLAAAAMMMM! The Men collide with Amelia and Ruth at FULL 
           FORCE. Like a painful-to-watch NFL REPLAY.
           Back to Real Time. Mindy jumps up and down and cheers. The 
           Flower Girls laugh, stick their tongues out at the two. 

           Amelia and Ruth are on the ground. Each holds approximately 
           half of the shredded bouquet. Entangled with them, the 
           Impossibly Gorgeous Men unhook the garter from their cuff 
           links.

           The Four look at one another for the second time. 

           Ruth and SKIP, the one with the rumpled suit and sparkling 
           eyes, share a moment. The sounds of the wedding drop out. 

           Amelia and CHAD, the square-jawed man, share an equally 
           intense connection. They blurt out, at the same time: 

                                 AMELIA AND CHAD
                        Do you wanna get out of here?

                                 RUTH AND SKIP
                        Whoa! That was weird! 

           The four look at each other. Not sure what to think. 

           EXT. NYC STREET - NIGHT

           The drunken foursome stumbles down the street. Laughing.

                                 AMELIA AND CHAD
                        Triple Jinx! Quadruple Jinx! Balls!

                                 RUTH
                        This is so-

                                 SKIP
                        -weird and awesome!

           Ruth throws her hands up smiling, that's what she was about 
           to say! All four laugh. 

           The group almost knocks into a WOMAN IN A BLUE SWEATER. She 
           rolls her eyes as the drunkards stumble past. They pass the 
           same place homeless Dirk sat before. But Dirk is gone. Only 
           his shopping cart of bags remains. 

           ON THE STREET

           The snow is melting. The water streaming into the gutters. 

           ON A BANK’S DIGITAL SIGN
           The temperature display on the sign changes from 30 degrees 
           to 31 degrees. Then again. 32 degrees...33 degrees...34 
           degrees...

           INT. AMELIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Chad, broad shouldered, with a bit of a swagger, loosens his 
           tie in Amelia’s darkened apartment and examines the full-size 
           reproduction of Rene Magritte's "Treachery of Images” hanging 
           over Amelia’s bed. The painting is an image of a pipe. 
           Underneath, are the words "Ceci n'est pas une pipe." 

                                 CHAD
                        So, ms. art professor, what's with the 
                        pipe?

           IN THE BATHROOM

           Amelia, still drunk, shaves above the knee in quick, sloppy 
           strokes. With her free hand she stuffs the stack of books 
           next to her toilet into a cabinet. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Um, it's not a pipe, actually. 

           IN THE BEDROOM

           Chad raises an eyebrow. 

                                 CHAD
                        It sure looks like a pipe. 

           INT. RUTH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Skip wanders through Ruth’s darkened apartment, flips through 
           Ruth’s extensive record collection. A record falls out of its 
           case, he fumbles to pick it up. This is not a guy comfortable 
           in his own skin. 

                                 SKIP
                        Are you a musician?

           IN HER ROOM

           Ruth slips on some cute, funky lingerie. Amuses herself by 
           modeling it in front of the mirror in her darkened room. 

                                 RUTH
                        No, I produce a music show at NPR. I hate 
                        musicians. 

           Ruth strikes a pin-up pose but drunkenly stumbles and knocks 
           over a tower of CDs. Where’d those come from? 
           IN THE LIVING ROOM

           Skip couldn’t hear her over the sounds of CDs falling.  

                                 SKIP
                        I'm a guitarist-singer-songwriter. We 
                        probably have a lot in common!

           INT. AMELIA'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Amelia takes one last sip from her flask before making an 
           entrance. With this guy, she’s going to need to be drunk.

                                 AMELIA
                        But that's what the french words say: 
                        "This is not a pipe." And it's not. It's 
                        a picture of a pipe. You can't smoke it. 

           IN THE LIVING ROOM

           Amelia steps out of the bathroom. Chad saunters over to her 
           in the moonlight.

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        That's surrealism, Chad. Get it?

           Chad steps up to her, lays his hands on her shoulders. 

                                 CHAD
                        Not really. I'm in advertising. 

                                 AMELIA
                        So was Magritte. Then he quit to do 
                        something worthwhile. 

                                 CHAD
                        I suppose teaching 19-year-old trust fund 
                        kids that that pipe is not a pipe is more 
                        worthwhile?

                                 AMELIA
                        Yes. Absolutely. 

           Chad pulls Amelia closer. Faintly, a COLDPLAY SONG begins. 

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        Do you hear something? Music?

                                 CHAD
                        Oh I hear music alright. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Ugh. Maybe you shouldn’t talk-
                                 CHAD
                        Okay-

           Chad leans in for a kiss. The Coldplay song FADES UP. And 
           their lips approach, slowly. Really slowly. Amelia opens her 
           eyes, wondering why they're moving so slow. Then Chad goes 
           for it. Their lips connect and...

           SLOW MOTION! THE SOUND OF COLDPLAY SWELLS! Chad leans Amelia 
           back on the bed. But Amelia stops him, with a confused look. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Oh, maybe not the bed-

                                 CHAD
                        Why not? 

           An awkward silence. Amelia breaks into drunken laughter. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I can’t remember!

           Chad smiles. Looks deep into her eyes. He leans her back on 
           the bed and the scene gradually fades to black. 

           INT. RUTH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Skip, still alone in the living room, won't shut up. 

                                 SKIP
                        So I play at that one coffee shop in the 
                        Village every Sunday. I mean technically 
                        it's open mic, but I'm almost like a 
                        headliner at this point-

           IN HER ROOM

           Ruth yawns. She’s heard enough. She throws on a dingy robe.

           IN THE LIVING ROOM

           Ruth approaches Skip with as little tact as possible. 

                                 RUTH
                        No offense Trip-

                                 SKIP
                        Skip.

                                 RUTH
                        Right, no offense, but I'm just not 
                        feeling this. I should have told you that 
                        I'm possibly a lesbian. Anyway, so, bye. 
                                 SKIP
                        Wow, well that's unexpected. Can I, uh, 
                        at least kiss you good night?

                                 RUTH
                        Um, okay, a little lame, a little fifth 
                        grade. But hey, why not? 

           Skip steps up to Ruth and touches his fingertips to her face. 
           Tilts her eyes up to his. The faint sounds of COLDPLAY begin. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Is that- Coldplay?! From Amelia’s place?

           Skip ignores her, pulls her in for a long, gentle, AMAZING 
           KISS. Ruth steps back, in shock at how great it was.

                                 SKIP
                        C’mon. This is going to be fun. 

           Skip holds out his hand for Ruth to take. What a geek. Ruth 
           holds back her eye roll before deciding...oh what the hell-

                                 RUTH
                        Okay. But talk less. 

                                 SKIP
                        Fair enough. 

           Skip leads a still-unsure-about-this-whole-thing Ruth to the 
           bedroom, hand-in-hand. We hear the SQUEAK OF A BEDSPRING. The 
           COLDPLAY MUSIC SWELLS. A slow fade to black.  

           INT. AMELIA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING

           Amelia wakes up in her bed. Incredibly hungover. The sun 
           shines oppressively into her room. She fumbles in her night 
           stand and pulls out some sunglasses. 

           She notices a note on the night stand: “Had to go. Call you 
           later. Chad.” Amelia scoffs at it. Crumples it and throws it 
           in the trash. 

           IN THE LIVING ROOM

           We see Amelia’s apartment now in full daylight. It’s 
           different. Gloriously large and uncluttered. If it weren’t 
           for the paintings on the wall, you’d think it was a different 
           apartment altogether. Amelia yawns. Looks around...and 
           continues her schlep to the bathroom without reaction. 
           INT. RUTH’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING

           Ruth tosses Skip’s note in the trash. She gets up out of her 
           bed, which is now luxuriously large and fits into the room 
           perfectly. She easily walks around the area she couldn’t 
           squeeze through before. Yawning. Not noticing anything. 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - MORNING

           Ruth, still in her sunglasses, stands on the sidewalk, 
           slinging back a bottle of TYLENOL. Amelia leaves an ATM and 
           rejoins Ruth. She stuffs some $20 bills into her wallet. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Weird. I swear my balance didn't change 
                        and I took out like a hundred dollars. 
                        I’ve finally done it. I’ve killed the 
                        brain cells that do math. 

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

           The girls nurse black coffees. The Woman in a Blue Sweater 
           enters the shop. The door SLAMS behind her. The girls flinch. 

                                 RUTH
                        So was it good for you?

                                 AMELIA
                        I think so, I mean yes-- I actually don't 
                        quite remember it, but I have this 
                        feeling that it was the most amazing sex 
                        I've ever had.  

                                 RUTH
                        Me too! I can't remember one position, 
                        testicle or wet spot, but I just know.

                                 AMELIA
                        It was like the whole world faded to 
                        black and...

           The girls both take a moment to think back dreamily. 

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        So are you gonna see him again?

                                 RUTH
                        God no, he's a musician and I'm not 
                        straight right now. You?

                                 AMELIA
                        He has perfect teeth and works in 
                        advertising. 
                                 RUTH
                        Eww. 

           The two get up to leave. Amelia in front of Ruth. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Oh! I forgot that I need to disown you 
                        for getting it on to Coldpl-

           She whips around to face Ruth. Her purse whips around with 
           her, knocking a STEAMING CUP OF COFFEE right into an UPTIGHT 
           BUSINESSMAN's crotch. He SCREAMS. 

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        Ooh, sorry. 

           Amelia dabs the Uptight Businessman's crotch with napkins. 
           Ruth CRACKS UP, then realize what she's been accused of.

                                 RUTH
                        Wait. Coldplay? That was you!

           The Businessman waves Amelia off his crotch. Ruth 
           accidentally walks into his backhand and is knocked off her 
           feet. She slams backwards into a pyramid-stacked display of 
           coffee. She hits the ground flat on her coccyx. Surrounded by 
           coffee bags, broken open and spilling beans onto the floor. 

           EVERYONE in the cafe stares at Amelia and Ruth. A CUTE GUY 
           rushes up to them, all smiles. 

                                 CUTE GUY
                        I know this is weird. But-- can I get 
                        your phone number? There’s just something 
                        about you. 

                                 RUTH
                        Uh, which one of us? 

                                 CUTE GUY
                        Oh. Either. 

           EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Amelia and Ruth stand outside, still in shock. 

                                 RUTH
                        Well that was weird. 

           Amelia nods, glances down at Ruth's shoes. High heels. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Hey. You're wearing heels. 
                                 RUTH
                        I know. Have you lost weight?

                                 AMELIA
                        Were we talking about something?

                                 RUTH
                        I don't remember. Jesus, it's hot. 

           Ruth and Amelia are, indeed, beginning to sweat. They look 
           out over the scene on the street. This is not the New York we 
           saw yesterday. Everything is brighter. Cleaner. Flatly lit. 
           Glowing, almost. Song birds chirp relentlessly. The trees are 
           laden with glorious fall leaves. 

           And most of all, Amelia and Ruth are different. Thinner. More 
           manicured. Better dressed. Prettier, even. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        This is some hangover, friend. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Maybe our best yet. 

           The two walk off in separate directions. Leaving in sight a 
           news stand, where we can read the headline: "Fall in 
           February?: Global Warming Hits NYC"

           A slide of Meret Oppenheim's artifact, Fur-Lined Teacup, is 
           projected onto a screen. Amelia lectures to a SMALL CLASS.

                                 AMELIA
                        Attraction and repulsion. That's what 
                        makes this piece so captivating. It's a 
                        teacup, something you want to drink from, 
                        though the thought of the fur in your 
                        mouth is disgusting right? But maybe it's 
                        just supposed to be funny. Comments?

           Amelia sees the DELIVERY GUY in the back of the classroom. 
           He's holding a vase filled with TWO DOZEN RED ROSES.

           Amelia is on the phone. Staring at the roses with contempt.

                                 AMELIA
                        Red roses. They're so literal!
           INT. RUTH'S OFFICE - DAY

           Ruth's cramped NPR office. She's on the phone with Amelia, 
           staring, nearly nauseated, at her own vase full of roses. 

                                 RUTH
                        They're so vanilla! 

           INTERCUT AMELIA/RUTH ON PHONE

                        They're so not us. 

                                 RUTH
                        I've gotten three phone calls today from 
                        Flip or Chip or whatever. And it's a 555 
                        number. When did those start existing?

                                 AMELIA

                        stand in ten years and it's a stalker. 
                        What is their deal?

                                 RUTH
                        I don't know. But what do you say these 
                        roses go straight to the land of the 
                        unwanted babies?  

                                 AMELIA
                        To the dumpster! On three. 

                         AMELIA
           One. Two. Three!
                                                          RUTH
                                             One. Two. Three!

           The two DROP the bouquets into their respective trash bins. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Reid, looking defeated, trudges through a lecture. He hates 
           every minute of it, but he's a great lecturer. Something is 
           different with his hair. On the screen behind him is a still 
           from Sandra Bullock's Two Weeks Notice. Sandra Bullock's foot 
           is stuck in a flower pot. 

                                 REID
                        The modern romantic comedy heroine is not 
                        a cliche. She is a collection of hundreds 
                        of cliches. The only true constant and 
                        cliche number one is that she must must 
                        MUST be immensely, inarguably, across-the-
                        board, unanimously, likable. 
           The Students furiously scribble notes. A picture of Jennifer 
           Aniston appears on screen.

                        she’s never aware. Because you can't like 
                        a pretty girl who knows she's pretty and 
                        you definitely can't like an ugly girl.

                        Cliche 3: Our heroine might have a little 
                        post-feminist girl power tacked on. "See, 
                        I'm pretty AND I can do complex math." 
                        But here's where we run into a problem. 
                        The human women in the audience are 
                        already thinking "wait, she's beautiful, 
                        brilliant, and everyone likes her. Why is 
                        she single?" Uh oh. Her likability is 
                        backfiring. So in most movies, the thing 
                        to do is to give the character a flaw. 
                        They're narcissists, they're deceptive, 
                        they're cannibals, WHATEVER. But that 
                        doesn't fly in a romantic comedy where 
                        the heroines "flaws" are things you would 
                        list as your weaknesses in a job 
                        interview: "I work too hard. I'm too 
                        nice. I'm deep in debt because I have an 
                        unusual affinity for gift giving." So how 
                        do we make our character more 
                        sympathetic? Meet Cliche 4: She's 
                        adorably clumsy.

           hand down to Ruth's ass. 

           But Ruth's eyes are wide open, focused on her kitchen table 
           where her cell phone flashes. She can see the number from 
           Katie's embrace: 212-555-1038. 

           INT. AMELIA’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Amelia reads on the couch, but can’t concentrate. Her cell 
           phone silently flashes at her from her purse. A “555” number. 
           She tries to ignore it, but keeps stealing glances at it. 

           Suddenly she freezes. Petrified. It’s as if someone is in the 
           room with her. Watching her. Right behind her. She turns 
           slowly and lays eyes on...

           A COSY BREAKFAST NOOK. With matching throw pillows.

           isn’t into it. Her mind still somewhere else. 

           Amelia flings open the door. Ruth pushes Katie off of her. 
           Katie slams to the floor. THUD.

                                 KATIE
                        Ow!

                                 AMELIA
                        Ruth, do I have a breakfast nook?  

                                 RUTH
                        What? I- I don’t know. 

                                 KATIE
                        Oh my god, is this your girlfriend? 

                                 RUTH
                        No Katie- I'm straight. You should go. 
           A CHINESE FOOD DELIVERY GUY appears in the hallway with THREE 
           GIANT BAGS of food. He knocks on Amelia's door. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Oh hi, those are for me. 

           Katie, pissed, walks out past Amelia and the Delivery Guy. 

                                 KATIE
                        Bisexual bullshit. 

                                 RUTH
                        I’m not bisexual, I’m straight! 

                                 AMELIA
                        Jesus, Ruth. Can’t you ever just say 
                        “it’s not you, it’s me-” 

                                 RUTH
                        Rewind. Breakfast nook. 

           INT. AMELIA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Amelia and Ruth stare at the breakfast nook. 

                                 RUTH
                        It looks like it’s always been there-

                                 AMELIA
                        I know, but why is it so- unsettling? 

           Ruth takes a deep breath. 

                                 RUTH
                        Because Amelia, strange things are afoot 
                        at the Circle Us. 

           INT. RUTH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Ruth sits Amelia down at the kitchen table. She’s serious.

                                 RUTH
                        Okay. So I've been feeling-- I don't 
                        know, empty, all day. And instead of my 
                        usual depression schtick of buying a too-
                        expensive bottle of wine, a cigar, and 
                        dancing drunk to Morrissey at full 
                        volume, I bought THIS. 

           Ruth opens her freezer. Inside: a pint of Chunky Monkey. 
           They both stare at the carton of ice cream. 
                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Amelia?- Is anything else kind of weird? 
                        Something you can't get off your mind? Or-

                                 AMELIA
                        -Someone? Yeah. 

                                 RUTH
                        Me too. I got to  thinking, what if it’s 
                        Fate? Or God? What if she’s trying to 
                        tell us something about those guys? 

                                 AMELIA
                        But those guys are so cheeseless pizza. 

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, you’re right. They’re sugarless 
                        chocolate. Decaf coffee-

                                 RUTH 
                        Nothing to see there folks-

           A beat.

                                 AMELIA
                        Let’s go out with them again. 

                                 RUTH
                        Yeah. Okay. 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Ruth and Skip walk down a winding path together. A pair of 
           ducks swim alongside them in the water. 

                                 SKIP
                        You know, ducks mate for life. 

                                 RUTH
                        Really? If I was a duck I'd be the 
                        biggest slut. 

                                 SKIP
                        I wrote a song about it once, if you 
                        wanna hear it-

                                 RUTH
                        Uh, later. Man it’s so bright lately!

                                 SKIP
                        Hey. The whole world is looking a little 
                        brighter to me too lately. 
                                 RUTH
                        Dude, you gotta work on those lines. 

                                 SKIP
                        Or maybe you need to lower your 
                        expectations. Then we both win!

                                 RUTH
                        You have some low self-esteem, pal. 

                                 SKIP
                        I do. 

                                 RUTH
                        That’s not a problem I can relate to. 

                                 SKIP
                        I noticed that about you. 

           Ruth laughs. This guy is growing on her. Behind them, Amelia 
           and Chad walk with hands in their own pockets. Amelia is 
           remembering why this was a bad idea. 

                                 CHAD
                        So I told them “you rent out every 
                        billboard in the city, slap an American 
                        flag on the box for the red staters and 
                        tell the blue staters it’s ‘green’.” 
                        Advertising: it’s not hard people. What? 
                        Why are you looking at me like that? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Because I think you're the Antichrist. 

                                 CHAD
                        I’m not. But I do look awesome in red.  

                                 AMELIA
                        Ugh. New subject: I didn't realize you 
                        and Skip were brothers. For some reason I 
                        find that kind of creepy-

                                 CHAD
                        It is kind of creepy that he still 
                        insists on taking baths together. 
                           (silence)
                        Kidding. Geez, I didn't realize you were 
                        one of those uptight types. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I'm not-
                          CHAD
                                                         AMELIA
           A type?
                                             A type. 

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        Stop finishing-

                          CHAD
                                                         AMELIA
           My sentences? 
                                             My sentences. 

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        Argh!

                                 CHAD
                        Last one was just a guess, I swear. 

           Amelia smiles despite herself. Chad notices, satisfied.

           POSTED TO A TREE THE FOUR HAVE PASSED

           Another Missing Persons Notice. Another happy couple. 
           Underneath their names: “Missing since February 15.” 

           FALLING IN LOVE IN NEW YORK MONTAGE. CUE THE MUSIC! 

           -Brooklyn Bridge
           The Four of them do the "Monkees walk" across the bridge. 
           Amelia and Ruth clumsily TRIP simultaneously. They all laugh. 

           -Coney Island
           The Four smush into one basket on the Coney Island 
           Wonderwheel. They merrily eat corn dogs, point out sights. 

           -Times Square
           The Four watch the NAKED COWBOY sing. Skip whispers something 
           into the Cowboy's ear. MOMENTS LATER, Skip and Chad are in 
           their underwear, playing the guitar for the laughing girls. 

           INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT

           A KNICKS PLAYER shoots a free throw. Scores! Amelia and Ruth 
           jump to their feet and APPLAUD. Skip and Chad beside them. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I didn't even know I liked basketball.

                                 RUTH
                        Look how happy Spike Lee looks!

           Chad kisses Amelia on the cheek as they sit back down. She 
           tries to shake off her weird feeling and enjoy it.   

           Ruth and Skip appear on the Jumbotron “Kiss Cam”, framed in a 
           heart! 
           They start kissing...then Ruth climbs onto his lap, starts 
           seriously making out. The kiss cam quickly cuts away. 
           Everyone laughs.  

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        I can't believe how much we did today!

                                 AMELIA
                        I can’t believe I actually had fun in 
                        Times Square. I always kind of considered 
                        it the eighth circle of hell.

                                 CHAD
                        Oh no. Not since Guiliani cleaned it up.

           Amelia laughs. Then realizes Chad’s not joking. Ruth and Skip 
           are looking dreamily into one another’s eyes. 

                                 SKIP
                        Can I...get you a Heineken, Rudi?

                                 RUTH
                        I’ll take a Heineken, sure. 

                                 CHAD
                        A capital idea. How about you, Mel? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Um, yeah. A Heineken. Thanks. 

           The guys leave. Amelia, uneasy for reasons she can’t 
           articulate, scans the crowd. SOMEONE reads a newspaper with 
           the headline: “NYC Now Cleanest, Safest City in Nation.” 
           Then she notices the scoreboard- the Knicks are killing the 
           competition. Something is not right here. And then there’s-

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        Mel? Rudi? 

           First the look of epiphany. Then fear. 

           EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT

           Amelia drags Ruth out onto the sidewalk. 

                                 RUTH
                        Hey! Let go. What's wrong with you?

                                 AMELIA
                        I just need some air. Ruth- Okay. So- 

                                 RUTH
                        Um, Amelia? Shouldn't we go tell Skip and 
                        Chad where we are?
                                 AMELIA
                        Mel and Rudi. Unisex and plucky-

                                 RUTH
                        “Plucky?” 

                                 AMELIA
                        New York is clean.  

                                 RUTH
                        Which is awesome-

                                 AMELIA
                        And the Knicks - they’re doing so well. 

                                 RUTH
                        Also awesome...Amelia? 

                                 AMELIA
                        And we're having a delightfully sunny 
                        fall, in February. 

                                 RUTH
                        Global Warming sucks and then you die. 

                                 AMELIA
                        And we're wearing four inch heels and our 
                        apartments are bigger and our waists are 
                        smaller and we hear Coldplay during sex 
                        we can't even remember. And most of all, 
                        we like those guys. A cocky ad exec and 
                        an unemployed musician? Ruth-

           Amelia grabs Ruth's hands, looks into her eyes. 

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        I think we're trapped in a romantic 
                        comedy.

                                 RUTH
                        Me too!

                                 AMELIA
                        Really!?

                                 RUTH
                        No. Wait, you were serious?

                                 AMELIA
                        Yes.
                                 RUTH
                        Baby, look at me. Are you having a Mary-
                        Todd-Lincoln breakdown on me?

                                 AMELIA
                        Listen. It all makes sense. The Chinese 
                        food and the “555” numbers and... 
                        Heineken! It’s product placement! And we 
                        like sports that are not roller derby 
                        now? And “Mel” and “Rudi.” It was all in 
                        Reid's lecture. It all fits. 

                                 RUTH
                        Okay, still not totally on board the 
                        crazy train with you-

                                 AMELIA
                        Watch this. 

           Amelia pulls a tissue out of her purse. Blows her nose. 

                                 RUTH
                        You should take that on the road. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Shut up. Watch. 

           Amelia throws the tissue up in the air, letting it fall to 
           the ground. Ruth shrugs. So what? 

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        Now where is it? 

           Ruth looks down. No tissue. Just a spic and span sidewalk. 

                                 RUTH
                        It blew away. 

                                 AMELIA
                        It’s not windy. 

                                 RUTH
                        A rat snagged it. 

                                 AMELIA
                        There are no more rats. C’mon Ruth. Don’t 
                        you feel-- out of character? 

           Ruth thinks. Sits down on a bench, eyes cast down. 

                                 RUTH
                        Not that this means anything, but- I took 
                        my roses out of the trash. I kept them. 
           Amelia puts a hand on Ruth’s shoulder. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I did the same thing. 

                                 RUTH
                        I like Skip. But I don't like that I like 
                        him. He blogs and writes songs with no 
                        choruses and...he likes Dave Matthews, 
                        Amelia. He likes Dave Matthews a lot. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Opposites attract. Hilarity ensues. 

                                 RUTH
                        But if- how did this happen? 

                                 AMELIA
                        I don't know. But- remember at Mindy's 
                        wedding, when we thought we were so drunk 
                        everything was moving in slow motion? 

                                 RUTH
                        Yeah. 

                                 AMELIA
                        What if everything WAS moving in slow 
                        motion? I don’t know how, but-

                                 RUTH
                        Well, okay, this is crazy but right 
                        before that, what Mindy said, and those 
                        creepy knee-highs dressed as cupids-

           Amelia takes out her cell phone, starts dialing. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Who are you calling? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Mindy. She has to know something about 
                        this. About these guys or those little 
                        girls. Or something. 

                                 RUTH
                        Maybe Mindy’s playing a prank on us. 

                                 AMELIA
                        She’d have to have a sense of irony to 
                        pull that off. 

                                 RUTH
                        Right. But- let’s just go back inside.  
                                 AMELIA
                        She’s not answering. We have to find her.

                                 RUTH
                        C’mon. They’re admittedly not the coolest 
                        guys we’ve ever met but they don’t 
                        deserve to get stood up. And the sex-

                                 AMELIA
                        You don’t even remember it! 

                                 RUTH
                        I’m unclear on your point-

                                 AMELIA
                        Those guys are not who we think they are. 
                        I’m not even sure those guys are real 
                        people. Look, you can come with me to 
                        Mindy’s or you can stay here and fill out 
                        your Dave Matthews fan club application.  

                                 RUTH
                        I hate you. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I know. C’mon. 

           INT. MINDY'S CONDO BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

           An upscale condominium complex with excessive wainscoting. 
           Amelia and Ruth enter the hallway. Set eyes on piles and 
           piles of boxes and mail at the foot of Mindy's door. Amelia’s 
           already worried. She knocks on the door. 

                                 RUTH
                        You're sure they're not on their 
                        honeymoon? 

                                 AMELIA
                        She said they were waiting for "April in 
                        Paris."

                                 RUTH
                        Gag. Maybe they're just having endless 
                        newlywed sex or something-

           Amelia pounds on the door. Ruth sifts through the mail. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Mindy! Darren! 
                                 RUTH
                        Mindy! The new US WEEKLY is out here! 
                        Stars, they're just like us! John Mayer 
                        eats sandwiches too!

           But it’s useless. Nothing. 

           EXT. MINDY’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Amelia and Ruth exit the building. 

                                 RUTH
                        It is kind of strange. I usually get two 
                        calls a day from her devoted to celebrity 
                        babies alone. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Her rating system is particularly 
                        disturbing.  

           Amelia stops in her tracks. She’s staring at a telephone 
           pole. A Missing Persons Poster. And Another. And Another. 

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        Look at the dates on these. Nothing 
                        before Valentine’s Day. 

           Ruth looks down the street. All of the telephone poles have 
           these posters on them. For as far as the eye can see. 

                                 RUTH
                        How did we not notice this?

                                 AMELIA
                        I don’t think we were supposed to. 

           EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

           A perfect New York day. Too perfect. A smiling POLICEMAN 
           waves cheerily to a happy HOT DOG VENDOR. The birds sing. 

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Ruth and Amelia open the door and stand on the stoop. They're 
           in designer sundresses and very high heels. They look 
           beautiful, neat, paranoid, and miserable. 

                                 RUTH
                        My dress is a size 4. 

                                 AMELIA
                        My heels are comfortable. 
                                 RUTH
                        God this is hell. 

           Amelia starts down the steps, but immediately she TRIPS and 
           falls out of frame. 

           Ruth rushes to her. Amelia sits up in a pile of freshly raked 
           leaves. She spits out a leaf. Ruth laughs. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Aww, you look like a little clumsy baby 
                        bird. I just wanna throw up in your mouth

           EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           Amelia and Ruth walk out of the Police Station. Past The 
           Woman in the Blue Sweater who is on her way in. Ruth is 
           reading from the New York Times.

                                 AMELIA
                        I can’t believe they won’t let us report 
                        a missing person for a week. Ridiculous. 

                                 RUTH
                        Here’s something on page 11. "What most 
                        confounds police is the similarities 
                        between the missing couples. They all 
                        share a certain 'opposites attract' 
                        dynamic, met each other in unusually 
                        coincidental circumstances, and each of 
                        the relationships began on or after 
                        Valentine's Day. A friend of one of the 
                        missing women stated “One minute they 
                        were falling in love, the next minute 
                        they hated each other, and then the next 
                        they were kissing in the rain. The 
                        wedding was the last time I saw her.”
                           (beat)
                        Maybe these people were all so crazy in 
                        love they just ran off to start a new 
                        life together. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Mindy wouldn’t run off and not tell 
                        anyone. I get a text message every time 
                        she has cramps. 

                                 RUTH
                        Okay, let’s assume for a moment we’re all 
                        “trapped in a romantic comedy.” Then why 
                        are people disappearing? It doesn’t 
                        connect. That’s not what happens in 
                        romantic comedies. 
                                 AMELIA
                        All I know is what happened to these 
                        people in the article is what’s happening 
                        to us. And now they’re gone.

                                 RUTH
                        I guess this means we’re not seeing Skip 
                        and Chad again, huh? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Ruth!

                                 RUTH
                        I’m just saying, if this is true maybe we 
                        could have some fun with it. I mean, Dave 
                        Matthews notwithstanding, it turns out I 
                        look really hot as a size 4. 

                                 AMELIA
                        But it's not real, Ruth.  

                                 RUTH
                        Oh, right. And that's-- bad?

                                 AMELIA
                        Yes!

                        rarely over 29. Unless they had to adjust 
                        it to 30 because Meg Ryan was too old to 
                        pass for 29. 35 is pretty much the max 
                        unless Dianes Keaton or Lane or Sarah 
                        Jessica Parker is involved-

                                 RUTH
                        But-
                                 REID
                        You like your job, Ruth? Respected there? 

                                 RUTH
                        Yes and yes. 

                                 REID
                        Two more checks in the “probably not in 
                        an alternate reality arbitrarily ruled by 
                        a film genre” column. Have you ever stood 
                        in pouring rain and not cared because you 
                        were so emotionally worked up?

                                 AMELIA
                        God no. 

                                 REID
                        Do you both still incessantly judge 
                        others and look at the world through the 
                        cynic's lens? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Well, yes-

                                 REID
                        At best each of you could be the wacky 
                        friend. But there are never two wacky 
                        friends. And the wacky friend is usually 
                        either a token sassy black girl or maybe 
                        an approachable gay guy so that the movie 
                        can claim “diversity.” 

                                 AMELIA
                        But-

                                 REID
                        Look. These movies exist to reassure 
                        single women that their one true love is 
                        just around coincidence corner. All the 
                        characters reject their soul mates at 
                        some point, but the rom-com universe 
                        punishes them endlessly until they 
                        realize it’s meant to be blah blah blah. 
                        So even if you were "trapped" in a 
                        romantic comedy (which you aren't), and 
                        you've met your soul mates (which you 
                        haven't), then there's nothing you can 
                        do. You'd be fated to be with them. True 
                        love in the movies is as inescapable as 
                        “Happily Ever After” and “The End.”

           Amelia looks beaten. Ruth eyes Reid strangely. 
                                 RUTH
                        Are you wearing an ascot?

           Reid looks down. He is, indeed, wearing an ascot. 

                                 REID
                        Yeah. I found it in a box of my ex’s old 
                        Halloween clothes. And I thought, “what 
                        the hey?” Like it?

           INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

           Amelia and Ruth wait in line at a Starbucks. Product 
           placement everywhere. Amelia’s eyes are vacant, lost.

                                 RUTH
                        Maybe Reid’s right. Maybe for the first 
                        time ever, you’re the one who jumped the 
                        gun on something. Helloooo? Amelia? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Ruth- The End. 

                                 RUTH
                        Did I miss the beginning and middle? 

                                 AMELIA
                        No. The End. There’s nothing after The 
                        End. There’s nothing after “Happily Ever 
                        After” in those movies.

                                 RUTH
                        Okay...

                                 AMELIA
                        They meet. They fall. They fight. They 
                        get married. Happily Ever After. THE END. 
                        That’s what happened to those people - 
                        maybe to Mindy. They reached “The End.”  

                                 RUTH
                        And? 

                                 AMELIA
                        I don’t know. Poof. Fade to black. The 
                        End. The Big End. 

                                 RUTH
                        Look. Amelia. Can we just blame this all 
                        on the current administration or rascally 
                        teenagers or something and call it a day!
           Ruth makes a gesture to emphasize her point. She KNOCKS over 
           an artfully stacked tower of teacups and saucers. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Oh, FUdge... I mean FRICK. I mean-

           Ruth can't seem to get her words out right. 

                                 AMELIA
                        You mean frag? Wait, I didn’t mean that-

                                 RUTH
                        Feck! Fire-Truck! 

                                 AMELIA
                        Son of a glitch we’ve been PG-thirteened! 

                                 RUTH
                        That's frucktarded. Mother-trucker! 
                        Clocksucker! Fluckface! Shit! Oh! I can 
                        say sh-

                                 AMELIA
                        Stop! Use it sparingly! We probably only 
                        get one each-
                           (beat)
                        Oh shit! 

           At the entrance, the door shuts behind Chad and Skip. 

                                 SKIP
                        I told you it was them! Why’d you guys 
                        ditch us?

                                 CHAD
                        That was downright hurtful, Mel. 

           Everything, once again, moves in SLOW MOTION. And Amelia and 
           Ruth are keenly aware of it. A BARISTA scowls at them, 
           sweeping up broken teacups. The PATRONS look at them like 
           they’re crazy. 

           Chad and Skip stand, dreamily backlit in the doorway, waiting-
           Ruth reaches over and quietly clutches Amelia's hand. Back to 
           real time. Ruth whispers. 

                                 RUTH
                        Amelia?

                                 AMELIA
                        Yes?
                                 RUTH
                        I believe you. Let’s run. 

           Amelia and Ruth CHARGE Skip and Chad, SCREAMING.

                                 RUTH AND AMELIA
                        Fuuuuuuuuuuuuug!

           INT. TAXI - DAY

           Amelia and Ruth pant heavily in the taxi. Their hair is 
           cutely askew. 

                                 RUTH
                        We just ran four blocks and I'm not even 
                        sweating!

                                 AMELIA
                        I don't think we do that anymore. 

                                 RUTH
                        Do you think Skip is cute?

                                 AMELIA
                        Ruth!

                                 RUTH
                        I’m sorry! I can't help it! I feel like 
                        some pod person is about to explode out 
                        of my skin!

                                 AMELIA
                        We’re going to die. Mindy’s dead and 
                        we’re going to die too. 

                                 RUTH
                        We’re not going to die. 

                                 AMELIA
                        The inevitable coincidences. They’re 
                        never going to stop. And everyone will 
                        keep changing. And we’ll keep changing. 
                        And then we’ll die. 

                                 RUTH
                        Stop it. That’s not going to happen. You 
                        know what we’re going to do? We’re going 
                        to go home, eat some Chunky Monkey and 
                        tomorrow we’re going back to work. We 
                        like and are awesome at our jobs and Reid 
                        said that never happens in those movies. 
                        So that’s where we’ll go. To work. 
                        Sanctuary.

                           (beat)
                        I’m not going to let you die. Okay?

           Amelia nods. Completely unconvinced. 

           INT. NPR OFFICE - DAY

           Somber EMPLOYEES at NPR are packing boxes. Ruth wanders 
           through the office, confused. She finds her melancholy 
           STATION MANAGER staring, forlorn, at his Peabody Award.

                                 RUTH
                        What’s going on? 

                                 STATION MANAGER
                        It finally happened. Congress finally cut 
                        our funding. As of Monday WNYC becomes 
                        WROKK a station devoted to top 40 R&B and 
                        pop megahits. NPR is dead. PBS got hit 
                        too. Sesame Street - gone. 

                                 RUTH
                        What!? We’re all fired? 

                                 STATION MANAGER
                        Worse. We’re not fired.  

                                 RUTH
                        Huh? 

                                 STATION MANAGER
                        Ruth, next week you start producing the 
                        new morning show called “Morning Glory 
                        with Knucklehead and The Bull.” Your new 
                        office is on the fourth floor. Steve’s 
                        got the boxes-

           The Manager places his Peabody award in a box. Rethinks it. 
           Puts it in the trash. Ruth looks absolutely carsick. 

           INT. NYU - CLASSROOM - DAY

           Reid teaches class. He's wearing a tight tee shirt and his 
           hair is gelled. His formerly dry, acerbic presentation has 
           been supplanted with genuine enthusiasm. 

           Projected at the front is a split-screen of Mel Gibson in 
           What Women Want and Seth Rogan in Knocked Up. 

                                 REID

                        He’s not self actualized but he is sassy 
                        and self-deprecating! They’re both 
                        falling in love and growing up in the 
                        process. Yum, don’t you want to eat them 
                        up with spoons!?

           Amelia tries to get Reid’s attention from the doorway.

           INT. AMELIA/REID'S OFFICE - DAY

           Reid melodramatically sighs. 

                                 REID
                        O-M-G, Amelia. I thought we all agreed 
                        this was crazytown! 

                                 AMELIA
                        Reid, I just got out of a meeting with my 
                        dean. You know what they want me to teach 
                        next semester?

           Amelia slams a painting down right in front of Reid: a 
           pleasant group of cottages next to a babbling brook, lined by 
           a quaint cobblestone street. 

                                 REID
                        Aww, I feel so cozy. 

                                 AMELIA
                        It's Thomas Kinkade, Reid. Paintings of 
                        cottages, Jesus, and Elvis that you buy 
                        in the mall. Next to Cinnabon. 

                                 REID
                        It's like he's painting my soul on 
                        Christmas morning. 

                                 AMELIA
                        But it's not art! I teach Man Ray and 
                        Ernst and Arp. 

                                 REID
                        Oh Amelia Bedelia, I never know what 
                        you're talking about.

                        Reid, Mindy has disappeared. You have to

                        "The Bull," and you- look at you!

           Reid looks down at his shirt, which is a picture of R2-D2 and 
           C-3PO. Accompanied by the text: Support Gay Marriage. 
                                 REID
                        Hey, I am very proud and comfortable with 
                        my sexuality and if you're not--

                                 AMELIA
                        No, Reid. YOU'RE NOT comfortable and 
                        proud of your sexuality. You're an 
                        awkward misanthrope who only dates 
                        "straight-acting" closet cases who wear 
                        flannel.  

           Amelia catches sight of something out of the corner of her 
           eye. Something scurrying. Amelia follows it. 

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God! A rat! This is great, I 
                        haven’t seen one since-

           Amelia stops. Not Amused. She is staring down at a shivering 
           ITALIAN GREYHOUND in a pink bedazzled shirt that reads 
           “Princess.” It daintily pees on the rug. 

                                 REID
                        Oh, that’s just Xena Warrior Princess. 
                        She’s changed my life. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Can’t you see? First you agree to teach 
                        the romantic comedy class-

                                 REID
                        Best decision I ever made!

                                 AMELIA
                        Then the boy band hair, then the ascot, 
                        and now that thing. The whole world has 
                        changed and you’re changing more every 
                        day. And so are we. Reid, we have to find 
                        out what happened to Mindy. And you’re 
                        the expert. We need you-

           Reid is on the spot. He takes a moment. Then: 

                                 REID
                        Le sigh. You know me, anything for my 
                        besties!

                                 AMELIA
                        FYI you would never say that. 
           INT. MINDY’S CONDO BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

           Amelia, Reid, and Ruth reach Mindy’s floor. There’s even more 
           mail stacked up outside her door.

                                 REID
                        Ooh US Weekly!

                                 RUTH
                        Move. 

           Amelia and Ruth take tools out of their purses. Set to work 
           on the lock. They seem pretty comfortable at the task. 

                                 REID
                        Whoa, you guys are scarily good at this. 

           The lock clicks. But the door will only open an inch.

                                 AMELIA
                        Ugh, there’s a chain lock on the inside. 

                                 RUTH
                        We didn’t bring wire cutters?

           Ruth peers into the apartment through the crack. She GASPS.  

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Look!

           From the crack in the door, they can see a pair of motionless 
           legs extending from behind a couch. Mindy’s legs. 

           Amelia, Ruth, and Reid immediately start RAMMING the door 
           with their shoulders. On the third try, the chain breaks. The 
           door flings open.  

           IN MINDY’S LIVING ROOM

           The Four rush up to Mindy’s body. Mindy’s...very alive body. 
           She lies on the carpet, wadded up tissues and empty cartons 
           of Chunky Monkey surrounding her. She looks like she’s been 
           crying for days. Her hair is in braided extensions.  

                                 AMELIA
                        Mindy, what happened?

           Mindy’s sits up. Looks at the three of them. She just shakes 
           her head, puts her hand over her mouth.

                                 RUTH
                        You can’t talk? 
                                 AMELIA
                        Are you hurt? 

           Mindy shakes her head again. They’re not getting it. 

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay, Mindy. You’re safe now. Tell 
                        us what happened.  

           Mindy takes a deep breath. But what comes out of her mouth is 
           decidedly un-Mindy. A raucous, SASSY BLACK GIRL VOICE. 

                                 MINDY
                        Girl, I don’t know what the hell 
                        happened, but it ain’t right. It ain’t 
                        right!

           Mindy slaps a hand over her mouth. Ashamed. She sobs.  

           LATER

           Amelia makes Mindy hot tea. Mindy, eyes deadened, answers 
           everyone’s questions with her new sad, sassy voice. 

                                 RUTH
                        But why didn't you open the door when we 
                        were pounding on it?

                                 MINDY
                        Just wanted to be alone. Didn’t want to 
                        have nobody see me or hear me like this. 

                                 REID
                        Where's your tall drink of a hubby? 

                                 MINDY
                        With his people. I kicked him out. He 
                        probably hating on me now. 

                                 AMELIA
                        But why? What happened?

                                 MINDY
                        I just woke up morning after the wedding 
                        and WHAM! I realize the biggest party of 
                        my life is over. I been planning that 
                        wedding since I was sixteen years old. It 
                        was like all the air went straight outta 
                        me so I just went on back to sleep. Slept 
                        all day and when Darren come ‘round at 
                        six PM, tells me I gotta get up, I said 
                        to him “I ain’t gonna get got up.” That’s 
                        the first time I talk like this. 
                                 AMELIA
                        But nothing else happened?

                                 MINDY
                        Just went to back to sleep. Next day he 
                        came to get me up and I opened my mouth 
                        and it was even worse. I tol’ him: “Boy, 
                        you think I’mma hop up outta here so I 
                        can be a frumpy ol’ married woman, 
                        darning your socks for the next sixty 
                        years, you got another thing coming!” 
                           (beat)
                        Then I realized: my life is over. Ain’t 
                        nothing to look forward to no more. And I 
                        don’t even care. Don’t wanna see my 
                        husband, don’t wanna do nothing. 

                                 RUTH
                        Any gaps in short term memory, weight 
                        loss, vertigo, acute tinnitus?

                                 MINDY
                        Huh? 

                                 RUTH
                        Mindy, do you know two guys named Skip 
                        and Chad? They were at your wedding. 

                                 MINDY
                        Skip? And Chad? I’ve never heard names so 
                        white in all my life. Hell no I don’t 
                        know no men named Skip and Chad.

                                 RUTH
                        Okay, Mindy. Wait, how come she can curse 
                        and we can’t? 

                                 MINDY
                        Y’all really think we trapped in a movie? 
                        ‘Cuz that don’t make no sense. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I’m wondering about that too. If all 
                        those other people disappeared, why not 
                        Mindy? She had the fairy tale wedding, 
                        got married-

           Silence. No one knows. Then. 

                                 REID
                        O-M-G-Z! Mindy is black!
                                 RUTH
                        Slow on the uptake, this one.  

                                 REID
                        No, listen! Mindy’s black! Think about 
                        all the missing persons posters. You 
                        remember seeing any black people on 
                        there? Latinos? Asians? No. Rom-coms are 
                        whiter than the inside of Lindsay Lohan’s 
                        nose. So unless Mindy lands a lucky spot 
                        in an Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence, or 
                        Tyler Perry movie (all total cross-
                        dressers I might add, not that I’m 
                        implying anything) her only other option 
                        then is to be-

                                 AMELIA
                        The sassy black friend. 

                                 REID
                        That’s why she can curse and you can’t. 
                        Token friends get leeway. 

                                 RUTH
                        And you’re our token gay. 

                                 REID
                        I’m just happy to be here!

                                 MINDY
                        Well, I’m not! This ain’t even how black 
                        folk talk. This how white folk think 
                        black folk talk! Y’all should be the ones 
                        havin’ to talk funny. You two is mean. 
                        Make me cry on my wedding day. Now I 
                        gotta be your comic relief? Oh hell no! 

                                 RUTH
                        Is the whole “crying on your wedding day”  
                        gonna be one of things you bring up every 
                        time we get together-

                                 MINDY
                        She kidding?

                                 AMELIA
                        Children, focus. We have to figure out a 
                        way out of this. 

                                 MINDY
                        Throw some ideas on out then, girl. 
                                 AMELIA
                        Well - let’s look at what got us into 
                        this: a combination of those flower girls 
                        nailing us with some roses and Mindy 
                        telling us we needed some more fairy tale 
                        bull- 

                                 MINDY
                        -shit

                                 AMELIA
                        -Thank you. In our lives. 

                                 RUTH
                        Can’t Mindy just un-curse us, then? 

           Everyone looks at Mindy. She gives it a go. Waves a hand.

                                 MINDY
                        Okay...You ain’t cursed no more!

           They all wait a minute. Nothing changes. She tries again.

                                 MINDY (CONT’D)
                        You don’t need no fairy tale bullshit in 
                        yo’ lives. You was doing just fine. 

           They wait again. Nothing. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Can’t you try to talk like you used to? 

           Mindy shoots her a look. Amelia backs down. 

                                 RUTH
                        So what about the little darlings? The 
                        flower girls. Let’s go hunt them down. 

                                 MINDY
                        You gonna have to be more specific then. 
                        I had up near 20 flower girls. Darren got 
                        a lot of nieces. Catholics. 

                                 AMELIA
                        They were white, blonde, twins maybe?

                                 MINDY
                        They was white? 

                                 RUTH
                        Yeah. White. Far apart eyes... 
                                 MINDY
                        Girl. I’m black. And my husband a Puerto 
                        Rican. We look like we got any recessive 
                        genes floating in our genetic pools?

                                 RUTH
                        But-

                                 MINDY
                        These little white girls got names? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Oh. Yeah! Karma and Destiny. 

           The implications hit everyone at the same time. 

                                 RUTH
                        You don’t think they were- actual cupids?

                                 MINDY
                        You did say the first people you saw 
                        after you was hit was Skip and Chad. 
                        Tha’s what happen when cupid hit yo’ ass. 
                        Fall in love with first thang you see.

                                 AMELIA
                        Yeah, you fall in love. You don’t get 
                        trapped in movie genres!

                                 REID
                        Wellsies, we were all kvetching about 
                        romantic comedies before all that, then 
                        you made Mindy cry, maybe that’s where 
                        the “Karma” aspect comes in. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Karma? Cupids? We’re trapped in the worst 
                        written romantic comedy of all time. 

                                 REID
                        “Gigli” will be so relieved-

                                 RUTH
                        So what do we do now?

                                 MINDY
                        Maybe we can get them cupids back? Do a 
                        cupid rain dance or something. 
                                 AMELIA
                        I don’t know. Cupid, or cupids as it is, 
                        are usually depicted as pranksters who do 
                        some haphazard arrow shooting and then 
                        leaves the victims to sort out the mess. 
                        I’ve never heard of him/them returning to 
                        clean things up. 

                                 REID
                        Well then may I suggest a more academic 
                        approach? Think tanking it? Research? 

                                 AMELIA
                        As in?

                                 REID
                        As in rom-com movie marathon, bitches!

                                 MINDY
                        What the hell he just call me? 

           INT. DVD RENTAL STORE - DAY

           Amelia and Mindy pull romantic comedy titles off the shelves. 
           Xena shivers in a baby bjorn on Reid’s chest. In the 
           background, The Woman in the Blue Sweater browses. 

           Amelia accidentally knocks over a stand of DVDs. The VIDEO 
           STORE CLERK looks up. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Sorry. 

                                 VIDEO STORE CLERK
                        It’s cool, lady. It was adorable. 

           Amelia sighs. So tired of this. Ruth comes in from outside. 

                                 AMELIA
                        What were you doing out there? 

                                 RUTH
                        I had to pee at the donut shop. 

                                 REID
                        Ooh Xena Warrior Princess definitely 
                        thinks we should watch Must Love Dogs.

                                 RUTH
                        Okay. I have a question to pose to the 
                        group. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RUTH (CONT'D)
                        If this is really happening, are we 
                        trapped in some sort of a parallel 
                        romantic comedy universe or did our whole 
                        world just change into a romantic comedy? 

                                 MINDY
                        If you in a parallel universe don’t that 
                        mean they other versions of you out 
                        there? Like they two Amelias. Two Ruths- 

                                 REID
                        Impossible. You ladies are one of a kind!

                                 AMELIA
                        And there were all the articles in the 
                        paper about Global Warming when the 
                        weather got so nice. If this was some 
                        parallel romantic comedy world, the 
                        weather would have always been nice. 

                                 REID
                        Look at our resident Nancy Drew go! Now 
                        where are those scrumptious Hardy boys?

                                 RUTH
                        Is there any way you can cut down on the 
                        histrionic supportive gay guy talk? 

           Reid frowns. Grabs some DVD titles from the shelf. Taunts 
           Ruth with them. 

                                 REID
                        Rudi, are you just crabby because this 
                        new Reality Bites? Or is that you’ve 
                        Never Been Kissed by anybody but Mr. 
                        Wrong. Don’t worry, Something’s Gotta 
                        Give, Rumor Has It One Fine Day, just by 
                        Keeping the Faith, you’ll get French 
                        Kissed or maybe even Knocked Up! for Nine 
                        Months. It’ll be Just Like Heaven.  

           Ruth just yawns at his display. 

                                 REID (CONT’D)
                        I’m serious, It Could Happen to You.

           Ruth holds up Two Can Play That Game followed by Loser.

                                 RUTH
                        I gotta pee again. 

           Ruth leaves. Amelia watches her go, suddenly uneasy. 
           INT. NYU - SCREENING ROOM - NIGHT

           A stack of Romantic Comedy DVDs on the projector. Amelia and 
           Mindy take copious notes. Ruth and Reid have a bottle of 
           tequila and shot glasses between them and are giddily drunk. 
           They all watch Notting Hill.

                                 REID
                        Oh, here they are again. Look, the mom 
                        and the kid extras by the bookstore. Same 
                        clothes as last time, totally different 
                        day in the movie. 

                                 MINDY
                        Shot!

           Ruth and Reid throw back shots. Amelia rolls her eyes. 

                                 RUTH
                        This was a great idea. Maybe romantic 
                        comedies are good for something after all-

                                 MINDY
                        We supposed to be researching-

                                 AMELIA
                        -not playing continuity error drinking 
                        games. 

                                 RUTH
                        Um, okay mom. 

           Amelia stares daggers at Ruth. She’s just hit one of those 
           touchy long-time friendship nerves. The room goes silent. 
           Reid desperately tries to defuse. 

                                 REID
                        Hey, you know what's trippy? Characters 
                        in romantic comedies often watch other 
                        romantic comedies. So if we’re actually 
                        in one, then this is-

                                 AMELIA
                        Ruth, Where did you go when we were at 
                        the video store?

                                 RUTH
                        I told you, I had to pee. I drank like 
                        two pitchers of Kool-Aid at Mindy’s.
                                 AMELIA
                        Nice try. But we don’t pee anymore. I’m 
                        not even sure where my bathroom is. I 
                        haven’t seen it in days. 

           Ruth is busted. 

                                 RUTH
                        Uh-

                                 AMELIA
                        I saw you put your phone back in your 
                        pocket. Who were you calling? 

                                 RUTH
                        Nobody. My dad. Whatever. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Let me see your phone then. 

           Mindy and Reid look at Ruth expectantly. Ruth folds her arms. 

                                 RUTH
                        Fine. If you let me see your notebook.

           Amelia pulls her notebook to her chest. Mindy and Reid look 
           at Amelia expectantly. What’s going on? 

           Suddenly, Amelia and Ruth LUNGE at each other. Amelia grabs 
           Ruth’s cell phone. Ruth snatches Amelia’s notebook. 

                                 AMELIA
                        You’ve been texting him! A lot!

                                 RUTH
                        Well at least I’m not lame-o writing my 
                        name with his last name in my notebook 
                        like a seventh grader! 

           Ruth holds up the evidence. Along with love doodles, “Amelia 
           Gordon” is written and rewritten. Amelia has taken no notes. 
           In retaliation, Amelia presses a button on Ruth’s phone. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Her ring tone for him-

           Salt-N-Pepa’s “Whatta Man Whatta Man” plays. Mindy lip syncs.

                                 RUTH
                        I thought you said changing your last 
                        name was a patriarchal construct? 
                                 AMELIA
                        It is! This isn’t me!

                                 RUTH
                        Well this isn’t me, either!

                                 REID
                        Oh my god, don’t fight! 

                                 MINDY
                        Everybody sit down and shut up. 

           Amelia and Ruth make a silent truce. Sit down. 

                                 MINDY (CONT’D)
                        Look, you said y’all was self-aware 
                        right? Y’all still got free will-

                                 AMELIA
                        Yeah, but we’re losing it. Skip and Chad 
                        aren’t even here and we can’t stop 
                        thinking about them.  

                                 MINDY
                        That’s why you got to act quick. Because 
                        there a ticking clock on your free will.  

           Mindy points to the screen. At Julia Roberts. 

                                 MINDY (CONT’D)
                        See that? You gotta be the anti-that. 

                                 RUTH
                        The anti-Julia Roberts? 

                                 MINDY
                        The anti-Julia, the anti-Meg, the anti-
                        Sandra, the anti-Drew- The worst romantic 
                        comedy characters-

                                 REID
                        -ever. 

                                 MINDY
                        Gotta scare the boys outta love with you.  

                                 AMELIA
                        But to do that we’d have to see them. 
                        It’s too risky.  We lose control just 
                        looking into their eyes. 

                                 MINDY
                        Well then don’t look in they eyes! Damn!
                                 RUTH
                        We’re can’t get out of this staying home.

                                 AMELIA
                        Yeah but-

                                 RUTH
                        Oh! Skip was just texting me about their 
                        house in the Hamptons. We could go there 
                        with them this weekend, play a little 
                        anti-Julia and be done by Sunday.

                                 MINDY
                        That’s good. Straight into the fire, no 
                        distractions, no interruptions. 

           Amelia looks around. Is she the only one not on board?

                                 RUTH
                        This would be no problem for the old 
                        Amelia. 

                                 AMELIA
                        That’s not fair. I am the old Amelia. 

                                 RUTH
                        So prove it. Let’s do this. Team Awesome. 
                        We’ve spent our whole lives being unlike 
                        Julia Roberts. It’ll be cake. 

           Amelia looks at her three friends. All depending on her. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Okay. 

                                 REID
                        Hello! Jealous! I love the Hamptons!

                                 AMELIA AND RUTH AND MINDY
                        No, you don't.

           EXT. VACATION HOUSE - HAMPTONS - DAY

           A BLACK MERCEDES pulls up to a gorgeous mansion on the water. 
           A musical flourish crescendos as it approaches. 

                                 AMELIA (O.S.)
                        Does anyone else hear a crescendo?

                                 CHAD (O.S.)
                        You've got to get those ears checked, 
                        Mel. Maybe you have tinnitus, like us.
                                 SKIP (O.S.)
                        The price you pay for front row at Dave 
                        Matthews. 

           Ruth gets out of the car with a shudder. She turns her 
           attention to the glorious house.

                                 RUTH
                        Whoa. Advertising pays well, huh Chad?

                                 CHAD
                        It does, but actually our parents left 
                        the house to us. 

                                 SKIP
                        They died in a horrible accident when we 
                        were kids. 

                                 CHAD
                        We don't really talk about it. 

           Amelia shoots a desperate look at Ruth, but Ruth is still 
           taking in the house. 

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Ruth enters a gorgeous bay-windowed master bedroom. Tosses 
           her suitcase on the bed. 

                                 RUTH
                        Well this is where I'll be. 

           Skip starts to follow. But Amelia squeezes through the 
           doorway in front of him. Tosses her suitcase down as well. 

           Skip, Chad, and Ruth's faces fall a little. Amelia grabs 
           Ruth's hand and beams at the guys. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Better start unpacking!

           The guys move on. Amelia shuts the door. 

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        A little help?

                                 RUTH
                        Sorry. I didn't know we were doing summer 
                        camp sleeping arrangements. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Are you with me on this, or not?
                                 RUTH
                        Hey, I practically came up with this 
                        plan. I'm with you. I swear. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Because? 

                                 RUTH
                        Because this is not real and we don’t 
                        want to disappear. We want to live in 
                        reality, even if it means we live the 
                        rest of our lives alone together in a big 
                        house with sixty cats, scaring 
                        neighborhood children. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Especially if it means that. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Arcs of orange juice and champagne fill a fluted glass. Two 
           stalks of celery are planted in a pair of Bloody Marys. 
           Amelia and Ruth descend the stairs. Skip and Chad hand them 
           cocktails. The ladies avoid any eye contact with the guys. 

                                 CHAD
                        I had a feeling you were a Mimosa lady.

                                 SKIP
                        -and you were the Bloody Mary type. 

                                 RUTH
                        That's so weird, those are our favorite--

                                 AMELIA
                        Actually, we were thinking of doing some 
                        coke. 

           Everyone stops, stares at Amelia. Amelia kicks Ruth. 

                                 RUTH
                        Right. Coke. We love doing us some 
                        cocaine. Want some?

           Skip and Chad look at one another. Unsure of how to respond.

                                 SKIP
                        I get tummy aches pretty easily-

                                 CHAD
                        Well, uh, I guess we are in the Hamptons. 
                        Skip’s a musician, I make a lot of money, 
                        I’m sure we’ll be like fish to water. 
           Shit. Amelia tries to think on her feet. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I’m sorry. Did I say coke? 

                                 RUTH
                        She didn’t mean coke. I mean c’mon, what 
                        is this, the White House? She meant, uh-

                         AMELIA
                                                          RUTH
           Crack.
                                             Meth. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Uh, Crack Meth is a very affordable 
                        alternative to cocaine. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Whipped up a fresh batch just yesterday-

           Skip and Chad look seriously worried now. But Chad's 
           expression suddenly changes. 

                                 CHAD
                        You two are amazing. You’re successful, 
                        funny, you look beautiful all the time, 
                        AND can smoke crack meth without it 
                        affecting your lives negatively at all.

                                 AMELIA
                        Um, thanks?

                                 SKIP
                        Yeah. I’m impressed. I would never have 
                        known you guys do- crack meth. 

                                 RUTH
                        Oh, well yeah, we do!

                                 AMELIA
                        But you know, we can do it later. We're 
                        not fiends or anything. 

                                 RUTH
                        Anymore. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Right.

           Awkward silence. 

                                 RUTH
                        So what did you guys wanna do?
                                 SKIP
                        Uh, well- I was thinking we could listen 
                        to some of mom and dad's old records in 
                        the basement. 

                                 CHAD
                        And I was hoping Mel, that you and I 
                        could go for a walk on the beach. 

           Amelia FARTS LOUDLY in desperation. Skip and Chad stop cold. 
           Amelia nudges Ruth. Ruth rolls her eyes, FARTS ON CUE. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Whoops!

           Skip and Chad are still frozen. Then- They LAUGH. 

                                 SKIP
                        You’re the most awesome girlfriends EVER!

                                 CHAD
                        Seriously!

                                 AMELIA
                        Girlfriends?

           Ruth hides a secret smile. Amelia yanks Ruth aside. 

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        This is not working. 

                                 RUTH
                        I have to be alone with him. 

                                 AMELIA
                        What!?

                                 RUTH
                        We have to divide and conquer. Look at 
                        them, they're just falling MORE in love 
                        with us. We have to get them alone. We 
                        have to go deeper. 

                                 AMELIA
                        That’s a terrible idea!

                                 RUTH
                        We'll just have to be extra careful. 
                        Don't worry, you're good at careful. 

                                 AMELIA
                        What's that supposed to mean?
                                 RUTH
                        I trust you. Do you trust me? 

           Amelia doesn’t answer. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Amelia. Do you trust me? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Yes. Okay. I trust you.  

                                 RUTH
                           (to Skip)
                        So your dead parents' records-- in the 
                        basement, you said?

           Skip grins. Amelia recommits to her role. 

                                 CHAD
                        Does that mean you're ready for the 
                        beach, Mel?

                                 AMELIA
                        Yeah-- just let me go upstairs and get my 
                        strap-on. Just in case you wanna try 
                        something new while we're there!

           Chad's face: total horror. 

           INT. BASEMENT - DUSK

           An Elvis album spins on the record player. Skip sits on the 
           floor. Plays guitar and sings along with Elvis. Ruth avoids 
           his eyes. Cringes at his vocal stylings. 

                                 SKIP
                        I can't help falling in love with you. 

                                 RUTH
                        Skip?

                                 SKIP
                        Yeah?

                                 RUTH
                        You don't actually believe in the whole 
                        "one true love" thing, do you?
                                 SKIP
                        Pssh. I always figured if there were a 
                        perfect match for me she’d probably be at 
                        home watching cartoons and eating lucky 
                        charms on Saturday night like I was. One 
                        of those catch-22 situations. But now...

                                 RUTH
                        Now?

                                 SKIP
                        I guess I'd say that whole “one true 
                        love” thing. It’s seeming a little bit 
                        more plausible. 

                                 RUTH
                        Does it feel-- real to you?

                                 SKIP
                        No. It feels unreal. But it feels right. 

           Skip locks eyes with Ruth. Her eyes start to glaze over as 
           the song changes... 

                                 ELVIS RECORD (V.O.)
                        You look like an angel
                        Walk like an angel-

                                 SKIP
                        Does it feel right to you? 

                                 ELVIS RECORD (V.O.)
                        But I got wiiiise-

           Ruth nods. Skip and Ruth KISS. The Elvis song speeds up-

                                 ELVIS RECORD (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        You're the Devil in disguise! Oh yes you 
                        are!-

           Ruth's eyes pop open. She breaks away from Skip, panicked. 
           Covering her eyes so she won’t look at him. 

                                 RUTH
                        Want to hear a good dirty joke? Racist 
                        joke? Dirty racist joke?

           EXT. BEACH - DUSK

           Amelia and Chad walk along the beach, shoes in their hands. 
                                 AMELIA
                        So then I told him "no I do NOT care if 
                        it means you'll have to euthanize all 
                        these puppies." Ultimately he couldn't do 
                        it, so I just had to do it myself. I 
                        mean, it's not that hard, guy. Just toss 
                        them in the chamber and flip the switch!
                           (beat)
                        Anyway, weird tangent. So what's your 
                        dog's name?

           Chad looks disturbed. They walk in silence for a moment, 
           Amelia smiling to herself. 

                                 CHAD
                        You must be really crazy about me. 

                                 AMELIA
                        What? 

                                 CHAD
                        To push me away so hard. But don't worry, 
                        I'll wait it out. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Okay. Get over yourself. You’re not my 
                        type and you’re probably not even real-
                           (catches herself)
                        Not even really that good looking. 

                                 CHAD
                        We both know that's not true. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Ugh. Did I mention narcissistic, self-
                        absorbed-

                                 CHAD
                        Those are synonyms. 

                                 AMELIA
                        It bears repeating. 

                                 CHAD
                        I love you. 

           Amelia just shakes her head, turns back to the house. But she 
           can’t go. Chad is tightly gripping her arm. Sparse drops of 
           rain fall. 
                                 AMELIA
                        Hey. Cut out the Rhett Butler crap. 
                        There's no marital rape staircase to 
                        carry me up around here. 

                                 CHAD
                        I love you. 

           THUNDER BOOMS. A few second of silence. Then: The RAIN POURS. 
           Chad and Amelia do not move. They shout over the storm. 

                                 CHAD (CONT’D)
                        I'm in love with you and, for the record, 
                        you're not my type either! You're a know-
                        it-all and you fart like a frat boy and 
                        kill puppies and use crack meth and I 
                        don’t know what’s happening to me. But 
                        this is how the proverbial cookie 
                        crumbled, so let's deal with it! 

                                 AMELIA
                        What do you want me to say? “I love you. 
                        Oh how I’ve waited for this?” Please. 

           Chad brings Amelia in close. She avoids his eyes. 

                                 CHAD
                        Look at me, Mel- Amelia. 

           Amelia trembles. She desperately wants to give in to this 
           moment.  They’re both soaked. She won’t look at him. 

                                 CHAD (CONT’D)
                        What are you afraid of? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Disappearing. 

                                 CHAD
                        That’s ridiculous. 

                                 AMELIA
                        It’s not. Trust me. 

           Amelia suddenly notices the pouring rain. 

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        It’s raining. 

                                 CHAD
                        I didn’t notice. 
                                 AMELIA
                        Well you should have.

           Amelia drags Chad under a tall lifeguard chair for shelter. 

                                 CHAD
                        Why are you so angry? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Because this is stupid! People should 
                        have enough common sense to come in from 
                        the rain. 

                                 CHAD
                        You’re far too attached to common sense. 

                                 AMELIA
                        What is it with the “I love you” anyway?  
                        Why does that have to be the seminal 
                        moment? Why does everyone need to hear 
                        those words to be happy? 

                                 CHAD
                        I don’t. Actually. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Oh really? 

                                 CHAD
                        Yeah, really. I thought you were smart 
                        enough to know.  

                                 AMELIA
                        Know what? 

                                 CHAD
                        That it’s much better to love than be 
                        loved. 

           They stay still for a moment. Chad pulls her out from 
           underneath the lifeguard chair, back into the open rain. He 
           tilts her chin. She doesn’t resist. She looks into his eyes.

           And they kiss. 

           ORCHESTRAL MUSIC CRESCENDOS. The camera moves around them in 
           a smooth 360 degree motion. The kiss doesn't end. Lightning 
           cracks the sky above the water's horizon. 

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Ruth, worried, stands outside the bathroom door. From inside, 
           she hears the sound of Skip RETCHING. 
                                 RUTH
                        Skip, are you okay!?

                                 SKIP (O.S.)
                        Yeah. I'm fine!

           He exits the bathroom, wiping his mouth with his sleeve. 

                                 RUTH
                        I'm so sorry. 

                                 SKIP
                        Yeah, I guess I just didn't know the joke 
                        was going to be that dirty. Or racist. 
                        That was...wow. 

                                 RUTH
                        This is stupid. Amelia’s wrong about you. 

                                 SKIP
                        What? Amelia doesn’t like me? 

                                 RUTH
                        Amelia looks so much before she leaps 
                        that she never leaps. 

                                 SKIP
                        Huh? 

           Ruth pulls close to Skip. The twinkling notes of Coldplay 
           begin. Skip wipes his mouth again. You know, just in case. 

           Good thing he did, because Ruth POUNCES on him. They kiss 
           hard. Coldplay BLARES. A quick FADE TO BLACK. 

           EXT. BEACH - SUNSET 

           The ORCHESTRAL MUSIC is still in its full glory. The "camera" 
           still circling around Amelia and Chad. Amelia pulls away. The 
           "camera" stops circling. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I'm getting dizzy. Are you dizzy?

           Chad puts a quieting finger to her mouth. Pulls her back in. 
           The spinning recommences. The orchestral music rises.

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Ruth and Skip lay on the floor. Smoking cigarettes. 
                                 RUTH
                        I guess this is the only time we’re 
                        allowed to smoke, huh?

                                 SKIP
                        Huh? Hey, will you finally let me play a 
                        song for you? I’ve been working on one I 
                        want you to hear. But you have to let me 
                        play the whole song. It’s important. 

           Ruth looks pained, but she nods anyway. Skip starts to play a 
           truly awful song (with no choruses), his eyes closed in 
           angsty passion. It’s all very coffee house open mic night. 
           Ruth grins, bears it.  

                                 SKIP (CONT’D)
                        I opened a book
                        called the Book of Ruth
                        It was kind of short
                        but it was full of truth.
                        And it opened my eyes, 
                        I’m not myself anymore.
                        I grew up reading that book
                        And it opened the door-

           FROM ANOTHER ANGLE - We see that a diamond ring is taped onto 
           the back of Skip’s guitar. 

           EXT. BEACH - SUNSET 

           Amelia and Chad are still kissing, with the camera circling. 
           But Amelia is now stumbling from the dizziness. 

           She pushes Chad away. Looks at him. Her hair blows in the 
           wind in slow motion as her face transforms from peaceful to 
           panicked. She pitches forward...

           And HEAVES. Vomiting. And vomiting. And vomiting. Chad puts a 
           hand on her back for comfort, but she pushes it off. Stands.

                                 AMELIA
                        This is not real! You are not real. You 
                        are not a pipe. You just look like a 
                        pipe. But you are not a pipe. You are a 
                        noose. And so is-

           Amelia looks back at the house. It’s quite far off in 
           distance. A light from the basement. Amelia HAULS ASS. 

           EXT. VACATION HOUSE - HAMPTONS - EVENING

           Amelia, sopping wet, races up to the front door. Locked. She 
           looks behind her. Chad is on her tail. 
                                 CHAD
                        Mel!

           Amelia picks up a lion statuette from the front walk. BASHES 
           in the window next to the door. She reaches through and 
           unlocks the door. Slips inside. 

                                 CHAD (CONT’D)
                        I had a key!

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Amelia rushes into the doorway, takes in the bizarre scene. 
           Chad runs in behind her. Skip is finishing his song. He’s 
           seriously jamming now. 

                                 SKIP
                        The door to love! The door to life!
                        The door to happiness!
                        The door to the rest of our lives,
                        The door to no regrets-

           Amelia runs down to Ruth, tries to wrench her out of her 
           position on the floor. But Ruth doesn’t acknowledge her. Skip 
           takes the song back to a soft, gentle place.

                                 SKIP (CONT’D)
                        And now I need that book-
                        for the rest of my life
                        And so I have to ask you, Rudi-

           Skip removes the diamond ring from the back of the guitar. 
           Gets down on one knee. 

                                 SKIP (CONT’D)
                        Rudi, will you be my wife? 

                                 AMELIA
                        No! Ruth! Let’s go-

           Ruth looks at Amelia: soaking wet and desperate. Then at 
           Skip. He shifts nervously, still holding out the diamond 
           ring. He’s adorable. 

           Ruth looks down at the floor. Takes a breath...and gazes 
           straight into Skip’s approachably adorable, twinkling eyes. 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Amelia packs both of their suitcases. Frantic. Ruth sits on 
           the bed, admires her ring. Blissful.
                                 AMELIA
                        Yes!?

                                 RUTH
                        No- it's not what you think. You think 
                        that all of this isn't real. But actually 
                        it is real. And I know it's real, because 
                        it doesn't feel real.

                                 AMELIA
                        Ruth, it's not a pipe!

                                 RUTH
                        Will you shut up about the pipe? 

                                 AMELIA
                        It's artificial. This isn’t love. This 
                        isn’t you. This is suicide!

           Ruth stares off dreamily.

                                 RUTH
                        Sorry, what were you talking about? 

                                 AMELIA
                        I-- WE are talking about "The End.” I 
                        know it’s hard to resist, but Ruth, those 
                        people on the posters- they’re all gone. 
                        And you’re next. 

                                 RUTH
                        You're just trying to scare me. Are we 
                        getting into your irrational fear of 
                        death now?

                                 AMELIA
                        Okay, it's not irrational to be afraid of 
                        something that's definitely going to 
                        happen. But that's beside the point. 

                                 RUTH
                        What was the point? 

                                 AMELIA
                        The point is we had a plan. And now, 
                        because you're doing your usual woman-
                        child impulsive joie-de-vivre crap, we're-
                        we're fecked.

           Ruth stands up. Gets in Amelia's face. 
                                 RUTH
                        And because you are doing your usual 
                        condescending, risk-averse, repressed 
                        crap, you're going to be miserable for as 
                        long as you live. 

           Ruth grabs her suitcase away from Amelia. Dumps the contents 
           out on the bed. Heads for the door. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Well at least I’m going to be alive. 

                                 RUTH
                        Oh, who cares anymore? 

                                 AMELIA
                        What? How can you just let yourself just 
                        be snuffed out of existence? 

                                 RUTH
                        He's my soulmate.

                                 AMELIA
                        He's an illusion. 

           Ruth gets up to make a dramatic silent exit but she 
           accidentally steps into a trash can. It’s stuck. She tries to 
           shake it off. But it won’t budge. Amelia shoots her an “I 
           told you so” look but Ruth isn’t having it. She heads out the 
           door clumping along with her foot still in the trash can. 

           INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT

           Amelia, suitcase in hand, tails Ruth and her trashcan-shoe 
           down the grand staircase. Clump. Clump. Clump.

                                 AMELIA
                        Look at yourself. It’s only going to get 
                        worse. 

                                 RUTH
                        I don't know why you're acting like this. 
                        You're the one always slamming me for not 
                        being able to commit-

                                 AMELIA
                        To a sexual orientation! To a political 
                        party! To a point of view on Radiohead’s 
                        last album. 

                                 RUTH
                        That album is trash. 
                                 AMELIA
                        Then why did we have to listen to it on a 
                        loop for a month? 

                                 RUTH
                        I changed my mind!

                                 AMELIA
                        You have no idea what you want and you 
                        think marrying that is gonna give you 
                        some clue? Even if you don’t die or 
                        disappear or whatever, that guy is a one-
                        way ticket to lameville.

                                 RUTH
                        All aboard!

           Ruth dials her cell phone as she reaches the bottom of the 
           stairs. She props her leg up on the kitchen island and grabs 
           a wooden spoon to crow bar the trash can off. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I'm leaving. And I’m not coming back to 
                        save you. 

                                 RUTH
                        Thanks. 
                           (on phone)
                        Mom? Hi! Guess what? I'm getting married! 
                        -- I know!

           POP! The trash can comes off. Amelia storms off. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Ruth gives Skip a peck on the cheek. He's also on his cell 
           phone, sharing the news. Amelia heads for the door. Chad 
           steps in her path. 

                                 CHAD
                        Hi. Can we talk?

                                 AMELIA
                        Um, okay. It's not me, it's you. And him. 
                        And her. Well, it's over. 

                                 CHAD
                        What!?

                                 AMELIA
                        Yeah, never wanna see you again. 
                                 CHAD
                        I just told you I loved you!

                                 AMELIA
                        I’m glad you got that out of your system. 

           Amelia pushes him aside. Walks out of the house. 

           EXT. VACATION HOUSE - HAMPTONS - LATE NIGHT

           A taxi pulls up just as Amelia reaches the curb. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Convenient timing. 

                                 CHAD
                        You're in denial. We're meant-

                                 AMELIA
                        -to be together. We finish each other's 
                        sentences we both like chocolate ice 
                        cream and even though there are 6 billion 
                        people in the world it just so happens 
                        that you and I, who live on the same 
                        small pinpoint of the universe, happen to 
                        be fated to be together. Is that right?

                                 CHAD
                        It could be. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Chad. You can't believe in something just 
                        because it would be nice if it were true.

           INT. CAB - LATE NIGHT

           Amelia leans her head against the back seat. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Wide shot. Sappy music. Fade out.

           EXT. VACATION HOUSE - HAMPTONS - EVENING

           A wide shot. The taxi pulls away. Sappy music commences. Chad 
           watches the cab disappear down the street. FADE OUT. 

           EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Amelia looks like hell. Exhausted, she stares vacantly at a 
           massive WALL OF MISSING PERSONS POSTERS. It dwarves her. 

           Then Amelia sees something out of the corner of her eye. It’s 
           The Woman in the Blue Sweater. Amelia grabs the Woman’s arm.
                                 AMELIA
                        Excuse me, do I know you? 

           The Woman shrinks back, frightened and tight-lipped. She 
           shakes her head and hustles off. 

           INT. AMELIA’S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

           Amelia enters her apartment to find Reid and Mindy watching 
           “Big Momma’s House 2” on BET. They’re hyperventilating with 
           laughter. Xena eats popcorn from a blinged out doggy bowl. 

                                 MINDY
                        Oh, there he go again! 

                                 REID
                        Don’t worry. Big Momma got this!

           The two realize Amelia is in the room. 

                                 REID (CONT’D)
                        Hey, why are you back? And whatever 
                        happened to Baby Ruth? 

                                 AMELIA
                        It didn't work. We were disgusting, we 
                        farted, we talked about drugs. And they 
                        just fell more in love with us. 

                                 REID
                        Well I s’pose you have to consider movies 
                        like There's Something About Mary, 
                        American Pie-- These days being gross 
                        could just make you more endearing. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Ruth and Skip are getting married. 

           Reid and Mindy gasp in tandem. 

                                 REID
                        And I haven’t got a stitch to wear! 

                                 MINDY
                        You dummy! Ruth get married, she gonna 
                        disappear. 

                                 REID
                        Right. Sucks, but-

                                 MINDY
                        We Ruth and Amelia’s token friends. Two 
                        of them, two of us. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MINDY (CONT'D)
                        Ruth disappear and one of us probably 
                        going down too. You wanna play them odds? 

                                 REID
                        But there aren’t posters for missing 
                        people like us-

                                 MINDY
                        Yeah. And NYPD wouldn’t let no one report 
                        me missing when they thought I was gone. 
                        You think that was a coincidence? And you 
                        think your kind gonna do any better? 

                                 REID
                        Then- then- Team Amelia!

                                 MINDY
                        And what if she go too? 

                                 REID
                        Can we put in for transfers? 

                                 MINDY
                        You know these white people gonna keep 
                        dropping like flies! Till the whole world 
                        gone! Not with a bang but with some white 
                        people’s weddings! 

                                 REID
                        Let’s not to jump to confusions here-

           Amelia eyes Reid. He fidgets nervously. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Why are you down-playing this so 
                        passionately?

           Reid goes quiet for a second. Amelia waits for an answer. 

                                 REID
                        I’m just so happy!

                                 AMELIA
                        Ah jeez. 

                                 REID
                        I am, Amelia. I’ve never been so happy in 
                        my whole life. It’s like the whole world 
                        has jazz hands and now I’ve got Xena 
                        Warrior Princess and- well I don’t mind 
                        telling you I’ve been thinking of 
                        adopting a little Cambodian girl and 
                        naming her Lulu. 
                                 AMELIA
                        Reid, this isn’t you talking. You loathe 
                        children and animals-

                                 REID
                        Miss Bedelia, I’m going to be blunt. I 
                        don’t think there’s a way out. I think 
                        Ruth has got the right idea. Romeo and 
                        Juliet met on Sunday and were dead by 
                        Thursday but it was a pretty darned good 
                        run while it lasted. 

                                 MINDY
                        Oooh he crazy! Girl, don’t listen to him-

                                 AMELIA
                        Okay, Mindy? Could you just not talk for 
                        a minute? That voice-

           Mindy clenches her jaw. Turns to Amelia. 

                                 MINDY
                        Well excuse me for living, the graveyard 
                        was full! You think I want to talk like 
                        this? You think it’s fair that you and 
                        Ruth and mid-life-crisis Lance Bass over 
                        here are programmed for happiness while I 
                        get turned into cries-real-tears Wanda 
                        Sykes? It ain’t! I was happy before! And 
                        for the record Wanda Sykes is very 
                        talented and could probably carry a film 
                        on her own if someone would let her!

           Mindy starts to SOB. Reid puts his arm around her. 

                                 REID
                        Wanda was the only good part of Monster-
                        in-Law. She really was. 

                                 MINDY
                        I miss my husband. But I can’t go back. 
                        This is so embarrassing. Post-nuptial 
                        depression. It sound just like one of 
                        them made-up white people diseases. 

           Amelia sits down on the other side of Mindy. 

                                 AMELIA
                        We’re all a little emotional. Let’s get 
                        some sleep. We’ll figure out what to do 
                        tomorrow morning. 

           Mindy comes out of her sobs with a few sniffles. 
                                 MINDY
                        But what if Ruth and Skip get married at 
                        City Hall or something before then?  

                                 REID
                        No way. Romantic comedies do not have 
                        City Hall weddings. Except for The 
                        Wedding Planner. Oh wait, Mr. McConaughey 
                        stopped that one at the last minute. Rule 
                        stands. No City Hall weddings.

           EXT. CITY HALL - MORNING

           Ruth and Skip climb the steps up to City Hall. Hand in hand.

           INT. AMELIA’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Amelia collapses into her breakfast nook with a cup of 
           coffee. She goes to sip it. Then stops. Frustrated. 

                                 AMELIA
                        There is nothing in this cup. 

           She looks out the window. But she’s totally unprepared for 
           what she sees. Her eyes widen with horror...Reid runs in.

                                 REID
                        Amelia! I just remembered! There is a 
                        City Hall wedding in a romantic comedy! 
                        In Sex and the City! How could I be so- 

           Reid follows Amelia’s gaze out the window. 

                                 REID (CONT’D)
                        Uh oh-sies.  

           INT. CITY HALL - CLERK’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Ruth and Skip wait behind other happy COUPLES. One couple is 
           in full bride and groom dress. 

                                 RUTH
                        Why can’t we just get it done here? 

                                 SKIP
                        Because we’re just here to get the 
                        license. C’mon, you’re not even wearing a 
                        wedding dress. And our parents aren’t 
                        here. Now I’ve only seen these things on 
                        my grandma’s daytime stories, but I think 
                        there’s some definite protocol. Flowers, 
                        tuxedoes, jordan almonds...
                                 RUTH
                        I hate those. 

                                 SKIP
                        Do you really love me so much that you 
                        can’t wait a measly couple of days for 
                        your dream wedding? 

           A DESPERATE WOMAN comes in the room. A stack of flyers in 
           hand. She holds one in front of Ruth’s face. It’s another 
           Missing Person’s Notice. Another young couple. A CITY 
           EMPLOYEE immediately hops up from behind her desk. 

                                 DESPERATE WOMAN
                        My daughter. She was last seen here with 
                        this man. Please, if you see her-

                                 CITY EMPLOYEE
                        We told you you’re not allowed in here.

           The Desperate Woman makes eye contact with Ruth. Shouting:

                                 DESPERATE WOMAN
                        I don’t know who this man is! He has no 
                        employment record. I couldn’t find out 
                        anything about him! It’s like he doesn’t 
                        exist. I have to find my daughter!

           Ruth looks away. The City Employee SLAMS the door shut. She 
           turns to Ruth. A smile spreads across her face. 

                                 CITY EMPLOYEE
                        Okay, you’re next! 

           EXT. AMELIA’S BALCONY - MORNING

           Amelia, Reid, and Mindy all stand on Amelia’s balcony. 

           ACROSS THE STREET

           A WORKER finishes plastering the last corner of a billboard. 
           The Billboard is composed to look like Amelia's pipe 
           painting. But instead of a pipe, in the center is a painting 
           of a cracked and broken heart. Underneath, the text: Mel, 
           This is not my heart. This is just how it feels. - Chad

           In the distance, more of the same billboard can be seen going 
           up all over the city. 

                                 REID
                        It's just like that weird painting of a 
                        pipe you have over your bed. 
                                 AMELIA
                        It's not a pipe!

                                 REID
                        I didn’t know you had a balcony.

                                 AMELIA
                        I don’t. Reid, what is this? 

                                 REID
                        The grand gesture. 

                                 MINDY
                        The what? 

                                 REID
                        To recap. Romantic comedy classic: Boy 
                        meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy gets sad. 
                        Boy makes grand gesture. Boy gets girl 
                        back. Happily Ever After. 

                                 AMELIA
                        What if the grand gesture doesn’t work? 

                                 REID
                        It always works. 

           The three hear MUSIC. Kelly Clarkson’s “A Moment Like This” 
           to be specific. They look down. The Slow Motion starts...

           ON THE STREET

           Chad stands below them, an iPod nestled in a small speaker 
           dock, held above his head a la Lloyd Dobler.

           ON THE BALCONY

           Amelia’s hair blows in the wind. She’s radiant. Frustrated. 
           Back to real time, Amelia shields her eyes. Turns away.

                                 AMELIA
                        I can’t take the slow motion anymore! 
                        Every time I see him!

                                 REID
                        Correction. Every time he sees you. It’s 
                        the male gaze. 

                                 MINDY
                        Why you talking about homosexuals? This 
                        is important!
                                 REID
                        G-A-Z-E. The male gaze. It’s a 
                        cornerstone of feminist film theory. A 
                        pretty woman appears on screen and 
                        everything slows down so the viewer is 
                        forced into being dominant and male. It’s 
                        visual objectification. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Ugh, really? Gross!

           INTERCUT AMELIA IN WINDOW/CHAD ON SIDEWALK

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        Go away!

                                 CHAD
                        I can’t! I wish I could! So do many of 
                        New York’s eligible bachelorettes. I’m 
                        kind of a catch, if you haven’t noticed!

                                 AMELIA
                        You realize this is stalking?! I’m 
                        getting a restraining order!

                                 CHAD
                        Let me know what time court is!

           Amelia laughs, despite herself. Mindy shoots her a look. 
           Amelia chokes out her next words. Unconvincingly.   

                                 AMELIA
                        I- I’m- I am not in love with you!

                                 CHAD
                        I don’t believe you! I’m just gonna stay 
                        down here until you’re ready to say it!

           PASSERSBY start to gather on the sidewalk around Chad. 
           Familiar faces - the Jogger, the Happy Hot Dog Vendor, the 
           Police Man, etc. A NEWS VAN rolls up. 

           INT. WEDDING PLANNER’S OFFICE - LOBBY - DAY 

           Ruth and Skip meet with the Wedding Planner from Mindy’s 
           wedding. Ruth is uncomfortable. 

                                 SKIP
                        As soon as possible. Whatever she wants. 
                        Sky's the limit. 
                                 WEDDING PLANNER
                        I’m thinking Four Seasons for the 
                        reception and St. Patrick’s Cathedral for 
                        the ceremony. This Saturday okay?

                                 SKIP
                        Yeah, that’d be awesome! 

                                 RUTH
                        Wait! We can’t afford this. You’re 
                        unemployed and I work in radio. 

                                 SKIP
                        It’s cool honey. I got a job at Borders. 
                        Well, I have to get a social security 
                        number or something like that, but then 
                        I’m totally in. After a trial period. 

                                 WEDDING PLANNER
                        Wonderful. Okay Ruth, let's talk about 
                        your dream wedding. 

                                 RUTH
                        I've never thought about it. 

                                 WEDDING PLANNER
                        Never thought about your own wedding? 
                        Flowers? Surely the dress? 

                                 RUTH
                        Hey, what about Skip’s dream wedding? 

           The Wedding Planner and Skip laugh heartily at the thought. 

                                 WEDDING PLANNER
                        Oh, funny. Where were we? Oh yes, how 
                        about your wedding colors, dear?

           Ruth looks like she's going to vomit. She steals a glance at 
           Skip and catches his eyes. Again, she looks deep into those 
           twinkling beauties. Ruth calms herself. This is right. 

                                 RUTH
                        I guess I like green? 

           The Planner hauls out a GIANT SWATCH BOOK. She opens it up to 
           THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS of shades of green. Ruth shrinks into 
           her seat, like a trapped animal.

           EXT. AMELIA/RUTH’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Chad holds up his iPod “boom box.” The Kelly Clarkson song on 
           a loop. 
           He’s attracted a group of SUPPORTERS, all of whom wear t-
           shirts with his broken-hearted billboard art on them. They 
           hold signs reading “Take him back!” and “Love Conquers All. 
           Even you, Amelia.” 

           INT. AMELIA’S APARTMENT - DAY 

           Amelia and Mindy talk serious strategy. Reid buffs Xena’s 
           nails. The sounds of Kelly Clarkson waft through the window.

                                 AMELIA
                        We’ve got to get out of here. 

                                 MINDY
                        You right. We got to go out and bring 
                        that girl back cuz it’s clear she ain’t 
                        coming back on her own. 

                                 AMELIA
                        That wasn’t exactly what I was thinking-
                        Ruth made it very clear she doesn’t want 
                        to be saved. 

                                 MINDY
                        I give a damn what that girl think!

                                 REID
                        Yeah I don’t want to be saved either, F-T-
                        Record. And unlike some people, I still 
                        have to go to work. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Oh no. I haven’t been to work in days. 

                                 REID
                        And somehow you never run out of money. 
                        Poor you. So sad. I’m organizing a vigil- 

                                 MINDY
                        Shush up. Amelia- once we get outta here, 
                        where we gonna go? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Anywhere but here. This city is the 
                        romantic comedy mecca. We need to find a 
                        haven, hide out for a while-

                                 MINDY
                        But we don’t got time! Ruth getting 
                        married Saturday! Two days!

                                 AMELIA
                        How do you know that?
           Mindy gazes at the floor. Wishing she didn’t know. 

                                 MINDY
                        She texted. Asked me an’ frosted tips 
                        here to be her maids of honor. 

           Amelia wasn’t expecting that. 

                                 REID
                        I told you we shouldn’t tell her! Look, 
                        now you hurt her feelings!

                                 MINDY
                        She ain’t herself, girl. You know that.

           Amelia pulls herself together. 

                                 AMELIA
                        No. She’s entirely herself. She’s more 
                        herself than she’s ever been. 

                                 MINDY
                        You gonna let your best friend in the 
                        world just up and fade away? You ain’t 
                        gonna fight for her?  

                                 AMELIA
                        I fought. I’m done. You want to save 
                        yourselves, you guys can come with me. 

           Amelia grabs a duffel bag. Starts throwing things in. She 
           grabs Reid’s Hannah Montana hooded sweatshirt from a chair. 

                                 REID
                        Hey! That’s my fave!

           Mindy just shakes her head. 

                                 MINDY
                        I thought you was better than this. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Well I’m not. 

           Amelia takes the duffel bag. Leaves the apartment. 

                                 REID
                        Ooh! Hold the elevator! 

           Reid leaves too. The doors shuts behind them. Mindy stands 
           alone in the apartment. Pissed. 
                                 MINDY
                        Well this just gonna have to be the first 
                        movie where a black woman save the world. 

           EXT. AMELIA/RUTH’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 

           A NEWS REPORTER stands with Chad in front of a camera. 

                                 NEWS REPORTER
                        The mysterious “broken heart billboards” 
                        have everyone in the city talking. Now 
                        we’re with the very handsome man behind 
                        them - Chad Gordon. Chad, One of the 
                        things we all want to know is why her? 
                        She broke your heart. I repeat. Why her?

                                 CHAD
                        I don’t know. I just love her. I don’t 
                        question it. But then again, I don’t have 
                        enough sense to come in out of the rain. 

           ON THE CORNER - SEVERAL YARDS AWAY

           Amelia, incognito in the Hannah Montana hoodie, overhears 
           Chad’s interview. She’s fighting a serious urge here. It 
           takes all she has, but she forces herself to cross the 
           street. She hails a cab.

           INT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY

           RUTH'S MOTHER, an elegant woman in her 60s, sits in an 
           overstuffed chair. She speaks in an old southern accent. 

                                 RUTH'S MOTHER
                        Well hurry up, Ruth. My heart's fixing to 
                        burst out here. 

           Ruth steps out of a dressing room wearing a giant, poofy, 
           blindingly white ball gown. She’s miserable. 

                                 RUTH'S MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Ruthie! Now we’re cooking with gas! 
                        You’re prettier than a red wagon full of 
                        speckled pups. 

           An Employee lead Ruth to a pedestal framed by three mirrors. 

                                 RUTH
                        Do I have to? That thing makes me feel 
                        like a music box ballerina. 

                                 EMPLOYEE
                        You look like a princess!
                                 RUTH
                        Yeah, like Princess Sparkle Slut. Mom, I 
                        want to go.

                                 RUTH'S MOTHER
                        And people in hell want ice water. 
                        Goodness, you’re as restless as a junebug 
                        on a string! 

                                 RUTH
                        Mom, why are you talking like that!? You 
                        live outside of DC. You’re not southern!

                                 RUTH'S MOTHER
                        Virginia is south of the MDL, isn’t it? 

                                 RUTH
                        The MDL? The Mason-Dixon line? Seriously?

                                 RUTH'S MOTHER
                        Oh wait 'till the girls at church hear 
                        little Ruthie's gone back on her raisin. 

           Ruth stares at herself in the mirror. Conflicted. In the 
           reflection, she sees...Mindy. Standing outside. Ruth has 
           never been so glad to see anyone in her whole life. 

           EXT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY

           Ruth rushes out to meet her. Mindy can’t get a word in.

                                 RUTH
                        Mindy! You came! Does this mean you’ll be 
                        my maid of honor?! Come in, meet my 
                        mother. Or something like my mother. 

           INT. JOHN F. KENNEDY AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Amelia walks up to a ticket kiosk. All business. A friendly 
           AIRLINE EMPLOYEE grins back at her. 

                                 AIRLINE EMPLOYEE
                        Where to? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Do you have any flights to Sudan? Darfur? 

           The Airline Employee checks the computer. 

                                 AIRLINE EMPLOYEE
                        I’m sorry, we must not fly there. 
                                 AMELIA
                        Iraq? Afghanistan? Iran? 

                                 AIRLINE EMPLOYEE
                        Hm. Nope. Doesn’t seem so. 

           The Employee shakes her head. Neither. Amelia pulls out 
           stacks and stacks of $20 bills. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I have cash. I can get more from the ATM. 
                        It’s endless. 

                                 AIRLINE EMPLOYEE
                        Well we’ll be glad to take it once you 
                        settle on your destination. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Fresno? Antarctica? North Korea? 

                                 AIRLINE EMPLOYEE
                        My, so many places I’ve never heard of! 
                        You must be quite the traveler!

           INT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY

           Ruth looks at herself in the mirror. 

                                 RUTH
                        What do you think of this dress? It’s 
                        kind of stupid but it’s growing on me-

           Mindy grabs Ruth by the shoulders. Points at the mirror. 

                                 MINDY
                        Look at yourself, girl! You chasing the 
                        fairy tale! Just like I was. But you two 
                        was right. It is BS. Girl, if fairy tales 
                        was keepin’ it real they’d just end with 
                        “And they lived. Period.” And you may not 
                        get that. Now take off that fugly dress 
                        and let’s go get Amelia!

           Ruth walks right up to Mindy. Gets in her face. And then- She 
           STARTS TO SING. (R.E.M.’s “It’s the End of the World”)

                                 RUTH
                        That’s great it starts with an 
                        earthquake, birds and snakes, an 
                        aeroplane - Lenny Bruce is not afraid.

           Ruth’s mother and the shop’s EMPLOYEES start to sing too. The 
           group dances Mindy into a corner. 
                                 RUTH’S MOTHER AND EMPLOYEES
                        Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself 
                        churn - world serves its own needs, don’t 
                        misserve your own needs.-

           Mindy knocks Ruth aside, the fear of God in her. She sprints.

           EXT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY

           Mindy on her cell phone. Breathless. 

                                 MINDY
                        I don’t know. They singing. And there’s 
                        spontaneous choreography-

           INT. NYU - DAY

           Reid is outside his class, talking into his cell phone. 

                                 REID
                        Okay, what you’re seeing is a rom-com 
                        musical number. They’re gaining 
                        popularity.  13 Going on 30, My Best 
                        Friend’s Wedding, Enchanted--

           INT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY

           The Employees bourrée around Ruth, in concentric, Busby 
           Berkley style circles. Measuring tapes as props. 

                                 ALL
                        It's the end of the world as we know it! 

                                 RUTH
                        And I feel fine!

           EXT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY

           Mindy yells into her cell phone. 

                                 MINDY
                        What do you mean I have to just let it 
                        “play out?” I got to stop this!  

           Mindy huffs in disgust and hangs up. 

                                 MINDY (CONT’D)
                        I knew they wasn’t gonna let a black 
                        woman save the world! Damn! 

           Ruth, her Mother and the Employees dance out of the shop and 
           into the street. 
           NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS, PEDESTRIANS, and CAB DRIVERS join in, 
           singing and dancing. Mindy sits on the curb waits for it to 
           pass. 

           INT. JOHN F. KENNEDY AIRPORT - EVENING

           Amelia is still talking with the Employee. Exhausted and 
           frustrated. The Airline Employee still chipper. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Let’s try this. Where do you fly? 

                                 AIRLINE EMPLOYEE
                        We offer top-class accommodations to all 
                        of the world’s best destinations. Paris,

                        several lovely small southern towns and 
                        the occasional flight to Los Angeles.

                                 AMELIA
                        Fine. I’ll take Venice. It’s the 
                        furthest. Maybe it will sink soon. 

           Amelia hands the Employee her ID. The Employee hands it back.

                                 AIRLINE EMPLOYEE
                        I’m sorry, ma’am. This is fake. 

                                 AMELIA
                        What?

                                 AIRLINE EMPLOYEE
                        It’s fake. If I may be so bold, I don’t 
                        know who you think you’re fooling but I 
                        can see that you’re over twenty-nine 
                        years old. 

           Amelia stares at the ID. The DOB is twenty-nine years ago.

                                 AMELIA
                        So what you’re saying, is that I’m stuck?

                                 AIRLINE EMPLOYEE
                           (remaining cheery)
                        What I’m saying is that you should leave 
                        before I call security. 

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - FRONT - DUSK

           Chad stares at the window along with his Supporters. They’re 
           getting tired of holding vigil. And Kelly Clarkson.

                        Is she even still there? 
           Chad stares up at the window. There’s been no movement at the 
           darkened window. But he’s not ready to admit the truth. 

                                 CHAD
                        She’s there. She wouldn’t leave. 

           INT. NYU - CLASSROOM - EVENING

           Reid stands in front of his class. Dramatically silent. His 
           eager students wait with bated breath. And he speaks: 

                                 REID
                        This may be one of the hardest classes 
                        I’ll ever teach. Because today, today 
                        we’re talking about the low point. The 
                        Dark Night of the Soul. In this moment, 
                        where are our characters are furthest 
                        apart, even the heavens won’t be able to 
                        hold their tears-

           DARK NIGHT OF SOUL MONTAGE. CUE THE SLIT-YOUR-WRISTS MUSIC.

           -Amelia steps out of the airport. It starts to rain. 

                                 REID (V.O.)
                        Our lovers will find themselves in 
                        crowds, but they’ll feel so alone. 

           -Amelia walks the streets of New York in the rain, an 
           adorably clumsy stumble here and there. Alone in the crowd.

                                 REID (V.O) (CONT’D)
                        Hope will dwindle to nothing-

           -Chad’s supporters are packing up and leaving. Amelia’s 
           apartment window is dark. Chad lowers his iPod. Flips it off.

                                 REID (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And even the strongest will find 
                        themselves at a loss-

           -Mindy pushes aside the piles of mail and enters her condo. 
           All of Darren’s clothes are gone from the closet.  

                                 REID (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        People will try to return to how things 
                        used to be-

           -Ruth starts to dial Amelia’s number. But hangs up after one 
           ring. Skip enters with a bouquet of gaudy red roses with Gold 
           Lettering: “Skip & Ruth - True Love.” Ruth nods in approval. 
                                 REID (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Before realizing that nothing will ever 
                        be the same again. But the worst will be 
                        the memories of better times.

           INT. AMELIA/REID’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Reid enters the office holding Xena. He SHRIEKS. Amelia is 
           slumped over her desk. Not moving. 

                                 REID
                        O-M-G-O-M-G-O-M-G-

           Amelia snaps awake. Sits up, bleary-eyed. 

                                 REID (CONT’D)
                        O-M-G I thought you were dead. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I wish. I think I was dreaming in memory 
                        montages or something-

                                 REID
                        You’re a hot mess, girlfriend. What are 
                        you doing here? 

                                 AMELIA
                        I was afraid to go home. 

                                 REID
                        I mean “here” as in New York. 

                                 AMELIA
                        You were right. It can’t be fought. 

           Reid puts a consoling arm around her. 

                                 REID
                        When you give in to it, you’re supposed 
                        to be happy. Why aren’t you with Chad? 

                                 AMELIA
                        I don’t know. 

           Amelia turns her attention back to a painting propped up on a 
           bookshelf beside her desk. The Thomas Kinkade painting. 
                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        Last night, when everything seemed 
                        hopeless, all I could think of was this 
                        painting. Like it was calling me.  

                                 REID
                        What’s the verdict? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Well, it’s not so terrible. There’s no 
                        irony or commentary, but it’s comforting. 
                        Easy to look at. It just- it doesn’t look 
                        like a place I’d want to live. It looks 
                        like a place I’d want to die. 

                                 REID
                        Ew. Mademoiselle Morbid! Now I can’t even 
                        look at it without seeing a corpse lying 
                        on those cobble stones. 

           Amelia looks at the painting. Then she looks closer. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Reid. That’s it!

                                 REID
                        Excusles?  

                                 AMELIA
                        Reid. This painting wouldn’t be this 
                        painting if there were a corpse in it. It 
                        would be another painting. 

           Amelia is excited. She grabs her slide projector, plugs it in 
           and turns out the lights. 

                                 REID
                        I’m not following. 

           Amelia hurriedly flips through the slides until she gets to 
           one of a beautiful, fair woman on a sofa. Circa 1800.  

                                 AMELIA
                        Look. This is David’s “Madame Recamier.”

                                 REID
                        Get thee to the tanning beds, girlfriend!

           Amelia flips to the next slide. Everything in the painting is  
           identical except that in place of the woman is a coffin, bent 
           in the same pose as the woman. A Magritte painting. 
                                 REID (CONT’D)
                        Gracious! That’s disturbing!

                                 AMELIA
                        What it is is an assault on the expected. 
                        Like a corpse in a Thomas Kinkade 
                        painting. 

                                 REID
                        Now you’re just making me feel stupid. 

                                 AMELIA
                        The farting, the drug talk, the puppy 
                        euthanizing, those were just mustaches on 
                        the Mona Lisa. 

                                 REID
                        What did you do to puppies?

                                 AMELIA
                        It wasn’t far enough. It wasn’t an 
                        assault. Magritte didn’t just take 
                        David’s painting a draw a mustache on the 
                        woman, he put her in a freaking coffin. 
                        It’s not just a joke, it changes the 
                        tone. It changes everything. 

                                 REID
                        Okay, 50 words or less-

           Amelia’s eyes go between the Thomas Kinkade painting and 
           Magritte’s version of “Madame Recamier.” 

                                 AMELIA
                        We have to kill Skip and Chad. 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT 

           Reid and Xena try to catch up to Amelia who is walking at 
           breakneck speed down the street. 

                                 REID
                        But how do you know it will work? 

                                 AMELIA
                        I don’t. It’s a last resort. It’s kind of 
                        characteristic of last resorts that you 
                        don’t know if they’ll work or not. 

                                 REID
                        But Amelia-
                                 AMELIA
                        Reid. I’m not just doing this for me- 

                                 REID
                        I know but I don’t want you to! If you go 
                        to jail and then who will be my BFF? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Exactly. 

                                 REID
                        What? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Think about it. Since this whole thing 
                        started, have you spent any time with any 
                        other human beings? Like, say, any other 
                        gay human beings? 

           Reid thinks about it. The horrible truth dawns on him-

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        Even if they’re here, it won’t matter. 
                        Wacky friends don’t get boyfriends or 
                        lives their own. There’s only room for 
                        one gay in the kind of movie we’re in. 
                        One racial minority. You and Mindy, your 
                        happiness is at stake here too. 

           Reid stops. Sits on a stoop. Rubs his head, tired. 

                                 REID
                        I haven’t had a boyfriend in ten years. 
                        I’m not sure I’m any better off in real 
                        life than here. At least here I’m not 
                        always miserable. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Reid, there were strange and beautiful 
                        things you loved before. And you loved 
                        those things because you were a strange 
                        and beautiful guy. And in the real world, 
                        there’s people that will appreciate a guy 
                        like you. You just have to let them in. 

                                 REID
                        Will you remind me? 

                                 AMELIA
                        You won’t listen, but yes. Sure. 
                                 REID
                        Alright. I’m in. I better call our sister 
                        from another mister. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Good. I’ll be in there-

           Amelia points down the block to a sign: “Gun Shop.” 

           INT. GUN SHOP - NIGHT

           Amelia enters a retail gun store. A CRUSTY OLD MAN stands 
           behind the counter. 

                                 CRUSTY OLD MAN
                        What can I do you for? 

                                 AMELIA
                        I need some guns. 

           The man chuckles heartily. Then stops, realizing Amelia’s not 
           in on the joke. 

                                 CRUSTY OLD MAN
                        You’re not serious? Darlin’, guns are 
                        against the law unless you’re police. 
                        Why, you could kill someone.

                                 AMELIA
                        You realize you have a gun-shaped sign  
                        out there that says “Gun Shop?” 

                                 CRUSTY OLD MAN
                        Oh, you know, it’s kinda like when you 
                        call a strip mall full of McDonalds and 
                        Pay Less Shoes “Ye Olde Towne Center” 
                        It’s got a nice ring to it. 

                                 AMELIA
                        You don’t sell any guns?

                                 CRUSTY OLD MAN
                        Nope. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Not even a musket? I’ve always believed 
                        in our right to bear muskets. 

                                 CRUSTY OLD MAN
                        No muskets. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Do you sell any weapons? 
                                 CRUSTY OLD MAN
                        We got some nice sling shots here. 

           Amelia sees something out of the corner of her eye: A display 
           of HEAVY DUTY CROSSBOWS. 

                                 AMELIA
                        How much damage can those do?

                                 CRUSTY OLD MAN
                        To what? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Um, let’s say a deer. Or two. Big ones.  

                                 CRUSTY OLD MAN
                        Close enough range and a good shot? 
                        Fatal. Definitely. 

                                 AMELIA
                        They’re perfect. I’ll take them all.

           EXT. ST. PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL - DAY

           The sun rises over the gorgeous, imposing gothic church.

           INT. ST. PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL - BRIDAL DRESSING ROOM - DAY

           Ruth checks herself out in the mirror. She wears the Princess 
           Sparkle Slut dress. She's smiling. No, GLOWING. She turns to 
           face the same Stepford Bridesmaids from Mindy’s wedding. 

                                 RUTH
                        Oh my God, I'm getting married! Eeeee!

           Mindy leans against the wall, disgusted. Drinking covertly 
           from Amelia’s borrowed flask. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Where is Reid? It’s inspection time-

           INT. ST. PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL - GROOM’S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

           Skip, in a sharp tux, straightens his bow tie. Chad is also 
           in a tux. But he’s the rumpled one now. He’s crying. 

                                 SKIP
                        Chad? Dude. Are you gonna cry like that 
                        during the ceremony? 

                                 CHAD
                           (through sobs)
                        I don’t know, man. This girl-
                                 SKIP
                        I never thought it’d be me getting 
                        married first, man. You’re such a catch-

                                 CHAD
                        I tried to tell her that. 

           INT. AMELIA'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Waves of Pink chiffon and tulle sway and billow. A hand zips 
           up a pink zipper. Manicured feet slip into ballerina pink 
           heels. Amelia stands in front of the mirror, wearing the 
           hideous pink bridesmaid dress from Mindy's wedding. 

           Reid drapes a succession of crossbows attached to straps over 
           her shoulder like ammo.  Like a proud mother. 

                                 REID
                        Why do you have to wear this godawful 
                        dress again? 

                                 AMELIA
                        I don’t want to waste anything nice. 

           Amelia holds a crossbow to eye level, pre-practicing her aim.

           INT. ST. PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL - DAY

           Ruth and her FATHER wait for the double doors to the chapel 
           to open. Ruth beams, but there’s an ever-so-slight nervous 
           twitch here and there. 

                                 RUTH
                        Thanks for coming, daddy. 

                                 RUTH'S FATHER
                        Never thought I'd see the day you let me 
                        walk you down an aisle on my arm. I guess 
                        even blind hogs find an acorn on occasion

           The "Wedding March" plays. The double doors open. Doubt is 
           all over Ruth's face. She takes her first step. TRIPS and 
           falls. She stays on the ground, not moving. This is a fight 
           or flight moment...Ruth’s face hardens. 

           She gets up. Brushes off. And continues down the aisle.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY

           Amelia, Reid, and Xena push their way through the crowd. 
           PEOPLE SCREAM, run, upon seeing Amelia and Reid’s big ass 
           crossbows. The Woman in the Blue Sweater scurries across 
           Amelia’s path. Amelia stops. Watches the Woman go. 

                                 AMELIA
                        She’s an extra! That’s why she couldn’t 
                        talk and why she’s always wearing the 
                        same thing. 

                                 REID
                        Nice. Shot!

           Amelia laughs, then clumsily TRIPS, firing a projectile bolt 
           into a store window. The glass shatters. The bolt just missed 
           Xena Warrior Princess. She whimpers. Amelia pulls herself 
           back up like a soldier. St. Patrick’s looms, a block away. 

           INT. ST. PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL - DAY

           Ruth and Skip stand, facing one another at the altar in front 
           of a PRIEST. Ruth is sweating. Skip is blissful. Beside Skip, 
           Chad sways unsteadily. 

                                 PRIEST
                        If there is anyone here who has any 
                        reason why these two should not be 
                        married, speak now or forever hold your-

           OUTSIDE THE DOUBLE DOORS

           Amelia listens to the Priest. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Geez, this is so cliche. 

                                 REID
                        Just go!

           Amelia BURSTS through the double doors. Crossbow aimed. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Everybody out!

           Amelia tosses one of the heavy crossbows to Mindy. Mindy 
           catches it expertly.  Skip starts to run, but Mindy grabs him 
           by the scruff of the neck and backs him up against the altar. 

           Amelia backs Chad to the altar too. Her crossbow aimed 
           straight between his eyes. WEDDING GUESTS flee around them.

                                 CHAD
                        I knew you’d be back. 
                                 AMELIA
                        You definitely should not talk right now. 

           Reid ties up the two men with ropes while Xena Warrior 
           princess licks their faces. The action swirls around Ruth.

                                 RUTH
                        Stop! This is my special day! 

           Amelia ignores her. Mindy puts a crossbow in Ruth’s arms. 
           Aims it at Skip. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        What is this for? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Ruth. We have a plan. 

           INT. NYPD STATION - DAY 

           The station, though filled with POLICE OFFICERS, is quiet as 
           a cubicle village. Officers play online scrabble, stand 
           around a water cooler not speaking, sleep at their desks. On 
           an assignment board, under Missing Person’s cases is written 
           “NO LEADS.” The rest of the categories are blank. A YOUNG 
           OFFICER bursts into the station. Grinning ear to ear.

                                 YOUNG OFFICER
                        Guys! We got a call! And there’s weapons!

           All the Officers hop up from their desks, like kids out of 
           bed on Christmas morning. The rush out the door, whooping and 
           hollering. The Police CHIEF knocks over the painstakingly 
           constructed house of cards he’s been building. Shouts orders.

                                 CHIEF
                        Grasso, call all the precincts! 
                        Valtierra, get the equestrian units!

           INT. ST. PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL - DAY 

           Ruth is freaking out, her crossbow lowered. Mindy and Reid 
           guard the doors. Amelia aims at Skip and Chad, now tied up. 

                                 RUTH
                        I can’t kill him! I love him!

                                 AMELIA
                        I know it sounds crazy- 

                                 CHAD
                        It definitely sounds crazy. 
                                 AMELIA
                        I know you love him and that you can’t 
                        help it. But I also know when I came into 
                        this church to stop this from happening, 
                        you looked relieved. 

           Ruth doesn’t deny it. She looks at Skip. He looks like a sad 
           puppy dog. She turns back to Amelia. 

                                 RUTH
                        You have no idea- how effing pissed off I 
                        am at you. Or how much I’ve missed you. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I think I can relate to those emotions. 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY 

           The ENTIRE FLEET of NYPD cars, paddy wagons, and equestrian 
           units speed/gallop down Madison Avenue. Sirens blaring.

           INT. ST. PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL - DAY 

           Amelia and Ruth are making up. Their crossbows still aimed. 

                                 RUTH
                        You were right, I change personalities 
                        like underwear. If we get out of this, 
                        I’m going to seriously take some time to 
                        figure things out. 

                                 AMELIA
                        No, you were right. My risk-averse 
                        repressed crap is going to make me 
                        miserable for the rest of my life. But 
                        I’m going to work on that. 

                                 SKIP
                        Uh, Patty Hearsts 1 & 2, would you mind 
                        lowering your weapons? 

                                 RUTH
                        Would you mind lowering your voice, I’m 
                        trying to talk to my BFF here. 

                                 CHAD
                        You really think we’re in a movie? So 
                        you’re going to kill us? With crossbows? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Chad, I didn’t want to do it this way. I 
                        wanted to use a gun.
                                 RUTH
                        Yeah, why don’t we have guns?

                                 AMELIA
                        Long story. 

                                 SKIP
                        I don’t buy it. You two rate at least a 
                        “Sharon Stone” on the crazy-o-meter, 
                        which, I’ll admit, is intriguing to a guy 
                        like me in an unhealthy way, but you just 
                        don’t seem like the murdering types. 

                                 RUTH
                        We’re not, but then again, you’re not 
                        real. So in a way it’s more like we’re 
                        taking out The Easter Bunny or a Log 
                        Cabin Republican.

                                 CHAD
                        What are you talking about? We’re real!

           The sound of POLICE SIRENS can be heard outside. Shit. Mindy 
           peeks out a window, sees the thousands and thousands of NYPD 
           vehicles screeching to a stop in front of the church. 

                                 MINDY
                        Don’t worry, girls. Reid and I got this.

           EXT. ST. PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL - DAY 

           The grand front doors to the Cathedral open. Mindy and Reid 
           stand in the middle of them. Reid holds a shivering Xena. The 
           ENTIRE NYPD faces them, guns aimed. Many BYSTANDERS look on. 
           Mindy, nervous, searches for some words- then finds them. 

                                 MINDY
                        Oh HELP! Some crazy white women holdin’ 
                        us hostage! Help!

           Reid looks around to see if anyone’s buying it. They are. On 
           either side of the church’s doors, Mindy and Reid have rigged 
           their crossbows onto biblical statues. From the NYPD’s POV, 
           it looks like two crossbows are pointed directly at them. 

                                 REID
                        They want you to stand back! And, uh, 
                        lower your weapons! They got demands!

           The Officers get a signal from the Chief to put down their 
           guns. They do. Mindy breaks into a mischievous smile. 
           INT. ST. PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL - DAY

           Amelia gives Ruth a quick crossbow tutorial. Chad and Skip 
           try to wriggle out of the ropes, but no luck. 

                                 AMELIA
                        And since it’s already loaded, just make 
                        sure you’re lined up. Release the safety 
                        and pull the trigger. Whap! 

                                 RUTH
                        Okay, I think I can handle that. 

                                 SKIP
                        Stop it! We’re not “trapped in a movie.” 

                                 CHAD
                        Actually. I think we might be. 

                                 AMELIA
                           (to Ruth)
                        We should aim for the heart. It will be 
                        the quickest. 

           Ruth nods. She centers her cross hairs on Skip. Amelia 
           centers hers on Chad. They’re both shaking. Skip braces for 
           the impact. Chad is putting the pieces together. 

                                 AMELIA AND RUTH

                                 CHAD
                        Wait!

                                 AMELIA AND RUTH
                        3!

           Too late. Amelia and Ruth PRESS HARD on the triggers...and 
           nothing happens. The projectile bolts still in the crossbows. 

                                 RUTH
                        They’re broken-

                                 CHAD
                           (to Skip)
                        They’re right-

                                 SKIP
                        Right about what? We’re not real?
                                 AMELIA
                           (to Ruth)
                        They can’t be broken, I accidentally shot 
                        a bolt on the way here. 

           Chad and Skip whisper among themselves. 

                                 CHAD
                        No they’re wrong about that. But they’re 
                        right about the movie thing. Remember how 
                        we kept saying they were too good to be 
                        true? And how you proposed to a girl 
                        you’d only known for a week when you’ve 
                        spent the last two decades bailing out on 
                        girls the moment things got serious? And 
                        how we thought my jaw was looking 
                        unnaturally square lately. 

                                 SKIP
                        Yeah, but- a movie- that’s crazy.

                                 CHAD
                        Skip. Look at them. A sexually confused 
                        Public Radio employee and an art-school-
                        wannabe egghead who makes crack meth? We 
                        like these girls. That’s weird bro! 

                                 SKIP
                        Oh God. That IS weird. 

           Ruth re-aims at Skip. Clicks her trigger a few more times. 
           Nothing. She turns away to look at the mechanism in a better 
           light and FTHHWT! Her bolt FIRES and sticks into an image of 
           the already arrow-ridden martyr St. Sebastian.

                                 AMELIA
                        How’d you do that? 

                                 RUTH
                        I don’t know-

                                 SKIP
                        So that’s why we were acting so lame. I 
                        thought it was just what love did to you-

                                 CHAD
                        Yeah, me too.

                           (to Ruth)
                        Uh oh-
                                 RUTH
                        What?

           Amelia does a test. She points her crossbow at Chad. Clicks 
           the trigger. Nothing. Then, she points her crossbow a few 
           inches over. FTHHHWT! The projectile bolt WHIZZES towards 
           Chad’s head. Just misses it. Shatters a stained glass window. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Frack! What now?!

                                 CHAD
                        Now you put those down and untie us. 

                                 RUTH
                        Why would we do that?

                                 CHAD
                        Because we want out of this just as much 
                        as you. If not more. 

           EXT. ST. PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL - DAY 

           Mindy is less nervous now. Now she’s running the show, 
           pretending to be getting “orders” from her hostage takers. 

                                 MINDY
                        What’s that? Oh, okay. They sayin’ they 
                        want Hollywood to make a movie where 
                        Wanda Sykes the star! And she save the 
                        world. From terrorists. White terrorists!

           The NYPD Officers write all this down on their note pads.

                        We crashed that wedding. Our parents 
                        thirtieth anniversary party was in the 
                        next ballroom and we were bored.

           The color drains from Skip and Chad’s faces.

                        Oh my God. We did say that.

                        Look. I’m just the messenger here. 

                                 CHIEF
                           (into his walkie talkie)
                        These people are giving us the run 
                        around. Get the SWAT team up here.

           INT. ST. PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL - DAY 

           Amelia, Ruth, Skip, and Chad sit on the steps of the altar. 
           Thinking. But no one’s got anything. The sirens blare 
           outside. The sunlight shines oppressively in. It’s too much. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I really should have taken you up on that 
                        double suicide when you offered it, Ruth. 

                                 RUTH
                        For serious. 
           The sit in silence. Think. Ruth GASPS. 

                                 SKIP
                        What? 

                                 RUTH
                        Suicide! It’d never happen in a romantic 
                        comedy-

                                 CHAD
                        Yeah but if this “thing” wouldn’t let you 
                        murder us, what makes you think it’s 
                        going to let you jump off a bridge? 

                                 RUTH
                        Because all we have to do is jump. 
                        There’s no third party objects to 
                        malfunction. And just by committing the 
                        act, maybe the world will change back-

                                 AMELIA
                        But when people jump off buildings in the 
                        real world, they die. 

                                 SKIP
                        We could get horribly crippled instead-

                                 AMELIA
                        That’s your silver lining? 

                                 CHAD
                        I’m in. We’ve got more of a chance 
                        changing things back by jumping than by 
                        fading to black-

                                 AMELIA
                        No. We’re not jumping to our deaths. Or 
                        to our...crippling. 

                                 CHAD
                        I guess I’m in and hoping for crippling. 
                        It’s not such a loss. I’ve never even 
                        played my Wii standing up. 

                                 AMELIA
                        No! This doesn’t make sense. 

                                 RUTH
                        We can’t fight this with logic. Remember, 
                        Amelia. I promised I wouldn’t let you 
                        die. 
                                 AMELIA
                        Yeah...but follow through is not exactly 
                        your strong point-

                                 RUTH
                        It’ll only work if we all do it. And the 
                        rest of us want to do it-

           EXT. ST. PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL - DAY 

           Mindy and Reid collaborate on their next demand. 

                                 MINDY
                        Yeah, an’ they sayin’ they want a black 
                        woman to run for president next time!

                                 REID
                        A black lesbian woman!

                                 MINDY
                        Yeah! But not Condoleeza!

                                 CHIEF
                           (into his walkie talkie)
                        Now. 

           The SWAT TEAM descends upon Mindy and Reid. Surrounding them 
           at gunpoint. The Swat Team sees the crossbows rigged up on 
           the statues. Mindy and Reid are screwed. Reid sets Xena free. 

                                 REID
                        Go, girl! Just go!

           Xena just stands there and shivers. 

                                 MINDY
                        What the hell we do now? 

                                 KID BYSTANDER
                        There they are! 

           The Kid Bystander is pointing up at the roof. Everyone, 
           including the SWAT team, cranes their necks up. Reid and 
           Mindy are no fools. They take the opportunity and RUN. 

           EXT. ST. PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL - ROOFTOP - DAY 

           Amelia and Ruth see Mindy and Reid hauling ass down the 
           street. Chad lodges a crossbow in the roof’s doorway.

                                 RUTH
                        Fudge me! Our distraction’s gone. 
           The Four see SWAT team members rushing inside the church. 
           They all step to the edge of the roof. It’s a long way down. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        This is why I prefer not looking before 
                        leaping. Everybody ready? 

           Amelia can’t stop looking at the drop.

                                 AMELIA
                        Yes.
                           (she turns to Chad)
                        I love you. I don’t particularly like you 
                        and I’d never go out with a guy like you 
                        in real life. And I don’t know if it’s 
                        real or not, but right now, I love you. 

           Amelia waits for Chad’s reaction. He grins. 

                                 CHAD
                        I’m glad you got that out of your system. 
                        Well, the first part at least. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Yeah sorry about that. I’m kind of 
                        allergic to simple emotions. 

           Skip takes the opportunity to be romantic. 

                                 SKIP
                        And I love you, Rudi. And I know we’re 
                        stuck in this lame movie or whatever, but 
                        I think I see, like, the real you. And-

                                 RUTH
                        Um. Skip? Before you go any further-

           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The SWAT TEAM rams into the roof door from 
           the other side. One of the door hinges breaks off... 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Skip. It’s not you, it’s me. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Your timing is truly impeccable. 

           BLAM! The door falls, the SWAT Team swarm onto the roof. 

                                 SWAT TEAM GUY
                        Don’t move! Hands above your head!

                                 SKIP
                        You’re breaking up with me?
                                 RUTH
                        Well, I still love you. I can’t control 
                        that. I just don’t want to be with you. 

           The Four put their hands up. The SWAT Team surrounds them in 
           a dense semicircle, edging them towards the roof’s end. 

                                 AMELIA
                        We have no way of knowing if this is 
                        going to work. I can’t-

                                 RUTH
                        No, we don’t. But you’re going to have to 
                        jump off this roof believing that it 
                        might. Because this is one of those 
                        moments in life that calls for a little 
                        self-delusion.

                                 CHAD
                        Why aren’t they doing anything? 

           The SWAT Team is still there, but they’re not doing anything.

                                 AMELIA
                        Because they couldn’t hurt us if they 
                        tried. They’re not the threat. 
                           (beat)
                        Alright guys. Let’s jump off a building 
                        and see what happens. 

           The Four, hesitant at first, drop their hands. The SWAT TEAM 
           members look to one another, not sure how to react. 

           The Four run, full speed, towards the edge of the roof. In 
           slow motion, their feet take the last steps on solid ground. 
           And they leap off into nothingness. The bodies fall...

           INT. AMELIA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

           Bed bugs scurry out from underneath Amelia’s mattress corner.

           EXT. ST. PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL - DAY 

           The four are still falling...falling...

           EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY

           Dirk finds himself back there on the sidewalk, confused. A 
           WOMAN walks by.

                                 DIRK
                        Spare some change, lovely? No? Well you 
                        got fat thighs! 
           INT. AN APARTMENT SOMEWHERE - DAY 

           The Woman in the Blue Sweater puts on a green sweater. 

                                 THE WOMAN IN THE BLUE SWEATER
                        Ah. That’s better. 

           EXT. ST. PATRICK’S CATHEDRAL - DAY 

           The CROWD watches as the sunny sky turns a DREARY GRAY. The 
           autumn leaves fall off all the trees in ONE BIG CLUMP.

           In the air, The Four are STILL falling. Until: Real time. 
           The four drop like lead weights to the ground. 

           CUT TO BLACK. The Blackness Stays. And Stays. THEN: 

           FADE UP on the sound of sirens. The four lay, like tossed rag 
           dolls over bushes on the sidewalk in front of the cathedral. 
           EMTs rush to the bodies. Then... Amelia’s eye flutters open. 
           She’s alive. And in a lot of pain. Beside her, Ruth moves. 

                                 AMELIA AND RUTH
                        Fuck. 

           Amelia and Ruth grimace, then realize what’s just happened. 

                                 AMELIA AND RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Fuck! Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!

                                 CHAD
                        Fuuuuck-

                                 SKIP
                        Mother fucker. 

           The girls are back to their normal weight and unshiny hair. 
           The guys have receding hairlines and a few extra pounds. Ruth 
           turns to Amelia, her hands on her waistline. An ear-to-ear 
           grin on her face. 

                                 RUTH
                        My fat is back! It worked. We’re free! 

           But Amelia is going through a different set of emotions. 
           She’s looking at Chad, in the real world, for the first time. 

                                 AMELIA
                        You have a receding hairline. 

                                 CHAD
                        It’s genetic. 
           INT. DARREN’S MOM’S APARTMENT  - DAY

           Darren is slumped in a La-Z-boy. The front door opens. Mindy 
           stands in the doorway. She says nothing. 

                                 DARREN
                        You want a divorce, don’t you? 

           Mindy still doesn’t speak.

                                 DARREN (CONT’D)
                        Well it’s just not that easy. I love you!

           Mindy opens her mouth. Her real voice comes out. 

                                 MINDY
                        I’m not interested in easy anymore. I’m 
                        interested in five or six decades of ups 
                        and downs and uncertainty. With you. 

           Mindy approaches him. They kiss a long, real, great kiss. 

                                 DARREN
                        I’m glad you’re back. Things have been 
                        weird. I quit my job at the firm to 
                        become a line cook and I became friends 
                        with this white line cook who is in the 
                        most screwed up relationship with this 
                        hotel heiress who thinks he’s rich, but-

           Mindy smiles. Kisses him again. Happy to have her life back. 

           INT. REID’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Reid, his hair now back to flat and uninteresting, tosses his 
           flamboyant clothes with disgust out the window. 

           Xena enters, wearing a glittery shirt. Reid looks at her with 
           the exact same look of disgust. He scoops the trembling dog 
           up...and removes her shirt. Tosses it out the window. 

                                 REID
                        C’mon. Let’s explore internet dating.  

           EXT. CHURCH - DAY

           Skip and Chad are carried on stretchers into ambulances. 
           Amelia is being handcuffed and read rights by an ARRESTING 
           OFFICER. But she’s not listening. She calls out to Chad-

                                 AMELIA
                        Chad! Do you want to go out for coffee- 
                        you know, when I’m next available? 
                                 CHAD
                        I thought you said you would never go out 
                        with a guy like me in the real world. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Trust me, it’s as big of surprise to me 
                        as it is to you. But the fact remains 
                        that for unknown and illogical reasons, 
                        the thought of not seeing you again, 
                        sucks balls. 

                                 CHAD
                        Well you do have so much class-

                                 AMELIA
                        Chad. Coffee. Yes or no? It’s highly 
                        possible I’m going to jail or prison for 
                        inciting fear in New York City so you’ll 
                        have plenty of time to back out by the 
                        time I can actually go on this date.

                                 CHAD
                        Then yes.

           Amelia cracks a smile. Chad does too. 

                                 CHAD (CONT’D)
                        I hope we’re not paralyzed. 

           BY ANOTHER AMBULANCE

           EMTs let Skip and Ruth talk while stabilizing their necks.

                                 RUTH
                        I guess I’m not sure if I’m straight or 
                        gay or bisexual or just Ruthasexual. 
                        These are things I have to take some me 
                        time to figure out. Also I think I’m just 
                        out of your league, Chip. 

                                 SKIP
                        -Skip. My name is Skip. And I told you, I 
                        don’t care. I would never date a girl 
                        like you. You’re a pretentious, 
                        insulting, flaky, hipster who thinks The 
                        Stones are a better band than the 
                        Beatles, which is certifiable. 

                                 RUTH
                        That’s right buddy, and I fucking love 
                        Yoko Ono, for future reference. 
                                 SKIP
                        Okay, actually I’ve always had kind of a 
                        thing for Yoko. 

                                 RUTH
                        Really? 
                           (beat)
                        Hey, would like you to hang out but never 
                        ever date? 

           Skip thinks about it. Nods and shrugs a “yeah, maybe.” 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Amelia and Ruth are being loaded into parallel ambulances. 
           Both are handcuffed and accompanied by ARRESTING OFFICERS.

                                 AMELIA
                        You don’t suppose we have any of that 
                        endless ATM money left? 

                                 RUTH
                        Probably not, no. Why? 

                                 AMELIA
                        Because we’re gonna need to make bail. 

                                 RUTH
                        Time to start hooking. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Oh Darling, it’s good to have you back. 

           BEHIND THEM

           The Crowd dissipates, everyone fairly blase about what 
           they’ve just seen. This is New York, after all.

           But very briefly, in quick glimpses, we can see two little 
           blonde headed girls weaving through the crowd of grown ups. 
           From their backpacks, the tips of golden bows poke out. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           The Ambulance doors close on Amelia and Ruth. They turn their 
           sirens on and race off into the dreary gray afternoon.
