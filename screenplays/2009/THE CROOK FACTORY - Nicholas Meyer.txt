           the WARNER-PATHE LOGO and FANFARE as the portentous VOICE OF 
           ED HERLIHY narrates a series of catastrophes, recapping World 
           War II thus far: 

           Ranting HITLER’s Wehrmacht overruns Europe, England on the 
           brink, JAPAN’S sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, bombs rain on 
           cities, endless lines of REFUGEES, black leather trench-
           coated AGENTS of the dread GESTAPO, Brits retreat in North 
           Africa, Nazi U-boats torpedo allied supply convoys in the 
           Atlantic as the Japs rout Americans in the Pacific... 

           America is losing the war...  REVEAL

           INT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT

           where JOSEF REINHART, 30’s, enjoys the news... He glances at 
           his watch by the light of the screen.  Gets up and leaves...

           EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           Reinhart walking, footsteps echoing.  (Because it IS night, 
           everything still looks to be BLACK & WHITE).  TITLE OVER:

                                 MEXICO CITY, 1942

           Reinhart stops at an inconspicuous door, fishes for his key, 
           looking around before entering...

           INT. MEXICO CITY SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

           DARK as Reinhart enters, cautiously... speaks in a whisper -

                                 REINHART
                        Wieland..?  Wo ist du?

           He moves tentatively, not wishing to use light to alert the 
           wrong people to his presence... when he stubs his FOOT.

           Bending down, Reinhart strikes a yellowing match to REVEAL -

           WIELAND - dead, eyes wide in shock. Reinhart starts to stand, 
           only to have a piano wire snapped around his neck by -

           A HATTED MAN who works quietly, efficiently. Muffled struggles 
           and scuffling FEET before Reinhart subsides beside Wieland...

           The killer kneels beside his victims, flicking open a ZIPPO. 
           By its light he deftly frisks their pockets, retrieving...     
           CONTINUED:

           SWASTIKAED documents which he holds up, REVEALING HIS FACE -
           impassive but stressed. He’s just killed two men. Zippo off.

           He’s quietly on his way out when he’s abruptly tackled by a 
           THIRD MAN.  A furious scuffle as our killer wrests a .22 from 
           his assailant... and shoots him in the face...

           The ZIPPO again, REVEALING an ARYAN-featured man, bleeding 
           profusely.  The killer extracts his papers. Name: BECKER.

           EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           The killer, now seen full figure in a trench coat, emerges 
           lighting a cigarette and looks to the end of the alley where -

           A CAR flashes its headlights.  The Zippo flashes in response 
           and the car moves forward, stopping as the killer gets in...

           INT. CAR, TRAVELING - NIGHT

           The conversation is conducted in sub-titled SPANISH -

                                 DRIVER
                        Go alright?

                                 LUCAS
                        Not your department. Hotel Reforma.

                                 DRIVER
                        No.  New orders.  The Director 
                        wants you in Washington tomorrow.

           He hands something to the killer, JOE LUCAS, (40), which he 
           reads by dim light... before sitting back, thinking...

           EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY

           by daylight we realize: we’re in color. A PLANE overhead -

           INT. DC 3 - DAY 

           Lucas, tired, needing a shave, surveys the unfinished 
           PENTAGON, under construction on the ground below...

           EXT. TARMAC, D.C. AIRPORT - DAY

           Lucas, carrying a valise, walking with other PASSENGERS,  
           many if not most in UNIFORM, to where another MAN waits. 
           CONTINUED:

           Nodding, briefly, they fall into step, walking past posters: 
           “Loose Lips Sink Ships”, “Keep mum, she’s not so dumb!” etc.  
           Washington in wartime...

           INT. AIRPORT MEN’S ROOM - DAY

           Lucas, in a wife-beater, shaving and giving himself a sponge 
           bath as TOM DILLON, his counterpart, proffers a clean shirt.

                                 TOM
                        You know the drill?

                                 LUCAS
                        He doesn’t like sweaty hands...

                                 TOM
                        He doesn’t like sweaty anything. 

           EXT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BUILDING - DAY

           more of wartime Washington as TOM’S CAR disgorges Lucas, who 
           walks past a brass plaque:  FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

           CLOSE ON TWO HANDS, SHAKING.  HOOVER’s hand discreetly wipes 
           itself dry on a handkerchief - REVEAL

           INT. HOOVER’S OFFICE, FBI HQ, DC - DAY

                                 HOOVER 
                        Special Agent Lucas.  Sit.

           HOOVER, 47 and bulldog squat, assumes his back-lit, slightly 
           elevated, throne-like chair across the desk from Lucas, now 
           dressed with pin-point neatness with no trace of fatigue.  

           Hoover holds out an expectant hand Lucas produces the Nazi ID 
           papers, setting them on the desk.  Hoover reacts to the dried 
           BLOOD on one of them -

                                 HOOVER (CONT’D)
                        ...trouble?

                                 LUCAS
                        Becker was there.  I didn’t expect 
                        him.  

                                 HOOVER
                             (dry, displeased)
                        It’s the early bird that gets the 
                        worm, special agent... Is he dead?
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUCAS
                        ...I think so... But they will send 
                        another team.

           Hoover, glances without interest at the Nazi papers...

                                 HOOVER
                        Nazis aren’t the real problem, 
                        Special Agent Lucas.  Would you 
                        believe me if I told you this 
                        entire world war is a sideshow?

           Hoover is now flipping through LUCAS’ FILE... 

                                 LUCAS
                        Sideshow?

                                 HOOVER
                        It’s the Communists, Special Agent 
                        Lucas. Communists are the real enemy.

                                 LUCAS
                        But now they’re on our side, right?

                                 HOOVER
                        In this office I ask the questions. 
                        Born in West Texas, I see.  
                        Bilingual. Is your given name Jose?

                                 LUCAS
                             (stiffens)
                        My birth certificate says-

                                 HOOVER
                        And you trained at Camp X.  Any OSS 
                        boys at Camp X while you were there?  

                                 LUCAS
                        Yes... I met some...

                                 HOOVER
                             (dripping with scorn)
                        OSS - Office of Strategic Services. 

                                 LUCAS
                        The OSS seems to enjoy President 
                        Roosevelt’s support...

           Hoover eyes FDR’s photo, half hidden on the wall.

                                 HOOVER
                        Presidents come and go. But there 
                        can only be one intelligence

                        that service will always be the FBI.

           Abruptly, he holds up a glossy PHOTO: A MAN, 40’s...

                                 HOOVER (CONT’D)
                        Ever heard of this man?

           Lucas squints at the caption under the picture -

                                 LUCAS
                        Ernest Hemingway? (frowns) Big game 
                        hunter?  Lives in Miami?

                                 HOOVER
                        Now he’s living like a king outside 
                        Havana with his third wife, waited 
                        on hand and foot by an army of 
                        spics; his money goes further there. 
                        Not bad for a Communist sympathizer.

                                 LUCAS
                        I didn’t realize there was money in 
                        big game hunting...

                                 HOOVER
                        Hemingway’s a best-selling novelist 
                        whose books get made into movies. 
                        Care to read his latest?

           FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS.  Lucas examines the volume -

                                 LUCAS
                        I don’t read make-believe books...

                                 HOOVER
                             (grim)
                        Then maybe I picked the right man 
                        for this assignment after all. 
                        Hemingway’s proposing to set up his 
                        own counter-espionage network in 
                        the Caribbean.

           He points to a huge MAP OF CUBA and the CARIBBEAN -

                                 HOOVER (CONT’D)
                        He wants government help to chase 
                        Nazi submarines on his fishing boat.  
                        More likely an excuse to get hold of 
                        rationed gas to go after marlin.  Go 
                        down there and find out what’s really 
                        going on with The Crook Factory.

                                 LUCAS
                        Crook Factory?

                                 HOOVER
                        The name he’s given his so-called 
                        operation.  You’ll submit weekly 
                        reports to the man who can match 
                        this and he’ll get them to me.

           He holds up the TORN HALF OF A DOLLAR BILL.  End of meeting.  
           After a moment, Lucas rises and takes it -

                                 LUCAS
                        Thanks.

           He starts out; stops.  Hoover looks icily up at him -

                                 HOOVER
                        Yes?

                                 LUCAS
                        Mr. Director, there’s a war on.  
                        Doesn’t this seem kind of silly? 

           Hoover holds up the novel -

                        Ask not for whom the bell tolls,

                        screwup in Mexico City it tolls for 
                        thee.  Hemingway is said to have a 
                        kind of crude charm.  Don’t fall 
                        for it; you may have to kill him.

                        this is jolly. I only go as far as

                        Well, actually Commander Fleming, 
                        MI6. But we work very closely with 
                        your Mr. Phillips of the OSS.

                        He really isn’t, you know. Hairless, 
                        I mean.  And he says you did very 
                        well in Mexico City.  Good show. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Commander Fleming, since you know 
                        I’m with the FBI-

                                 FLEMING
                        Yes, yes, turf war, rival 
                        intelligence agencies, all that 
                        rot.  The FBI does a superb job as 
                        far as it goes but it’s not enough, 
                        is it? Does Hoover know you’re half 
                        Mexican, by the by? (smiles) You 
                        see, the OSS does its homework so-

                                 LUCAS
                        Commander Fleming, will you get to 
                        the point?

                                 FLEMING
                        Of course, Special Agent Lucas. And 
                        what precisely is your speciality?  
                        Don’t tell me.  There’s 4,000 FBI 
                        agents but only a handful have been 
                        trained at Camp X to kill on

                        Your point, Commander?
           CONTINUED:

                                 FLEMING
                        Oh yes my point: be careful in Cuba, 
                        Special Agent.  The FBI may not be 
                        adhering to US foreign policy.  Might 
                        be illegal. (realizes) Oh dear, we’re 
                        starting our descent. (eyes Lucas) 
                        Already.  

           He starts to rise but looks down: Lucas’ hand on his sleeve.

                                 LUCAS
                        What’s he like?

                                 FLEMING
                        What’s who - (he gets it) Ah, Senor 
                        Hemingway. (smiles broadly) I’m 
                        sure you’ll be amused.

           He leaves Lucas to consider his cryptic remark... Now the 
           pulsing, pulsating CUBAN MUSIC that will underscore the film, 
           begins, faint at first, then bursting as -

           EXT. OCEAN - DAY

           as a 700 pound MARLIN leaps out of turquoise water, hooked!  
           YELLS of excitement and encouragement bring us around to -

           EXT. PILAR - DAY

           HEMINGWAY’S 38 foot, green and black BOAT, in a stern chair 
           of which, ERNEST HEMINGWAY (43), tugs on a large, bent double 
           fishing rod. He’s beardless but in the rugged prime of life - 

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Harness!  Harness!!  Fuentes -!

                                 FUENTES
                             (the squint-eyed mate)
                        Si, Papa!

           As the huge fish tugs on his straining, sinewy forearms -

           FUENTES and PATCHI (30’s), help Hemingway into straps that 
           will keep him from flying off Pilar’s taffrail as -

           The great fish displays itself in magnificent, heroic bounds 
           out of the rolling sea in its effort to shed the hook -

           WINSTON GUEST, known as “Wolfer”, (40’s), a ruddy-faced, 
           millionaire sportsman with an ever-present drink in hand -
           CONTINUED:

                                 WOLFER
                        Are you in love, Papa?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                             (chortling)
                        I’m in love -!  Look at him -!

           Amid the cries, the giant fish leaps and leaps again!  That’s 
           when Hemingway sees something out of the corner of his eye...

                                 HEMINGWAY (CONT’D)
                        Shit!  Knife -!

                                 PATCHI
                        Knife?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Knife!  On the double -!  Look!

           They follow the direction he jerks his head: A PERISCOPE.

                                 HEMINGWAY (CONT’D)
                        Damnation!

           Someone hands him a knife and he slashes at the line, freeing 
           the glorious marlin as Hemingway frantically yanks off the 
           harness and races up Pilar’s flying bridge -

           (Along the way, we catch glimpses of several other CREW, all 
           of whom we will come to know by and by...)

                                 HEMINGWAY (CONT’D)
                        Full speed -!

           As Pilar responds with a roar of her engines, Wolfer climbs 
           up alongside Hemingway with binoculars - and his drink...

           THEIR POV - a mile or so off, a German U-Boat is surfacing.

                                 HEMINGWAY (CONT’D)
                        Sonovabitch!

           He steers for the sub as her conning tower becomes visible, 
           the number U-238 on her prow...

           SEVERAL ANGLES of Pilar, smashing through moderate swells as 
           she tries to close on U-238, shuddering with each wave hit... 

           Realizing she’s been spotted, the U-boat begins to dive -

                                 HEMINGWAY (CONT’D)
                        No -!  Wolfer, take the wheel!
           CONTINUED:

           He almost leaps off the flying bridge, down to the deck -

                                 HEMINGWAY (CONT’D)
                        Harpoon -!  Sinsky!  SINSKY!!

           SINSKY (30) hands him an ancient harpoon and Hemingway races 
           to Pilar’s bow and hurls the antique at the vanishing sub -!

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY CONFERENCE ROOM, HAVANA - DAY

           A HUGE WALL MAP of the Caribbean as a CLOCK TICKS... 

           AMBASSADOR BRADEN (40’s) and his aides, BRIGGS and JOYCE sit 
           silently, trying not to look at the clock, which reads 2:25.

                                 AMBASSADOR BRADEN
                        I can’t understand it, Ernest is 
                        always so punctual...

           REVEAL Lucas, smoking off to one side of the paneled room, 
           idly crafting paper planes from embassy stationary...  

           More silence. Abruptly, the door is banged open by Hemingway, 
           still dressed in chino shorts and a stained blue work shirt. 
           Bigger than life with his energy, he dominates every room...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Ambassador Braden, I am so sorry..!

                                 AMBASSADOR BRADEN
                        Not at all, Ernest. I believe you 
                        know my aides, Briggs and Joyce-

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        We saw one! U-238, big as life -!

                                 BRIGGS
                        A German submarine?  You actually-

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I’m telling you, fishermen are 
                        tripping over them!  And Havana’s 
                        crawling with German agents. The 
                        Crook Factory can keep tabs ashore 
                        but if we’d had a radio at sea today 
                        it would’ve been different story! 
                        (urgent) If we could convert the 
                        Pilar to a Q-boat..!

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        An armed vessel disguised as 
                        something harmless, like, uh, 
                        “marine research”, something that 
                        would enable us to get close to an 
                        unsuspecting sub so I could lob a 
                        grenade down her conning tower... 
                        my pitching arm’s pretty-

           A PAPER PLANE mockingly sails past Hemingway, who stops mid-
           speech to clock the man in the shadows he hadn’t seen.

                                 LUCAS
                        Sorry...

                                 AMBASSADOR BRADEN
                        Ernest this is Joe Lucas who comes to 
                        us from, the uh, State Department...

           Braden is a self-conscious liar...  Hemingway steps over to 
           inspect Lucas, who rises laconically and returns his look.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        State Department?

                                 AMBASSADOR BRADEN
                        Joe here will be your liaison to the 
                        Embassy.  We felt an extra hand 
                        might help you to-

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Ever been to Cuba, Mr..?

                                 LUCAS
                        Lucas.  No.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Speak any Spanish?

                                 LUCAS
                        ... uh, poquito...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Do you know boats?

                                 LUCAS
                        ... a little.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Guns?

                        ... in theory.
           CONTINUED:

           The two men stare at one another... Then -

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Ambassador, I don’t know this man.  
                        I don’t understand his purpose or 
                        his qualifications and I’d prefer-

                                 AMBASSADOR BRADEN
                        Ernest I’m afraid you’ve no choice.  
                        We are prepared to finance the 
                        conversion of the Pilar into a...

                                 JOYCE
                        Q-boat...

                                 AMBASSADOR BRADEN
                        A Q-boat, yes, but the quid pro quo 
                        is Mr. Lucas’ presence as requested 
                        by the, uh, State Department.  You 
                        will be asked to divulge all Crook 
                        Factory data to him.

           Pause.  Hemingway walks back to Lucas, who hasn’t moved.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Let me see your hands.

           Cigarette dangling, Lucas holds out his hands.  Hemingway 
           stares into Lucas’ eyes but surprisingly, feels his hands...

           CLOSE THEIR HANDS... Then, back to -

                                 HEMINGWAY (CONT’D)
                        You’ve done work with these hands.

                                 LUCAS
                        Oh, yes...

           And don’t we know it.

           INT. LINCOLN, TRAVELING, HAVANA - DAY

           Hemingway drives Lucas away from the AMBOS MUNDOS HOTEL... 

                                 LUCAS
                        Thanks for letting me stay at your

                             (mild)
                        Let’s cut the crap.  Braden wants 
                        you to keep an eye on me;

                        now I can keep an eye on you. By 
                        the way, the old doorman in front 
                        of the hotel? 

           Lucas can see the MAN saluting them in the right hand mirror -

                                 HEMINGWAY (CONT’D)
                        He’s part of the Factory: Agent 3.

                                 LUCAS
                        Agent 3... Swell.

           EXT. HAVANA STREET, FLORIDITA BAR - DAY

           as the Lincoln passes a group of SCRAWNY STREET URCHINS, who 
           chase after it, hands extended for coins. EXCEPT ONE, 11, but 
           appears younger, who studies the car as it passes... 

           INT. FLORIDITA BAR - DAY

           Hemingway and Lucas served drinks by a WAITER...

                                 LUCAS
                        I don’t really drink...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I don’t smoke.  They’re called 
                        Mojitos.  Mud in your eye...

           They drink.  Hemingway looks at Lucas, inquiringly -

                                 LUCAS
                        Tastes like yak piss.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        You’d know.  By the way, the waiter 
                        is Agent 16.

           Lucas eyes the waiter, now across the room.  Great.  
           Hemingway clocks Lucas’ contempt.

           INT. LINCOLN, TRAVELING - DAY

           along the malecon, Havana’s picturesque seawall, where people 
           come to meet, gossip, fight and make love...

                        Crook Factory knows all about her. 
                        Southern Cross, biggest private 
                        yacht in the world, used to belong 
                        to Howard Hughes, currently 
                        chartered by Theodore Shell, a Dutch 
                        businessman. 

                                 LUCAS

                        Shell’s been here three weeks with 
                        an attractive blond.  Americans come 
                        to Cuba to behave badly...

                                 LUCAS
                        That include you?

                             (controlling himself)
                        I was generalizing.

                        Besides, you said Shell was Dutch.

                        Sure as shootin’.

           Lucas clocks the right hand mirror again: they’re being 
           followed by a WHITE BUICK... then back at -

           Hemingway, who drives, furious - and oblivious to the Buick.

           EXT. MALECON - DAY

           as the two cars wipe past, the SAME URCHIN we saw before, now 
           covered with sweat from running to keep up, stops at the 
           Malecon, frowning, heaving, watching the cars disappear...

                        I can’t put you up in our guest- 
                        house; we’re using that for Crook 
                        Factory stuff. But there’s an old 
                        dairy across the road and Marty’ll 
                        fix it up for you.

           MARTHA GELHORN, (29), Hemingway’s wife, a Lauren Bacall 
           prototype, at one end of a formal dinner table, glaring at -

           Hemingway, at the other end, also beneath STUFFED ANIMAL 
           HEADS, the previously glimpsed Pilar’s crew between them... 

           Hemingway does indeed live well in Cuba.

                        Must’ve been seven hundred pounds!

           Hemingway glaring at Lucas as DR. SOTOLONGO (with pince nez):

                        I believe my brother was referring

                        Papa tried to harpoon it!

           Lucas, next to DON ANDRES, (in a PRIEST’s collar), stares at 
           Martha, who can’t abide this rum bunch, even in formal attire.

                                 DON ANDRES
                        With a .50 caliber machine gun we

                        tower, yes, Papa?

           ... as RAMON, the Hemingways’ COOK exchanges their dinner 
           plates, Martha tries to civilize the conversation -

                        Friendless, shoo!  Just push her 
                        off, Lucas...

           Lucas notices: there are CATS wandering all over...

                        will lose.

                        Unlike you, sir, I’ve never fought 
                        in a war so I’m not entitled to say.

                        You’ve come to the right place, Mr.

                        What’s your point, Marty?

           Hemingway’s look.  She surveys the room.  Walks out.  
           Hemingway glares down the table at Lucas -

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        You think this is all a game.

           Across the well-appointed room, Lucas doesn’t answer, but -

           INT. VIGIA “GRADE A” - NIGHT

           Smoking at a small desk, hunched over papers and a kerosene 
           lantern, Lucas writes in longhand in the converted dairy...

                        No, I think YOU think it’s a game.

           REVEAL - beside Lucas on the desk: a .357 Magnum. No game. 
           Finished, tired, he surveys his small, sparse quarters:  
           there’s a fireplace, a Spartan cot (with an extra shoved 
           sideways against a wall)... the amenities are outside...

           Abruptly, Lucas’ eye caught by a small LIGHT OUTSIDE... he’s 
           on the move at once...

           EXT. FINCA - NIGHT

           as Hemingway quietly steals behind the wheel of his Lincoln - 
           to confront Lucas climbing into the passenger seat opposite.

                                 LUCAS
                        We going somewhere?

           Hemingway’s annoyance, then he starts the car -

           GIRLS standing around, half-naked; also confused JOHNS and

           The girls scatter as she leads Hemingway and Lucas down the 
           hall, past rooms of the trade, until she reaches -

           INT. MARIA’S ROOM, LEOPOLDINA’S BROTHEL - NIGHT

           Hemingway and Lucas survey the BODY on the bed.  The throat 
           has been expertly slit, ear to ear; BLOOD is everywhere.

                                 LEOPOLDINA
                        He says he wants nice girl so I

           New and currently curled in a sobbing ball around the base of 
           the toilet in the small adjacent bathroom... 

           Confronted with a corpse, Lucas’ FBI training kicks in.  He 
           examines the body as Hemingway gently helps the girl up. 
           Puffy-eyed, but still gorgeous and looks to be about 21.

                        This his suitcase? Anything gone?

           Hemingway’s surprise at Lucas’ fluency.  But Lucas is now 
           examining the SUITCASE, opening it... more subtitles...

                                 MARIA
                        He first... wants only to talk. 
                        Suddenly, two men come.  They are

                        closet ...and then I hear a scream.

           She’s sobbing again.  Indifferent to her distress, Lucas 
           studies a US Passport from the suitcase: MARTIN KOHLER -

                                 LUCAS
                        Doesn’t look like theft. (Spanish)

           Lucas startles her, slitting open the back panel of the 
           suitcase with his knife, extracting a LUGER PISTOL... 

           And a slender NOTEBOOK filled with handwritten SYMBOLS...    
           He reacts, reverting to English -

           as the elevator doors clang open, admitting MALDONADO, a 6’6” 
           COP with a GOLD TOOTH and a wicked gleam in his eye plus two 
           more uniformed COPS.  Maldonado grabs the nearest JOHN by the 
           throat, lifting him off the ground, choking him to death as -

           INT. LEOPOLDINA’S BROTHEL, BACK STAIRS - NIGHT

           Hemingway, Lucas and Maria clatter down four flights, Lucas

           Maldonado kicking open door after door to empty rooms until 
           he bashes one completely off its hinges, REVEALING...   
           MARTIN KOHLER’s corpse in Maria’s blood-filled room.

                        Forged...

                                 MARIA
                        Senor, you please stop the car. I 
                        will go back to my village..?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        That is not safe.  You stay with 
                        us, while Caballo Loco hunts for 
                        you. (re the book) What’s that?

           Lucas now examining the book, flicking open the Zippo, 
           REVEALING pages of hand-written letters, numbers and ///es...

                                 LUCAS
                        We’ll talk about it later.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        What is your problem?

                                 LUCAS
                        My problem is I don’t trust whores.

                                 MARIA
                        Maldonado is cerdo - pig.  Like my 
                        brother. In my village, my brother, 
                        he rapes me. But my father, does 
                        not believe me ...so I run away...

                                 LUCAS
                        She’s pretty chatty for a whore 
                        whose trick just bought the farm. 

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Well get used to it ‘cause you’re 
                        in charge of her now.

           Lucas’ reaction: what a clusterfuck.

           INT. FINCA GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT

           Crook Factory HQ as Hemingway and Lucas study the book...

                                 LUCAS
                        Looks like an Abwehr code book. 

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Abwehr.  What’s Abwehr?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Abwehr... Can you break the code?

                                 LUCAS
                        Not without the code key. Most 
                        likely it’s a book in the radio 
                        room.  Something common like a 
                        Bible.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I’ve got a Bible...

                                 LUCAS
                        It has to be the same edition or 
                        the key won’t match the pagination.
                        Plus maybe it’s not the Bible.  And 
                        chances are it’ll be in German... 
                        Gonna be a long night...

           INT. VIGIA “GRADE A” - NIGHT

           by the kerosene lamp, Lucas lies on his cot, struggling over 
           the bewildering symbols of the code book as Maria paces...

                                 MARIA
                        ...is ...frio...

           She tugs the second cot beside his, climbing onto its 
           creaking frame beside him... It may be frio but she is HOT -

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Senor...

                                 LUCAS
                        Lucas, uh huh...

                                 MARIA
                        Si... I am...

           He fires off in bored, subtitled Spanish as she nears him -

                                 LUCAS
                        Don’t tell me: you’re alone, you’re 
                        frightened.  You like me...

                                 MARIA
                             (brightens; snuggling up)
                        Si... I- you me teach Inglese?
           CONTINUED:

           Lucas removes her arm where it has entwined round his neck...

                                 LUCAS
                        Forget it.

           He blows out the light, bringing us to -

           INT. LINCOLN, TRAVELING - DAY

           leaving the Finca behind with Hemingway framed by the car’s 
           rear window as he watches his wife driven away by Lucas.   

           Martha, in war correspondent’s gear, studies him -

                                 MARTHA
                        Mr. Lucas, or whatever your real 
                        name is, at dinner last night you 
                        refused to express an opinion about 
                        war because you’d never fought in 
                        one.  But that didn’t stop you from 
                        expressing an opinion about 
                        fiction, even though you’ve never 
                        read any.  For Whom The Bell Tolls 
                        just won the Pulitzer Prize.

                                 LUCAS
                        I don’t know what that is.

                                 MARTHA
                        ... Take care of my husband.

           i.e. he’s worth it.  She gets out, grabs her bags from the 
           back and heads confidently towards a boat... 
           CONTINUED:

           After watching her go, Lucas shifts his attention to the huge 
           yacht, almost a small ocean liner.  He frowns, squinting at 
           something and grabs BINOCULARS...  

           BINOC POV: TARPS cover stuff astern... Shifting his POV 
           REVEALS: an ursine, HEAD-SHAVEN MAN and a gorgeous, equally 
           NAKED BLOND, diving gracefully off the accommodation ladder 
           for a morning skinny dip in the harbor...

           Above them, UNIFORMED OFFICERS keep straight faces while a 
           CHRIS CRAFT circles the two swimmers protectively...

           As Lucas watches... so does the familiar street Urchin... 

           Only his focus is on the WHITE BUICK parked uphill and behind 
           Lucas: A MAN stands beside it, binoculars trained on Lucas.  

           INT. LOBBY, AMBOS MUNDOS HOTEL - SAME DAY

           Lucas approaches the desk...

                                 LUCAS
                        Any mail?  Lucas..?

                                 CONCIERGE
                        Just a minute, Sr. Lucas... let 
                        me... ah, just this newspaper.

           He hands over the folded Cuban newspaper...

                                 LUCAS
                        Thanks...

           Lucas crosses the lobby, opens the paper: a STREET MAP within. 

           A “BLIND” MAN with a cane clocks Lucas as he leaves...

           EXT. HAVANA SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           Lucas approaching, MAP in hand.  The Lincoln parked behind in 
           a rundown, dangerous-looking neighborhood -

           PAN UP TO Lucas’ FBI contact, DELGADO, (39), skinny, dressed 
           in a soiled white linen suit over a wife beater, topped by a 
           straw, short-brimmed Cuban fedora.  He looks both dangerous 
           and indifferent, holding out an expectant hand into which 
           Lucas sets his report. Delgado drops the fluttering pages...

                        only show me type report...”

           He gestures - there’s a small, boxed Royal typewriter on a 
           table.  And he drops the accent -

                                 DELGADO (CONT’D)
                        What’s with “Papa”’s boat?

                                 LUCAS
                        Read the report.  What can you tell 
                        me about The Southern Cross?

           Delgado inserts a toothpick...

                                 DELGADO
                        Heard about the radio operator huh? 
                        Did that psycho cop find the whore 
                        yet?  He’ll fuck her til she’s half 
                        dead before he cuts off her nose. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Who’s Theodore Shell and the blond 
                        who goes skinny dipping with him?

                                 DELGADO
                        Sonny, you’re supposed to be spying 
                        ON Hemingway, not FOR him.

                                 LUCAS
                        I need to make myself useful to him.

           Delgado wearily shoves over a THICK FILE labeled TOP SECRET. 

           Lucas reacts: there’s a photo of BALDY on the inside cover -

                        Schlegel?

           EXT. HAVANA STREETS - DAY

           Lucas, making sure he’s not followed, carries the typewriter 
           briskly back to where he left the Lincoln, now surrounded by 
           kids on the point of stripping it, when he sees -

           The WHITE BUICK parked across the street, the DRIVER leaning 
           against the fender: they’ve been waiting for him.  Sighing, 
           Lucas crosses to the car.  The driver holds open the rear 
           door and Lucas climbs in -

           INT. BUICK - DAY

           Sitting in back is a (relatively) HAIRLESS, SHORT MAN WITH  
           (slightly) HUNCHED SHOULDERS - but he has a warm smile...

                        make sure your friend’s car isn’t 
                        touched.

                        He’s not my friend.

           As the driver, now behind the Buick’s wheel, pulls away... 

                                 WALLACE BETA PHILLIPS
                        “Papa”, then, let’s say...

                                 LUCAS
                        Seems like as long as I’m with 
                        “Papa”, I’ll never be lonely... 
                        This about the FBI doing illegal 
                        stuff in Cuba?  Your friend Fleming 
                        already made that speech...

                        Much worse I’m afraid. This involves 
                        the security of the United States it-

                                 LUCAS
                        I’m sick of this bullshit. People 
                        are dying in this goddamn war. If 
                        you have evidence, let’s have it. 

                                 WALLACE BETA PHILLIPS
                        We were sort of counting on you to 
                        supply the evidence, Special Agent-

                                 LUCAS
                        Stop the goddamn car.  Now.

           The car stops at a signal from Phillips, who smiles -

                                 WALLACE BETA PHILLIPS
                        Should you wish to reconsider, 
                        Special Agent Lucas, we’ll be in 
                        room 314 at the Nacional.

                                 LUCAS
                        Don’t hold your breath.

           He slams out -

           EXT. HAVANA STREET - DAY

           The unsmiling URCHIN watches as Lucas, still hefting the 
           typewriter, stalks back, gets in the Lincoln and peels off...

           INT. FINCA GUEST HOUSE - DAY

           Crook Factory HQ abuzz with activity as Lucas enters.  Agents 
           we’ve met, the old DOORMAN, the Floridita WAITER, Don Andres, 
           the casual priest, also the “Blind” Man, as well as some we 
           haven’t, in and out with info as Wolfer takes notes.  

           Hemingway, Fuentes, Sinsky and Pilar’s crew hover over a big 
           table with a large MAP of Havana Harbor, a BRICK marking the 
           location of the yacht -

                     FLORIDITA WAITER
                                                        HEMINGWAY
                                              You took your time...
           One of the crew boasted to 
           me: she’s 320 feet long...

                                 LUCAS
                        I went to church.
           CONTINUED:

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        We think we’re onto something.
                        According to Agent 22, Shell is 
                        giving a big party tonight...

                                 LUCAS
                        Which is 22? - seems like he’s the 
                        only one who knows what he’s doing.

                                 WOLFER
                        Party’s gonna be black tie...

                                 LUCAS
                        I guess Shell’s not losing sleep 
                        over his murdered radio operator...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        As I was saying: I’ll get myself 
                        invited...

                                 LUCAS
                             (sarcasm leaking...)
                        How will that work, exactly?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                             (grins)
                        I’m famous...

                                 LUCAS
                        How could I forget.  So then what?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        During the party, I sneak into the 
                        radio shack and swipe the book...

           Lucas flops into a chair. His action causes the rest to stop.

                                 HEMINGWAY (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong with that?

           Lucas lights up, blows smoke. Torn between fatigue and fury -

                                 LUCAS
                        Where do I start?  For one thing, 
                        you don’t know where the radio room 
                        is.  For another, you don’t know 
                        which book is the code key; for a 
                        third, you can’t steal the book 
                        because once they find it’s gone 
                        they’ll just change the code.  
                        Apart from that, it’s brilliant.

           Hemingway’s awkward pause; then he tries to regroup -
           CONTINUED:

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I could write down the names of all 
                        the books and the editions of each.

                                 LUCAS
                        Maybe in fiction no one will bother 
                        you while you sit and copy them. 
                        But this is real life. They’ll have 
                        to be memorized. And fast. Can you 
                        do that?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        ...no.  (realizes) But you can.

           They’re looking at him. Lucas’ turn to hesitate, then, dry -  

                                 LUCAS
                        They taught me at the State Department. 

           A FISHERMAN comes in, panting from a long bike ride...

                                 FISHERMAN
                        ...she’s got a crew of 30 plus five 
                        officers and the engine gang..!

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Only one problem: we still don’t 
                        know where the radio room is.

           Lucas rolls out the BLUEPRINTS Delgado gave him of the yacht.

                                 LUCAS
                        Wrong.   

           Hemingway’s face.  Who IS this guy?

           INT. VIGIA “GRADE A” - DAY

           Lucas hurrying in, stops short: Maria is shakily pointing a .22 
           in his general direction.  She looks even more beautiful... 
           They now speak a mixture of English and subtitled Spanish.

                                 MARIA
                        Ayi, Sr. Lucas..!

                                 LUCAS
                        Maria... Put the gun down.  Gently.  

           After a moment’s pause, she does. He moves slowly; takes it.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        I guess we forgot about you.  
           CONTINUED:

                        Where did you get this thing?

                                 MARIA
                        Papa give me in case Caballo Loco-

                                 LUCAS
                        Great.  Look, I’m in a hurry...

           Lucas is pulling off his shirt, changing...  She proffers a 
           copy of For Whom The Bell Tolls.

                                 MARIA
                        And Papa give this book he write. 
                        He say, girl have my name, Maria... 
                        but I... no can read...

                                 LUCAS
                        Uh huh...

                                 MARIA
                        Jose... is still... frio here...

                                 LUCAS
                        Frio?  Cold?  Here’s what you do.

           Furious, he rips the book in two.  As she gasps, he takes the 
           second half and shoves it in the fireplace -

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        You scrunch up all this shit and 
                        you make yourself a fire, okay? 

           The ZIPPO lights the fire and he starts out...

                                 MARIA
                        But... where you going?

           Wild YELLS OVER -

           EXT. HAVANA HARBOR - NIGHT

           as a flotilla of 5 FISHING BOATS roar out, carrying a load of 
           DRUNKS, hollering, drinking and whooping it up.  WHIP PAN TO:

           The Southern Cross, ablaze with light, a floating city, 
           SCORES OF BLACK-TIED GUESTS, a cocktail PIANO tinkling...

           INT. SOUTHERN CROSS, LOUNGE - NIGHT

           “TEDDY SHELL”, in white tux, being charming to a GLAMOROUS 
           CROWD, raising his glass, etc. as he becomes aware of YELLS!
           EXT. BOAT DECK, SOUTHERN CROSS

           OFFICERS react to the approaching drunken FISHERMEN armada. 
           AN EXPLOSION!  The officers yell warnings to -

           The CHRIS CRAFT, which tries to interpose itself... but she’s 
           like a terrier confronting too many berserk sheep...

           CLOSER ON THE LEAD FISHING BOAT - REVEAL HEMINGWAY, WOLFER...

           IN ADJACENT BOATS, more Crook Factory “drunks”, (Sinsky, 
           Fuentes, et al), swigging from bottles and breaking out -

           FIREWORKS, ROMAN CANDLES, SMOKE and CHERRY BOMBS - all manner 
           of July 4th mayhem, which they fire, throw and shoot in the 
           direction of the gigantic yacht... explosions everywhere...

           ABOARD THE CHRIS CRAFT - a GOON fires a machine gun burst-!

           BULLETS whizz past Hemingway, who doesn’t flinch, even though 
           others duck.  He’s exhilarated - just like with the marlin.

           ON THE SOUTHERN CROSS - the PIANO ceases as fancy GUESTS come 
           on deck to watch frantic OFFICERS shouting at the Chris Craft 
           “No shooting!!”  “Cease Fire!”  The last thing they want as -

           Shell-Schlegel races on deck, screaming in a Teutonic accent-

                                 SCHLEGEL
                        Swine!  Vot do you think you are 
                        doing!? I will call the Coast 
                        Guard!!  Get their names!!!

           ON THE LEAD FISHING BOAT - Hemingway grins, keeps going...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Vaya con dios!

           And hurls another cherry bomb, yes, indeed, quite a pitching 
           arm!  He’s mimicked by others as -

           OFFICERS on the yacht run in circles trying to wave off the 
           “fishermen” as Roman Candles, etc. explode, lighting up the 
           sky from all sides like an artillery barrage...

           HEMINGWAY fires a smoke rocket... that lands on the tarps 
           astern of the yacht...  SMOKE billowing and VOICES crying in 
           sudden alarm - FIRE!!  

           Shell-Schlegel furious, fists pounding the railing...

           Hemingway and friends laughing to beat the band, Wolfer 
           enjoying another drink... and now for the grand finale...
           CONTINUED:

           The Keystone Cops - or rather: THE HAVANA FIREBOATS roaring 
           out, SIRENS shrieking, LIGHTS flashing, MEN IN FIREMEN’S GEAR 
           on deck with GRAPPLING HOOKS!

                                 SCHLEGEL
                        No, NO...!  Stay away..!

                                 AN OFFICER
                        Mr. Shell, it’s the fire brigade. 
                        They have priority in port!

           Schlegel looks at him wild-eyed as SMOKE billows aft... A 
           FIREFIGHTER in hat and slicker races up the accommodation 
           ladder and yells in subtitled Spanish...

                                 FIREFIGHTER
                        Gangway!

           And runs aft, trailed by more FIREMEN as Schlegel watches in 
           helpless fury while the Chris Craft chases futilely after 
           circling, taunting fishermen of the Crook Factory... 

           Oaths in English and Spanish are traded across the water as 
           fireworks continue to pop and explode... Hemingway, laughing 
           like hell, swigs another drink as -

           INT. SOUTHERN CROSS, BELOW DECK - NIGHT

           One FIREMAN, (Lucas) making his way with an AXE down a long 
           corridor towards the bow... He knows just what he’s looking 
           for and yanks open the door marked, RADIO ROOM -

           INT. SOUTHERN CROSS, RADIO ROOM - NIGHT

           as VOICES outside yell in confusion, Lucas scans the shelves 
           above the communications gear: all tech manuals in English.

                                 LUCAS
                        Shit.

           He switches on the KLAXON, adding to the chaos before leaving. 
           Ureahhh-Ureahh-Ureahhh!!! 

           INT. SOUTHERN CROSS, BELOW DECK - NIGHT

           Lucas another deck down, counting cabins as he does, 1, 2, 3, 
           4... when he collides with a BLOND IN A GLAMOROUS EVENING 
           GOWN as smoke belches out of the air intake ducts...  

           INGA ARVAD.  As Lucas pushes past, in a German accent -

                                 WOMAN
                        What are you doing here?

                                 LUCAS
                        Perdon, senorita!  Fuego!

           INT. SOUTHERN CROSS, MARTIN KOHLER’S CABIN - NIGHT

           as Lucas bursts in and rummages on the lone bookshelf: DREI 
           KAMERADEN, GEOPOLITIK, DEUTSCHE LITERATUR ANTHOLOGIE... 

           VOICES get nearer, FEET pounding as Lucas memorizes aloud -

                                 LUCAS
                        Drei Kameraden by Remarque, Voss, 
                        1938, Haushaufer’s Geopolitik, 
                        Heidelberg Press, 1926, Mein Kampf-

           That’s all.  Lucas tears out, passing a SHIP’S OFFICER -

                                 OFFICER
                        Hey -!

           And dashes up stairways past other GUESTS and CREW, yanking 
           off his fireman’s hat, slicker, boots...

           EXT. SOUTHERN CROSS, BOAT DECK - NIGHT

           explosions and fireworks still going off as Lucas emerges, 
           now only swim trunks. Unnoticed in the commotion, he DIVES 
           FOUR STORIES INTO THE SEA!  As he hits -

           INT. HAVANA SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           dressed as before, Delgado looks up from Lucas’ typed report.  
           Next to him on the beat up desk, are piles of US DOLLARS...

                                 DELGADO
                        This is shit. 

                                 LUCAS 
                        But it’s typed shit. 

                                 DELGADO
                        Now you’re pulling bag jobs on a 
                        legally US-registered yacht?  

           As he speaks, Delgado is stuffing wads of DOLLARS into a

                                 LUCAS
                        I have to gain his trust... 

                                 DELGADO
                        First it was make yourself “useful” 
                        ...now it’s “gain his trust”.  You 
                        turn this in, you’ll lose Hoover’s. 
                        Re-write it. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Re-write it how?

                                 DELGADO
                        Take out the whore for starters.  
                        Where is she, anyway?

                                 LUCAS
                             (eyeing the money)
                        Who knows?  Maldonado’s turning over 
                        every stone but it’s dumb, she didn’t 
                        kill Kohler.  What else?

                                 DELGADO
                        Take out you had anything to do with 
                        finding the code-book.  Make it like 
                        it was all the Crook Factory so 
                        Hoover’s hands stay clean.  What?

                                 LUCAS
                        Nothing.  Just never occurred to me 
                        he’d ever stumble onto anything.  
                        What’s all the money for?

           Delgado strokes his thin mustache.  His soiled linen jacket 
           deliberately pulls open to REVEAL a PISTOL in its holster...

                                 DELGADO
                        Curiosity killed the cat, Joe.  

           He rises and leaves, taking the BRIEFCASE with him. 

           Lucas clocks this.  After a moment, he decides to follow...

           EXT. HAVANA STREETS - DAY

           MUSIC! Havana, heart of Cuba, a riot of color and intoxicating 
           rhythm as Lucas keeps his distance amid the jangling chaos. 
           Delgado is good at shaking tails, but Lucas is good, too...  

           SEVERAL CUTS as Delgado weaves his way through Havana, 
           through the Cathedral Square, the Capitol (a copy of ours).. 
           In the Parque Central, Delgado sits on a bench beside...
           CONTINUED:

           MALDONADO, still in uniform!  The cop opens the briefcase, 
           briefly examining its contents... 

           Lucas blinks as the cop riffles a wad of US DOLLARS before 
           replacing them and walking off with the briefcase, never 
           looking at Delgado.  Lucas confused: which one to follow?

           Delgado rises and Lucas waits before following him... 

           MORE STREETS, TRAFFIC and pulsing MUSIC, leading to...

           EXT. CIGAR FACTORY - DAY

           Delgado enters... then... Lucas...

           INT. CIGAR FACTORY - DAY

           a long, human-wooden assembly line with WOMEN at different 
           stations, all fashioning CIGARS at different stages as -

           A READER at a lectern reads Hemingway’s A FAREWELL TO ARMS 
           aloud (in Spanish) to the busy workers... 

           Delgado vanishes at the far end of the long room as Lucas 
           enters, goes after him -

           INT. CIGAR FACTORY OFFICES - DAY

           in time to see Delgado open a door, inside which is the ARYAN 
           Lucas shot in the face in Mexico City.  He is disfigured by 
           the bullet wound as he snaps up an open palm to Delgado -

                                 SCARRED MAN
                        Heil Hitler.

           As Lucas clocks this once-handsome, face, the door is CLOSED.  
           HOLD ON Lucas, mind racing...

           Lucas knocking.  Phillips’ Driver opens the door -

                                 LUCAS
                        Where is he?
           INT. ROOM 314 - DAY, LATER

           as Phillips, short, yes, balding, yes and hunched, yes, but 
           charming nonetheless, hands Lucas a drink, which he declines -  

                                 WALLACE BETA PHILLIPS
                        What was it you wished to see us 
                        about, Mr. Lucas?

           Us.  Now Lucas clocks Fleming as he turns from the bar -

                                 LUCAS
                        You were right. 

                                 FLEMING
                        Well you must admit I tried to warn-

                                 WALLACE BETA PHILLIPS
                        Nice job on the yacht by the way. 
                        How’re you doing with Kohler’s code-
                        book?  

           Lucas’ surprise - as he looks from one to the other...

                                 FLEMING
                        May we see it?

                                 LUCAS
                        Try again.

                                 WALLACE BETA PHILLIPS
                             (friendly smile)
                        You came here for a reason, didn’t 
                        you, my boy?  

           Lucas’ hesitation.  True...  He sighs.

                                 LUCAS
                        We’re waiting for copies of the 
                        code-keys to get here, but even 
                        then... I’m not great with codes.

                                 WALLACE BETA PHILLIPS
                        Perhaps the OSS can be of help. 
                        Provided we’re kept out of it.

                                 LUCAS
                             (eyes narrowing)
                        In exchange for..?  

                                 WALLACE BETA PHILLIPS
                        A share of what you decipher. Come,

                        But the offer isn’t open-ended. 
                        This lovely suite costs money and 
                        we too must live within our means.

           Lucas in over his head.  Bites a fingernail...  Then -

                                 LUCAS
                        Alright.  At my discretion.

                                 WALLACE BETA PHILLIPS
                        The OSS will trust to your...

           EXT. PILAR, CASABLANCA BOATWORKS - DAY

           amid CARPENTERS and CABINETMAKERS, Wolfer and Fuentes get a

                        here’s hidden closets to hold -

           The man grins as he displays two LARGE SIGNS meant to be 
           draped over the port and starboard gunwales amidships:

                                 WOLFER
                             (grins)
                        What’re we waiting for?

           INT. VIGIA “GRADE A”

           waiting for Lucas, sweating in the small, hot place, trying 
           without success, to make sense of Kohler’s code-book...

                                 LUCAS
                        Fuck.

           A KNOCK and Hemingway enters with a PACKAGE -

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        You got it?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Special delivery from New York in 
                        the Embassy pouch, via Agent 22.

           He stands aside to REVEAL... the URCHIN, nut brown and 
           skinny, grinning with crooked teeth.

           Lucas is floored.  In Spanish:

                                 LUCAS
                        You’re Agent 22?

                                 SANTIAGO
                        Si.  Papa call me 22.

           Lucas tears open the package to find:  Whew -! 
           CONTINUED:

           The GERMAN BOOKS, all in the correct editions and years...   

                                 LUCAS
                        22 - what’s your real name?

                        Good work Santiago.  Tomorrow, 
                        maybe you can help me?

           The kid looks at Hemingway, who nods, ruffles the kid’s hair -

                                 SANTIAGO
                        Si, senor Lucas. Adios, Papa.

           He chases out.  Lucas regards the GEOPOLITIK volume -

                                 LUCAS
                        This should make the job a hell of 
                        a lot easier. (looks around) 
                        Where’s the whore?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                             (smiles)
                        Dinner’s at seven. We’ve got 
                        special guests so we’re dressing. 
                        Don’t be late. 

           He leaves Lucas confused.  Lucas picks up GEOPOLITIK.  

                                 LUCAS
                        Talk to me, honey.

           CLOSE ON THE DECRYPTION PROCESS - SEVERAL DISSOLVES -

           INT. VIGIA “GRADE A” - LATER

           Lucas, using the grid and the Geopolitik volume as code key, 
           copies out Kohler’s messages, the letters running together. 

           Lucas’ wide-eyed reaction as he realizes what he’s copying. 
           He looks at his watch: almost 7. Damn. He grabs his penciled 
           papers, folds them, pulling off his shirt to get cleaned up.

           EXT. FINCA - NIGHT

           Lucas, now in jacket and tie, hurrying past the huge pool, 
           the lush grounds...
           INT. FINCA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           as Lucas enters and sees Hemingway, also neatened up -

                                 LUCAS
                        Alright, I’ve managed to-

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Joe, let me introduce our guests, 
                        Theodore Shell of Marathon Steel
                        and Miss Inga Arvad, (pointed) who 
                        like, you, works for the Museum of 
                        Natural History.  Joe Lucas...

           Lucas is stunned.  Appalled.  Does she recognize him? 

           Hemingway, ignorant of their previous encounter, is amused... 

           But that’s nothing compared to Lucas’ reaction when drinks 
           are served by Maria, dressed as a domestic!  He stays cool -  

                                 LUCAS
                        How do you do?

           Schlegel practically clicks his patent leather heels -

                                 SCHLEGEL
                        Herr Lucas... a pleasure.

           Maria, trembling, steps forward with a drink on a tray.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I was just telling Herr-

                                 SCHLEGEL
                        Please.  Teddy...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Teddy, yes, how sorry I was not to 
                        have made it to his soiree the 
                        other night.  (to Schlegel) I 
                        gather there was some trouble?

                                 SCHLEGEL
                             (laughs)
                        Some rowdy fishermen... drunk...

           The icily beautiful woman stares at Lucas -

                                 INGA
                        ... have we met before, Mr. Lucas?

           She says nothing, can’t place it -

                                 SCHLEGEL
                        Dr. Arvad is an archeologist...

           To his disgust, one of the CATS rubs up against Schlegel...

                        Marine research - were you hired by 
                        Dr. Cullen?  He’s head of the 
                        department, isn’t he?

           Dead silence.   Lucas smiles -

                                 LUCAS
                        I think your memory plays you false. 
                        Dr. Cullen died three years ago. I 
                        was brought in by Professor Petrie.

                        Oh, yes, of course.

           Hemingway stunned by Lucas’ performance as Maria announces -

                        Well, Papa, Teddy is kind enough to 
                        put the ship at my disposal.  When 
                        she has finished repairs, we will 
                        head for the Peruvian coast. I am 
                        hoping to find traces of Viking 
                        exploration.

                                 LUCAS
                        Viking?

                                 INGA
                        Yes.  We know the Vikings landed in 
                        North America long before Columbus. 
                        It is my theory they were also in 
                        South America before the Spaniards.

                                 HEMINGWAY

                        No disrespect intended. But what 
                        about your own safety? (their 
                        looks) There’s not a lot of U-boats 
                        this far south, but still-

                                 SCHLEGEL
                        We are a research vessel. We are 
                        safe. (but he can’t resist): Though it 
                        does look as though Hitler will defeat 
                        the Russians.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Oh, I wouldn’t be too sure. A year 
                        ago, they said he’d defeat England 
                        and they’re still around.  What 
                        kind of repairs?

                        our crew, he became... ill...

           Maria, taking pantomime instructions from Ramon, pours more 
           wine for Lucas, who drinks - and Lucas doesn’t really drink.

                                 HEMINGWAY

                        Well, I must replace him...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Interesting.  I mean the notion 
                        that people can be replaced. 

           Hemingway has finally said something that interests Lucas.

           EXT. FINCA DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           A LIMO idles as Inga and Schlegel say their good-nights. 
           Hemingway has had a deal to drink... Lucas, too.

           INT. VIGIA “GRADE A” - NIGHT

           Hemingway, with glasses on, reading Lucas’ work -

                        “Commence Operation Raven”.  Hey,

                        Kohler was American-born - they 
                        were lazy.  Where’s the whore?

                        I doubt it.  22’s in the kitchen, 
                        scarfing down left-overs. This 
                        stuff all runs together...

                                 LUCAS
                        It’s basically a simple alphabet-
                        numerical substitution where K 
                        equals O and X is a dummy. Easy 
                        enough when you have the key...

           Huh?  Hemingway sinks into a chair by the kerosene lantern,

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Come again?

                                 LUCAS
                        Those numbers - that’s a numerical 
                        code and we don’t know how to read 
                        it.  But the rest, it sort of 
                        dropped into our laps, didn’t it?   

                                 HEMINGWAY
                             (pointed)
                        You mean like you showing up with 
                        blueprints of the Southern Cross? 

                                 LUCAS
                             (realizing)
                        In a way...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Are you nuts?  Look what the Crook 
                        Factory went through the other-
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUCAS
                        Yeah, I know, we jumped through 
                        some hoops and if we sit tight and 
                        their new radio operator doesn’t 
                        change the code, we may find out 
                        what Operation Raven is that’s 
                        commencing. (gnaws at him)  But why 
                        can’t we read this number thing? 
                        ‘Cause we’re not supposed to?  

           Lucas blows smoke, eyes closed again as Hemingway studies him-

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        You really don’t drink, do you?

                                 LUCAS
                        I try to keep a clear head.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        To observe what’s going on.  From 
                        the outside?  To see things as they 
                        are?  To see what’s true? 

                                 LUCAS
                        If I can...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        You’re describing me.

                                 LUCAS
                             (eyes open)
                        You?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Except, I like to drink. (smiles) 
                        Lucas, you did great work today.   
                        I don’t know who the hell you are, 
                        but whoever sent you picked the 
                        right man for the job.

           Lucas’ conflicted reaction.  Hemingway rises -

                                 HEMINGWAY (CONT’D)
                        There’s only one thing I don’t get. 
                        (Lucas’ look) What do you care about, 
                        Lucas?  

                                 LUCAS
                        I could ask you the same question.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I could answer.  Being alive.
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUCAS
                        You’re living...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        You didn’t hear me. 

           He walks out, leaving Lucas to his complex thoughts...

           LATER - 

           Lucas typing his report, cigarette dangling...  Then the 
           OUTSIDE SHOWER goes on.  She’s back.  Lucas tries to 
           concentrate.  Can’t.  Then the water’s turned off.  Hold on 
           LUCAS as Maria comes in draped in a white towel.  Which she 
           drops.  He doesn’t turn.  She waits, naked, behind him... 

           Her gorgeous offer spurned again, she crawls under the sheet.  
           As Lucas resumes typing, HEAR MOUNTING CROWD ROAR OVER...

           INT. JAI LAI COURT, HAVANA - DAY

           the fastest game in the world in progress before HUNDREDS   
           of SCREAMING - and BETTING - FANS...  DISCOVER -

           PATCHI, among the EIGHT TEAMS, rotating on and off the field 
           with blinding dexterity and speed... the ball going 200 mph -

           REVEAL SLICED OPEN TENNIS BALLS thrown from the crowd to the 
           BOOKMAKERS - SLIPS OF PAPER with BETS stuffed into the balls.

           FANS’ HEADS turning back and forth to catch the rapid action.

           EXCEPT FOR ONE:  Agent 22 has eyes only for...

           Smiling Teddy Schlegel, sliding between SPECTATORS - he’s 
           carrying AN ATTACHE CASE...

           As Santiago watches, Schlegel sits right next to...MALDONADO, 
           watching the game in uniform.   Santiago looks to -

           DON ANDRES, the priest, in the crowd.  Does he also see?

           Don Andres nods... he’s seeing...

           Santiago watches as -

           Maldonado rises and squeezes past SCREAMING FANS.  He’s 
           carrying the attache case.

           Santiago, just another kid amongst the crowd, also rises and, 
           unseen by the psycho cop, follows...
           EXT. HAVANA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           incredibly lush and green as Lucas drives the Lincoln to an 
           abandoned farmhouse and gets out, holding the LATEST MAP.

           Sitting on a motorcycle, Delgado is waiting.  Lucas gets out 
           of the car, hands him his report...

                                 LUCAS
                        How come we’re here instead of the 
                        safe house?

                                 DELGADO 
                        I don’t always feel safe in safe 
                        houses. Especially with you. What’s 
                        happening with Papa’s boat? Last I 
                        heard the taxpayers paid for 40,000 
                        dollars worth of weapons and 
                        communications gear. We’d like to 
                        get something for our money.

                                 LUCAS
                        The taxpayers’ll have to wait...

           Delgado, grinding a toothpick, is scanning Lucas’ report -

                                 DELGADO
                        So Maldonado’s getting paid by the 
                        Abwehr...

                                 LUCAS
                        Same day he deposits 20 grand in a 
                        local bank account. (casual)  I hear 
                        the guy takes payoffs from all over.

           Delgado, still on the motorcycle, stays poker-faced...  

                                 DELGADO
                        Which agent saw the hand-off? (no 
                        reply) Who saw Maldonado make his 
                        bank deposit? (nothing)  Lucas, why 
                        do I get the feeling you’re holding 
                        out on me?

                                 LUCAS
                        Naming names is not part of my job.

                                 DELGADO
                        Your job?  Lucas, you don’t even 
                        know who you’re working for any 
                        more.  Didn’t the Director warn you 
                        not to fall for Hemingway? 
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUCAS
                        Go fuck yourself.

                                 DELGADO
                        I would if I could but don’t change 
                        the subject.  Did you crack the 
                        code, Yes or No?

                                 LUCAS
                        It’s all in there.  Saboteurs on 
                        Long Island... old news...

           Delgado stares at Lucas.  Abruptly, he pockets the papers, 
           stands on the kick starter and takes off in an angry ROAR...  

           Lucas watches him go, then calls out...

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Okay...

           From the tall grass, Santiago emerges wheeling a small 
           motorbike, grinning, as always...  Lucas frowns...

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Where’d you get that?

                                 SANTIAGO
                             (cheerfully)
                        I borrow it. Now I follow senor 
                        Delgado?

                                 LUCAS
                        No. Stay away from Delagado. You 
                        take this (another set of papers) 
                        to room 314 at the Hotel Nacional.

                                 SANTIAGO
                        Si, 314-

                                 LUCAS
                        Wait. (he stops) Santiago: be 
                        careful...

                                 SANTIAGO
                             (laughs)
                        Siempre-!

                                 LUCAS
                        I’m serious. You stay away from 
                        Delgado and from Caballo Loco.  
                        They are dangerous. (looks at him)  
                        Why are you even doing this?

                             (grins at the question)
                        For Papa!

           He’s off... leaving Lucas to ponder the boy’s devotion.

           Don Andres in turn hails a CAB, but doesn’t get in, merely 
           speaks to the DRIVER.  The cab takes off...

           INT. VIGIA “GRADE A” - DAY

           Lucas staring bleary-eyed at the inscrutable number code.  On 
           the desk: the typewriter, out of its case... 

                                 HEMINGWAY’S VOICE
                        Any luck..?

                                 LUCAS
                        Not so far...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I was looking for you...

                        ...I was in church.

                        Confessing your sins? (no answer)
                        You go often.  You must have a 
                        great many sins to confess. I see 
                        you have a typewriter.  Are you a 
                        writer, Lucas?

                                 LUCAS
                        ...Sometimes...

           Hemingway sits, studies him - he doesn’t miss much.
           CONTINUED:

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        What do you write about, Lucas?  Do 
                        you write honestly?  Do you write 
                        what’s true?

                                 LUCAS
                        Do you?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I try.  I write about honor.

                                 LUCAS
                        I thought we were discussing truth.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        It’s the same thing. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Is it?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        The only thing.  (looks around)
                        The girl took off...

                                 LUCAS
                        What?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        That’s why I was trying to find 
                        you.  Back to her godawful family, 
                        probably.  Did you upset her?

                                 LUCAS
                        ... I wasn’t the one who turned her 
                        into a maid.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I thought it might be an improvement.

                        Much heavier, but the engines have 
                        more pep.  Done much boating?

                        You stay in touch?

                                 LUCAS
                        ... he died in the flu epidemic...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                             (sympathetic reaction)
                        ...Go ahead...

           Lucas takes the wheel in rising swells as Hemingway watches. 
           On the horizon is the enormous Southern Cross... 

                                 LUCAS
                        Stay with her..?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        They’d only insist we join them for 
                        lunch.  Let’s look for U-boats. There’s 
                        a naval outpost up the coast at Cayo 
                        Confites. We’ll put in there and let 
                        the kid have a swim.

           He points, smiling.  In the bow, little Santiago is 
           practically dancing for joy, salt spray in his upturned face.

                                 LUCAS
                        He calls you Papa, too.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Don’t begrudge him, I’m the only 
                        Papa he’s got.
           CONTINUED:

           Santiago gives Lucas a reassuring high sign: (his papers made 
           it to room 314), as Wolfer ascends the flying bridge...

           Hemingway nods, descends to help Fuentes, Sinsky and Patchi 
           drape the Natural History Museum “research” signs amidships.

                                 LUCAS
                        Guess I’ll check below and see if

                        Somehow I knew you’d know how to 
                        work all that stuff. Me, I just know 
                        how to shoot things.  (shrugs 
                        amiably)  And drink.

           a small cove, featuring a Cuban “naval” outpost... It’s little 
           more than a shack manned by 4 ragged but friendly GUYS IN 
           UNIFORM, laughing, their boredom relieved by visitors. 

           Scuttling away from the humans, CRABS THE SIZE OF BASKETBALLS. 

           Hemingway et al spreading out a Fuentes-cooked picnic while 
           chortling Santiago swims out towards one edge of the cove...

           INT. PILAR, HEAD - DAY

           Patchi comes in to use the john only to find Lucas wedged in 
           the sweltering box, wearing HEADPHONES amid all the gear...

                                 PATCHI
                        O Dios...

                                 PATCHI
                        Si.  You don’t wanna have lunch?

                                 LUCAS
                        That’s okay...

           Patchi smiles with his brilliant white teeth and leaves Lucas 
           to his claustrophobic misery.  SOUNDS coming through the tin 
           cans... familiar chatter, signals.  Boring.  Lucas fiddles 
           with dials, wiping sweat from his forehead and eyes...
           CONTINUED:

           Falling asleep... when he HEARS a different set of BEEPS! 
           Instantly alert, Lucas fumbles for the GEOLPOLITIK volume 
           close to hand, plus a pad and pencil... starts writing, eyes 
           widening at the content...

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit... “2300 hours...

                        Tiburon!  Tiburon!  Santiago!

           Lucas knows what that means... Torn, he keeps listening and 
           writing as the frantic cries continue...

                           LUCAS
                                                         VOICES

           Point Roma, Bahia de Cadiz”!

           He rips off the headphones and races topside to see -

           EXT. CAYO CONFITES - DAY

           The guys on shore shouting to Santiago, who is directly in 
           the path of a HUGE APPROACHING SHARK’S FIN -

           No one has a weapon -

           Hemingway alone is thrashing powerfully through the sea to 
           get to the doomed child...

           Lucas races for the weapons locker and grabs a BAR, shoving 
           bullets into the chamber and taking aim...

           HIS POV - Pilar swaying at anchor, plus Hemingway and the boy 
           between his shot and the SHARK make it impossible...

                                 LUCAS

           SEVERAL ANGLES of Hemingway’s desperate swim...

           And the shark’s inexorable approach...  

           Lucas, struggling to find the shot...

           The shark within 50 feet of Santiago...

           As Hemingway grabs the kid and starts swimming back, 
           absolutely no hesitation as the monster closes in and...
           CONTINUED:

           Lucas FIRES!  

           And hits the shark, which flails in spasm, thrashing in 
           widening swirls of its own blood as Hemingway drags the boy 
           to shore and the rest rush over to where the writer lies on 
           the beach, half dead...

                                 SANTIAGO

                        Heroism is grace under pressure.

           Lucas is completely awed by this kind of guts -

                                 LUCAS
                        Okay, so you’re a hero.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I was talking about you.

           Lucas with headphones, continues to transcribe intercepts as -
           Hemingway glasses on, crammed in with him, reads... since the 
           shark, something is different between them now...

                                 HEMINGWAY

                        sub was still here. Bahia de Cadiz- 

           He consults the MAP OF CUBA tacked to the bulkhead -

                        That’s only 28 miles from Cojimar.  
                        (realizing)  Hey, how come they 
                        didn’t change the code?

           Lucas tugs off the headphones -
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUCAS
                        If my theory’s right, it’s so we 
                        can read it.  Two couriers, 28 
                        miles, one week. There’s more... 
                        convoy sailing timetables...

           He holds up more intercepts.  Hemingway smiles.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Kipling was right. (Lucas’ look) 
                        Kipling called espionage The Great 
                        Game.

                                 LUCAS  
                        The boy okay?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        He will be.  What do we do with 
                        these? (i.e. the messages)

                        Tell Ambassador Braden?

           After hesitating, Lucas hands the papers to Hemingway -

           Wolfer steering on the flying bridge, joined by Lucas under a 
           million brilliant STARS...  Wolfer hands off his plate -

                        Marinated swordfish with pasta and

           Lucas tastes the dinner - yummm.

                                 LUCAS
                        Why does Hemingway call you Wolfer?

                                 WOLFER
                        When his boys were little, they

                        Perdon, senor. We find this girl on 
                        the road - she says she knows you.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Of course she does.  Dorila, did 
                        you run off again? Officers, my 
                        thanks.  The girl works for me, but 
                        she is hardly any use at all-

                        from the Havana police-

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Hav- don’t be ridiculous. Look at 
                        her.  This girl has never been to 
                        Havana in her life. 

           She is indeed a tattered mess.  Off their hesitation -

                        Dorila, go inside now and get 
                        cleaned up... quick-quick -!

           He’s absently taking her from the overawed cops and gently 
           shoving her up the stairs towards the front door...

                        Officers, please allow me to thank

           Where the road dead-ends near another of those abandoned, 
           roofless, farmhouse/shacks.  Hemingway and Lucas get out, 
           leaving the headlights on... 

           It doesn’t take them long to spot the body... 
           CONTINUED:

           Santiago lies on his back in a ditch - his throat slit from 
           ear to ear, rain dripping down on the little boy...

           Hemingway is turned to stone.  Lucas squats, forcing himself 
           to examine, then looks up -

                                 LUCAS
                        You still think it’s a Great Game?

           Hemingway stares at Lucas, then pushes him aside and tenderly 
           gathers the corpse in his arms...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I will kill Maldonado.

           He starts back to the car... Lucas calls after him -

                                 LUCAS
                        Have you ever killed anybody?
                        Aside from all those animals -    
                        and this boy? 

           Hemingway stops, his back to the enraged Lucas -

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Have you?  The truth, Papa.  Isn’t 
                        truth what you care so much about?

           Hemingway turns, holding the dead child, light rain in the 
           headlights between them...

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        He has no family. Help me bury him.

           EXT. FIELD NEAR THE MARIEL ELECTRIC PLANT - NIGHT

           again in the headlights of the car, using shovels from the 
           open trunk, Hemingway and Lucas finish digging...

           Gently, Hemingway takes the body and climbs with it into the 
           grave.  He needs Lucas’ HAND to pull him out again... They 
           stand together over the pit with the small body...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Goodnight sweet prince, and flights 
                        of angels sing thee to thy rest...

                                 LUCAS
                        ...that’s not Catholic.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Does it fit?
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUCAS
                             (reluctant)
                        ...yes...

           He crosses himself, then joins Hemingway pushing back the 
           muddy earth in the pattering drizzle... 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. LINCOLN, PARKED - DAY COMING

           both muddy, silent wrecks... RAIN drilling on the car roof, 
           hood and blurred windshield.  After silence -

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        You’re right: I’ve never killed 
                        anyone. (looks at Lucas)  But you 
                        have.  Who did this?  Was it 
                        Maldonado? Schlegel? Inga?  WHO?

                                 LUCAS
                             (takes a breath -)
                        Hold onto your stomach.

           EXT. LINCOLN - DAY

           as we circle the car.  We can FAINTLY HEAR Lucas’ voice, 
           telling everything...  At the end of the circle -

           INT. LINCOLN - DAY

           Hemingway sitting behind the wheel, frozen. Finally -

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Abwehr and the Gestapo?  I didn’t 
                        even know there were two kraut 
                        intelligence agencies...

                                  LUCAS
                        You don’t know much.  The Gestapo 
                        and the Abwehr are in Cuba fighting 
                        for turf - just like the FBI and the 
                        OSS - and the Crook Factory’s being 
                        used as a pawn in something huge, 
                        but I can’t figure out who’s using 
                        it.  We’re supposed to meet those 
                        two couriers when they land, that 
                        much I get, but without cracking the 
                        number code I’d have to assume the 
                        Crook Factory is... expendable. 
                        (heavily) As we’ve seen.  
           CONTINUED:

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Estamos Copados.  We’re surrounded.

           Lucas says nothing.   Hemingway looks at him -

                                 HEMINGWAY (CONT’D)
                        So now what, you report all this to-

                                 LUCAS
                        Delgado  No, that’s all finished.
                        I’ve been feeding him bullshit for 
                        quite a while and he smells a rat 
                        but maybe I can buy the Crook 
                        Factory some time with another dose.

           They sit.  Hemingway’s head sinks onto the steering wheel. 

           INT. VIGIA “GRADE A” - DAY

           Maria is startled when Lucas returns - a sight.

                                 MARIA
                        Jose... what happen-?

           He’s barely holding it together... she gets that much...

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Jose... 

           Rather than succumb to her consolations, Lucas rummages to 
           where he’s hidden the .22.  He pulls out the small gun and 
           shakes out the bullets, inserting ONE BULLET in the chamber -

                                 LUCAS
                        I left one bullet in there in case 
                        Caballo Loco shows, but don’t shoot 
                        unless you’re sure what you’re 
                        aiming at.  Comprende?

           He now loads the .357 magnum and sticks it in his back 
           waistband beneath his jacket; starts out -

                                 MARIA
                        Jose, where you going?

                                 LUCAS
                        Church.

           EXT. FINCA DRIVEWAY - DAY

           Lucas approaches the car, parked outside the living room.  
           CONTINUED:

           He peers inside... Hemingway is within, drinking, slurring...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Lucas!  Lucas, have a drink! Be 
                        ALIVE!  That’s an order, Lucas!
                        Estamos Copados! We’re surrounded! 

           Ignoring him, Lucas gets into the car and slams the door.

           INT. HAVANA CHURCH CONFESSIONAL - DAY

                                 LUCAS
                        Bless me father, for I have sinned. 
                        (where to start?)...I have lost my 
                        way... my faith does not sustain 
                        me... if it ever did.  Help me, 
                        father, for I know not what I do...

           Long pause.  Lucas is holding the magnum.  And trembling. 
           CLOSE IN ON THE GRILLE...

                                 PRIEST’S VOICE
                        There is no sin beyond God’s power 
                        of redemption, my son.  What is it 
                        you have to confess?  ...My son..?

           REVEAL - the confessional now empty.

           INT. HAVANA SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           Delgado backwards in a chair, legs splayed, toothpick in place 
           as he scans Lucas’ latest with incredulity...

                                 DELGADO
                        A picnic lunch?  What is this, an 
                        Andy Hardy movie?

                                 LUCAS
                        Marinated swordfish and chorizo 
                        pasta.  You want the recipe?

                                 DELGADO
                        Maybe that recipe made you sick.  
                        You don’t look so hot, Lucas.

                                 LUCAS
                        You never do.

                                 DELGADO
                        Aren’t you gonna tell me about the 
                        boy?  He’s dead, isn’t he?
           CONTINUED:

           Behind his back, LUCAS’ HAND straying towards the waistband -

                                 LUCAS
                        What do you know about it?

           Now DELGADO’S HAND is disappearing too...

                                 DELGADO
                        Me?  Nothing.  But word gets 
                        around.  Too bad about the kid.

           LUCAS’ HAND tightening around the magnum under the jacket...

                                 LUCAS
                        His name was Santiago...

                                 DELGADO
                        Whatever.  Tell Papa not to use 
                        children in his games next time...

           Tense pause.  Suddenly Delgado’s hand shoots out: a PHOTO: the 
           Aryan minus the ghastly SCAR we glimpsed at the cigar factory.

                                 DELGADO (CONT’D)
                        Know this guy?

           Lucas’ hand loosens on the gun -

                                 LUCAS
                        Captain Johannes Becker of the 
                        Gestapo - we’re acquainted.

           Delgado grins, points to his cheek where Becker’s scar is -

                                 DELGADO
                        He’d like to renew your 
                        acquaintance. 

                                 LUCAS
                        How would you know?

                                 DELGADO
                             (whoops)
                        ...I’m negotiating with him.

                                 LUCAS
                        What about?

                                 DELGADO
                        Brrr, it’s cold in Cuba.  Lucas, 
                        you’re on very thin ice.  

           Lucas’ face.
           EXT. FINCA DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           as Lucas exits the Lincoln.  Quiet.  He enters the house...

           INT. FINCA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           curtains drawn.  In the gloom, beneath the staring eyes of 
           dead animal heads, Lucas can barely make out -

           Hemingway - his TOE ON THE TRIGGER of a Mannlicher RIFLE, the 
           barrel facing his mouth...  When he speaks, he is cold sober:

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Hello, Joe.  You’re just in time.

                                 LUCAS
                        What’re you doing?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        The honorable thing.  

           CLOSE ON THAT TOE - Lucas had better think fast...

                                 LUCAS
                        What happened to “grace under 
                        pressure”?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Always in the mouth, Joe: because 
                        the palate’s the softest part of 
                        the skull...

                                 LUCAS
                        Lemme get this straight: as far as 
                        you’re concerned, the boy died for 
                        nothing?  He gave his life so you 
                        could throw yours away like some... 
                        maricon -?

           HEMINGWAY’S TOE comes off the trigger -

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        What did you call me?

                                 LUCAS
                        You heard me.  You know, I’m 
                        starting to think your wife was 
                        right about you. There’s a war on, 
                        but you stay on the si-

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I fought in two damn wars-!
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUCAS
                        Right!  You took shrapnel in your 
                        leg in 1918!  You took on the 
                        fascists in Spain in ‘36! I’ve read 
                        your fucking FBI file! I know the 
                        truth about you, so why-

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        The truth about me isn’t in my 
                        file, you moron, it’s in my books!

                                 LUCAS
                        Lemme tell you where you are in MY 
                        books...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Shut up, I’m warning you-

                                 LUCAS
                        Maricon!

           That does it. Hemingway starts with a haymaker and the fight 
           is on. And both know how to fight. They go at it bare-fisted, 
           hammer and tongs, tumbling over furniture as the CATS, who’ve 
           been placidly watching, now scat, scampering up the curtains 
           as the fight crashes through a window and travels outside -

           EXT. FINCA - NIGHT

           moonlight. Punches landing, cartilage cracking, BLOOD spurting-

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Wait a sec.  Hold on...

           Lucas waits.  Hemingway bends over, vomits...

                                 HEMINGWAY (CONT’D)
                        Okay.

           The fight resumes, edging towards the enormous POOL... Both 
           men are counterpunchers. Hemingway splits a knuckle knocking 
           out one of Lucas’ teeth. 

           Lucas connects hard with Hemingway’s HEAD, a fearsome crack; 
           he SPLASHES backward into the pool!

           Maria sits up in bed, wide-eyed... 
           EXT. FINCA, POOL - NIGHT

           Panting, Lucas watches as Hemingway heaves himself out and 
           lies there, a beached whale. No more suicide attempts tonight.

           INT. VIGIA “GRADE A”

           Maria listening to STEPS APPROACHING... When Lucas totters 
           in, holding his mouth -

           She fires!  The .22 whanging into splintering wood close to 
           him, as Lucas grabs her, pinning her arms.  The bear hug 
           turns into a bloody kiss; the kiss becomes frantic sex...

           AFTERWARDS - lying on the cot, the lamp lit, Maria gingerly 
           touches Lucas’ battered face, his blackening right eye...

                                 MARIA
                        Jose... do not tell Papa..?  OK?

                                 LUCAS
                             (broken smile)
                        “... it is between us and the sea.”

                                 MARIA
                        Que?

                                 LUCAS
                        Nothing.  Sleep now...

           She closes her eyes...  Lucas has only one good eye but it 
           stays open...   Then, a new thought: with a torn, swollen 
           hand, he pulls down the half copy of FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS. 
           And starts to read:

           CLOSE ON THE WORDS AS THEY FILL THE FRAME, ONE AT A TIME...

           “He lay flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest”

           CLOSE ON A SAFE COMBINATION DIAL - WIDEN TO REVEAL

           INT. FINCA, HEMINGWAY’S STUDY - NIGHT

           Hemingway, now dry, wearing glasses (magnifying his almost 
           shut BLACKENED LEFT EYE), squinting at the SAFE DIAL. With 
           red, puffy fingers, clumsily twirls it... 

           Retrieving from within the decoded INTERCEPTS Lucas 
           transcribed and handed him on Pilar’s way home.  Seated on 
           the floor, he turns on a lamp and pores over them.
           INT. HAVANA CHURCH - DAY

           pushing towards the CONFESSIONAL as we HEAR another American 

                                 VOICE
                        Bless me father for I have sinned.

           INT. VIGIA “GRADE A” - DAY (MORNING)

           as Lucas turns the last page of the first half of Hemingway’s 
           novel, realizing: Maria burnt the half he gave her.  Damn. 
           Lucas wears a different expression.  

           Quite simply, he has never encountered anything like what he 
           has just read. He stares at the torn book in his hands as -

           Hemingway appears, beaten to a pulp, with the intercepts...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Where’s Maria?

           Numbly, Lucas looks around, shrugs - he’s simply speechless.

                                 HEMINGWAY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been studying these and I’m 
                        starting to think you’re right: 
                        it’s got to be the number code.

           Lucas is staring at the man he almost killed last night...

                                 HEMINGWAY (CONT’D)
                        Are you listening?  We’ve got to 
                        break that code.  Isn’t there any 
                        more light in here?

           Lucas’ eyes follow him around the room as he looks. Hemingway 
           can do something Lucas never even dreamed was possible.

                                 LUCAS
                        Your book... it’s-

           He’s stopped by the SOUNDS OF A CAR, then two doors slamming. 
           As they look at each other with blackened left and right 
           eyes, the Vigia door bursts open to REVEAL -

                                 PATCHI
                        Schlegel is leaving!

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        On the yacht?

           Don Andres, the priest, shakes his head -
           CONTINUED:

                                 DON ANDRES
                        By plane for Rio in three hours. 

                                 LUCAS
                        From there he can get to Berlin.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        How did you learn this?

                                 DON ANDRES
                        In the confessional, from one of
                        the crew.  

           Lucas’ reaction.  Did he confess to Don Andres?!  The priest 
           is looking at them, bewildered...

                                 DON ANDRES (CONT’D)
                        What happened to you two?

           Hemingway and Lucas look at one another - yes, what?

           EXT. HAVANA HARBOR - DAY

           as the Chris Craft approaches a pier and Schlegel, dressed in 
           a panama, sun glasses, dark blazer, white slacks and shoes, 
           debarks with a CREWMAN carrying his expensive suitcase to -

           The shiny black LIMO where it is slammed into the trunk. 
           Schlegel barks commands in German before entering the car -

           INT. LINCOLN - DAY

           sitting back and opening the newspaper left there for him. He 
           pays no attention to the DARK-SUITED DRIVER, who pulls away: 
           Lucas, a chauffeur’s peaked CAP pulled over his beat-up face.

           EXT. HAVANA STREETS - DAY

           as the cleaned up “limo” wends its way...

           INT. LINCOLN, TRAVELING - DAY

           Lucas looks in the mirror at preoccupied Schlegel, reading -

           EXT. DEAD END ROAD - DAY

           the Lincoln heading back to the same abandoned farmhouse 
           where Santiago’s body was found.  And stopping.
           INT. LINCOLN - DAY

           Schlegel looks up, around, confused.  Where are they?   Lucas 
           swivels around with his GUN aimed at Schlegel -

                                 LUCAS
                        Take off your clothes. 

                                 SCHLEGEL
                        What?  What is the meaning of this?

           Lucas pulls the hammer back -

                                 LUCAS
                        Now.

           INT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE - DAY

           Schlegel staring at the roofless sky.  He’s in his underwear, 
           trussed hand and foot...

           Lucas, now in shirt-sleeves, kicks him in the ribs.  Hard.

                                 LUCAS
                        Listen carefully.  What you say in 
                        the next few minutes will determine 
                        whether you live or die.

           Amid the charred farmhouse ruins, Schlegel spies his OPEN 
           SUITCASE: loads of US CASH, his own Luger, etc.  

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        You know this place?  

                                 SCHLEGEL
                        This place? (another kick) OW! No! 
                        Why should I?  

                                 LUCAS
                        Your code name?

                                 SCHLEGEL
                        What are you talking a-

           Lucas’ knife now slitting off Schlegel’s underwear, cutting 
           him so his buttocks bleed in the process.  He screams.

                                 SCHLEGEL (CONT’D)
                        Salama!  Code name Salama!  Listen 
                        to me! Are you working for the 
                        writer?  I can pay you more, much-!
           CONTINUED:

           REVEAL - Hemingway sitting on barn debris, watching uneasily 
           as Lucas now produces a CAN WITH A LID and a SCREWDRIVER -

                                 LUCAS
                        This is a screwdriver.  This is 
                        axle grease.  As an Abwehr agent 
                        you, know how the Gestapo uses 
                        these together. 

           Schlegel’s EYES widen as Lucas spreads duct tape over them.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        What is Operation Raven?

           As Hemingway scowls with distaste, Lucas sits calmly, 
           stirring the axle grease for effect... 

                                 SCHLEGEL
                        It’s a Gestapo operation - I don’t 
                        know more!  I swear!  Please...

           Only now we see: it isn’t axle grease, it’s FRUIT YOGURT, but 
           the gentle clinking of the spoon on the tin can is.. yecch...

                                 LUCAS
                             (eats some yogurt)
                        Why is Johannes Becker in Havana? 

                                 SCHLEGEL
                             (appalled)
                        Becker is in Cuba?!

           Lucas creaks forward on the floorboards, stirring the yogurt 
           suggestively next to Schlegel’s EAR -

                                 LUCAS
                        Is he here to meet the two Abwehr 
                        couriers after they are dropped off 
                        by U-238? 

                                 SCHLEGEL
                        Those couriers are coming to meet 
                        with the FBI! 

           Hemingway’s astonished, but Lucas gets it.  His screwdriver 
           now stroking Schlegel’s trembling ass...

           Tears are now spilling down beneath the duct tape...

                                 LUCAS
                        Why are German intelligence agents 
                        meeting with the FBI in wartime?
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCHLEGEL
                        Jesus Christ! Are you insane?! How 
                        can I tell you what I don’t know?! 

                                 LUCAS
                        Who killed the boy?

                                 SCHLEGEL
                        Boy?  What boy are you talking 
                        about?  Please let me see!

                                 LUCAS
                        Tell me something you DO know. Tell 
                        me or I will use this to examine 
                        your prostate.

           Schlegel is now peeing on himself... Lucas eats more yogurt.

                                 SCHLEGEL
                        There is a Gestapo Todt team on the 
                        island!  A two man death squad!  

                                 LUCAS
                        I know what a Todt team is. Names?

                                 SCHLEGEL
                        I know only their code names... 
                        Panama and Columbia..! (realizing) 
                        Becker must be here to take charge! 

                                 LUCAS
                        Where are they?  Where ARE-

                                 SCHLEGEL
                        I don’t know where Columbia is but 
                        Panama... has already penetrated 
                        The Crook Factory!

           He can’t see their dismay.  Clinking the spoon on the can...

                                 LUCAS
                        One last question and if I’m not 
                        happy with your answer, we will 
                        proceed with the examination:   

           Out of FRAME, Lucas’ hand with the screwdriver, moves near 
           Schlegel’s most vulnerable orifice...  Schlegel weeping -

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        The number code.
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCHLEGEL
                        In my address book, third to last 
                        page, fifth number down: 295-1403 
                        is the key! Mein Gott in himmel-!

           Lucas squats by the suitcase, locating the address book and 
           the number at the back.  Schlegel lies sniffling...

           Lucas thinks, goes back to him, holding the screwdriver, 
           dipped in yogurt, strokes his rear cheek and whispers...

                                 LUCAS
                        I don’t believe you.

                                 SCHLEGEL
                        Backwards!! It has to be backwards! 
                        That’s it, I swear on the soul of 
                        my mother!

           Screeching.   Lucas squats next to him - 

                                 LUCAS
                        Open your mouth.  Open it...

           As the broken creature obeys, Lucas spoon-feeds him -

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Have some axle grease.

           As Schlegel’s taste buds reveal the subterfuge, he screams 
           again - in fury, this time, yogurt like foam around his lips. 
           Lucas looks over at Hemingway -

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        We’re a long way from honor.

                                 LUCAS
                        But much closer to truth.

           Hemingway starts out -

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        How do you live with yourself?

                                 LUCAS
                        Weren’t you asking yourself the 
                        same question lately?

           EXT. JOSE MARTI AIRPORT, HAVANA - DAY

           as the Lincoln races up, STOPS.  
           CONTINUED:

           Lucas turns back to where the shattered, humiliated Schlegel 
           sits woodenly, his once natty outfit now rumpled -

                                 LUCAS
                        I’ve got agents all around the 
                        airport and if they don’t report 
                        you boarded the plane...

                                 SCHLEGEL
                             (flat)
                        I will be on the plane...

                                 LUCAS
                        Good.  Never come back to Cuba. 

           Schlegel opens the door to start out -

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        One last thing.  Before you board, 
                        you will call the Southern Cross 
                        and order her to remain in Havana 
                        until further instructions. You 
                        will not speak to Miss Arvad. Don’t 
                        forget your suitcase; I left you 
                        all the money.  Oh and Schlegel: if 
                        Berlin learns you gave up their 
                        number code, they will kill you.

           Silent acquiescence.  Lucas watches him go - all the swagger  
           gone from his walk... now he stumbles like an old man...

           INT. LINCOLN, TRAVELING - DAY

           Lucas at the wheel, now glugging WHISKEY from a bottle...

           CLOSE ON THE NUMBERS: 295-1403 - WIDEN TO REVEAL

           INT. VIGIA “GRADE A” - DAY

           As Lucas, overwhelmed, blearily copies them backwards and works 
           to decode the numerals at the bottom of original intercept 
           ...frowning at the result, when Maria bursts in, wild-eyed...

                                 MARIA
                        Maldonado!

           EXT. FINCA - DAY

           Hemingway in a stand-off with the huge cop and TWO UNIFORMED 
           GOONS.  Maldonado’s manner is smiling, mock-obsequious...
           CONTINUED:

                                 MALDONADO
                        Senor Hemingway, I intend no 
                        disrespect, but I must insist we 
                        search the premises...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        You do and I’ll have you cited for 
                        committing an act of war...

           Lucas strolls over.  Maldonado’s gold tooth glints. He’s 
           amused by their bruised faces, glass cuts and black eyes...

                                 MALDONADO
                        An act of war?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I am currently in the employ of the 
                        American government, which makes 
                        this property diplomatically immune-

                                 MALDONADO  
                             (smiling)
                        You cannot be serious, senor...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Step over this threshold and you’ll 
                        find out how serious I am. 

           Ramon returning with a basket of fresh produce...

                                 MALDONADO
                        But this is absurd...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        You want to provoke a diplomatic 
                        incident, go right ahead...

           Maldonado grabs Ramon and slices open his cheek with a KNIFE.

                                 MALDONADO
                        This man is not a US citizen and I 
                        am not inside your “immune” house. 

           Hemingway pulls a pistol from the back of his shorts -

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Let him go or everyone will die. 
                        You first.

                                 MALDONADO
                             (still “reasonable”)
                        Senor, if you will give me your 
                        word the girl is not here-
           CONTINUED:

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I’ll give you six feet of earth if 
                        you don’t let that man go and get 
                        the hell off my property...

           Long pause.  One of the Goons grins, whispers to Maldonado, 
           who smiles, releases the bleeding Ramon -

                                 MALDONADO
                        As you wish, senor.

           He signals his men and they get in the car...  

                                 LUCAS
                        So that’s how fiction works...

           INT. FINCA KITCHEN - DAY

           as Hemingway carefully stitches up Ramon’s torn cheek...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I’m sorry about this, Ramon...

                                 RAMON
                        It is caballo loco, not you, Papa. 

           Hemingway looks up from his work to Lucas waiting at the door. 

           INT. GUEST HOUSE, FINCA - DAY, LATER

           Hemingway stares at the translated numerical code:         
           NEEDINSTRUCTIONSANDFUNDSCOLUMBIA

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        “Need instructions and funds. 
                        Columbia.”  That’s all?  

                                 LUCAS
                        That’s plenty.  Remember, this is 
                        the one we’re not supposed to know.  
                        And we wouldn’t know it except that 
                        I’m able to live with myself.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                             (touche)
                        What did he mean, those couriers 
                        are coming to meet the FBI?

                                 LUCAS
                        Very “back channel”, obviously - 
                        the FBI is me, via you.
           CONTINUED:

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        And this so-called death squad: 
                        Who’s their target?  Who’s 
                        Columbia?  Who is Panama?

                                 LUCAS
                        Good questions.  All we know is 
                        Panama’s MO: he cuts throats - one 
                        of them a child’s - and whoever he 
                        is, he’s already infiltrated the 
                        Factory.  

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        But... who? (reluctant)  Patchi?  
                        Fuentes?  Padre Andres?  I fought 
                        with some of these men in Spain. 

                                 LUCAS
                        What about the old doorman at the 
                        Ambos Mundos? One of the fishermen?  
                        Wolfer?  Your waiter friend at the 
                        Floridita?  Madame what’shername?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                             (scoffs)
                        Leopoldina?  

                                 LUCAS
                        Panama’s got to be one of them.  

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I don’t believe it. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Your faith in people is touching.  

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        They are my people; it is my faith. 
                        Where’s yours?  

           Lucas can’t answer.  Agitated, Hemingway paces... 

                                 HEMINGWAY (CONT’D)
                        So what do we do?  

                                 LUCAS
                        Are you a fast learner?

                        we’ll be gone.  You’ve got to come

           They start to make love... Lucas needs all he can get.

           EXTRA FUEL DRUMS...

           Hemingway, wearing the tin cans, is copying down intercept

           Wolfer approaches Maria, sitting in the marlin chair, offers

           EXT. CAYO CONFITES - DAY

           Pilar at anchor.  On shore, Fuentes is cooking... Maria, 
           cheered up on dry land, chatters in Spanish and laughs, 
           enjoying the local Coast Guard guys.  They flirt clumsily, 
           enjoying a gorgeous relief from their boredom.  

           A ROAR and all turn.  Wolfer grins as Lucas and the Lorraine 
           jam into the cove... 

                                 WOLFER

                        on sub patrol to the northeast; 
                        we’ll rendezvous here tomorrow.

           As Maria watches with confusion and alarm, Hemingway is

           Lorraine heads out to sea again with a ROAR of engines, as 
           Maria watches them go, tears stinging her eyes... 

           EXT. LORRAINE - DAY

           charging through mild chop with Lucas and Hemingway.  They 
           must shout over the roar of Lorraine’s engines... The 
           prospect of action has raised Hemingway’s spirits...

                        We’ve got guns, ammo, grenades,

                        Last year we brought a pig with us

                        squealed so much, we parked it 
                        there overnight til we were ready 
                        to cook it! (laughs) Next morning 
                        the tide was in and the island was 
                        underwater - goodbye pig! ...

           Water getting shallower... Lucas eyeing more GIANT CRABS and 
           taking levels with a BOAT HOOK... water less than two feet... 

           Hemingway steers carefully, the engine put-putting past 30 
           foot cliffs on one side, sand dunes on the other, more 
           MANGROVE REEFS as they glide into the mysterious place...

                        someone. Before moonrise.

                        These old rum runners hold a lot...

           Passing guns, tents, lights to Lucas, who has leapt out and 
           surveys the place - those cliffs... potential trouble spots.

                                 LUCAS
                        We may need a lot.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        But they know we’ve read the book 
                        code.  They’re expecting us, right?

                                 LUCAS
                        Were you ever a Boy Scout?

           EXT. POINT ROMA - NIGHT, LATER

           we can make out the equivalent of a camouflaged duck blind 
           nestled against the sand berm... lots of SAND FLIES...

                                 HEMINGWAY’S VOICE
                        2130 hours.  We’re way early...

                                 LUCAS’ VOICE
                        It’s the early bird that gets the 
                        worm. (BUZZ! SLAP!) Damn..!

           INT. “DUCK BLIND”, POINT ROMA - NIGHT

           stifling. Hemingway and Lucas crouched in almost pitch black. 
           Hemingway organizes their WEAPONS, brushing off sand, as -
           CONTINUED:

           Lucas crawls to the top of the berm, using BINOCS to scan the 
           dark horizon.  Satisfied, he switches on a flashlight.

                                 LUCAS
                        Look, we better be able to 
                        recognize each other if we need to.

           He ties a RED FLANNEL RAG over the flashlight and hands it to 
           Hemingway; ties another red strip over his own. Hemingway 
           observing Lucas’ black eye in the red darkness -

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Together we make a racoon. 

                                 LUCAS
                        How’s the head?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Hard as a brick, don’t worry.

           He’s unfolding papers and scanning them by red flashlight -

                                 HEMINGWAY (CONT’D)
                        Marty sent me some of her Life 
                        magazine articles. She’s good... 
                        But not great.  That makes it hard.

           For whom? Lucas wonders. Hemingway gives up, switches off the 
           light.  Silence, just the distant, POUNDING SURF.  Finally -

                                 LUCAS
                        So... how did you do it?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Do what?

           Lucas quotes without mockery; it comes out poetically...

                                 LUCAS
                        “He lay flat on the brown, pine-
                        needled floor of the forest, his 
                        chin on his folded arms, and high 
                        overhead the wind blew in the   
                        tops of the pine trees...”

           Hemingway amazed.  And pleased...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        You read it...

                                 LUCAS
                        ...Half.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        And..?

                                 LUCAS
                        It was... amazing.  But it’s a lie.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        A lie can tell the greater truth.

                                 LUCAS
                        Bull.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Okay, listen: you’re the outsider, 
                        the observer.  Like me.  You write 
                        your reports. But just transcribing 
                        shit isn’t art. You’ve got to do it 
                        from your gut, inside out. You take 
                        what’s real and mix it up and make 
                        it your own.  Then it’s your truth.  
                        Understand?

                                 LUCAS
                        I’ve been an outsider all my life, 
                        I understand that part...

           Hemingway sighs, chuckles... a mosquito whines...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        You choose pieces that stand in for 
                        the whole.  Like that sub we’re 
                        waiting for.  All you need is to 
                        see the periscope and you can 
                        imagine the rest, those sweating, 
                        frightened bastards down there... 
                        Fiction is just another code.

                                 LUCAS
                        What’re you writing now?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I haven’t written in a year.

                                 LUCAS
                        The war...

           Pause, then -

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        No.  That’s just an excuse...
           EXT. BEACHFRONT, POINT ROMA - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON A WATCH ILLUMINED IN RED LIGHT: 11:O0. WIDEN

           INT. “DUCK BLIND”, POINT ROMA - NIGHT

                                 HEMINGWAY

           He snaps off the light aimed at his watch as Lucas crawls 
           with BINOCS to the top of the berm...

                                 HEMINGWAY (CONT’D)
                        I’m dying to know why Nazi agents 
                        want to meet up with the FBI...

           LUCAS’ POV - a FLASHING LIGHT offshore... the flashing light 
           faintly illumines: U-238!

                                 LUCAS
                        Well, here’s your chance; typical 
                        krauts - they’re right on time.

           In the dark, the blacker shape of the SUB and, closer to 
           shore, a bouncing RAFT with TWO DARK FIGURES, flashing back.

           Hemingway crawls up next to Lucas, in time to see... The raft 
           being pulled ashore by the two dark figures, when -

           FOUR SHOTS RING OUT!  The two darkened men reel and fall.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Holy-

                        Split up!  Take the beach!  

           EXT. “DUCK BLIND”, POINT ROMA - NIGHT

           Hemingway and Lucas scuttle out of the tent and take off in 
           different directions, Lucas crawling inland and up, while 
           Hemingway goes over the berm, crawling down towards the sea.

           EXT. POINT ROMA, INLAND - NIGHT

           Lucas on top of the cliffs, looking at the abandoned sugar 
           refinery... cocking his weapon and hiding in beach grass...
           EXT. POINT ROMA, BEACH - NIGHT

           Hemingway rolls down the dune, rising with rifle aimed at -

           TWO BODIES next to their raft, just above the surf line...

           Hemingway looks out to sea... the SUB is diving...

           EXT. POINT ROMA, INLAND - NIGHT

           Lucas scuttling in beach grass when he becomes aware -

           SOMETHING MOVING toward his right... running inland...

           Lucas follows quietly... SEVERAL ANGLES...

           EXT. POINT ROMA, BEACH - NIGHT

           by moonlight, Hemingway inspects TWO YOUNG MEN in Wehrmacht 
           uniforms... on closer examination, all unit markings have 
           been ripped off, leaving pale patches where they were...  

           Hemingway looks around cautiously as -

           EXT. POINT ROMA, INLAND - NIGHT

           Lucas approaches the sugar refinery - all those partially 
           broken glass windows glinting... perfect for a sniper... is  
           a second shooter up there looking for him?  Lucas looks up  
           at the moon.  He’s backlit, a perfect target.

                                 LUCAS
                        Shit.

           He retreats, crawling backwards into the beach grass...

           SEVERAL ANGLES - disoriented, he heads towards the sound of 
           SURF... Someone else nearby.  He un-shoulders his rifle and 
           takes aim, finger on the trigger, until -

           A RED LIGHT snaps on.   Lucas sighs, produces his own...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Lucas?

                                 LUCAS
                        Yeah...

           They move towards each other -

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        They’re both dead.  Now what?

                                 LUCAS
                             (slaps a fly; thinks)
                        We wait.

           BANG!  SUN RISING ON THE HORIZON (the LAWRENCE OF ARABIA cut) 
           ... only WE DROP DOWN TO REVEAL -

           GIANT CRABS plucking out the eyes of the dead couriers and 
           otherwise, devouring them...  SUDDENLY GUNFIRE -!

           From Lucas, blows one away and the rest scurry off as 
           Hemingway and Lucas, armed, descend the dune, repulsed -

                                 LUCAS
                        Oh boy...

           Suppressing his disgust, he searches the ravaged corpses as 
           Hemingway stands guard, casting a wary eye over... sniffs...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        They’re starting to turn...

           Their pockets are empty, natch. But Lucas finds a DITTY BAG. 
           Moving upwind he sits down and examines the contents: PAPERS. 

           Hemingway squats beside him to see: DETAILED MAPS and FIGURES

                                 LUCAS
                        It’s all kraut intel about Soviet 
                        army tank strength, ammo dumps, 
                        troop dispositions, supplies... 

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Why the hell would the FBI care 
                        about any of this stuff?  Russians 
                        are on our side... And why didn’t 
                        the shooter take this with him?

           The ditty bag and papers.  Lucas thinking...

                                 LUCAS
                        He knows we’re supposed to pass it 
                        on. These two were killed to prevent 
                        them bringing something back.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Something from us?  Like a trade?
           CONTINUED:

           Lucas stands, replacing the papers in the ditty bag...

                        Okay, let’s photograph everything 
                        before we bury all of it.

           He pulls out the CAMERA.  As he SNAPS -

           She smiles at Lucas, shyly pleased with herself. Lucas leaves -

           Sweating, Lucas examines the radio, finding: A LOOSE WIRE in

           Lorraine attached by a rope astern, Pilar’s crew stowing gear

           INT. PILAR, MAIN CABIN - DAY

           Maria mopping Wolfer’s sweaty brow... Lucas looks in.

                                 LUCAS
                        Honey, let’s get you some fresh 
                        air. You earned it. I’ll take you 
                        for a picnic in Wolfer’s baby...

                        just the place.  

           He gently tugs her upstairs, past Hemingway, who stays 
           expressionless as Maria brushes by...

           Nearing little Cayo Perdido, where Hemingway lost the PIG...

                        es entre nosotros y el oseano. 
                        “Between us and the sea”.  Still 
                        don’t know that old Cuban 
                        expression? How about in German?  
                        HE REPEATS IT IN GERMAN.

           Setting the magnum on the deck between them.  She blinks at 
           the gun, baffled -

                                 MARIA
                        Jose...

                                 LUCAS
                        Don’t call me that. Whatever you do 
                        don’t call me that.  And I won’t 
                        call you Maria because your name is 
                        Panama. Only Panama’s not your name 
                        either, is it?  You look Hispanic 
                        but you’re German.  Your name is 
                        Kindermörder.  Can you give me that 
                        in English?  Kindermörder?  I think 
                        it comes out, Child Killer. Child 
                        Killer is your real name.

                                 MARIA
                        Jose, I do not-

                                 LUCAS
                        Shut up. I was wrong when I told 
                        Delgado you didn’t kill Kohler.  
                        You killed him alright: hiding from 
                        Maldonado was the perfect way to 
                        attach yourself to Hemingway, the 
                        scared little whore. Oh, and by the 
                        way, whores all over the world know 
                        what “fuck” means.  You overdid it. 

                                 MARIA
                        No comprende-
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUCAS
                        From Hemingway’s place you could 
                        pass on Crook Factory stuff to 
                        Columbia, the other half of your 
                        Todt team, but when little Santiago 
                        caught you doing it, you killed him 
                        too.  And then you took me to bed 
                        while your hands were still slick 
                        with his blood.  

           She’s cowering on the back seat of the boat, skirt askew -

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Then later, Maldonado conveniently 
                        shows up at Hemingway’s so we have 
                        to take you with us on this trip. I 
                        guess you didn’t really have time 
                        to do a proper job on the radio. 
                        Wolfer’s lucky he only came down 
                        with food poisoning. 

                                 MARIA
                        Jose-

           Lucas addresses her angrily in subtitled German -

                                 LUCAS
                        Pull down your skirt, kindermörder, 
                        your underpants are showing.

           Surprised, she obeys, only to realize her mistake - she 
           screams in her native German as she leaps forward -!

                                 MARIA
                        Lucas you swine! I spit on you!  
                        Cocksucking sonovabitch!

           Grabbing the magnum, aiming at Lucas and pulling the trigger - 
           Clickclickclick. The gun won’t fire.  Lucas holds up bullets.

                                 LUCAS
                        No bullets.  Oh dear.

           With a fistful of bullets, he slugs her, knocking her out, 
           ripping off her clothes... When she’s buck naked, he tosses 
           her into the shallow water, which wakes her, spluttering.

                                 MARIA
                        I cannot swim -!

           Ignoring this, he starts Lorraine’s engine and takes off. 
           Behind him, Maria clambers naked onto the little island...
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        There are sharks -!

                                 LUCAS
                        ...kindermörder...

           Lorraine is speeding so fast, Lucas’ eyes are watering...

                                                       SEVERAL DISSOLVES:

           as the WATER RISES... and Cayo Perido disappears... and so 
           does... “Maria”... REVEAL

           EXT. PILAR - EVENING

           Hemingway, Lucas and the crew peering at the empty horizon -

                                 WOLFER
                        ... did she drown?

                                 PATCHI
                        Maybe that sub picked her up...

                                 FUENTES
                        Naked - such a catch...

                                 SINSKY
                        Too bad we couldn’t question her. 
                        Find out who Columbia is...

           Hemingway observes Lucas staring, eyes clouded with pain.   
           He squeezes a large hand on Lucas’ shoulder...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        No.  Lucas did the right thing.  

           Hemingway guns the engines. Pilar peels off in a large u-
           turn, the sun setting... Lucas stays on the taffrail...

           INT. PILAR, HEAD - NIGHT

           Lucas, staring blankly, wearing headphones, when he’s 
           startled from his agony by a familiar signal -

                                 LUCAS
                        Book code...

           Grabbing the Geopolitik volume, a pencil between his teeth, 
           Lucas goes to work deciphering...
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        “Operation... Raven... shut down, 
                        repeat... shut down...”

           He sits, mulling this -

                                 DELGADO’S VOICE OVER
                        THE RADIO BROKE???!!

           INT. HAVANA SAFE HOUSE - DAY

                                 LUCAS
                        What can I tell you?

                                 DELGADO
                             (totally pissed)
                        Nothing!  Not a fucking thing is 
                        what you can tell me!  Or what you 
                        WILL tell me.  Subs?

                                 LUCAS
                        Not a one. 

                                 DELGADO
                        What about the little whore?  I 
                        didn’t see her when you docked.

                                 LUCAS
                        She was sleeping below...

                                 DELGADO
                        Drive me to the airport. Lucas, you 
                        have totally fucked up. I’m on the 
                        next flight to Miami and Hoover’s 
                        gonna boot your sorry ass to 
                        kingdom come.  You’re done, Lucas. 

           EXT. JOSE MARTI AIRPORT, HAVANA - DAY

           as Lucas watches Delgado’s plane take off into the blue...

           CLOSE ON ROOM 314 - WIDEN TO REVEAL

           INT. HOTEL NACIONAL - DAY

           Lucas knocking impatiently.   The door is opened by -

                                 LUCAS
                        I need to see-

           A confused OLDER WOMAN in a nightgown. The OSS has pulled out.
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Sorry...

           The door closed.  HOLD ON LUCAS alone in the long hall.

           EXT. COJIMAR HARBOR - NIGHT

           Pilar lit up at anchor; Lorraine docked and tarped again...

                                 LUCAS’S VOICE OVER
                        They warned me they wouldn’t wait 
                        around forever...

           INT. PILAR, MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

           low light. Gloom. The ditty bag on the table between them. 
           Hemingway downs a whiskey; Lucas has a cigarette as they 
           stare at the papers with Russian maps and tank data...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        What do we do with this Russian stuff?

                                 LUCAS
                        I was supposed to hand it over to 
                        Delgado who’d pass it on to Hoover.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        And what about these intercepts 
                        with the dates and times of British 
                        convoy sailings?

                                 LUCAS
                             (finger snap)
                        That’s what those couriers were 
                        supposed to take back to the sub!  
                        The trade!

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        So the krauts can sink more ships. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Only Becker didn’t want it coming 
                        from the Abwehr and scoring points 
                        with Hitler.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Is Becker Columbia?

                                 LUCAS
                        I don’t think so... 
           CONTINUED:
                                 LUCAS (CONT'D)
                        But either way, we still have to 
                        give him the convoy schedules.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        You’re crazy.  Those ships will be 
                        torpedoed. Thousands of men will die!

                                 LUCAS
                        But if we don’t the Gestapo will 
                        figure out we’ve broken their 
                        number code and many more thousands 
                        will die.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        That’s a hellova choice. Where do 
                        you get the right to make it?  Or 
                        do you qualify on the basis of 
                        “previous experience”?  

                                 LUCAS
                             (stung)
                        You want me to do the math for you?  

           With an effort, Hemingway chills.   He hands Lucas another 
           INTERCEPT; quieter -

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        This came over the radio while you 
                        were seeing off your FBI friend - 
                        it’s in the number code...

           Lucas’ reaction, squinting through smoke...

           INT. PILAR, HEAD - NIGHT

           as Hemingway watches...  Lucas reads his decoding:

                                 LUCAS
                        “Good work Columbia.  Part One 
                        Operation Raven complete. Now kill 
                        Shakespeare.”  Shakespeare, that’s 
                        you: you’re the target.

           Hemingway is taken aback.  Out of reflex, Lucas turns on the 
           radio.  The usual stuff faintly HEARD through the phones...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        You said Raven was shut down.

                                 LUCAS
                        That was book code - the one we’re 
                        meant to read.
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        This is the real deal.  Tag, you’re 
                        it.

           Before Hemingway can speak, Lucas reacts, grabs one phone to 
           his ear, holding up a hand, then seizing a pencil...

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        ...book code... signal very strong  
                        - must be someplace close... 

           He listens, writing, then drops the headphones.  Hemingway 
           watches as Geopolitik’s key is applied and Lucas rapidly 
           deciphers. (There are no spaces until he reads them) -

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        “Panama ordered to rendezvous with 
                        Columbia at 0240 hours where pale 
                        death enters the palace of kings 
                        under the shadow of justice.”
                        What the hell...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        It’s a sculpture, part of the 
                        biggest mausoleum at the Cementario 
                        de Cristobal Colon! Columbia’s 
                        going to show!

                                 LUCAS
                        A cemetary in the middle of the night?  
                        It’s a set-up. Columbia knows Panama’s 
                        dead.  This is in book code to lure   
                        you there.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Then we can bring him down!

                                 LUCAS
                        Not “we”. 

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        But-

                                 LUCAS
                        Let’s not take chances.  These 
                        people want to kill you. 

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        After Santiago, I wouldn’t be any 
                        great loss...

           From behind the stacked radio gear, Lucas pulls out his torn 
           half of FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS -
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUCAS
                        Yes you would.  You take Pilar back 
                        to Cayo Confites with the boys 
                        tonight, before Columbia can dope out 
                        where you are. I’ll take the cemetery 
                        and join you on Wolfer’s baby. 

           Hemingway sits there, hesitating...  Lucas notices -

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Come on, let’s gas up these boats -

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I’ve got a bad feeling about this.  
                        One of us isn’t going to make it.

                                 LUCAS
                        That’s a hellova thing to say. 

           THUNDER OVER -

           EXT. CEMENTERIO DE CRISTOBAL COLON - NIGHT

           Lucas, carrying ROPE and a crude MAP drawn by Hemingway, 
           leaves the parked Lincoln and enters the fabled necropolis.  

           LIGHTNING FLASHES as he makes his way through avenues and 
           boulevards of grotesque mausoleums, with gargoyles, winged 
           angels with skulls, the Gothic and the goth... 

           A sprawling city of the dead, until...

           Lucas arrives beneath the enormous crypt with its mansard 
           roof and bizarre sculpture: “pale death” a grim reaper with 
           scythe, faces a “palace” under the “shadow of justice” with 
           her familiar scales...

           Checking his watch by another LIGHTNING FLASH, Lucas tosses a 
           loop of rope over the shadow of “justice” with its scales... 
           He tests the thing for strength and then rapidly ascends to 
           the roof, intending to hide there...

           EXT. MAUSOLEUM ROOF, CEMETERY - NIGHT

           as Lucas gains the roof A HUGE FOOT crushes his grasping HAND.  
           He looks up as LIGHTNING FLASHES, backlighting the grinning -

                                 MALDONADO
                        The early bird... he gets the worm.

           CLAP OF THUNDER as he yanks Lucas up like a toy -
           CONTINUED:

                                 MALDONADO (CONT’D)
                        Sit on your hands.

           Flinging Lucas slewing onto the gravel roof, obeying...

                                 LUCAS
                        So you are Columbia... 

           Ignoring this, Maldonado frisks Lucas from behind, tosses 
           away the .357 and checks his watch by lightning -

                                 MALDONADO
                        Who?  We are both early...

                                 LUCAS
                        Are you waiting for Panama?  She’s 
                        dead.  I drowned her.  

           LIGHTNING CLOSER followed at once by a horrific THUNDER clap. 
           Maldonado grins, his gold tooth, glinting in the darkness -

                                 MALDONADO
                        Senor Lucas, what do you say?

           CLOSE - Lucas’ FISTS grabbing handfuls of gravel...

                                 LUCAS
                        Maria.  Maybe you know her as 
                        Maria?  She’s dead.

                                 MALDONADO
                        That murdering little puta. I told 
                        Becker he should pour gasoline and 
                        light a match on her.

           He’s oblivious to the huge black clouds closing in behind...

                                 LUCAS
                        Why did you kill the boy?  Why?

                                 MALDONADO
                        What boy? (grins) I think we will 
                        not wait to kill you any longer-

           A HUGE LIGHTNING STRIKE on the very next mausoleum -! 

           Startles both but Lucas moves faster, flinging GRAVEL in his 
           face as Maldonado shoots, blasting off part of Lucas’ ear as 
           he rolls away and comes up, kicking Maldonado in the balls...

           Doubling over, Maldonado’s gun goes flying and the fight on 
           the rooftop begins.  The cop is huge but he wasn’t trained at 
           Camp X like Lucas... 
           CONTINUED:

           Who finally trips him, hard enough to snap Maldonado’s WRIST 
           in a scream -

           Lucas rolls on top, his gravity KNIFE tip on one eyeball as 
           LIGHTNING dances around them and deafening THUNDER...

                                 LUCAS
                         Who is Columbia?  

           Maldonado in agony... the blade touching his eyeball...

                                 MALDONADO
                        Columbia?  What is Co-

                                 LUCAS
                        This will go into your brain. Who 
                        will kill Hemingway?  

                                 MALDONADO
                        I do not know who kills him but he 
                        dies today!

           Lucas is shocked long enough for Maldonado to heave him off, 
           trying to escape down Lucas’ rope with his one good hand... 
           as RAIN BEGINS...  Lucas recovers the magnum, then -

           Uses his knife on the rope... The cop falls screaming to the 
           flagstones, where he lies motionless, blood spreading, 
           diluted by the rain, at the foot of “Pale Death”...  

           EXT. CEMENTERIO DEL CRISTOBAL COLON, ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           running through rain, Lucas regains the Lincoln and peels out-

           EXT./INT. ROADS - NIGHT

           SEVERAL ANGLES in the lightning and increasing downpour: the 
           Lincoln skids perilously, Lucas, one ear bleeding, intent at 
           the wheel, windshield wipers frantic, as the car heads to -

           EXT. COJIMAR HARBOR - NIGHT

           RAIN pelting, Lucas gets out to see PILAR long gone...  But 
           so is LORRAINE -!

                                 LUCAS
                        Oh, God.

           He scrambles back into the Lincoln and squeals out...
           INT. LINCOLN, TRAVELING - NIGHT

           Lucas, trying desperately to think...

                                 LUCAS
                        Columbia, you sonovabitch.

           EXT. LINCOLN, TRAVELING - NIGHT

           passes a sign for HAVANA.  The Lincoln backs up, mud 
           spattering off the tires, and chooses the Havana road...

           EXT. HAVANA HARBOR - NIGHT

           featuring the anchored Southern Cross and the eternally 
           circling Chris Craft... the wind now picking up...

           EXT. CHRIS CRAFT, HAVANA HARBOR - NIGHT

           TWO GOONS, miserable and wet, passing a bottle... when one 
           sees something...

                                 GOON #1
                        What the fuck...

           A ROWBOAT approaching in the storm -

                                 GOON #1 (CONT’D)
                        Hey...  HEY, YOU -!

                                 MAN IN ROWBOAT
                        Help...!   Help me!

           The goons look at each other as the rowboat approaches -

                                 GOON #1
                        Go fuck yours-

           Lucas’ magnum in his face -

                                 LUCAS
                        Jump in the water.

           EXT. OUTSIDE HAVANA HARBOR - 4 AM

           looking in past imposing El Morro fortress at the entrance as 
           the Chris Craft, her HEADLIGHT jouncing all over the water, 
           tears out in wind, rain and rising seas...
           INT. CHRIS CRAFT - 4 AM

           Lucas steering almost blind into the increasing tempest.

           INT./EXT CHRIS CRAFT - DAYBREAK

           LIGHTNING enabling us to see - SEVERAL ANGLES 

           the speedboat riding up and down gigantic swells. She isn’t 
           as flexible as Lorraine but her bigger size helps as Lucas 
           struggles not to capsize...

           He eyes the GAS GAUGE... there wasn’t time to fill the tanks.

           SUDDENLY A WALL of SEA dead ahead...

           CRASHING DOWN on the small boat... which disappears...

           Before coming out the other side, slewing about, the 
           propellers spinning out of the water as Lucas struggles, 
           drenched and almost blind from salt water...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. CAYO CONFITES - DAY

           the storm has abated here into merely grey skies as Sinsky, 
           Wolfer, Patchi and Fuentes breakfast over a small fire on the 
           beach, down a few hundred feet from the coast guard shack...

           They HEAR a sputtering and look up to see the Chris Craft 
           limp into view around one side of the cove... 

           They frown until - 

                                 SINSKY
                        It’s Lucas -!

           He runs down the beach, followed by Patchi and Fuentes, but 
           Wolfer hangs behind, uneasy at the sight: not his boat...

           CLOSER - the guys wade into the water where Lucas is more 
           dead than alive at the wheel... He looks like a drowned rat. 
           Down the beach, the Coast Guard contingent straggles out...

                                 LUCAS
                        Where’s Pilar?

                                 WOLFER
                        Papa took her after he got your 
                        telegram... 
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUCAS
                             (blinks)
                        What telegram?

           Patchi points to the shack -

                                 PATCHI
                        To the Coast Guard.  You said to 
                        meet you at Point Roma and come 
                        alone.  What happened to your ear?

           Lucas’ face: it can’t get any worse.  Wolfer now there -

                                 WOLFER
                        What’s going on?

                                 LUCAS
                        I need fuel and I need it NOW.  

           Tic of hesitation, then, pointing to the shack -

                                 SINSKY
                        We will get it from the Coast Guard 
                        and be off in no-

                                 LUCAS
                        No - we can’t have five guys in 
                        this thing blasting away, we’ll be 
                        shooting each other. (before they 
                        can object) I don’t have time to 
                        argue.  Get the damn gasoline...

           After another hesitation, they obey, taking off down the 
           beach towards the bewildered Coast Guard guys, shouting...

           Lucas slumps to the deck...

           Meanwhile another COAST GUARD OFFICER is running full tilt 
           out of the shack, yelling, subtitled  -

                                 COAST GUARD #1
                        There’s an alert out for this boat - 
                        she was hijacked in Havana!

                          SINSKY
                                                         FUENTES
           Bullshit!
                                              Roberto, you know us-!  

                          PATCHI
                                                     COAST GUARD #1
           This is Jose’s-!
                                              No, we-

           Amid all the yelling amongst them...

           A BURST OF SUBMACHINE GUN FIRE FROM -
           CONTINUED:

           Wolfer.

           All hands reach for the sky.

           EXT. CAYO CONFITES - DAY

           The Chris Craft, on its way again, leaving the cove...

           CLOSER - at the wheel, Lucas, exhausted, glugging WATER, now 
           shouldering a SUBMACHINE GUN, A HAND GRENADE on his belt... 
           The sea is calmer...

           INT. COAST GUARD SHACK, CAYO CONFITES - DAY

           Pilar’s crew and the Coast Guard guys under guard, still 
           yelling back and forth... 

           EXT. POINT ROMA - DAY

           as the Chris Craft chugs into the low water maze of floating 
           mangroves and Lucas tries to maneuver the bulkier vessel, 
           keeping a wary eye for... he’s not sure what...

           SEVERAL ANGLES - everything looks like a sniper’s haven...

           Then, Lucas reacts... Swinging slowly at anchor, her stern 
           towards him, the abandoned Pilar... 

           Lucas is too far and too low to see anything on her deck but 
           the flying bridge is unoccupied...

           He un-shoulders and readies the submachine gun, steering with 
           one hand...

           SUDDENLY A ROAR -!

           And out of nowhere charges LORRAINE, heading right for him!

           Lucas hits the throttle and the Chris Craft dodges into 
           another channel... as -

           LORRAINE slews around, spewing water... coming after...

           Lucas can now see: Lorraine steered by the maniacal -

           BECKER, his scarred face contorted with hatred.  This is his 
           rematch. Curiously, he’s wearing a SHIRT we’ve seen on Lucas.

           The speedboat duel is on, Lorraine vs the Chris Craft...As 
           the two boats dodge and weave in the treacherously shallow 
           salt bayous...  
           CONTINUED:

           Becker is also armed... On one pass, he fires and BULLETS rip 
           up the hull of the Chris Craft, splintering the windshield...

           On another, the two boats race past each other and Lucas 
           tosses a hand grenade, which EXPLODES but misses as the boats 
           wheel again, like charging horses...

           But Lorraine, built in the ‘20s for smuggling, is more adept 
           at this sort of maneuvering than the -

           Chris Craft, whose propellers are abruptly snagged, as Lucas 
           looks down, reacting -

           By MANGROVES.  

           Lucas’ face. He tries frantically to free the prop, reversing 
           engines, but to no avail... he’s a sitting duck, which -

           Becker now realizes, skidding Lorraine to make her charge...

           Lucas still straining to yank free the damn mangroves as 
           Lorraine races toward him...

           At the last minute, when Becker has committed, machine gun 
           blazing erratically because of the boat -

           Lucas REVEALS his own submachine gun and FIRES -!

           Becker hit and Lorraine suddenly veers out of control into 
           and UP one of the sandy banks at 70 mph, exploding in an 
           enormous fireball of debris...

           BECKER’S CORPSE blown sky high, pieces raining down on -

           Lucas and his boat...

           MINUTES LATER - Lucas tugs free the last of the mangrove 
           roots, climbs back aboard the Chris Craft and put-puts back 
           through several channels to where -

           Pilar sits motionless as before...  

           Cautiously, weapon ready, Lucas pulls alongside, such that he 
           can see over the rail...

           Hemingway is dead on the deck, BLOOD spreading from his head.

                                 LUCAS
                        Papa...

           The only time he’s ever said it.  Leaving the Chris Craft and 
           the gun, Lucas climbs onto Pilar -
           CONTINUED:

           Only to be SHOT THREE TIMES, BAM-BAM-BAM, twice in the chest, 
           once in the leg, sinking to the deck 10 feet from the author.  

           Pause, and then from the cabin below, the killer appears: 
           Delgado, with Hemingway’s .22.  He approaches Lucas...

                                 DELGADO
                        Well, whaddaya know. Joe Lucas, the 
                        man who’s neither here nor there. I 
                        knew that cemetary thing wasn’t
                        gonna work.  Maldonado’s big, but 
                        he’s dumb.

                                 LUCAS
                        Dumb and dead.  Like Becker.

                                 DELGADO
                        Like you.  Figures.  Once I told 
                        Becker you’d be coming, I knew he’d 
                        want another crack at you. (smiles) 
                        And how could I refuse?  Now I’m 
                        the Gestapo’s man in Havana. (grins) 
                        And Hoover’s.  You know, I almost 
                        had to kill you the night I shot the 
                        couriers. Jou were too close, amigo. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Did you really think we were gonna 
                        trade them the convoy sailing times?

                                 DELGADO
                        Couldn’t take the chance of you two 
                        idiots deciding to make the Abwehr 
                        look good.

           Delgado smirking; Lucas breathing heavily -

                                 LUCAS
                        So you’re Columbia.

                                 DELGADO
                             (shrugs)
                        Miami’s only 90 miles...  Just a 
                        round trip.  Now we’re back to plan 
                        B: FBI agent turns out to be Nazi 
                        spy, kills famous writer.

           Delgado sticks the gun in his waistband, fishes out 
           cigarettes from his pocket, then realizes -

                                 DELGADO (CONT’D)
                        Oh, sorry; want one?
           CONTINUED:

           Delgado lights a second (like Paul Henreid in those Bette 
           Davis movies), and obligingly sticks it in Lucas’ mouth.

                                 LUCAS
                        Thanks.  Becker shoot Hemingway or 
                        was it you? 

                                 DELGADO
                        Nah, the big idiot put up a fight 
                        so I had to club him with the boat 
                        hook. Messy. (amused) How you doing 
                        Lucas?  You look kinda dead.

                                 LUCAS
                        Delgado...

                                 DELGADO
                        That’s not my real name, obviously.
                        Oh and before you croak, where’s 
                        that Russian tank intel?  I thought 
                        Papa had it in this pouch but that 
                        turned out to be one of his 
                        bullshit stories of people fucking 
                        in France.  So where is it?

                                 LUCAS
                        Back at the finca -

           Delgado slaps Lucas, knocking away the cigarette -

                                 DELGADO
                        Don’t fuck with me. 

           Slapped to the left, Lucas now sees: Hemingway on the deck 
           behind Delgado...   Moving... Time for Lucas to stall...  
           make like he’s at death’s door...

                                 LUCAS
                        How’d Papa let you guys get close?

                                 DELGADO
                             (sighs)
                        Alright, tit for tat.  Becker was 
                        wearing your shirt; Elsa swiped one 
                        from your cozy lovers’ cabin... He 
                        thought it was you...

                                 LUCAS
                        Elsa?
           CONTINUED:

                                 DELGADO
                        Elsa, Maria, Panama... Same 
                        difference. OK, your turn: where’s 
                        the stuff? Hoover’s waiting for it.

           Hemingway lifting his head, shaking it...

                                 LUCAS
                        Hoover...

                                 DELGADO
                        That’s why they picked you, Joey: 
                        smart - but not smart enough...

                                 LUCAS
                        What is Operation Raven?

                                 DELGADO
                        That’s the Gestapo getting rid of 
                        those old, pre-Nazi pansies in the 
                        Abwehr.  There’s only room for one 
                        intelligence service in the Third 
                        Reich and the Gestapo’s gonna be 
                        it.

           Hemingway now realizing where he is, what’s happening as 
           Lucas tries to keep Delgado’s attention...

                                 LUCAS
                        I don’t get it...

                                 DELGADO
                             (laughs, blows smoke)
                        What, I gotta draw you a picture? 
                        Hoover hates the Commies; Gestapo 
                        hates the Abwehr. So they do a deal.  
                        Gestapo gives Hoover Russian intel 
                        and thanks to Miss Arvad and her US 
                        Navy boyfriends, Hoover can pass 
                        Brit convoy schedules to the Gestapo, 
                        helping them undercut the Abwehr.

           Hemingway almost fainting again... Lucas must improvise -

                                 LUCAS
                        Where did the Crook Factory figure?

                                 DELGADO
                        You kidding? The Crook Factory was a 
                        godsend. 
           CONTINUED:
                                 DELGADO (CONT'D)
                        If the OSS ever caught Hoover 
                        passing British convoy schedules to 
                        the krauts he could always blame 
                        Hemingway and his bunch of amateurs.  
                        No way the head of the FBI would be 
                        selling out our Brit allies.

                                 LUCAS
                             (remembers, quoting)
                        “Nazis are a sideshow; the real 
                        war’s against the Commies...” 

           Hemingway is now on his knees...

                                 DELGADO
                        You got it, Joey...

                                 LUCAS
                             (fights for breath)
                        And if the Abwehr ever caught the 
                        Gestapo passing stuff to Hoover, 
                        you could still blame The Crook 
                        Factory.

                                 DELGADO
                        Win-win for all sides.  And then 
                        we’d kill Papa so there wouldn’t  
                        be anyone to deny it.  Which is 
                        just what we’ve done.  

           He stubs out his cigarette -

                                 DELGADO (CONT’D)
                        So - time’s up.  Let’s have the 
                        Russian stuff.  

           Hemingway now on his feet... weaving but upright -

                                 LUCAS
                        In the Chris Craft. Delgado, lemme 
                        ask you something: did you ever 
                        read anything Hemingway ever wrote?

                                 DELGADO
                        Hell no, why the fuck should I?

                                 LUCAS
                        Cause I bet you pissed him off.

           Hemingway’s interlaced FISTS come down on Delgado’s neck and 
           the fight is on as Lucas watches, helpless...
           CONTINUED:

           Delgado tries to go for the gun in his belt, but Hemingway’s 
           huge arms have wrapped themselves around Delgado, pinning his 
           arms and flinging him down, the gun sliding free on the deck 
           towards Lucas...

           But not close enough...  

           As Lucas watches, Hemingway, his head bloody, scrambles with 
           Lucas to reach the gun...

           Delgado gets there first, but Hemingway’s big hand wraps 
           around his, forcing the barrel closer and closer to Delgado’s 
           mouth, as Delgado desperately tries to get his lips out of 
           the way... 

           Impossible.   Delgado lets out a high-pitched scream as -

           Hemingway, hands over Delgado’s on the trigger, forces the 
           barrel into Delgado’s mouth - the soft palate - and blows his 
           head off.

           Lucas passes out.   PULL BACK...

           Three bodies lie on the aft deck of Pilar as we -

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. PILAR, WHEELHOUSE - DAY

           calm seas... Hemingway, grubby, head caked with dry blood, at 
           the wheel.  Abruptly, his hunter’s eye catches something on 
           the horizon ahead of him and he snatches up the BINOCS...

           HIS POV - U238 on the surface.  His Moby Dick.

           The sub’s just sitting there, re-charging her batteries..?

           Then he remembers, looks over to where -

           Lucas, now wrapped in tourniquets of torn shirts strapped 
           around his chest and leg, lies on one of Pilar’s long, side 
           cushions, aft...

           Hemingway’s face.  In other circumstances, he’d be grinning. 
           He reaches for SOMETHING in the cupboard below the wheel.

           Now, with no choice, he heads for the waiting sub...

           Using his belt to lash the wheel, Hemingway runs amidships 
           and lowers the Natural History Marine Research signs...

           Then yells to the nearing U-238 in (subtitled) Spanish -
           CONTINUED:

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Hola!  Auxilio!  Auxilio!!

           Before running back and freeing the wheel, gliding Pilar 
           skillfully alongside the sub, where an OFFICER has appeared 
           in the conning tower with a MEGAPHONE, calling out in German-
           accented, pigeon-Spanish -

                                 SUB OFFICER
                        Hola, que passa, mien freund?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Accident!  My boss from the museum - 
                        he is hurt bad!  I too am bleeding!

           Hemingway can’t see over the top of the conning tower.  He’ll 
           just have to chance that the hatch is open - he starts up...

                                 SUB OFFICER
                        Halt!

           Good enough...  Hemingway pulls the pin on the GRENADE hidden 
           in his hand and lobs it over the top of the tower, where it 
           goes right between the officer’s legs and -

           DOWN THE HATCH - ! (If the guy hadn’t had his hands full with 
           that megaphone...)

           INT. U238 - DAY

           stunned U-boat SAILORS clock the falling GRENADE..!

           The EXPLOSION in the sub’s confined space, blows it apart and 
           practically lifts Pilar out of the water...

           Hemingway, thrown backwards, regains the wheelhouse and guns 
           the engine as behind him, CHAOS -

           - the sub breaking apart with gigantic BUBBLES and muffled 
           SCREAMS... DEBRIS and BODIES erupting above the surface...

           WIDE ANGLE - Pilar flees the scene...

           INT. PILAR, WHEELHOUSE - DAY

           Hemingway, head full of dried blood, ties off the wheel again, 
           then kneels heavily next to Lucas who is very pale, eyes shut.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Lucas..?  Lucas, you’re not going 
                        to do anything foolish, are you?
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUCAS
                        Thought you were dead...

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I told you: my head’s hard as a 
                        brick. Nothing wrong with my 
                        pitching arm, either.  Lucas..?

                                 LUCAS
                             (eyes still closed)
                        Why’d you call it The Crook 
                        Factory?

           Hemingway’s face - THAT’s what he wants to know?  Now?

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        ... I thought it was funny...

           Lucas says nothing...

           WIDE ANGLE - as Hemingway guns the engines...

           CROSS FADE THEIR ROAR WITH A DC 3’s PROPELLERS as we

           EXT. JOSE MARTI AIRPORT, HAVANA - DAY

           the Miami plane waiting, engines revving on the tarmac...

           REVEAL - members of the Crook Factory watching as -

           Hemingway, who now sports the start of a BEARD, and Dr. 
           Sotolongo help Lucas out from the back of the Lincoln... 
           Lucas uses a CANE. He’s thinner, with one funny-looking ear, 
           but alive.  He sees the Crook Factory lined up. And Wolfer...

                                 LUCAS
                        Sure am sorry about the Lorraine, 
                        Wolfer...

                                 WOLFER
                        Not to worry. I’m getting divorced. 
                        I would’ve had to rename her...

                                 PATCHI
                        Anything but Maria.

           Lucas’ face.  Hemingway gently helps Lucas across the tarmac.

                        She fooled all of us...
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUCAS
                        I fooled myself.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Come on, you’ll miss the plane.

                                 LUCAS
                        They’ll hold it for a cripple -

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        A cripple who destroyed not one, 
                        but two Nazi spy rings on Cuba...

                                 LUCAS
                             (grim humor)
                        Alone and unaided.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        You worried the FBI will come after 
                        you?

                                 LUCAS
                        I don’t see it. Braden says New 
                        York cops arrested Inga Arvad when 
                        the Southern Cross docked in 
                        Manhattan and she’s on ice if 
                        Hoover tries making any more 
                        foreign policy decisions. The genie 
                        is back in his bottle. What about 
                        you?

           Hemingway laughs, points to his new beard.

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        I’m in disguise.  

                                 LUCAS
                        Brilliant.  Keep it.

           They stop at the foot of the stairs... Lucas looks back at -

           Sinsky, Wolfer, Patchi, Fuentes and other members of the 
           Crook Factory, watching... Wolfer hoists an invisible GLASS. 

           Lucas waves back at all of them, something between a 
           benediction and a salute - then turns to Hemingway.

           A pause - neither sure what to say...

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Well.  Here we are... 
           CONTINUED:

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Lucas, I don’t think I’ll forget 
                        you in a hurry.

                                 LUCAS
                        I’m not so sure about you. 

           Hemingway’s surprise, but then he grins as Lucas produces a 
           complete copy of FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS from under his arm -

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        I swiped this from your library.  
                        Hope you don’t mind.

           Hemingway conceals his feelings with a smile -

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Now you’ll see how it comes out.

                                 LUCAS
                        Just my plan.  So long... Papa.

           Hemingway’s reaction. Lucas starts up the steps, then turns -

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Visit Santiago for me.

           Hemingway nods, swallows, watches Lucas hobble up the stairs.

           The rest watch him disappear inside -

           INT. D.C. 3 - DAY

           Holding the book, Lucas makes his way down the crowded plane 
           and sits down in an aisle seat, opening the volume -

           Lucas’ surprise: it’s already inscribed:

           To Joe, the man I’d like to be.  Ernest Hemingway

           Lucas blinks, overcome, when the guy by the window turns: 
           Commander Ian Fleming. 

                                 FLEMING
                        Well, well, small world.  Special 
                        Agent Lucas, is it?

                                 LUCAS
                             (closing the book)
                        Not any more...

           The plane starts moving...
           CONTINUED:

                                 FLEMING
                        Bad luck, old man.  Sorry we 
                        couldn’t stay - war to wage and all 
                        that.  But on the bright side, your 
                        navy just won a big victory at 
                        Midway, did you know?  Good show.  
                        The tide is turning, Lucas.  Oh, 
                        before I forget, Mr. Phillips 
                        thought you might enjoy this...

           As the plane starts down the runway, Fleming produces a 
           manila folder pulls out a black & white PHOTOGRAPH:    
           “MARIA” in a bathing suit on a dais, with a trophy -

                                 FLEMING (CONT’D)
                        I believe that’s your friend 
                        Panama, isn’t it?  Aka Elsa Von 
                        Hoffmanstahl, taking a bronze in 
                        long distance swimming at the 1936 
                        Olympics.  Maybe that island didn’t 
                        hold her, after all.

           Lucas stares at the photo, a punch in the gut.

                                 FLEMING (CONT’D)
                        You know, one of these days, I was 
                        thinking of trying my hand at 
                        writing, like your friend.  Seems 
                        easy enough: you stay home and make 
                        things up. I say, what’re your plans?

                                 LUCAS 
                        I don’t have any.

                                 FLEMING
                        Well, maybe you’d like to work for 
                        Mr. Phillips (grins) - you know, 
                        the dwarf?  Take it from me, dear 
                        boy, the OSS is the coming thing.

           Lucas looks at him, realizing: why Fleming’s on the plane.

                                 LUCAS
                        Maybe.  But first I think I’m going 
                        to try being alive...

           He smiles at the thought... and we’ve never seen that smile. 

           EXT. JOSE MARTI AIRPORT, HAVANA

           LOW ANGLE, SHOOTING PAST HEMINGWAY, his back to us as he 
           watches the plane soar into the blue sky... 
           CONTINUED:

           Then turns, smiling, before walking away, leaving the plane 
           alone in our vision.

           CRAWL:

           Much of this story is true.  The Crook Factory was 
           Hemingway’s counterespionage operation in Cuba.

           In 1961, Ernest Hemingway shot himself.  He was convinced the 
           FBI was after him.

           The OSS became the CIA.
