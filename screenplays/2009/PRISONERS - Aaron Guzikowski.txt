           EXT. NEW HAMPSHIRE FIELD - DAWN/THANKSGIVING

           A deer hops through waist-high grass, not far from...

           KELLER DOVER, camouflage, hunting rifle in hand.  A serious 
           man, imposing, still built like a prize fighter at 37.  

           He doesn’t move a muscle; letting his son take the shot...

           RALPH, 15, aims his rifle, a little shaky, still learning.  
           He squeezes the trigger -- POP POP --  

           The deer stumbles towards us, shot in the neck.  It backs up 
           and collapses.  The high grass hides its final moments in a 
           canopy of swaying tendrils.  

           EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER

           Still early morning.  A pick-up truck barrels down the 
           highway.  On the tailgate, in painted letters it says: 
           DOVER CARPENTRY.

           From above we see the shot deer lying in the pick-up’s 
           flatbed.  The truck blows by a roadside sign that says: 
           WELCOME TO MASSACHUSETTS -- 

           INT. KELLER’S TRUCK - TRAVELING

           Keller drives.  Ralph sits in the passenger seat.  The Bible 
           on tape is playing while Keller talks over it --

                                 KELLER
                        Most important thing your Grandpa 
                        ever taught me.  Be ready. 
                        Hurricane, flood, whatever it ends 
                        up being.  No more food gets 
                        delivered to the grocery store, gas 
                        stations dry up.  People turn on 
                        one another and all of a sudden all 
                        that stands between you and being 
                        dead is you. 

           He looks at Ralph.  Ralph nods, idolizes his father even if 
           he barely understands him.  Keller nods back, not finished, 
           not satisfied, but done talking.  He turns the Bible up --

                                 BIBLE
                        And he heard me; out of the belly 
                        of hell cried I, and thou heardest 
                        my voice.  For thou hadst cast me 
                        into the deep --
           EXT. TREEMONT CIRCLE - LATER/THANKSGIVING DAY

           AN OLD YELLOWED RV as it weaves through BROCKTON, 
           MASSACHUSETTS: a blue collar town whose best days are half a 
           century behind it.

           The RV turns onto Treemont Circle, creeping past modest 
           houses with slush covered lawns, past KELLER DOVER’S HOUSE, 
           his pick-up truck parked in the driveway.

           The RV disappears around the bend as...

           The Dover’s front door opens and Keller’s daughter, Anna, 6, 
           walks out into the cold, followed by his wife, GRACE, a 
           fragile looking beauty with a whisper thin voice:

                                 GRACE
                        Wait, Anna.

                                 ANNA
                        Are we taking the truck?

           Ralph comes out --

                                 RALPH
                        We’re going across the street you 
                        dope.

           Keller comes out, cradling a couple hunks of venison bleeding 
           through butcher’s paper. 

           TREEMONT CIRCLE

           Keller and Ralph walk behind Grace and Anna, crossing the 
           street to the Birch’s house. 

                                 RALPH
                        Danny's Dad said he'd sell me their 
                        old car.  I got half of what I need 
                        saved from the summer -- thought 
                        maybe --

                                 KELLER
                        Forget it.  I'm barely getting 
                        enough carpentry work to keep up 
                        with the mortgage.

                                 RALPH
                        Why don’t you rent out Grandpa's 
                        old apartment house? 
                                 KELLER
                        ‘Cause it's an old building.  
                        Cost a fortune to fix it up. 

           THE BIRCH’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The Dovers stand on a neighbor’s doorstep like mute carolers. 
           Ralph lifts up Anna so she can ring the door bell.

           The door opens and they’re welcomed by their neighbors and 
           long time friends THE BIRCHS: 

           FRANKLIN, 36, a bespectacled music teacher who already has a 
           drink in his hand.  His wife NANCY, 32, grabs the cat before 
           it can run out the door.  She’s tough, happy, no nonsense.

                                 NANCY
                        Happy Thanksgiving.  Keller, you 
                        bring that poor deer you shot? 

                                 KELLER
                        No Ma’am, this one’s Ralph’s.

           Ralph shyly accepts credit with an awkward smile.  Keller 
           slaps him on the back, proud as can be.  Behind Franklin and 
           Nancy stand their two girls: ELIZA, 15, and hiding behind her 
           is JOY, 7, shy, wears glasses.

           INT. KITCHEN - THE BIRCH’S HOUSE - LATER

           Nancy peeks at the venison, then wraps it back up while Grace 
           chops an onion --

                                 NANCY
                        You’re in charge of this.  
                        Us veterinarians make lousy 
                        butchers.

                                 GRACE
                        No problem.

           Keller sits on the floor helping Franklin fix a wobbly table 
           leg.  Anna comes running into the kitchen, goes to straight 
           to Keller -- 

                                 ANNA
                        Can I go outside with Joy?

                                 KELLER
                        Convince your brother to go with 
                        you and you can.
           Anna races from the kitchen as Grace yells after her:

                                 GRACE
                        Wear your hat, you’re still getting 
                        over that cold.

           EXT. TREEMONT CIRCLE - DAY

           Joy and Anna take off running, racing each other around the 
           circular block.  Ralph and Eliza take their time following 
           them.  

                                 ELIZA
                        You feel bad for that deer when you 
                        shot it?

                                 RALPH
                        You feel bad for cows when you go 
                        to McDonald's?
                             (off her confused look)
                        That's what my dad says.  And the 
                        deer, they have too many babies and 
                        the babies starve anyway.  You 
                        gotta keep the population down.

                                 ELIZA
                        Your Dad say that too?

                                 RALPH
                             (a little embarrassed)
                        Yeah.  But I agree with him.

                                 ELIZA
                        What do you say?

           He doesn’t look quite sure.  She smiles, amused, obviously 
           smitten.  He looks up ahead --

                                 RALPH
                             (yelling to the girls)
                        Hey, get away from that thing!

           That old RV is parked up ahead on the side of the road, the 
           girls are racing each other to it.  Joy leaves Anna in the 
           dust -- SLAPS the RV's bumper victoriously.

           Ralph and Eliza pick up the pace and catch up to them.  
           The RV is parked in front of a house with a FOR SALE sign.

                                 RALPH (CONT’D)
                        Come on, let's go.
           Eliza walks along the RV peering up at opaque windows smeared 
           with filth.

                                 ELIZA
                        Gross.

           Anna starts to climb a little ladder on the back of the RV, 
           when Ralph pulls her off --

                                 RALPH
                        Let’s go --

           Eliza grabs Joy’s hand and shooshes Ralph.  

                                 ELIZA
                        Do you hear that?

           They all stop and listen.  A radio just came on inside the 
           RV: some 1970's Christian folk song.  

                                 ELIZA (CONT’D)
                        Somebody’s in there.

           Anna hucks a snowball and it SMASHES LOUD on the side of the 
           RV.  Ralph grabs her hand.  

                                 RALPH
                        Cut the shit, I don’t feel like 
                        getting yelled at.  Let’s go.

           Eliza takes Joy’s hand and the four of them continue on 
           around the block...     

           The rear windshield of the RV.  A shadow appears behind the 
           filthy glass, watching them go...     

           INT. DINING ROOM - THE BIRCH’S HOUSE - LATER

           The post-dinner table.  Dirty dishes piled, half empty wine 
           glasses.  The sound of laughter from the next room...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - THE BIRCH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller and Grace sit beside one another.  Grace is drinking 
           wine.  Keller drinks milk.  Nancy shakes her head as Franklin 
           enters with his trumpet, obviously drunk.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        I’m taking requests.

           Anna and Joy run in behind him.
                                 ANNA
                        Mom, can I take Joy to our house?

                                 GRACE
                        Why?

                                 ANNA
                        My red whistle.  She’s going to 
                        help me look for it.

           Grace shakes her head.  

                                 GRACE
                        Sweetie, I think that whistle is 
                        long gone.

           Anna just stares back at her mother, waiting for another 
           answer until:

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Fine, but get Ralph and Eliza to go 
                        with you please.

                                 NANCY
                        What whistle?

                                 ANNA
                        The emergency whistle Daddy gave 
                        me.  I lost it...
                             (thinking)
                        Hundred and thirty-three days ago.

                                 GRACE
                        She’s just like her father, she 
                        can’t let anything go.

                                 FRANKLIN
                             (to Anna and Joy)
                        If you want to find a whistle, you 
                        have to whistle for it.

           Franklin whistles a little something.  Keller rolls his eyes.  
           Anna and Joy fire back with a tuneless sampling of Zip-a-dee-
           doo-dah.  Everybody laughs.  The girls take a bow, and exit.  

                                 FRANKLIN (CONT’D)
                        OK, Keller, what do you want to 
                        hear?

                                 GRACE
                             (giggling, a little drunk)
                        Keller doesn’t like music -- oh, 
                        except the Star Spangled Banner.
           Franklin starts to play the Banner.  Nancy throws a couch 
           pillow at him, laughing.

                                 KELLER
                             (smiling, getting up)
                        Think I need a refill.

           INT. KITCHEN - THE BIRCH'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Grace enters, Franklin’s Banner blaring through the house.  
           Keller pours himself a fresh glass of milk, his back to her.

           She sneaks up and wraps her arms around him --

                                 GRACE
                        Having fun?

           He turns around, immediately taken by her tipsy adoring eyes.  

                                 KELLER
                        When I get you home I will be.

                                 GRACE
                             (coyly)
                        We’ll see about that.

           She kisses him passionately as Franklin's Banner reaches its 
           soaring climax.

           EXT. THE BIRCH’S HOUSE - LATER

           The sun sets behind the Birch house.  

           INT. BASEMENT/TV ROOM - THE BIRCH’S HOUSE - DUSK

           Ralph and Eliza sit watching TV.  They look lobotomized with 
           boredom.  Keller walks in.

                                 KELLER
                        Where are your sisters?

           They both shrug their shoulders.  Grace comes in behind 
           Keller, flushed from too much wine.  

                                 GRACE
                             (to Keller)
                        I can’t find them.
                                 KELLER
                             (to Ralph and Eliza)
                        Did you take them to look for the 
                        whistle?

           Ralph and Eliza just stare blankly.

                                 RALPH
                        Dad, what are you talking about?

                                 GRACE
                        They didn’t come to get you earlier 
                        -- they were supposed to come and 
                        get you.

                                 ELIZA
                        We haven’t seen them since we ate.

           Keller puts his hand on Grace’s shoulder, steadying her.

                                 KELLER
                        Don’t worry, they’re probably at 
                        our house.  

           EXT. TREEMONT CIRCLE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller jogs across the street without his coat on.

           INT. KITCHEN - THE DOVER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller moves fast through the kitchen...

                                 KELLER
                        Girls?  

           INT. STAIRS - THE DOVER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller double times it up the stairs...

                                 KELLER
                        Anna?  Girls?

           INT. HALLWAY - THE DOVER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller runs in and out of the bedrooms one by one.  
           They’re not here.
           INT. BASEMENT - THE DOVER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The light clicks on, Keller rushes down the stairs and looks 
           around.  Food and water to last a lifetime.  Chemical 
           toilets.  Meds for radiation sickness.  Guns.  No girls.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - THE BIRCH’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Grace, Nancy and Ralph wait anxiously in the living room.  
           Keller rushes in, out of breath.

                                 KELLER
                        Are they here?

                                 GRACE
                        Oh God.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        I don’t believe this.  

           Eliza enters from another room.

                                 ELIZA
                        I looked all over the house, 
                        they’re not here.

                                 RALPH
                        The RV, Dad there was this RV and 
                        they were playing on it.  There was 
                        someone inside I think --

                                 KELLER
                        Where?

           EXT. TREEMONT CIRCLE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller, Ralph and Franklin burst out the door.

                                 KELLER
                             (to Franklin)
                        Go that way, we’ll meet you on the 
                        other side.

           We follow Keller and Ralph as they sprint down the middle of 
           the street.  They slow, seeing PAUL BREWER, 45, standing on 
           his stoop puffing on a cigar -- 

                                 KELLER (CONT’D)
                        Paul, have you seen my daughter 
                        walk by here?
           Paul shakes his head.  Then watches on, confused, as Ralph 
           and Keller take off again, hauling ass down the street...

           Ralph makes a hard stop, pointing at some big tracks in the 
           slush where the RV was parked.  

                                 RALPH
                        Here.  It was here.

           Keller looks up at the empty house with the FOR SALE sign on 
           its lawn.  He makes a beeline for the front door.

                                 KELLER
                        Were you guys messing around in 
                        this house?

                                 RALPH
                        No.

           Keller tries the front door.  It’s locked.  Franklin comes 
           running from the other direction, out of breath, shaking his 
           head.  Keller pulls out his cell phone, dialing...

                                 KELLER
                             (to Ralph)
                        Tell me everything you can remember 
                        about that RV...

           INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - LATER

           DETECTIVE LOKI, 33, sits at a darkened table, finishing up 
           his duck.  He’s the only customer.  Hair cropped, suit 
           pressed; looks more like a cadet than a detective.  The 
           WAITRESS walks over with the check, Chinese, 25, gorgeous, 
           all smiles.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Happy thanksgiving, Detective.

           Loki gets up, pays the check in cash, gets his coat on --

                                 LOKI
                        No fortune cookie?

                                 WAITRESS
                        My boss told me cops don’t like 
                        fortune cookies.

           Loki ponders this, amused.  

                                 LOKI
                        Don’t worry about me, sweetie, I 
                        got a bright future.  
           She’s smiling at him.  His phone rings -- 

           INT. BLACK SEDAN - TRAVELING - NIGHT

           Loki drives like a demon while talking on his police radio.

                                 DISPATCH  (V.O.)
                        OK, a woman who saw the Amber Alert 
                        just called, says there’s an RV 
                        matching the description parked at 
                        a rest stop off of Route 24, 
                        northbound, past exit 17.

           Loki pulls over and u-turns fast, wheels SCREECHING.  

                                 LOKI
                        Yep, yep, copy that, 1340 en route.  

                                 COP  (V.O.)
                        This is 1212, we’re en route.

                                 COP 2 (V.O.)
                        1080 en route, we’re about five 
                        minutes away.

                                 LOKI
                        No lights, no sirens.  Wait for me.

           EXT. REST STOP - NIGHT

           The rest stop is empty but for the parked RV facing the 
           adjacent woods.  And on the other side of the narrow lot, 
           cloaked in darkness...

           A parked cop car, with two uniform cops sitting impatiently 
           inside, late twenties: CARTER and WEDGE.  Loki drives up 
           beside them and everybody gets out --

           Loki grabs a shotgun out of his car and leads the way, moving 
           fast, unrelenting.  Carter and Wedge can barely keep up.  

           Loki’s maybe ten feet from the RV’s side door when ITS ENGINE 
           ROARS to life.  IT STARTS BACKING UP, positioning for the on-
           ramp.  Carter and Wedge look to Loki -- What now?

           Then, going the wrong way on the on-ramp, ANOTHER COP CAR 
           BLOCKS THE RV’S ESCAPE, forcing it to change course, angling 
           right for the adjacent WOODS now, accelerating until...

           THE RV SMASHES THROUGH THE TREES, burrowing into the woods 
           for a few yards until it GRINDS TO A HALT --
           Loki runs up behind the RV, Wedge and Carter right behind 
           him, trudging over the newly flattened forest, BLACK SMOKE 
           EVERYWHERE -- 

           Lost in the smoke, Loki moves up alongside the RV.  He peers 
           through the portal glass on the side door:

           A giant branch has punched through the windshield, reaching 
           all the way to the back of the RV.  Nobody’s there.  He tries 
           the door, it’s locked --

           INT. RV - CONTINUOUS

           The side door, as it’s SMASHED IN.  Shotgun ready, Loki moves 
           inside, COUGHING, crazed eyes scanning the RV’s dark 
           interior...  He sees something, levels the shotgun down at...

           A man cowering under the little kitchen table, 34, 
           disheveled, thick glasses, big bushy beard.  
           This is ALEX JONES.

                                 LOKI
                        Show me your hands.  Get down on 
                        your stomach -- on the floor --

           Jones complies, looking terrified.  Loki puts his foot on 
           Jones’ back while he cuffs his hands --

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        Where are they?

           Jones doesn’t answer.  Loki gets up and starts frantically 
           tossing the RV.  Wedge and Carter move inside --

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        They’re not here -- they’re not 
                        fucking here --

           EXT. TREEMONT CIRCLE - NIGHT

           Ralph trails Keller, the two of them marching across a 
           neighbor's lawn, shining their flashlights, searching.  
           A GROGGY MAN, 52, peeks his head out the front door.

                                 GROGGY MAN
                        Get the fuck off my lawn.

           He sees it's Keller and loses the bravado quick. 

                                 KELLER
                        Looking for my girl.
           Groggy Man gets his glasses on and sees the throngs of people 
           walking down the street with flashlights. 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Alex Jones stands against the wall.  He seems spacey if not 
           downright schizophrenic, staring blankly at the picture of 
           Anna and Joy, Loki holds in front of his face.

                                 JONES
                        No.

                                 LOKI
                        No?  They weren’t playing on your 
                        RV?

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE RV AS FORENSICS TEARS IT APART

           The ceiling panels as they’re pulled out one by one.

                                 JONES (V.O.)
                        I didn’t see them.  Can I sit down?

           The grungy carpet of the RV as it’s ripped off the floor.

                                 LOKI (V.O.)
                        Where do you usually park the RV?

           An old eight track tape -- Heaven's Gonna Be A Blast -- as 
           it’s popped out of the dash.  

                                 JONES (V.O.)
                        My aunt’s house.

           EXT. BACKYARD - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - NIGHT

           The house: squalid, small and yellow.  

                                 JONES (V.O.)
                        She let's me park it in the back 
                        yard.  The grass don’t grow back 
                        there anyway.

           Loki paces around in the backyard.  There’s a beat-up Trans 
           Am parked on the lawn, covered in bird crap.  

           Jones’ Aunt, HOLLY JONES, 53, comes out the back door, 
           hugging herself against the cold.  She has a regal face, her 
           long greying hair grown down past her waste.   
                                 HOLLY JONES
                             (hollering to Loki)
                        It was my husband’s.  It’s for sale 
                        if you want it.

                                 LOKI
                        No thanks.

           Loki rubs some dirt from one of the Trans Am’s windows and 
           peers inside.  Nothing there.  

           INT. HOLLY JONES' HOUSE –!NIGHT

           Holly Jones carries a little cat-like dog as she leads Loki 
           through cramped hallways, past little rooms clogged with old 
           furniture.

                                 LOKI
                        Does he sleep in the RV?

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        In the summertime he does, but this 
                        time of year he sleeps on the 
                        couch.  

           She motions to a frayed sofa bed.

                                 LOKI
                        Where are his things?

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - NIGHT

           Holly leads Loki into the small room.  Atop a chest of 
           drawers sits a framed photo of her, circa 1970’s, young and 
           beautiful, sitting inside the then brand new RV, with her 
           long haired, hippie husband.

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        My husband.  We had a fight...God, 
                        almost five years ago.  He walked 
                        out and didn’t come back.  
                        Alex loved him like a father.

                                 LOKI
                        What happened to Alex’s real 
                        parents?

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        My husband’s brother and his 
                        girlfriend.  They died in a car 
                        accident when Alex was six.  
           She opens the top drawer and presents it to Loki: some sorry 
           looking clothes.  A little Matchbox RV.  

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        He doesn’t have much.

           EXT. TREEMONT CIRCLE - NIGHT

           Keller and Ralph about to walk another lap around the circle 
           when Franklin pulls up in his car and rolls down his window --

                                 FRANKLIN
                        They found the RV -- girls weren't 
                        inside.  Parked on that rest stop 
                        near the south woods.  They're 
                        putting together a search party.  

           Keller and Ralph get into the car and Franklin takes off --

           INT. GARAGE - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           What’s left of the RV.  Sitting inside at the little kitchen 
           table is FORENSICS GUY, 55, smarter than most, likes his job.  
           He’s thinking, head leaned back, eyes closed.  Loki walks 
           inside and SLAPS the table --

                                 LOKI
                        What do we got?

           Forensics Guy takes a moment to think of something that makes 
           him frown.

                                 FORENSICS GUY
                        This thing's clean.  I mean it's 
                        filthy as shit, but we didn't find 
                        anything.

           Loki seems unfazed by this piece of news, thinking --

                                 LOKI
                        They could have been wearing winter 
                        hats and mittens the whole time 
                        they were in here.  So no prints, 
                        no hair fibres.  

                                 FORENSICS GUY
                        If he just used this thing to 
                        transport them I might buy that, 
                        but if there was a struggle in here 
                        I would have found something.  
                        I’d start searching the woods near 
                        the rest stop.
                                 LOKI
                        Yeah, half the cops in the state 
                        are doing that right now.  
                        When you’re done with this thing 
                        take a team over to his aunt’s 
                        place.

           Loki takes a bag of coffee beans from his pocket and offers 
           one to Forensics Guy.

                                 FORENSICS GUY
                        Doesn’t make you shaky?

           Loki holds his hand out.  Still as can be.

                                 LOKI
                        I don’t shake.

           EXT. HIGHWAY REST STOP - NIGHT

           The rest stop is swarming with cops and volunteers.  Everyone 
           is heading into the adjacent...  

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           A constellation of flashlights moves through the woods.  
           Keller, Franklin and Ralph are among the searchers, eyes 
           scanning, exhausted...

           EXT. TREEMONT CIRCLE - MORNING

           An AERIAL VIEW of the circular street swarming with ant-like 
           searchers...

           EXT. THE DOVER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           NEIGHBORS wanting to help, but not sure what to do mill 
           around on the Dover’s driveway.  Loki’s car pulls up...

           INT. BATHROOM - THE DOVER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller splashes water on his face.  A little gold crucifix 
           hangs around his neck.  

           His eyes drift to the toothbrush holder.  The little 
           toothbrush with the cartoon character on it.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - THE DOVER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
           Grace is sitting on the couch next to Detective Loki, who’s 
           distracted, reading a text on his phone.  Grace is composed, 
           but there’s dread in her voice.

                                 GRACE
                        Did we pass?

                                 LOKI
                        What?

                                 GRACE
                        The poly-whatever -- the lie 
                        detector we took this morning.

                                 LOKI
                             (puts the phone away)
                        Sorry -- yes, we appreciate your 
                        cooperation.

                                 GRACE
                        Nancy’s lawyer friend told us it 
                        would help speed things up.  
                        It's embarrassing, all this fuss.  
                        Everyone's going to think we're 
                        crazy when those two come out from 
                        wherever they're hiding.  

                                 LOKI
                        You have some reason to think they 
                        ran away?

                                 GRACE
                        No, they were happy, but they must 
                        have run away...  

           She looks to the window, her mind drifting as she listens to 
           the faint sound of congregating neighbors outside.  

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        The police captain said you've 
                        solved every case you've ever been 
                        assigned.  

           Loki nods, pretends to be humble.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        You have children?

                                 LOKI
                             (shakes his head)
                        Maybe when I retire I’ll have some.
                             (beat)

                                 LOKI (CONT'D)
                        We think the girls came back here 
                        after they left you at the Birch’s 
                        yesterday.

           Keller appears in the doorway.  Loki stands up.   

                                 KELLER
                        They were looking for Anna’s red 
                        whistle.

                                 LOKI
                        Right, I read your statement.

           Loki offers his hand to Keller.  Keller looks him up and 
           down, then shakes his hand briefly.

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        Detective Loki.  I'm heading up the 
                        investigation into your daughter's 
                        disappearance.  Please, sit down.

           Keller sits down beside Grace.  She grabs on to his arm.

                                  KELLER
                        Listen, my son told you, the guy 
                        was hiding inside that RV, watching 
                        them.

                                 LOKI
                        We haven’t found any physical 
                        evidence in the RV, or his aunt’s 
                        house where he lives.  Alex Jones 
                        has the IQ of a ten year old and 
                        there’s no way he would have been 
                        able to abduct two girls in broad 
                        daylight and then somehow make them 
                        disappear.

                                 KELLER
                        You give him a lie detector?

                                 LOKI
                        Yeah, we did.  Doesn’t work if you 
                        don’t understand the questions.

           Keller looks far from satisfied with the answer.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - THE DOVER’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Loki’s leaving in his car when Keller runs up alongside.  
           Loki stops, rolls down his window --
                                 KELLER
                        He stays in custody until my 
                        daughter is found, right?

                                 LOKI
                        There’s no charges against him.

                                 KELLER
                        Then charge him with something.

                                 LOKI
                        Mr. Dover, let me worry about --

                                 KELLER
                        Detective, two little girls gotta
                        be worth whatever rules you have to
                        break to keep that asshole in
                        custody.

           Loki considers for a moment while Keller's desperate eyes 
           bore into him.  

                                 LOKI
                        I’ll see what I can do.

                                 KELLER
                        Thank you, Detective.  I appreciate
                        it.

           Loki nods and drives off --

           INT. CAPTAIN’S OFFICE - POLICE STATION - DAY

           O’Malley sits behind his desk shaking his head at Loki.

                                 O’MALLEY
                        You’re positive he’s innocent, but 
                        you want to hold him anyway?  

                                 LOKI
                        I told Anna Dover’s father --

                                 O’MALLEY
                        That’s your fucking problem.  
                        You find his daughter, he’ll 
                        forgive you, you don’t, he’s gonna 
                        hate you anyway.

                                 LOKI
                        One more day -- 
                                 O’MALLEY
                        Fuck you.  And I’m on to you, you 
                        sneaky fuck.  My buddy at MSP told 
                        me you’re angling for a transfer to 
                        Boston’s homicide unit.  

                                 LOKI
                        Nothing personal, but I’m on a 
                        winning streak.  Much as I love 
                        this shithole, it’s onward and 
                        upward, gotta keep climbing until I 
                        run out of ladder.

                                 O’MALLEY
                        Keep this clusterfuck from dragging 
                        me into the depths and I might give 
                        you my blessing.  What’s next?  
                        We’re coming up on twenty-four 
                        hours missing and you have exactly 
                        shit.  

                                 LOKI
                        I’m knocking on doors all night.

           Loki pulls a printout from his pocket.

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        Got nine level three sex offenders 
                        living within a ten mile radius of 
                        Treemont Circle.  

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. SAINT ANNE’S CHURCH - NIGHT

           Headlights wash over a cheaply built grey house, its windows 
           all boarded, a big white cross on its front.  And right 
           beside it...

           Is a small grey house, THE RECTORY.  The headlights wink out.  
           It’s Loki...

           INT. BLACK SEDAN - PARKED - CONTINUOUS

           Looking beat, Loki pops a coffee bean in his mouth.  
           He checks his notebook, crossing off the last of a long list 
           of sex offenders.
           EXT. FRONT DOOR - RECTORY - MOMENTS LATER

           A cracked door bell as Loki pushes it and nothing happens.  
           He sighs, tired, pissed off.  He starts BEATING ON THE DOOR --

                                 LOKI
                             (yelling inside)
                        Police.  Hello?  I need to search 
                        the house, Father.  Open the door.

           He peers in a window near the door: a TV playing an old black 
           and white war movie.  An old priest lying on the floor -- 
           looks dead.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - THE RECTORY - CONTINUOUS

           Loki opens the unlocked front door and rushes inside...

           He squats down beside the priest lying on the floor, FATHER 
           DUNN, 64, grizzled and bald.  He’s not dead, he’s SNORING, 
           passed out.  Empty liquor bottles are everywhere.

           Loki considers, then stands up.

                                 LOKI
                        You mind if I look around?

           Dunn doesn’t seem to mind at all, still SNORING up a storm.  

           INT. KITCHEN - RECTORY - CONTINUOUS

           Loki turns on the light: a wall clock TICKING, a sink full of 
           liquor bottles, an abandoned game of solitaire on the table, 
           cards thrown on the floor...

           Where Loki sees something: a gouged trail in the linoleum.  
           It leads all the way across the kitchen to...

           The refrigerator, it’s been moved.  Loki walks to it shaking 
           his head.  He looks behind it.  It’s blocking a door.  

           Loki sighs and starts shoving the refrigerator off the door.  
           Its old and heavy and doesn’t go easy...

           INT. THE BASEMENT - THE RECTORY - MOMENTS LATER

           The door opens, Loki takes the first step....THEN GRABS THE 
           DOOR FRAME WILDLY -- THE STAIRS HAVE BEEN REMOVED.  It’s a 
           ten foot drop to the basement floor...
           Loki squats down and flashes his flashlight.  Piles of junk 
           obscure his view...

           He gets down and lets his legs dangle off the edge.  Then he 
           turns around, gets in a hanging position, and drops --

           He lands on his feet, then falls back on his ass.  He gets 
           up, cursing under his breath, shining his flashlight -- 
           suddenly startled by three big statues.  Saints.

           Loki moves in closer.  There’s something behind them...

           A MAN IN A CHAIR.  Loki loses his breath, draws his gun --

                                 LOKI
                        Hey!

           Loki shines his flashlight on him...it’s a corpse, skeletal, 
           long since dead.  What was once a very tall man, strapped to 
           a chair with six leather belts.

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        Christ.  

           Loki moves in closer.  He notices a pendant hanging around 
           the corpse’s neck with a maze-like design carved into it.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Loki drags a statue of a kneeling saint under the doorway.  
           He steps on its back, reaches up and grabs the lip of the 
           door frame.  Then, straining, he pulls himself up...

           INT. KITCHEN - RECTORY - MOMENTS LATER

           Father Dunn's POV as he comes to: Loki's dragged him to the 
           basement door AND IS ABOUT TO TOSS HIM OVER THE EDGE, holding 
           him by the back of his shirt.  Dunn is terrified, acting like 
           there's burning lava down there --  

                                 FATHER DUNN
                        NO!  NO!  Don't -- PLEASE!

                                 LOKI
                        Who’s the corpse.  First name, last 
                        name.  NOW, or down you go -- leave 
                        you with your buddy for a while.  
                        Come on!  What’s his name!?  Who is 
                        he?

                                 FATHER DUNN
                        Couldn’t go to the police.
                        They’d never believe a --
           Loki leans him further over the edge -- DUNN SCREAMS --

                                 LOKI
                        NAME, you boy-loving fuck!  
                        His name is all I want to hear come
                        out of your mouth.

           Dunn shakes his head, tears streaming --

                                 FATHER DUNN
                        I DON'T KNOW!  Came to me for 
                        confession.  Killed sixteen 
                        children, he said.  Bragged about 
                        it.  I convinced him to come back 
                        here.  He was going to kill more. 
                        He wouldn’t tell me his name.

           Loki rolls his eyes, yanks Dunn back from the edge -- 

                                 LOKI
                        Right.  Sixteen children huh?
                        I think he was just trying to
                        impress a fellow pervert scumbag --
                        come on, time to go.

           EXT. WOODS - MORNING

           Keller trudges through the woods, an earphone in his ear: 

                                 AM RADIO DJ
                             (in Keller’s ear phone)
                        -- temperatures will be in the low 
                        teens today.  And it looks like 
                        that snow storm is going to just 
                        miss us.  That’s good news for the 
                        volunteers searching the south 
                        woods.  
                             (someone talks off mic)
                        This just came across the AP wire.  
                        Looks like despite pleas from Anna 
                        Dover and Joy Birch’s parents, Alex 
                        Jones is being released from 
                        custody today --

           Keller stops, shocked, listening with wide eyes, turning 
           around.  Franklin and Ralph are about twenty yards behind 
           him.  

           He takes off running towards them, weaving between trees, 
           stomping through the snow, running right past them --

                                 RALPH
                        Dad?  Where you going?
                                 FRANKLIN
                        What’s going on?

           Keller doesn’t answer, running past volunteers wearing SEARCH 
           AND RESCUE jackets, startling a blood hound --

           INT. FRONT DESK - POLICE STATION - DAY

           Jones, his aunt rubbing his back as the DESK SERGEANT gives 
           him paper work to fill out.

                                 DESK SERGEANT
                        Sign here.

           He signs his release papers, slowly and methodically: 
           Alex Winterman Jones.

           EXT. POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Jones and his aunt come out the door, escorted by six uniform 
           cops.  CRAZED REPORTERS AND ANGRY LOCALS ENVELOP THEM --

                                 REPORTER 1
                        Is this your Mother?

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        Don’t talk to them, Alex.

                                 REPORTER 2
                        Do you have any comment on the 
                        girls -- are you innocent?

           Someone is pushing through the crowd towards them.  IT’S 
           KELLER.  HOLLY JONES bumps right into him.  Their eyes lock 
           for a second and then --

           Keller freezes up and lets her pass with Jones right behind 
           her.  Time seems to slow as he watches them disappear into 
           the crowd.  

           Disparate voices ring in Keller’s ears: They’re letting him 
           go.  He did it, look at him.  They’re letting the bastard go.

           A manic electricity starts to build in Keller’s visage...

           And then, suddenly, he springs to life, plowing through the 
           crowd after them, shoving a cop out of the way as he grabs 
           hold of Jones --

                                 KELLER
                        TELL ME WHERE THEY ARE!  
           Jones pulls away, knocking into people, shocked -- 

                                 KELLER (CONT’D)
                        TELL ME WHAT YOU DID WITH THEM!

           A cop tries to pull Keller back.  KELLER COLD COCKS HIM.  
           Another cop, KELLER KNOCKS HIM TO THE CEMENT --

                                 KELLER (CONT’D)
                        I JUST WANT TO TALK TO HIM -- 

           Keller grabs Jones by the shirt.  THEY’RE SWALLOWED BY ANGRY 
           COPS.  Keller’s POV: bodies blocking the light, holding on to 
           Jones by his ripping shirt --

                                 JONES
                             (whispering to Keller)
                        They didn’t cry.  Not until I left 
                        them.

           Keller is in shock, he looks around -- did anybody else hear 
           that?  And then Jones is gone, whisked away with his aunt.  

           Keller starts to get up when he’s smashed back down, 
           uniforms, angry faces, fists --

           INT. CAPTAIN’S OFFICE - POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Loki walks in, O’Malley is talking to Keller, who’s sitting 
           slumped in a chair.  When Keller sees Loki he shakes his head 
           in bitter disgust.

                                 LOKI
                             (off Keller’s look)
                        Listen, I tried --

                                 O’MALLEY
                        I’m talking here.
                             (back to Keller)
                        I know your Dad was a guard at 
                        Walpole, and I got a daughter of my 
                        own so I’m gonna show some mercy on 
                        you.  As for Alex Jones, he has 
                        orders not to leave the 
                        commonwealth.   

                                 KELLER
                        What about what I just fucking told
                        you?!  Why aren't you sending 
                        someone to go arrest this guy?!
                                 O’MALLEY
                        Mr. Dover, tell Detective Loki what 
                        you told me -- he will definitely 
                        look into it.  And when you're 
                        done, I need you to go home.  
                        Your family needs you at home, not 
                        hanging around here.  

           Before Keller can argue O’Malley exits into THE CHAOTIC 
           HALLWAY and shuts the door.

                                 LOKI
                        You have something to tell me, Mr. 
                        Dover?

           Keller takes a moment, bludgeoning Loki with his eyes, then:

                                 KELLER
                        That asshole you promised me you'd 
                        keep in custody, when I grabbed him 
                        in the parking lot, he said right 
                        to my fucking face: they didn't 
                        cry, not until I left them.  

                                 LOKI
                        Just now in the parking lot?  

                                 KELLER
                        What did I say -- yeah, just now in 
                        the parking lot.  

                                 LOKI
                        Anybody hear besides you?

           Keller shakes his head bitterly.

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        You sure you heard him right?

                                 KELLER
                        Jesus Christ -- you think I'm 
                        making this up?

           Loki observes Keller’s hands are shaking...  Keller gets up 
           and walks for the door --

                                 LOKI
                        OK, I’ll go see him.

           Keller stops, looks him in the eye.

                                 KELLER
                        Don't go see him.  Go arrest him.  
           INT. LIVING ROOM - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - DAY

           Jones and his Aunt sit side by side on the couch.  Loki sits 
           across from them on an ottoman.

                                 LOKI
                        So you didn’t say anything to Mr. 
                        Dover out on the parking lot today?  

           Jones shakes his head.

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        Nothing at all?  Maybe he misheard 
                        you?  You didn’t say, get away from 
                        me?  Help?  Nothing like that?

                                 JONES
                        No.

           Loki nods, thinking.

                                 LOKI
                        Can I talk to Alex alone for a 
                        minute?

           She gives Alex a reassuring look, then gets up --

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        I’ll be right in the next room, 
                        Alex.

           She’s gone.  Loki moves in a little closer.  Jones is afraid.  

                                 LOKI
                        Do you like your Aunt?

           Jones doesn’t answer at first, confused, but then:

                                 JONES
                        Yes.

                                 LOKI
                        You know if you know something 
                        about what happened to these girls 
                        and you don’t tell us, your aunt 
                        will go to jail too.  You want that 
                        for her?  After she took care of 
                        you all this time?  

           Jones shakes his head, a little lost.  
           EXT. HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Loki walks to his car on the phone.

                                 LOKI
                             (into the phone)
                        Mr. Dover, it’s Detective Loki.

           INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - THE DOVER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller stands in the hallway on his cellphone.

                                 KELLER
                             (into the phone)
                        Have you arrested him?

                                 LOKI (O.S.)
                             (over the phone)
                        He said he didn't say anything in 
                        the parking lot.  I pushed him hard
                        and he didn't budge.  We can’t 
                        waste anymore time with this guy.  
                        I’ll let you know when I have 
                        something new.  Just hang --

           Keller hangs up the phone, considering with desperate eyes.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - THE DOVER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller walks in.  Ralph sits by Grace’s bedside looking 
           freaked out.  She's holding on to him for dear life, 
           hysterical; denial given way to manic terror.  

                                 GRACE
                        The zipper on her coat was broken, 
                        and I told her it didn't matter, 
                        that we were just going across the 
                        street.  
                             (to Keller)
                        Why hasn't she come home?  It’s 
                        been three days.  Why can't you 
                        make her come home?  I don't 
                        understand.  It's been too long!

           Keller motions to Ralph to get up and sits down next to 
           Grace.  Ralph flees the room.  She motions to a bottle of 
           Xanax on the bedside table.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Give me two, I just want to be 
                        knocked out.  I can't be awake 
                        anymore.
           Keller complies and she swallows the pills with trembling 
           hands.  She lies back.  Keller strokes her hair.  She calms 
           for a moment, then looks up at him accusingly.  

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        You made me feel so safe.  You said 
                        you could protect us from anything.  

           He starts to answer, but nothing comes out.  He looks 
           sickened with shame, turning away from her stare, his eyes 
           finally resting on a ticking clock...

           INT. HALLWAY - THE DOVER'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Keller comes out of the bedroom.  Grace is sleeping.  
           Ralph stands awkwardly in the dark hallway.

                                 KELLER
                        I'm going out to help the police.  
                        Keep an eye on your mother.  

           Ralph's been crying.  His eyes beg his father not to leave.

                                 KELLER (CONT’D)
                        Come on now, your sister needs us 
                        to be brave for her.  You gonna be 
                        brave -- be a grown-up for me?

           Ralph doesn’t answer.  Keller holds his stare for second, 
           then just rushes past him, disappearing down the stairs.

           INT. KELLER’S TRUCK - TRAVELING - NIGHT

           Keller drives listening to the Bible on tape.  

                                 BIBLE
                        He reminds him that trouble and 
                        affliction are what we have all 
                        reason to expect in this world: Man 
                        is brought to trouble...

           EXT. GUN HILL ROAD - NIGHT

           A narrow lane lined with dead hedges and garbage.  A MISSING 
           flyer taped to a telephone pole.  Keller’s pick up truck 
           pulls up across the street from HOLLY JONES’ HOUSE...

           INT. KELLER’S TRUCK - PARKED - CONTINUOUS

           Keller turns off the engine and watches the little house...
           INT. KELLER’S TRUCK - PARKED - LATER 

           Keller’s eyes have lost some of their steely focus.  
           He starts the truck, about to turn on his headlights when: 

           The front door to the house opens, Holly Jones’ dog runs out 
           and close behind it is Alex Jones holding the leash.

           Jones walks it to the edge of the yard, checks to see if 
           anyone’s watching, then lifts the dog by its leash and lets 
           it dangle while he taunts it under his breath.

           Keller looks sickened by the display, but stays in the truck.  
           Jones lowers the dog back to the ground.  And while it gasps 
           for breath, Jones stares up at the sky and whistles a tune: 

           Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay, my oh my what a wonderful --

           Keller grips the steering wheel.  He takes a breath.  
           And gets out of the truck...

           EXT. HOLLY JONES' STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Jones doesn’t notice Keller stalking up behind him as he 
           walks beyond the last working street light into the darkness.

                                 KELLER
                        Alex.

           Startled, Alex turns around to see Keller aiming a pistol at 
           his head.

                                 KELLER (CONT’D)
                        That song you were just whistling, 
                        where did you hear it?

           Jones drops the dog’s leash to the ground and it runs off.  
           He doesn’t look scared as much as quizzical, even when Keller 
           presses the gun to his head.   

           INT. JOY’S ROOM - THE BIRCH’S HOUSE - DAWN

           Joy’s gerbil runs through a habitrail.  Through the window: 
           Keller’s truck pulls up, HONKS.  Franklin jogs out of the 
           house carrying a back pack and gets in the truck --

           INT. KELLER’S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Keller drives.  Franklin sits in the passenger seat, the 
           backpack on his lap, looking supremely confused.
                                 KELLER
                        Did you bring a change of clothes 
                        like I told you?

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Yeah, are you going to tell me why?  

           He notices Keller looks like grim death, eyes red.  
           His knuckles are wrapped in gauze.  

                                 KELLER
                        It’s better if I just show you.

           Moments later.  They turn down a narrow side street lined 
           with slummy three-story apartment houses.  

           Keller parks the truck and gets out.  Franklin doesn’t move.

                                 KELLER (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go.

           Franklin reluctantly gets out of the truck...

           EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Franklin follows Keller to the front door of a triple decker 
           apartment house.  NO TRESPASSING.  LEAD POISON.  CONDEMNED.  
           There’s a padlock on the front door.  Keller has a key.  

                                 FRANKLIN
                        You used to live here, didn’t you?

           Keller nods and Franklin follows him inside...

           INT. THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - APARTMENT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller and Franklin walk inside.  Wires hanging out of the 
           ceiling.  Bare rafters.  Cold air blowing through.  

           Franklin waits for an explanation.  Keller is looking around 
           the place, like he sees things lurking in the shadows that 
           Franklin can’t.

           A sound -- something CLANGING AGAINST A PIPE.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        What’s that?

           Keller walks to the closed bathroom door.  He opens it, then 
           steps aside, beckoning Franklin.  Franklin approaches...
           A gutted bathroom.  JONES SITS IN THE SHOWER STALL, tied to a 
           pipe jutting from a hole in the wall, his head down...

           Franklin backs out of the room, pale-faced, he looks at 
           Keller, shocked.

                                 FRANKLIN (CONT’D)
                        What the hell is this?  What did 
                        you do, Keller?

           Keller pulls him into the next room and gets in his face.

                                 KELLER
                        I heard him whistling the same song 
                        they were whistling on 
                        Thanksgiving.  I swear to God, 
                        Franklin, the same fucking song.  
                        And I told you what he said in the 
                        parking lot.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        So we take him back to the cops.

                                 KELLER
                        He’ll just clam up and act crazy 
                        like he did last time.  Someone has 
                        to make him talk.   

                                 FRANKLIN
                        What if you’re wrong?  What if you 
                        just heard what you wanted to hear?  
                        I want my daughter back as much as 
                        you do, but this isn’t right. 

                                 KELLER
                        We hurt him until he talks or 
                        they’re going to die.  That’s the 
                        choice.  I know what I heard.    

           Franklin looks back inside at Jones, perhaps thinking on what 
           horrible things he might have done to his daughter, rage 
           starting to take hold -- 

                                 KELLER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        He’s not a person anymore.  
                        He stopped being a person when he 
                        took our daughters.

           Franklin turns to Keller, looking painfully conflicted.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        What about us?

           Keller starts wrapping a rag tight around his knuckles.
                                 KELLER
                        I’ll do whatever it takes.   

           INT. CAPTAIN’S OFFICE - POLICE STATION - DAY

           A framed newspaper article on Loki’s desk, ROOKIE COP RESCUES 
           YOUTH.  A bag of coffee beans.  A beat-up Superman action 
           figure.  The Mensa Genius Quiz Book.    

           Loki sits there, doggedly staring at his computer screen. 
           O’Malley walks over.

                                 O’MALLEY
                        They weren’t able to ID the corpse 
                        in the priest’s basement.  
                        The priest is sticking to his 
                        story; thinks he killed the next 
                        Ted Bundy.

                                 LOKI
                        Probably his jilted lover or 
                        something.  Here, check this out -- 

           Loki pulls up an old newspaper article up on the screen:
           BROCKTON BOY DISAPPEARS

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        Seven year old kid, named Eddie 
                        Milland, went missing in 1982.  
                        His Mom took an afternoon nap and 
                        when she woke up he was gone.  
                        No suspects.  No evidence.  Never 
                        found.  Check out his address.

           O’Malley squints at the screen, reading slowly to himself, 
           Loki gets impatient --

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        48 Treemont Circle.  That empty 
                        house the RV was parked in front 
                        of.  Eddie Milland’s mom moved out 
                        of that house three years ago.  
                        Lot of people on the street had 
                        started complaining she was scaring 
                        their kids, watching them and 
                        whatnot.  She lives with her 
                        daughter and son in Easton now.

                                 O’MALLEY
                        Alright.  Go check it out.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - THE MILLAND’S HOUSE - DAY

           Loki’s POV of the TV: an old home video of Eddie Milland, 6.  
           He’s playing inside a big cardboard box/playhouse, staring 
           out one of the cut-out windows.

                                 MRS. MILLAND (O.S.)
                        Same person who took him took those 
                        girls.  I’m sure of it.

           The video starts to distort, the image deteriorating --

                                 MRS. MILLAND (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Oh Christ.  I’m wearing out the 
                        tape I guess.  I watch it everyday 
                        after breakfast.  It’s the only 
                        video I have of him.  

           Loki’s gaze turns to the unblinking eyes of Mrs. MILLAND, 65, 
           unable or unwilling to get up off the couch, her rotund frame 
           draped in vertiginous patterns.  

                                 MRS. MILLAND (CONT’D)
                        I read about you in the newspaper.  
                        The great finder of lost children.  
                        Maybe if you had been around twenty-
                        seven years ago...  Well, you 
                        weren’t, so what does it matter.

           KIM MILLAND enters, 37, along with her brother SCOTT, 35.  
           They orbit their mother like nervous nurses.  

                                 MRS. MILLAND (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead and search the house.  
                        I know from experience how precious 
                        time is to you right now.  Scott 
                        will go with you, in case you need 
                        to move something, he can put it 
                        back.  He knows where everything 
                        goes.  

           INT. THE BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           The light flickers on and Scott leads Loki down the stairs.  
           The basement is completely empty -- so empty SCOTT’S VOICE 
           ECHOES:

                                 SCOTT
                        We’re not allowed to put things 
                        down here.  She likes to have 
                        everything where she can see it.
           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Scott shows Loki into a room filled with old toys and 
           translucent storage containers stacked to the ceiling.

                                 SCOTT
                        Everything Eddie ever touched.  

           Loki nods, seeing the old cardboard box/playhouse from the 
           home video.  He weaves through the clutter towards it...  

                                 LOKI
                        You said you knew Anna Dover’s 
                        father when you lived on Treemont?

                                 SCOTT
                        Not really knew him.  His son was 
                        playing on our lawn one time -- 
                        this was years ago -- and my 
                        mother, she grabbed him and tore 
                        his shirt a little.  She was 
                        confused.  I stopped her and sent 
                        the kid home.  Other than his shirt 
                        he was fine.  Then an hour later 
                        his father comes over and starts 
                        threatening me -- obviously drunk, 
                        but he seemed serious enough.  
                        I locked the doors and waited for 
                        him to leave.  But he didn’t, he 
                        just sat there on our front steps 
                        for over an hour.  Didn’t leave 
                        until the cops came.   

           While considering this Loki looks inside the cardboard 
           box/playhouse.  An old stuffed animal sits inside staring out 
           at him.

           EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT

           The sun is gone.  A lone light in the third floor window...

           INT. BATHROOM - THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Franklin braces Jones, keeping him standing while -- CRACK -- 
           Keller slugs his bloodied face for what looks like the 
           hundredth time.

                                 KELLER
                        Why?  Why won’t you just fucking 
                        tell us!?  You’re doing this to 
                        yourself.
           Keller winds up to hit him again, but Jones’ head is hanging 
           now, barely conscious.  Keller drops his fists, furious.  
           Franklin lets Jones collapse to the floor.

           INT. THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - APARTMENT HOUSE - LATER

           Keller unwraps the now bloodied rag from his knuckles while 
           Franklin puts on a clean shirt.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        It doesn’t seem like he even knows 
                        what’s happening to him.  

                                 KELLER
                        That’s what he wants you to think.  
                        It’s an act.  
                             (beat)
                        We’ll start up again in the 
                        morning.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Start what up again?  It’s not 
                        working.

                                 KELLER
                        Then we’ll try something else.

           EXT. TREEMONT CIRCLE - NIGHT

           Franklin walks up the street towards where the RV once 
           parked.  It’s alive with lights.  

           He gets closer.  A candlelight vigil.  At least a hundred 
           people, standing in the cold.  He walks past a reporter --  

                                 REPORTER
                        Four days have passed since Anna 
                        Dover and Joy Birch were last --

           He spots Nancy and Eliza and goes to them.

                                 NANCY
                        Hi.

           He takes her hand, then Eliza’s...

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                             (whispers to Franklin)
                        Where have you been?

           He doesn’t answer.  All the lights are making him nauseous.
                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Franklin?

                                 FRANKLIN
                        The woods, searching.

           The lights are unbearable.  He lets go of their hands, 
           reeling a little.

                                 NANCY
                        What is it?

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Nothing, I’m OK.  Just need to sit 
                        down.

           As his wife and daughter walk after him, he sits down on 
           someone’s lawn and tries not to throw up.  

           Someone in the crowd is watching them: a man wrapped up like 
           a leper in filthy winter wear, face obscured.  He leers at 
           the Birchs until Eliza notices him and he looks away --

           EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - MORNING

           Franklin follows Keller up the front stairs, looking like 
           he’s being led to the gallows...

           INT. CAPTAIN’S OFFICE - POLICE STATION - DAY

           Loki walks in and drops something on O'Malley's desk. 
           A little dog collar with ID tags on it.

                                 LOKI
                        Jones' aunt's dog.  Car hit it on 
                        Southworth Street.  Turns out Jones 
                        took it for a walk the night before 
                        last and didn't come back.  His 
                        aunt didn't tell us until we called 
                        her about the dog this morning -- 
                        said she didn't want to get him in 
                        trouble.  I thought we were gonna 
                        keep him under surveillance. 

                                 O’MALLEY
                        You get new information?  You told 
                        me the guy was innocent.  I don’t 
                        have money in the budget for 
                        watching innocent people.

                                 LOKI
                        I like knowing where everybody is.
           A CLERK walks in --

                                 CLERK
                        Loki, you got a call.

           INT. DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

           Christmas music squawks as Detective Loki stands in the check-
           out line talking to JILL, 16, working the register.  

                                 JILL
                        This guy comes in here every week 
                        almost and buys kid’s clothes, but 
                        he’s always buying stuff in 
                        different sizes.  He was in here 
                        this morning messing around with 
                        the kid-sized mannequins.  I asked 
                        him what he was doing -- he got all 
                        freaked out and left without the 
                        clothes.  

                                 LOKI
                        Did he pay with a credit card?

                                 JILL
                        Nope, cash.  

           Loki pulls out his notebook, pulls out a picture of Jones.

                                 LOKI
                        This guy?

           She looks at the picture --

                                 JILL
                        He’s always bundled up in this big 
                        dirty coat -- couldn’t really see 
                        his face...

                                 LOKI
                        Here’s my card.  If he comes back, 
                        call me.

           INT. THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Franklin, shivering in his underwear fumbles in his backpack 
           for clean clothes.  He’s crying silently.

                                 KELLER
                        We’re not done, Franklin.
           Keller stands a few feet away, blood on his shirt, stone 
           faced.  The closed door to the bathroom, Jones whimpering.  

                                 FRANKLIN
                        We’ll -- we’ll come back later.  
                        Need to get home.

                                 KELLER
                        It’s been five days.  Maybe five 
                        days since they’ve had a drink of 
                        water.  This could be the last 
                        night that matters.  

                                 FRANKLIN
                        I’ll call you after Nancy falls 
                        asleep.  I promise. 

           Keller looks dubious.

           INT. KITCHEN - THE BIRCH’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Nancy pours Eliza a bowl of cereal, they both look exhausted.

                                 NANCY
                        Will you do me a favor and start 
                        feeding your sister’s gerbil?  
                        Just until she comes back.   

           Eliza nods.  Nancy pours the milk.  Then sits down, her cold 
           coffee waiting.  Eliza eats a cereal flake with her 
           fingers...

           The sound of Franklin coming in the front door.  Nancy gets 
           up fast --

           INT. VESTIBULE - THE BIRCH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Franklin locks the front door as Nancy appears behind him.  

                                 NANCY
                        Do you know what time it is?  

           He turns to face her.  She stops, shocked by the way he 
           looks, like he’s aged, and his eyes -- staring through her.

           EXT. THE DOVER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           With Franklin standing meekly behind her, Nancy rings the 
           door bell over and over, until finally Keller opens the door.

           Nancy glowers at Keller, trembling...
                                 NANCY
                        I want to see him Keller.

           Keller gives Franklin the evil eye.

           INT. KELLER’S TRUCK - TRAVELING - NIGHT

           Nancy and Franklin ride up front with Keller.  Keller pulls 
           into a liquor store parking lot.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Where are we going?

                                 KELLER
                        Can’t keep parking in front -- 
                        people are gonna notice.  
                        We’ll walk from here.

           EXT. LIQUOR STORE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Keller, Nancy and Franklin get out of the truck and walk 
           silently across the parking lot.  A doll peeks out of Nancy’s 
           purse...

           INT. BATHROOM - THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           The bathroom door opens.  Nancy walks in, alone, clutching 
           her purse...  

           Jones’ wrists are tied to a pipe in the shower.  His face is 
           all but hidden; wrapped in blood soaked rags, just one eye 
           peeks out...

           Nancy doesn’t scare easy; she moves in close and gets down to 
           eye level with him...  

           She pulls some pictures of Joy out of her purse and lays them 
           out on the floor.  Then some drawings.  And finally the doll.  

                                 NANCY
                        This is her favorite doll.  
                        She can’t sleep without it.  

           Nancy fights to keep from crying.  She looks to Jones, his 
           cyclops eye staring blankly.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        She did these drawings.  They’re 
                        kind of sad, see.  She hasn’t had 
                        the easiest life. 
           He starts to come to life a little; leaning over to get a 
           closer look at the photos and drawings.  

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Please help her.

           She stops and considers for a moment.  Then, with shaking 
           hands, she unties his wrists from the pipe.   

           His mangled hands free now, Jones starts to remove the rags 
           from his head.  His face is a horror.  His mouth is moving.  
           He’s saying something...    

           Nancy moves in closer, closer, until finally she gets the 
           message:

                                 JONES
                        Help me.

           Jones grabs Joy's doll, stands up and backs away from Nancy, 
           towards THE WINDOW...

           Jones beats the doll's plastic head against the window until 
           the glass shatters.  Nancy SCREAMS.  Keller and Franklin rush 
           inside. 

                                 KELLER
                        You untied him?!

           Jones is wriggling out the window, about to plunge three 
           floors, when Keller grabs his legs and yanks him back in.

           Jones grabs a shard of glass off the sill.  Keller gets his 
           chest slashed as he grabs Jones' wrist and slams it into the 
           wall repeatedly.  Jones drops the shard -- 

           Shocked, Nancy watches Keller and Franklin struggle to tie 
           Jones back up, trampling Joy’s belongings beneath their feet.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Loki sits down across from Father Dunne.  Standing by the 
           door is the seldom smiling DETECTIVE CHEMELINSKI, 43.

                                 LOKI
                        Detective Chemelinski said you had 
                        some specifics about the crimes you 
                        claimed this man committed.  
                        The abductions.

                                 FATHER DUNN
                        He was waging a war against God.
           Loki shakes his head --

                                 LOKI
                        Great.
                             (to Chemelinski)
                        You told me he had something?

                                 CHEMELINSKI
                             (to Dunne)
                        Tell him how he took the kids, 
                        shitbird.  

           Loki looks back to the priest, waiting...

                                 FATHER DUNN
                        He said he took them in daylight.  
                        Sometimes more than one child at a 
                        time.  

           Loki leans in, suddenly very interested.

                                 LOKI
                        He said that?

                                 FATHER DUNN
                        Yes.  

                                 LOKI
                        Did he mention an accomplice?  
                        Any names?

                                 FATHER DUNN
                        No.  But he said he had a family.  
                        A wife and a son.

           INT. THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT

           The closed door to the apartment.  Behind the door we hear 
           the WHINE OF A BAND SAW REVVING UP.

           INT. THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Keller, leaned over the band saw lost in a cloud of saw dust 
           as he slices through a piece of plywood.

           He slams nails into wood with a nail gun, one after another, 
           like the ticking of some two ton clock hand.  We’re too close 
           to see what he’s building...
           INT. THE BIRCH’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Nancy stands in front of the humming microwave, zoning out as 
           leftovers bubble and melt.  IT BEEPS.  The clock: 2:05 am.
           The door bell rings.  

           VESTIBULE

           Nancy opens the door.  It’s Keller.  He’s covered in sawdust.  

                                 NANCY
                        What is it -- what happened?

                                 KELLER
                        Get Franklin.  I need to show you 
                        how it works.  

           INT. THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT

           Keller, Franklin and Nancy approach the closed bathroom door.  

                                 FRANKLIN
                        We need to let him go.

                                 KELLER
                        You said that already.

                                 NANCY
                        Has he said anything new?

                                 KELLER
                        He will.  Soon.  You’ll see.

           INT. BATHROOM - THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           No sign of Jones, but where the shower used to be is a false 
           wall made of wood: THE CELL.   

                                 KELLER
                        No light gets in, barely enough 
                        room to sit down inside.  
                        The shower still works, but we 
                        control it from out here.  I rigged 
                        the water heater, so it either 
                        comes out scalding or freezing.

           He motions to two pipes jutting out of the cell, with faucet 
           knobs on the end, “cold” and “hot.”

                                 KELLER (CONT’D)
                        Talk to him through this --
           Keller motions to a PVC pipe jutting out, bent like an elbow.
           Nancy leans in and listens: JONES IS INSIDE sobbing...

                                 NANCY
                        Oh my God.

           Franklin notices a little picture of Anna and Joy tacked to 
           the outside of the cell.

                                 KELLER
                        To remind us.  In case we start 
                        feeling sorry for him.

           Nancy and Franklin are stupefied.

                                 KELLER (CONT’D)
                        We can’t hurt him any more without 
                        killing him.  This is the only way.  

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Are you out of your fucking mind?

           INSIDE THE PITCH BLACK CELL 

           Jones stops sobbing and quiets, listening to the muffled 
           timbre of their voices...

                                                               BACK TO:

           Keller, as he picks up a hammer and hands it to Franklin.  

                                 KELLER
                        You have a better idea?  Go ahead, 
                        let him out if you want to.  
                        I won’t stop you.  If that’s really 
                        what you want, go ahead.

           Franklin considers with harried eyes...    

                                 KELLER (CONT’D)
                        You think someone is looking out 
                        for our girls the way you’re 
                        looking out for him?  Five days 
                        they’ve been gone now.  We’re 
                        running out of time. 

                                 FRANKLIN
                        We don’t even know if he’s the guy 
                        Keller.  

                                 KELLER
                        I do.
                                 FRANKLIN
                        I want my daughter back as much as 
                        you do.  I’d die for her -- but 
                        this needs to end.

                                 KELLER
                        Then you better get to work.  
                        I’d start with that wall there.

           Franklin looks to Nancy, but her eyes are lost.  He takes a 
           breath, then goes to the cell, starting to pry at one of the 
           walls with the hammer.  

           After a few moments Nancy puts her hand on his shoulder --

                                 NANCY
                        Don’t.  Franklin, stop.  

           He shakes his head and keeps on prying at the wood, BREAKING 
           OFF A SMALL PANEL --

           SUDDENLY JONES REACHES OUT AND GRABS HIM.  Franklin drops the 
           hammer.  NANCY SCREAMS as he yanks his arm from Jones’ grasp.

           Franklin levels a long accusing stare at Keller.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s just go.  Please.

           Franklin finally heeds his wife and they leave Keller alone 
           with his creation...

           EXT. BACK YARD - THE BIRCH’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           An unseen person’s POV, the INTRUDER, creeping across the 
           Birch’s moonlit backyard, moving towards...

           THE BACK DOOR

           We see the Intruder’s shadowed hand jimmying the lock with a 
           screw driver...

           INT. BATHROOM - THE BIRCH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Eliza is taking a bath, talking on her cell phone to Ralph.  

                                 ELIZA
                             (into phone)
                        I need to get out of here, Ralph.  
                        Everything in this house makes me 
                        want to throw up.

                                 ELIZA (CONT'D)
                             (listening)
                        We should go to a hotel or 
                        something and hide out.
                             (listens, smiles)
                        Yeah, I thought you’d like that 
                        idea.  

           INT. HALLWAY - THE BIRCH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Back to the Intruder’s POV, moving down the hallway: he stops 
           at the closed bathroom door, listening to Eliza’s voice...

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - THE BIRCH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Nancy and Franklin get out of the minivan, mid-argument:

                                 NANCY
                        Fine, I won’t go to the police, but 
                        if you go back to that place, I 
                        swear to God I’ll tell them 
                        everything.  Let Keller do what he 
                        thinks he needs to, but we don’t 
                        know about it anymore.  

           Franklin nods, seemingly in agreement, shell shocked.

           INT. HALLWAY - THE BIRCH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Franklin walks down the hallway, stopping at the closed 
           bathroom door.  He knocks.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        Eliza?

           He knocks again.

                                 FRANKLIN (CONT’D)
                        Eliza?  You in there?

           He tries the door.  It’s locked.  Nancy comes up behind him.

                                 NANCY
                        What’s the matter?

           Franklin turns to her, terrified.

                                 FRANKLIN
                        She’s not answering.

           Nancy’s eyes go wide.  She rattles the doorknob -- BANGS ON 
           THE DOOR --
                                 NANCY
                        Eliza, honey open the door.  
                        Open the door, sweetheart -- Oh 
                        Jesus -- 
                             (screaming at Franklin)
                        Break it down!  Hurry up!

           Franklin stands back, about to kick the door in when Eliza 
           opens the door in a towel, hand over her cell phone.  

                                 ELIZA
                        Fuck you both.  Next time you’re 
                        going to leave me here alone -- 
                        maybe you could try at least 
                        telling me where you’re going.

                                 NANCY
                        I’m sorry, honey, we thought you 
                        were sleeping -- we were at the 
                        police station --

           Eliza slams the door in their face.  

           EXT. TREEMONT CIRCLE - CONTINUOUS

           Back to the Intruder’s POV: as he moves across the street to 
           the Dover’s house.  Keller’s truck isn’t in the driveway.  
           He moves around to the back of the house...

           INT. HALLWAY - THE DOVER’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The intruder’s POV: as he moves past the closed door to 
           Ralph’s room.  The muffled sound of him talking on the phone.  

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - THE DOVER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Grace lies in bed, sleeping, suddenly awakened as she hears a 
           noise in the next room.  She sits up.

                                 GRACE
                        Anna?  Anna?

           She gets out of bed...

           INT. HALLWAY - THE DOVER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Grace moves slowly down the hallway.  She sees the door to 
           Anna’s room is open...
           INT. ANNA’S ROOM - THE DOVER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Grace walks inside the room and turns on the light.  
           Anna’s window is conspicuously open, curtains billowing.  

                                 GRACE
                        Anna?  I heard you.  It’s Mommy, 
                        honey.  Come out and see Mommy.

           She stands there in the middle of the room, zoning out, her 
           breath starting to show in the cold.  Ralph appears in the 
           doorway, half asleep.

                                 RALPH
                        Ma, what are you doing?  
                        It’s freezing.

           Ralph goes to the window.  He looks outside.  Nothing there.  
           He shuts the window --

           INT. ANNA’S ROOM - THE DOVER’S HOUSE - LATER

           Loki follows a thoroughly drugged Grace into Anna’s room.

                                 GRACE
                        She was in here.  I heard her.  And 
                        when I came in, the window was --

           She starts to get dizzy.  Loki steadies her and sits her down 
           on the side of the bed.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        She opened her window.  
                        Ralph closed it, but it was opened 
                        before.
                             (beat)
                        Aren’t you going to write that 
                        down?

           Loki nods, and trying to do so with as little condescension 
           as possible, pulls out his note pad and jots down: 
           IN THE HOUSE?  OPEN WINDOW

                                 GRACE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        The basement.  I need to check the 
                        basement.

           INT. BASEMENT - THE DOVER’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Grace leads Loki down the stairs.  Loki looks around, a 
           little taken a back by the floor to ceiling provisions.
           While Grace searches for Anna, Loki notices something on 
           Keller’s work table.  A little sketch: a stick figure in a 
           box...  

           Then he sees something else, among the provisions...a half 
           used bag of lye.  He lingers on it for a moment.

                                 LOKI
                        Where is your husband, Mrs. Dover?

                                 GRACE
                        I was going to ask you.  He said 
                        he’s been helping the police look 
                        for Anna.  

           Loki looks dubious, thinking...

                                 LOKI
                        You think he’ll be back soon?

                                 GRACE
                        No.  He’s never home until late.

           Loki looks at his watch: 3:45 am. 

           INT. BLACK SEDAN - PARKED - DAY

           Loki puts his window down, reaches out and wipes a little 
           snow from the windshield.  Now he can see again: he's parked 
           up the street from the Dover's house.

           EXT. THE DOVER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller emerges from his front door and walks to his truck.  

           INT. BLACK SEDAN - TRAVELING - CONTINUOUS

           Loki drives, tailing Keller.  He yawns then pops a coffee 
           bean into his mouth.  

           He turns the police radio down and turns on the FM, tuning in 
           a 50’s pop song, tapping along, trying to stay alert.  

           INT. KELLER’S TRUCK - TRAVELING - CONTINUOUS

           Keller listens to the Bible on tape while he drives, fast 
           forwarding, looking for something he’s not finding, until it 
           EATS THE TAPE.
           EXT. LIQUOR STORE PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Keller pulls into the parking lot -- 

           EXT. LIQUOR STORE PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Keller gets out of the truck and starts across the snow 
           covered parking lot towards the apartment house.  

           INT. BLACK SEDAN - PARKED - CONTINUOUS

           Loki pulls to the side of the road, watching Keller trudge 
           across the parking lot when a truck comes up behind him --

           It’s a snow plow.  Loki waves him past, but the plow doesn’t 
           budge, BLARING HIS HORN --

                                 LOKI
                        Shit.  Shit shit shit.

           EXT. LIQUOR STORE PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Keller hears the snow plow’s HORN BLARING.  He looks over and 
           spots Loki’s car.  

           Keller freezes.  He’s busted; standing in the middle of an 
           empty parking lot, nowhere near his truck, about to lead Loki 
           to the apartment house.  

           He grimaces, thinking.  He looks back over his shoulder.  
           The liquor store MANAGER, 38, is raising the storefront 
           security cage -- 

           Keller does an about face, and starts walking back, veering 
           towards the liquor store.  

           INT. BLACK SEDAN - PARKED - CONTINUOUS

           Loki watches, baffled, as Keller walks into the liquor store.

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS

           The Manager is still turning on the lights when Keller walks 
           in...

                                 MANAGER
                        Don’t open until noon.

           Keller turns to look at him --
                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Oh, hey, Keller.  Been a while.  

           Keller nods to him, grabs a bottle of whiskey and brings it 
           to the counter, taking out his wallet, watching Loki’s car 
           out the window --

                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        No charge.  I’m sorry about your 
                        girl.

           Keller scowls, smacks twenty bucks on the table, grabs his 
           purchase and goes --

           INT. BLACK SEDAN - PARKED - MOMENTS LATER

           Loki watches as Keller walks from the liquor store, paper bag 
           in hand, making a bee line for Loki’s car.  Loki shakes his 
           head; he can’t believe this guy.  

           As he approaches, Keller pulls the bottle from the paper bag, 
           unscrews the cap and takes a slug...

           EXT. LIQUOR STORE PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Keller knocks on Loki’s passenger side window.  Loki puts the 
           window down...    

                                 KELLER
                        Why are you following me?

           INT. BLACK SEDAN - PARKED - CONTINUOUS

           Loki leans over the seat and opens the door.  

                                 LOKI
                        Sit down.

           Keller takes his time, but he does as he’s asked and gets in.  
           He sits there and takes another long haul of whiskey.

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        You’ve got a half a bag of lye in 
                        your basement and you’ve been lying 
                        to your wife about helping us.

           Keller shakes his head in bitter disbelief, breathes out:

                                 KELLER
                        Used the lye to bury our dog last 
                        year.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 KELLER (CONT'D)
                        And helping the cops sounds better 
                        than I’ve been driving aimlessly in 
                        my truck, ‘cause I don’t know what 
                        the fuck else to do.

                                 LOKI
                        Is that what you were doing on 
                        Saturday night?  

                                 KELLER
                        Probably.

                                 LOKI
                        I’m asking because you assaulted a 
                        man who is now missing.  

                                 KELLER
                        I heard.  So what happened to him?

                                 LOKI
                        I assume the fact you’re asking 
                        means you don’t know.

                                 KELLER
                        I didn’t think it was something I 
                        could get away with.

                                 LOKI
                        It’s not.

                                 KELLER
                        Couldn’t be that he skipped town 
                        ‘cause the asshole is guilty, nah 
                        couldn’t be that, ‘cause that would 
                        be your fault, wouldn’t it?  

                                 LOKI
                        Where were you going just now?

                                 KELLER
                             (raises the bottle)
                        To get this.

                                 LOKI
                        No, before that.  You were walking 
                        in the other direction, across the 
                        parking lot towards Campello 
                        Street.  

           Keller drinks some more, stalling, until:

                                 KELLER
                        I haven’t had a drink in a long 
                        time.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 KELLER (CONT'D)
                        I figured if I walked around the 
                        parking lot for a while, by the 
                        time they opened I’d stop wanting 
                        it so bad.  Then I saw you, and 
                        that sort of helped make up my 
                        mind.  

           Loki stares into Keller’s eyes, finding no apparent trace of 
           falsity, just undeniable sadness.  Keller offers the bottle 
           to Loki.  Loki shakes his head.

                                 LOKI
                        Your little girl will need you when 
                        she comes home, Mr. Dover.  You and 
                        your wife need to take care of 
                        yourselves, that’s the best thing 
                        you can do for her right now.

                                 KELLER
                        Thanks for the tip.
                             (guzzles some whiskey)
                        I heard kids gone for more than a 
                        week have half as good a chance of 
                        being found.  And after a month 
                        almost none are.  Not alive.

           Beat.

                                 LOKI
                        It hasn’t been a week yet.

           Keller starts to get out of the car, but before he closes the 
           door.

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        You don’t think I’m going to let 
                        you get behind the wheel of an 
                        automobile after you’ve been 
                        drinking -- in the middle of a 
                        blizzard.  Let me drive you home.  

                                 KELLER
                        I’m gonna walk.

           Keller shuts the door, and Loki watches as he walks off into 
           the white blur of falling snow.

           EXT. THE DOVER’S HOUSE - DUSK

           Keller trudges up his driveway, completely drunk, half 
           frozen.  He tosses the now empty bottle of whiskey into a 
           snow drift.
           INT. BEDROOM - THE DOVER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller walks in.  Grace is passed out in bed.  He takes his 
           boots off, almost falling over in the process.  

           Then he crawls into bed with his clothes on, his bloodshot 
           eyes fluttering closed...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KELLER’S DREAM - BEDROOM - NIGHT - THE DOVER’S HOUSE

           Keller opens his eyes to see ANNA STANDING BY THE SIDE OF THE 
           BED.  He’s too shocked to speak.  She holds up a red whistle. 

                                 ANNA
                        Look, Daddy!  We found it!  
                        We found it!  It was at the bottom 
                        of the Brewer’s pool!     

           Keller sits up, eyes tearing, reaching for her --

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. BEDROOM - THE DOVER’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Keller wakes up aghast, and still a little drunk.  He thinks 
           for a moment -- staring at the spot where Anna stood in his 
           dream, when suddenly his face goes hard with fright --  

                                 KELLER
                        No -- no --

           He jumps out of bed --

           INT. DEN - PAUL BREWER’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           BUD BREWER, 8, stares through a sliding glass door at the 
           pool area in his back yard.  He’s intently watching something 
           we can’t yet see...

                                 BUD
                        Mom, there’s a man in our yard.

           JANE BREWER, 29, still in pajamas, coffee in hand, walks up 
           behind Bud --

                                 JANE
                        Come eat your breakfast, Bud.  

           She looks out the glass door, and drops her coffee.  
                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                             (calling into the next 
                              room)
                        Paul!  PAUL!

           EXT. POOL AREA - PAUL BREWER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Paul, in boots and pajamas, slowly slides open the glass 
           door, frightened eyes locked on...

           The pool.  Someone’s dragged part of the pool cover off.  
           Paul walks up to the pool’s edge, his wife and son watching 
           through the glass door in the background...

           Baffled, Paul stares down at the exposed icy green water when 
           suddenly -- KELLER BURSTS TO THE SURFACE, SUCKING AIR --

           Paul almost has a heart attack, backing away, eyes wide, as 
           Keller climbs out of the pool, shivering, skin blue -- 

                                 PAUL
                        Keller?  What the hell is going on?

           Keller doesn’t answer, his eyes look like they’re still 
           dreaming.  He lumbers away without a word, while Paul and his 
           family watch on in shocked disbelief.

           Paul takes a look in the water to see if he’s missing 
           something.  But all he sees is a pool full of ice and leaves.

           EXT. REST STOP - DAY

           Two WOMEN, 40’s, sit ready to hand out reflective vests and 
           hot cocoa.  There’s plenty left.  Only about five volunteers 
           have shown up to search the woods.

           Ralph walks up to the table, looking around, baffled at the 
           lack of turn out.  One of the women is reading a newspaper:
           SEARCH ENTERS SIXTH DAY

                                 RALPH
                        Where is everybody?

                                 MOTHER
                        Don’t know, sweetie.  Too cold for 
                        some people I guess.

           Ralph shakes his head.  She hands him a vest.  He puts it on 
           and walks to the meager group preparing to head into the 
           woods...
           INT. LOKI’S DESK - BROCKTON POLICE STATION - DAY

           Loki, stares at his computer screen, perplexed.  He’s been 
           here all night and looks it.

           The CAPTAIN’S SECRETARY, 29, walks by drinking coffee.

                                 CAPTAIN’S SECRETARY
                        You need a shower, Loki.  

           Loki waves her away.  On screen: a newspaper article.  
           A picture of Keller’s Dad.  The headline: WALPOLE GUARD 
           COMMITS SUICIDE IN HOME

           Loki scans the article, eyes resting on an address: 
           234 Campello Street, apt 3

           He remembers something and gets up, gets his coat on --

           EXT. LIQUOR STORE PARKING LOT - DAY

           Keller walks across the parking lot towards his truck, still 
           parked where he left it the previous day...and right past it, 
           on to the apartment house...

           INT. BATHROOM - THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - DAY

           The cell, the sound of the SHOWER BLASTING INSIDE.  Steam 
           rises from the PVC pipe -- as Jones BANGS ON THE INSIDE --

           EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Loki's car pulls up in front of the apartment house.  He gets 
           out and observes the building from the street, considering...

           INT. BATHROOM - THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - DAY

           The HOT knob as Keller turns it off and speaks into the PVC 
           pipe:

                                 KELLER
                        I'm here.  I'm listening.

           No response.  Just a horrible dripping sound.
           EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Loki observes the padlock on the front door IS HANGING 
           UNCLAMPED.  Someone’s inside.  He thinks for a second, then 
           clamps the padlock shut.

           INT. BATHROOM - THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Keller is about to turn the hot water back on when he hears 
           something outside.  He goes to the bathroom window, looks 
           down into the back alley and sees:

           Loki trying to remove the board from one of the low lying 
           windows --

                                 KELLER
                        Fuck me.

           INT. STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

           Keller jumps down flights of stairs, making a mad dash for...  

           THE FRONT DOOR TO THE BUILDING

           Keller tries the door, BUT LOKI’S PADLOCKED THE OUTSIDE --

           INT. FIRST FLOOR APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Keller enters, frantic.  One of the boards covering the 
           windows is being pried from the outside -- but it's still in 
           place, Loki has yet to see inside.  

           Keller lays his coat out like a blanket and lies down on top 
           of it, pretending he’s been sleeping here all night --

           Loki gets the board off the window.  He pokes his head inside 
           and sees Keller lying there on the floor.  

           Loki climbs in.  Then he walks to Keller and toes his ribs 
           with his shoe.

                                 LOKI
                        Rise and shine.

           Keller opens his eyes, pretends to look surprised, plays up 
           the hangover.

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        I knew you were headed over this 
                        way.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        I’m not going to find two little 
                        girls in this building am I, Mr. 
                        Dover?  

                                 KELLER
                        Fuck you.

                                 LOKI
                        What about Alex Jones?  

                                 KELLER
                        What about him?  I came here to 
                        drink.  Didn’t want to do it in 
                        front of my wife.  My father left 
                        me this building.

           Loki considers.

                                 LOKI
                        Mind giving me the tour?

           Loki motions to the door.  Keller breathes out and gets up.

           INT. STAIRWELL - APARTMENT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller walks up the stairs, panic in his eyes, Loki a few 
           steps behind him.

                                 LOKI
                        Why didn’t you tell me about this 
                        place?

                                 KELLER
                        Didn’t think it mattered.

                                 LOKI
                        Everything matters.   

           INT. SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - APARTMENT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller walks inside the apartment, Loki follows, looks 
           around, CLAPS HIS HANDS a couple times to wake himself up -- 
           Keller flinches -- 

                                 LOKI
                        All that survival gear in your 
                        basement, you know something the 
                        rest of us don’t?

           Keller watches a cockroach scuttle across the floor.
                                 KELLER
                        Pray for the best.  Prepare for the 
                        worst.

           Loki nods condescendingly.  

           INT. STAIRWELL - APARTMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Loki follows Keller up the stairs to the third floor.  
           Keller slows the ascent, desperate, doesn’t know what to do --

                                 LOKI
                        Come on, hurry up --

           Loki’s PHONE RINGS -- 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Jill the check out girl watches as a little junker of a car 
           takes off out of the parking lot, she’s out of breath --

                                 JILL
                             (into the phone)
                        The guy I told you about was just 
                        here.  He saw me watching him and 
                        ran.

                                 LOKI (O.S.)
                             (over the phone)
                        Get his plates?

           INT. STAIRWELL - APARTMENT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Loki rushes past Keller up the stairs to the third floor as 
           Jill gives him the plates...

           Keller freezes, going out of his mind as he listens to Loki's 
           ECHOING FOOT FALLS...  

           Until they suddenly stop.  HE'S AT THE DOOR.  Keller takes a 
           breath and bounds up the rest of the stairs, just in time to 
           see Loki disappear into the apartment -- 

           INT. THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Loki walks inside, hangs up his phone and takes a quick look, 
           rushing, distracted.  THE DOOR TO THE BATHROOM IS OPEN, but 
           the light is out.  Jones is silent and from where Loki is 
           standing...
           The cell looks like just another unfinished wall.  Loki turns 
           around and rushes out --

           INT. HALLWAY - THE APARTMENT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Loki walks out into the hall.  Keller is waiting for him, 
           ready to be busted.  But then Loki just rushes right past 
           him, barreling down the stairs --

                                 LOKI (O.S.)
                        Go home, Mr. Dover.

           Keller stands there dumbstruck.  Then he walks to the open 
           apartment door and looks inside across the way at the open 
           bathroom door, realizing his good luck...

           EXT. FRONT DOOR - BOB TAYLOR’S HOUSE - DAY

           Loki pushes a doorbell and waits.  Someone’s made a snow 
           angel in the front yard.  Loki stares at it, lost in thought 
           until the door opens --

                                 BOB TAYLOR
                        Hi.

           The man from the candlelight vigil, minus the layers of 
           winter wear: BOB TAYLOR, 39, big, pudgy baby face.  Loki 
           shows him his badge.

                                 LOKI
                        The car in the driveway, is it 
                        yours?

                                 BOB TAYLOR
                        Yeah.

                                 LOKI
                        You done any shopping at AJ Sax 
                        lately?

                                 BOB TAYLOR
                        Yeah, why is it a crime to shop 
                        there?  
                             (motioning to Loki’s suit)
                        I don’t have the money to shop at 
                        Brooks Brothers.

                                 LOKI
                        You bought child’s clothing.
                                 BOB TAYLOR
                        Did I?  I must have been in a 
                        hurry.

                                 LOKI
                        Do you have any children?

           Bob pauses, slowly shaking his head.

                                 BOB TAYLOR
                        No...I don’t have anything.

           Loki puts his foot in the door jam.  Bob slams the door on 
           it, hard, breaking Loki’s foot.  Loki doesn’t scream but he 
           comes close, forcing the door open as he draws his gun...    

           INT. VESTIBULE - BOB TAYLOR’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Trying to ignore his broken foot, Loki grabs Bob, cuffs his 
           hands behind his back and forces him to lie on his stomach.

                                 LOKI
                        Your nose leaves that floor I will 
                        shoot you.

           Loki gets on his phone as he starts a pained, limping sweep 
           of the house’s interior.

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        Need a rescue unit at 437 Carrol 
                        Street -- possible kidnap victims 
                        on the premises.  

           Loki’s POV: mazes are drawn on the walls and cut-out of the 
           carpets...

           KITCHEN

           There’s something in the kitchen sink: flies buzzing all 
           around it.  Loki walks to the sink and sees some hair...    

           He looks closer, covering his mouth as he steps to the sink 
           and looks inside.  A pig’s head, wearing a wig.  

           HALLWAY

           Loki comes to a closed door.  It’s locked.  Loki draws his 
           gun and FIRES into the door jam --
           A SMALL ROOM 

           Loki’s POV as the door swings in: stacked high against the 
           wall are SIXTEEN STEAMER TRUNKS --

           Loki’s jaw drops.  He limps to them, and struggles to take 
           one down, his broken foot screaming.  It’s heavy, and locked.  

           Loki SMASHES THE BUTT OF HIS GUN AGAINST THE CLASP, again and 
           again until it finally breaks.  He flips it open.  Some 
           bloody kid’s clothes.  THERE’S SOMETHING MOVING UNDERNEATH...

           Loki reaches inside.  A SNAKE RISES UP -- HISSING --

                                 LOKI
                        Shit -- fuck --

           LOKI SLAMS IT CLOSED.  

           Loki takes a breath, then in a mad blur he takes down another 
           trunk and another, wildly bashing his gun against the locked 
           clasps, flipping the tops open --

           More bloody kid’s clothes -- more SNAKES.  More steamer 
           trunks to open -- 

           Moments later he’s dripping with sweat, surrounded by open 
           steamer trunks, snakes everywhere.  Just one trunk to go...

           Loki brings his gun down on the locked clasp -- and his 
           pistol grip BREAKS OFF -- his gun falling to the floor in two 
           smashed up pieces.

           Loki sighs, stands up and kicks his foot down on the clasp -- 
           ONCE -- TWICE -- IT FINALLY BREAKS.  Out of breath, Loki gets 
           down and opens it...

           Inside is a homemade book.  Scrawled on its cover: 
           IF YOU FINISH ALL THE MAZES YOU CAN GO HOME

           INT. HALLWAY - POLICE STATION - DAY

           Keller sits on a bench.  A SQUEALING door opens.  Franklin 
           bursts out, horrified and rushes past him down the hall.  
           Then Nancy comes out in tears, her eyes meet Keller’s for a 
           moment, stunning him --

           Keller stands up, getting freaked out.  Nancy rushes down the 
           hall, sobbing, rushing after Franklin.  

           Loki stands in the doorway looking shaken up.  His foot is in 
           a cast and he’s walking with a cane now.
                                 LOKI
                        Mr. Dover?  Your wife here?

           Nancy’s sobbing is still audible, until she exits into the 
           parking lot with Franklin and the DOOR SLAMS behind them.

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Dover?

                                 KELLER
                        She’s not coming.

           Loki nods, considering.

                                 LOKI
                        Alright.  But if you can’t make a 
                        positive ID...she’s going to need 
                        to come in and take a look at this.

           INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

           A banged up table covered with evidence bags, all containing 
           different articles of bloody children’s clothing.  

           Loki watches on as Keller stares down at the bagged clothes.

                                 KELLER
                        He confessed?  He said he killed 
                        them?

                                 LOKI
                        We had hoped he was lying -- we 
                        didn’t find any bodies, but, Mr. 
                        Dover...

           Loki is absorbing Keller’s dread, struggling to continue:

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        The Birchs just positively ID’d two 
                        of these as belonging to their 
                        daughter.  
                             (beat)
                        Do you recognize anything?

           Keller looks over the bags, his body going cold as he picks 
           one up and looks at the shredded shirt inside.  He gently 
           sets it down, relieved.  

           Another bag, as he picks it up and inspects a bloody sleeve 
           ripped from a little coat.  Another sigh of relief -- and 
           then as he sees what’s beneath it...
           A lone sock with a bunny face on it.  Keller picks it up.  
           His hands are shaking.

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Dover?

           Suddenly Keller grabs Loki and slams him against the wall.  

                                 KELLER
                        You wasted time -- you wasted time 
                        following ME!  YOU LET THIS HAPPEN!  

           Loki shoves him off.  Plays it tough. 

                                 LOKI
                             (bellicose)
                        I did everything I could.

                                 KELLER
                        Keep telling yourself that.  

           Keller walks out and SLAMS THE DOOR -- 

           Loki looks down at the bloody sock in the plastic bag.  
           He lingers on it guiltily, perhaps imagining how it came to 
           be here.

           He loses himself for a moment, lets go of his cane --  
           It falls to the floor with a hard SLAP. 

           He bends down and reaches for it.  His face goes sick as he 
           notices his hand is shaking.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - THE DOVER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller opens the door, looking in on Grace, passed out in 
           bed.  He watches her for a moment, his face like that of some 
           malfunctioning robot...

           INT. ANNA’S ROOM - THE DOVER’S HOUSE - DAY

           Ralph sits on his sister’s bed in shock, holding his cell 
           phone.  He looks up as Keller walks inside and goes to the 
           window.  There are two news vans parked out front.  

                                 KELLER
                        Don’t talk to them.

           Ralph stands up.
                                 RALPH
                        Eliza told me they’re dead.  
                             (beat)
                        Is it true?

           Keller doesn’t turn from the window.  

                                 KELLER
                        No.

                                 RALPH
                        But she said they found their -- 
                        their bloody clothes.

           Keller swings around, grabs Ralph and shakes him --

                                 KELLER
                        Don’t you tell your mother that.  
                        Don’t you dare tell her that.  
                        You understand me?  

           Ralph’s goes rigid, his eyes burn into Keller's.

                                 KELLER (CONT’D)
                        I want you to listen to me.  I need 
                        you to stay around the house for 
                        the next couple days, make sure she 
                        doesn’t see the news -- when the 
                        paper comes throw it the fuck away.  
                        We don’t give up on your sister -- 
                        I’m gonna find her and bring her 
                        home.  We do not give up on her, 
                        you understand?  

           Ralph's shakes his head, raging -- 

                                 RALPH
                        You're gonna bring her home?  
                        She's dead, you can't do anything.  
                        You left me and Mom here while you 
                        went out and got fucking drunk.  
                        You think I can't smell it on you?

           Keller grabs Ralph and slams him into the wall, knocking over 
           a dollhouse.  He holds him there for a second, until the 
           madness drains out of his visage and he finally lets go.

           Ralph just stands there, holding his ground, jaw clenched.

           Keller can't look at him now.  He exits.  Ralph breathes out. 
           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Loki and O’Malley watch through the two-way mirror as a 
           shackled Bob Taylor draws on a large piece of paper with a 
           crayon.  He appears to be drawing an insanely dense maze.

                                 O’MALLEY
                        How long has he been working on 
                        this...map?

           Loki looks at his watch wearily.

                                 LOKI
                        Three and a half hours.

                                 O’MALLEY
                        You think it’s gonna lead you to 
                        the bodies?  ‘Cause I sure as shit 
                        don’t.  

                                 LOKI
                        No offense, Captain, but go fuck 
                        yourself.  We weren’t getting 
                        anywhere questioning him.  

           O’Malley shakes his head, moving in closer until his nose is 
           against the glass.

                                 O’MALLEY
                        Looks more like a maze than a map.

                                 LOKI
                        He’s got a thing for mazes.

           O’Malley’s seen enough.  He goes to exit.

                                 O’MALLEY
                        I’m going home.  Call me if 
                        something happens.

           INT. HALLWAY - POLICE STATION - LATER

           It’s late.  Wedge and Carter stand guard outside a closed 
           door.  Loki limps towards them, popping a coffee bean in his 
           mouth.  He looks like he’s ready to blow.

                                 LOKI
                        Open the door.

           Loki unholsters his gun and hands it to Carter --
                                 CARTER
                        Captain said to call him before 
                        letting anybody in.

                                 LOKI
                        I just talked to him.  He said it 
                        was fine.  But if you want to call 
                        and wake him up again, go ahead.

           Wedge and Carter look at each other, then Wedge swipes a pass 
           key over a sensor unlocking the door with a BEEP --

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - LATER

           Loki limps inside and shuts the door.  Bob is still working 
           on his maze.  

                                 LOKI
                        I think it’s done now.

           Loki grabs the crayon out of his hand --  

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        Tell me what I’m looking at.

           Bob looks conflicted, considering, and then:

                                 BOB TAYLOR
                        I can’t.

           Loki grabs the back of Bob’s head and SMASHES HIS NOSE INTO 
           THE TABLE --

                                 LOKI
                        You said you’d draw a map, not a 
                        fucking puzzle.  Tell me what I’m 
                        looking at.

           Bob starts to cry --

                                 BOB TAYLOR
                        I can’t -- 

           Loki throws him to the floor, on top of him now, holding his 
           cane across Bob’s throat, strangling him --

                                 LOKI
                        Yes.  You can.

           Wedge and Carter burst in, scrambling to pull Loki off of 
           Bob.  BOB GRABS WEDGE’S GUN FROM ITS HOLSTER -- 
                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        HE’S GOT YOUR GUN --

           Carter draws his gun as Bob, shackled, both hands gripping 
           the gun, backs up against the two way mirror --

                                 CARTER
                        DROP IT!  

                                 LOKI
                        Bob, put the gun down.  

           Bob brings the gun up to his chin in a quick motion --

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        NO!

           Loki and Carter rush him -- BANG -- Bob falls to the floor, 
           dead.  Loki, Wedge and Carter just stand there in shock.  

           INT. ANIMAL CLINIC - NIGHT

           Darkness.  The front door opens, Nancy enters, punches a code 
           into the alarm keypad, keys jingling --

           She hits the lights and rushes down a hallway to a supply 
           closet.  She fumbles through her keys with trembling hands, 
           her breath quickening.  She gets it open, takes a breath --

           INT. THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT

           The closed front door to the apartment as someone KNOCKS --

           Keller rushes out of the bathroom, his heart in his throat as 
           the front door swings open.  It’s Nancy Birch, clutching a 
           white paper bag.

           Keller breathes out, relieved.  She slowly makes a bee line 
           for the closed bathroom door.

                                 KELLER
                        Why are you here?

           She opens the bathroom door and peers inside.  A cold washes 
           over her.

                                 NANCY
                        I was praying you had ended this 
                        already.  

           She grimaces, thinking to herself, checking something over in 
           her mind.  Finally she holds up the white paper bag weakly.  
                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I got it from work.  
                             (beat)
                        We use it to -- to put down 
                        animals.  

                                 KELLER
                        Jesus.  Just like that, huh?

                                 NANCY
                        You started this.  You went and 
                        took him.  Got Franklin involved.  
                        This isn’t your decision to make.  
                        He’s beyond help anyway -- 

           She shoves the bag into Keller’s hand, looks away and starts 
           to cry bitterly.

                                 KELLER
                        They found some clothes -- they 
                        haven’t found the bodies.  I’m not 
                        giving up.  I’m not having 
                        Christmas without my daughter.  

                                 NANCY
                        They had Joy’s bloody pants in a 
                        plastic bag for Christ’s sake!  
                        What do you think that means?

                                 KELLER
                             (motioning to the 
                              bathroom)
                        He looked me in the eye and told 
                        me: they only cried when I left 
                        them.  He’s connected with the guy 
                        who confessed, I know it.  

                                 NANCY
                        He’s just some disturbed man who 
                        parked on our street, Keller.  
                        That’s all. 

           She breaks down and puts her head on his chest, sobbing, 
           holding on to him for dear life.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I can hear him -- anytime it’s 
                        quiet -- I can hear him trying to 
                        get out, can smell him on my 
                        clothes.  You have to make it stop.  

           She steps back, wiping the tears from her face, trying vainly 
           to calm herself down as she turns and walks to the exit...
                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        And when it’s done, burn this 
                        place.

           The door shuts, she’s gone.  It’s quiet.  Just Keller and the 
           white paper bag in his hands...

           INT. BATHROOM - THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - LATER

           Keller removes a little panel of wood from the cell...  
           Recessed inside he sees a patch of white skin.  

           He picks up the white paper bag and pulls out two little 
           white boxes branded with a skull and crossbones.

           Moments later, Keller, syringe in shaky hand, draws a plunger 
           full of clear liquid...

           He sits on the floor across from the cell, guzzling whiskey 
           from his coffee thermos, the loaded syringe in his lap...

           And then a scratched whisper comes from the PVC pipe:

                                 JONES (O.S.)
                        They’re in the maze.

           Keller freezes.  His face goes dead.  

                                 JONES  (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        In the maze.

                                 KELLER
                        What?  
                             (beat)
                        What did you say?

                                 JONES (O.S.)
                        That’s where you’ll find them.

           Keller goes to the cell, speaking into the PVC pipe:

                                 KELLER
                        What maze?  Where is it?  How do I 
                        get there?  It’s OK, I’m gonna get 
                        you out of there.  Just tell me 
                        where the maze is.

           Keller waits and waits, the tension building to an 
           excruciating crescendo...until JONES STARTS TO LAUGH.  

           Keller, enraged, BEATS ON THE CELL WITH HIS FISTS, SCREAMING:
                                 KELLER (CONT’D)
                        TELL ME!  

           No response.  Keller steadies himself.

                                 KELLER (CONT’D)
                        Something’s gonna get to you.  

           INT. HALLWAY - POLICE STATION - NIGHT 

           Loki is asleep, slumped on a bench in the now clamorous 
           hallway.  O'Malley walks over and gives Loki's broken foot a 
           hard kick -- 

           Loki springs awake as Taylor's corpse is rolled out of the 
           adjacent interrogation room.  O'Malley shoves Taylor's blood 
           spattered maze drawing into Loki's hand --

                                 O'MALLEY
                        He explain this before he ate the 
                        bullet?

           Loki takes the drawing weakly, shaking his head.

                                 LOKI
                        Captain, I'm sorry --

                                 O’MALLEY
                        Fuck you’re sorry.  Save it for the 
                        girls' parents.

           EXT. JONES’ AUNTS’ HOUSE - DAY

           Keller rings the bell.  Listens.  He hears someone moving 
           around inside, TV’s on --

                                 HOLLY JONES (O.S.)
                        Just a minute.

           Holly Jones opens the door.  Keller’s shaky, struggling to 
           act normal.

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        Can I help you?

                                 KELLER
                        Good afternoon Ma'am, I’m Keller 
                        Dover.

                                 JONES’ AUNT
                        I’m sorry, you’re who?
                                 KELLER
                        My little girl was abducted with 
                        her friend --

           She recognizes him and steps back, starting to close the 
           door, fear in her eyes.

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        What do you want?  

                                 KELLER
                        I’m sorry, I guess I didn’t think 
                        this through too good.  I’ve just 
                        been thinking a lot about what 
                        happened with your nephew.  I know 
                        I scared him that day at the police 
                        station.  I guess what I’m trying 
                        to say is I feel responsible for 
                        him running away.

           She studies him, the act of which seems to be giving her a 
           headache.

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        Would you like to come in?

           INT. KITCHEN - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           It’s a quaint little nook.  Keller sits at the table across 
           from Holly Jones.  She drinks tea.  

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        My husband and I were very devout 
                        at one time.  Spent our summers, 
                        driving around in that RV with our 
                        son -- handing out pamphlets, 
                        spreading the good word.  But after 
                        our son died of cancer we started 
                        seeing things differently.  
                        Adopting Alex helped, but we never 
                        got over it.  

           Keller shakes his head sympathetically.  

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        You look very tired.

                                 KELLER
                        I don’t sleep much.  Keep dreaming 
                        about being lost in a maze.
           Keller watches for her reaction to his mention of the word, 
           but she doesn’t react whatsoever.  Instead there’s a long, 
           awkward silence, until:

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        I’m sorry, Alex never talked much, 
                        so I hardly know what to say to 
                        people when they come here.

           Keller waits for her to go on, and when she doesn’t.

                                 KELLER
                        He doesn’t talk much?

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        He talks.  Good morning, good 
                        night, things like that, but it’s 
                        hard to get much more than that out 
                        of him.  He had an accident when he 
                        was little.  After that he started 
                        choosing his words a little too 
                        carefully.

                                 KELLER
                        What kind of accident?

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        My husband kept snakes.  It wasn’t 
                        so bad what happened, but Alex had 
                        a fear of them, and...  
                             (she trails off)
                        It’s not my favorite memory.  

                                 KELLER
                        I’m sorry, it’s none of my  
                        business.

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        You know you remind me of him a 
                        little -- my husband.

                                 KELLER
                        Oh?

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        It’s the eyes.

           She stares into his eyes for a moment, making him noticeably 
           uncomfortable.  He looks down, noticing the newspaper on the 
           table: TAYLOR COMMITS SUICIDE, 
           LOCATION OF BODIES STILL UNKNOWN

                                 JONES’ AUNT
                        You sure you don’t want some tea?
           She sees Keller trembling as he slowly swivels the paper 
           around, staring at it in disbelief.  

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        Oh God, I’m sorry, Mr. Dover, I 
                        thought for sure you knew already.  
                        I say it’s better this way.  They 
                        don’t have the death penalty here, 
                        that awful man would have just 
                        gotten fat in prison.  Not knowing 
                        where she rests is a horrible thing 
                        though, I am so so sorry --

           Keller gets up --

           INT. O’MALLEY’S OFFICE - POLICE STATION - DAY

           Loki sits in front of O’Malley’s desk, looking a mess, 
           staring at a photocopy of the maze Bob drew while O’Malley 
           pours a glass of whiskey.

                                 O’MALLEY
                        Well at least I don’t have to worry 
                        about losing you to MSP.     

           Loki isn’t listening, moving a shaky finger over the maze 
           drawing, lost, trying to find his way out.

                                 O’MALLEY (CONT’D)
                        When forensics is done with his 
                        place we’re deploying cadaver dogs.  
                             (beat)
                        We’re not super heroes, kid.  
                        We don’t save the fucking day.  
                        We’re cops.  Hell’s janitors.  You 
                        want fulfillment, start a family, 
                        have some kids.  

           INT. LOKI’S DESK - BROCKTON POLICE STATION - DAY

           Loki walks to his desk, staring deliriously at the disarray.  
           He straight arms everything to the floor, computer monitor 
           and all.  No one walking by dares make mention of this.

           His desk is now bare but for an evidence bag containing 
           Jones' matchbox RV.  He sits down, takes the little RV out of 
           the bag and sets it on his desk.  

           He gives it the tiniest push, watching as it slowly rolls off 
           the edge --
           He reaches down to pick it up when something on the floor 
           catches his eye...

           The crime scene photos of the corpse he found in Father 
           Dunn’s basement.  A close-up of the pendant the corpse was 
           wearing with the maze carved into it.

           Suddenly energized, he pulls the photocopy of Bob's map from 
           his pocket, unfolds it and sets it on the desk next to the 
           photo of the corpse's pendant...  

           THEY’RE IDENTICAL.  Loki’s astounded.  His cell phone RINGS.

                                 LOKI
                             (into phone)
                        Yeah?

                                 FORENSICS GUY (O.S.)
                             (over the phone)
                        We found something.

           EXT. BOB TAYLOR’S BACKYARD - DAY

           Loki limps up behind Forensics guy and the rest of his team, 
           all of them staring down at...

           What looks like two little bodies, half buried under garden 
           pebbles and mulch.  But as Loki gets closer he sees it’s:

                        in.  And I just talked to my lab 
                        guys.  They’re telling me all of 
                        the blood we sampled from the 
                        steamer trunks is pig’s blood.
                             (yelling to his team)
                        Get those covered!  It’s supposed 
                        to snow soon.  Come on, hurry up!

           INT. LIVING ROOM - BOB TAYLOR’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A darkened mess of a room with mazes drawn on the walls and 
           ceiling.  Forensics Guy and Loki enter --

                                 FORENSICS GUY
                        It’s like he’s playacting.  Case in 
                        point, except for the few pieces 
                        ID'd by the Dover's and the 
                        Birch's, all the other kid's 
                        clothes we found still had the tags 
                        on them.

                        And the book of mazes we found in 
                        the steamer trunk, he made it out 
                        of photocopies, pictures in this 
                        book we found in the attic.  Ex-FBI 
                        agent wrote it.

           Forensics Guy grabs a beat-up hardcover off a table.

                                 LOKI
                             (reading the title)
                        Finding the Invisible Man.

                                 FORENSICS GUY
                        It’s about a theoretical suspect he 
                        claimed was responsible for 
                        numerous child abductions in the 
                        eighties and nineties.  Totally 
                        discredited I guess, but I read 
                        some of it, kind of interesting.  

           Forensics Guy flips through the book showing Loki some full 
           page photographs of the real book of mazes.

                                 LOKI
                        Taylor was abducted when he was a 
                        kid, escaped after three weeks.  
                        His captor drugged him continuously 
                        with LSD.  He had no idea where 
                        he’d been.  They never caught the 
                        guy.  

                                 FORENSICS GUY
                        There you go.  Probably read this 
                        book and decided he was taken by 
                        the Invisible Man.  Now he’s doing 
                        his best imitation.  

                                 LOKI
                        Did his best imitation.  He shot 
                        himself last night.

           Forensics Guy shakes his head.

                                 FORENSICS GUY
                        How did he do that?  I thought he 
                        was in custody.

           Loki ignores the question and takes a photocopy of Bob’s map 
           out of his pocket.

                                 LOKI
                        Taylor drew this.  It was supposed 
                        to be a map to the bodies.

                        We found a corpse last week wearing 
                        a pendant with the same design on 
                        it.

                                 FORENSICS GUY
                        It’s not a map, it’s the last maze 
                        in the maze book.  Unsolvable.  
                        No way out.  Corpse is probably 
                        just another wannabe who read the 
                        book.  

                                 LOKI
                        So what are we saying?  Taylor is a 
                        fake?  These girls could still be 
                        alive somewhere?  How did he get 
                        his hands on the clothes the 
                        parents ID'd?

                                 FORENSICS GUY
                        That I can't reconcile.  

           Loki pops a coffee bean in his mouth with a shaking hand, 
           Forensics Guy watching on, concerned.

                                 FORENSICS GUY (CONT’D)
                        You alright?

           Loki nods dismissively.  Forensics Guy nods back, doesn't 
           push him -- has his own fish to fry. 

                                 FORENSICS GUY (CONT’D)
                             (yelling to his team)
                        If there are windows open, get them 
                        fucking shut.

           Something occurs to Loki.  He pulls out his note pad, 
           flipping through the pages, until he comes to: 

           IN THE HOUSE?  OPEN WINDOW

           INT. PET STORE - DAY

           Keller peers in at a tank containing some large snakes.  

           A SALESMAN comes over --

                                 KELLER
                        How much for all of them?
           INT. JOY’S ROOM - THE BIRCH’S HOUSE - DAY

           Joy's now dead gerbil lying in its habitrail.  Nancy stares 
           down at it, something building inside her...

           Eliza walks up behind her.

                                 ELIZA
                        What is it?

           Nancy turns, losing control of herself and SMACKS Eliza 
           across the face --

                                 NANCY
                        I told you to feed it!  Why didn’t 
                        you feed it?!      

           Eliza stands there in shock.  She gives her a mother a hating 
           look, shakes her head in disbelief and rushes from the room --

           INT. RALPH'S ROOM - THE DOVER'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ralph talks on the phone with Eliza as he looks out his 
           window, watching as Loki limps through the bushes looking for 
           something...

                                 RALPH
                             (into phone)
                        OK, I’ll meet you out front --

           EXT. THE DOVER’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Loki looks up at Anna’s window, maybe ten feet from the 
           ground.  He looks down and notices two deep footprints filled 
           with water -- someone dropped hard from the window.

           He looks around thinking, starts poking the bushes with his 
           cane...  

           His eyes go wide, he lifts his cane.  HANGING OFF THE END IS 
           A SOCK WITH A RABBIT FACE ON IT. 

           As he deposits the sock in a little plastic bag he hears 
           someone SCREAMING across the street at the Birch's house. 

           He looks up to see Eliza crossing the street towards him, 
           Nancy standing in her doorway yelling after her --

                                 NANCY
                        Get back here!  I can’t handle this 
                        right now!
           Loki then looks over to see Ralph coming out of the Dover's 
           house with a duffle bag slung over his shoulder.

                                 LOKI
                             (off Ralph’s look)
                        Just needed to check something.

           Ralph nods curtly and throws the duffle bag in the back of 
           Grace's compact as Eliza gets in the passenger side --

           Loki watches as Ralph drives off with Eliza.  Across the 
           street Nancy retreats back inside her house and SLAMS THE 
           DOOR --

           INT. BATHROOM - THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - DAY

           The pictures of Anna and Joy nailed to the cell.  
           Angle widens to reveal:

           KELLER IS FEEDING THE HEAD OF A BIG SNAKE INTO THE PVC PIPE, 
           holding on to the tail as the rest disappears...

                                 KELLER
                        Feel him?

           Nothing, and then Jones starts THRASHING inside the cell, 
           SCREAMING.  Keller yanks the snake back out --

                                 KELLER (CONT’D)
                        It’s going all the way in if you 
                        don’t start talking.

           Keller BANGS on the cell --

                                 KELLER (CONT’D)
                        You hear me?  

           No reply.  So Keller feeds the snake back in...until JONES 
           LETS OUT A SCREECH and the cell starts shaking.  
           Keller slowly pulls the snake back out --

                                 KELLER (CONT’D)
                        Last chance.

           The snake dangles from Keller’s hand, curling and uncurling, 
           HISSING --  

                                 KELLER (CONT’D)
                        TALK!

           Jones only whimpers.  So Keller feeds the snake all the way 
           into the PVC pipe...and lets go -- 
           Jones GOES BALLISTIC INSIDE, trying to CLAW HIS WAY OUT -- 

                                 KELLER (CONT’D)
                        Tell me about the God damn maze, 
                        asshole!  Tell me and I’ll get you 
                        out right now.  I’ll take you home 
                        to your aunt.

           Angle widens to reveal another dozen snakes in a cardboard 
           box.  Keller grabs another one.  He starts feeding it into 
           the tube when he hears JONES TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING and 
           yanks it back out --

           Keller presses his ear to the tube, but he still can’t hear 
           what Jones is saying.  He grabs a claw hammer off the 
           floor...

           And starts prying off a small panel of wood right where 
           Jones’ head is, until...

           Jones’ cadaver-like face is revealed, his mouth is moving, 
           but Keller still can’t hear him...

           So he moves in closer, putting his head inside the cell, 
           until his face is just inches away from Jones’...  

                                 JONES
                        There’s no way out.  It’s a prison.  

           Keller waits for more.  But it soon becomes apparent that 
           there is no more.  Jones has gone blank.

           Jones' POV as Keller replaces the panel of wood and 
           EVERYTHING GOES BLACK: THE SOUND OF SNAKES HISSING, KELLER 
           HAMMERING --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. A SMALL ROOM - DAY

           The windows are boarded, it's mostly dark, no furniture.  
           On the floor is a half-empty 2-liter bottle of what looks 
           like grape-aid.  

           And beside it are two crayons, and a homemade book with a 
           familiar cover: FINISH ALL THE MAZES AND YOU CAN GO HOME

           ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL JOY AND ANNA, ALIVE, slumped against 
           the wall, their lips stained purple. 

           A dead bolt UNLOCKS.  The girls snap into action, pretending 
           to be asleep as the door swings wide.
           Someone enters, cloaked in darkness, SEEN ONLY IN SILHOUETTE: 
           THE KEEPER.  The Keeper sets down a new 2 liter bottle of 
           grape-aid.  Then picks up the book... 

           And starts turning the pages -- soon realizing that several 
           have been ripped out.    

           The Keeper looks around, sees something and throws the book 
           to the floor.  The boarded window, one of the ripped-out 
           pages is half-pushed through a seam in the boards...

           The Keeper yanks it out.  Scrawled over the maze in crayon: 
           HELP US.  The Keeper looks back at the girls --

           THEY'RE GONE -- JUST RAN OUT THE DOOR.  The Keeper bolts 
           after them --

           EXT. A BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           The girls’ drugged POV as they burst out a door, their vision 
           so distorted it’s impossible to tell where they are: they 
           sprint across a morphing lawn as the Keeper gives chase...

           They plow through some hedges into what looks like a field, 
           Anna starting to lag, THE KEEPER'S BREATH LOUD IN HER EARS --   

           And then Joy looks beside her and Anna is gone, SCREAMING in 
           the widening distance...

           EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY

           Joys's POV: running along the side of the road as cars fly by 
           looking like astral comets, the sound of their engines like 
           ROARING LIONS --

                                                               CUT TO: 

           INT. COMPACT CAR - CONTINUOUS

           A WOMAN, 43, drives, drinking coffee, soft rock on the radio.  
           She passes Joy on side of the road, running in the same 
           direction.  No coat on.  Looks like she's in trouble.  

           The Woman stops the car, rolling down her passenger side 
           window as Joy runs past --

                                 WOMAN 
                        Hey, where's your Mommy?  Where you 
                        going, hon?
           The Woman gets out of her car and Joy bolts away from her 
           across the street, RIGHT INTO THE PATH OF SPEEDING VAN --

           The van slams on the breaks, SCREECHES OFF THE ROAD IN A 
           CLOUD OF RUBBERSMOKE AND SLAMS INTO A TREE.  

           The Woman runs to Joy and grabs hold of her, hugging her 
           writhing form --

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - THE DOVER'S HOUSE - DAY

           The phone is RINGING.  It’s dark, the curtains are drawn.  
           Grace emerges from the nest of blankets and picks up:

                                 GRACE
                             (groggy, into phone)
                        Hello?

           She listens, sitting there in the darkness...

           INT. BATHROOM - THE DOVER'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Dirty clothes, wadded tissues and prescription bottles crowd 
           the vanity.  The sound of Grace running from room to room -- 

                                 GRACE (O.S.)
                        Keller!?  Ralph?!  

           She comes bursting into the bathroom and turns on the cold 
           water, splashing it on her face --

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Wake up, Grace.  Gotta wake up now.

           She accidentally knocks an open bottle of Xanax into the 
           sink, half the pills spill out into the rushing water.  

           She instinctively starts rescuing pills from the drain.  
           But before long she decides to let them go.  She dumps out 
           the rest and rushes out -- 

           INT. KELLER'S TRUCK - TRAVELING - DAY

           Keller pulls into the driveway.  Grace comes bursting out the 
           front door in her nightgown.

           He opens the truck door.  She puts her palsied hands on him 
           before he can get out --
                                 GRACE
                             (frantic)
                        We need to go to the hospital.  
                        They found Joy.  She's alive.  
                        They didn't -- they didn't --

           She starts sobbing.  Keller gets out, steadying her.  There's 
           a flurry of activity across the street at the Birch's house.  

                                 KELLER
                        What?  What?

           She hugs him hard, talking into his shoulder:

                                 GRACE
                        Not Anna.  Joy was alone.  
                        Anna wasn't with her --

           Keller's POV, everything starts spinning, surreal, a camera 
           man is filming them from across the street, a car wooshes by.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        They're at the hospital.  
                        Ralph took my car this morning -- 
                        he’s not answering his phone.  
                        I've been stuck here waiting and 
                        waiting for you -- we need to go 
                        see her.  Maybe she knows where 
                        Anna is --

                                 KELLER
                        No, I'll go, you stay in case --

           Grace isn't listening, she runs around and gets in the truck.

           INT. HALLWAY - BROCKTON HOSPITAL - DAY

           A crowded hallway.  Reporters, cameras, an orderly trying to 
           get them to leave.  Keller pushes through, Grace behind him, 
           wearing his coat over her nightgown.  A COP stops them -- 

                                 COP
                        Nobody gets beyond this point --

           Grace rushes right past him --

                                 COP (CONT’D)
                        Miss! 

           He grabs her shoulder.  She screams in his face:

                                 GRACE
                        Don't touch me!
           The cop steps back as Loki limps up the hallway --

                                 LOKI
                        It's OK, they're OK --

           Loki ushers them down the hall a bit and then:

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                             (to Keller)
                        The clothes you identified, he 
                        broke into your house and stole 
                        them.  He didn’t do it, some kind 
                        of wannabe.  

                                 GRACE
                        What did Joy say?  Do you know 
                        where my daughter is?

                                 LOKI
                        She hasn’t said anything -- she was 
                        drugged with something.  As soon as 
                        she's able I’ll talk to her --

                                 GRACE
                        No -- now, we need to talk to her 
                        now!

           Grace spots Franklin up the hall walking into a private room.  
           There!  She bolts down the hall, Keller right behind her --

                                 LOKI
                        Wait a minute!

           INT. PRIVATE ROOM - BROCKTON HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

           Franklin walks inside.  Nancy sits by the bedside hanging up 
           her cell phone as TWO NURSES tend to Joy.

                                 NANCY
                        Eliza’s not picking up.

           Before Franklin can answer Grace and Keller move inside --

                                 NURSE 1
                        You can’t be in here.

           Nurse 2 grabs Keller and tries to escort him out.  
           Keller shrugs her off -- knocks over a cart --

                                 NURSE 1 (CONT’D)
                        You need to get out of here right 
                        now!
                                 NANCY
                        It's OK, It's OK --

           Everyone stops for a second.  The nurses back off.  Franklin 
           enters, Loki right behind him, both watching as Nancy lets 
           Grace and Keller come up next to the bed.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                             (to Grace and Keller)
                        They’re gonna find Anna too,
                        I know they are.  

           Grace and Keller aren't listening, mesmerized by the sight of 
           Joy lying there like some dream come to life.  

           Keller squats down by the bed and looks Joy in the eyes.   

                                 KELLER
                        Was it far from our street?  Joy? 
                        Did it take long to get there?

                                 NURSE
                             (to Loki)
                        They can’t be doing this now.

           Loki knows that.  But he motions to the nurse to wait a 
           second. 

                                 GRACE
                        Just tell us she's alive.  Can you
                        give us a nod -- just nod your 
                        head.

           Joy just stares, her eyes vacant.  Keller is losing patience.

                                 KELLER
                             (threateningly)
                        WHERE DID YOU LEAVE HER!?  
                        WHY WASN'T ANNA WITH YOU!?

                                 NANCY
                        Keller!

           Loki grabs Keller’s arm.  

                                 LOKI
                        Alright, that’s enough.

                                 KELLER
                             (to Joy)
                        YOU CAN TALK, I KNOW YOU CAN TALK!

           Suddenly Joy looks up at Keller, as if she’d only now just 
           recognized him.  He meets her eyes.  And she speaks:
                                 JOY
                        You were there.

           Keller’s eyes go wide.  Loki stops.    

                                 KELLER
                        What?  I was where?

                                 JOY
                        It put tape on our mouths.  

           Something suddenly occurs to Keller.  He turns and rushes out 
           the door as Loki limps after him --

           INT. HALLWAY - BROCKTON HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

           Loki comes out the door, looks up and down the bustling 
           hallway.  Keller’s at the end of the hall about to take a 
           corner --  

                                 LOKI
                        Hey!  Stop!
                             (to a uniform cop)
                        Don’t let him go!

           The COP gives chase, but Keller’s already disappeared into 
           the slipstream.

           INT. KELLER’S TRUCK - TRAVELING - DUSK

           Keller drives past Holly Jones’ house and parks about three 
           houses away.  

           He picks a duffle bag up off the floor of the passenger side 
           and puts it on the seat.

           It’s unzipped: nylon rope, a rifle and duct tape peek out.  
           He zips it up.  His hands are shaking -- 

           INT. DEN - HOLLY JONES’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Holly Jones sits watching TV.  THE DOOR BELL RINGS.  
           Startled, she stands up, goes to the window and peeks through 
           the curtain...

           Keller Dover is standing on her doorstep.

           EXT. FRONT DOOR - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller stands at the door, holding the duffle bag, waiting...
                                 HOLLY JONES (O.S.)
                        Just a minute.

           Holly Jones opens the door looking a little out of breath.  
           She’s now holding a big ice pack around her hand.

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        Hello again.

                                 KELLER
                        Hello.  I was -- I was hoping you’d 
                        let me do some penance.

           She looks a little baffled.

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        For what?

                                 KELLER
                        For scaring you that day at the 
                        police station.  

           She nods, regaining her poker face.

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        You’ve already apologized for that.

                                 KELLER
                        I know, but I thought you might 
                        need something fixed up around the 
                        house?  Brought my tools.  

           She eyes his bag.

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        Oh.  I see.  
                             (motioning to her ice 
                              pack)
                        I burned myself.  Feeling a little 
                        icky today.  
                             (beat)
                        But I’m glad you want to talk some 
                        more.  There’s no need to make 
                        excuses.  Come in, you can make me 
                        some tea.

           INT. VESTIBULE - HOLLY JONES’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Jones’ Aunt shows Keller inside and closes the door, turning 
           her back to him as she walks to the kitchen.  Keller lingers 
           in the vestibule, watching her, considering...
                                 HOLLY JONES
                        What are you waiting for, Mr. 
                        Dover?  

           He stops, looking caught.

                                 KELLER
                        What?

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        Come on in and make me some tea.

           INT. KITCHEN - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller turns on the faucet and fills the tea kettle with 
           water...  

           He turns on the gas fueled stove burner.  He stares down into 
           the little blue flame --

                                 KELLER
                        I don’t want to have to hurt you.  
                        I know they were here --

           He turns around to see the ice pack fall from her hand, 
           revealing a .38 revolver.  She stands up, gun leveled at 
           Keller’s head.  

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        Put your hands on your head and 
                        turn around.

           Keller doesn’t move.

                                 KELLER
                        I’m just gonna go.

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        You don’t know me, Mr. Dover.  
                        Believe me when I tell you I won’t 
                        let you go.

           Keller considers, watching her.  Her eyes don’t waver.  
           Her hands don’t shake...  

           He puts his hands on his head and turns around.  She moves in 
           and lifts the back of his coat.  There’s a pistol tucked into 
           the back of his waistband.  She grabs it out and tosses it 
           into a nearby wastebasket.

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        Good.  Now, right in front of you.  
                        The top drawer.  Open it.
           Keller takes a breath, and opens the drawer...

           Inside is a rusted old pair of handcuffs.  

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        Put them on.

           Keller doesn’t move.

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        Put them on.

           Keller takes his time picking up the handcuffs, trying not to 
           smile as he observes their corroded condition.  

           He clamps them on his wrists.  Keeping the gun on him she 
           opens the refrigerator and takes out a 2 liter bottle filled 
           with the laced grape-aid.

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to drink the whole 
                        thing.  About a third should be 
                        fine for a man your size.  
                        Something to keep you manageable. 
                        Even in handcuffs I have a feeling 
                        you’re going to be a problem.

                                 KELLER
                        Forget it.

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        Drink it, Mr. Dover, or I’ll kill 
                        you right here in my kitchen, and 
                        then I’ll bring your daughter in 
                        and make her scrub your brains off 
                        the floor. 

           He lunges towards her --

                                 KELLER
                        WHERE IS SHE?!

           She cocks the .38.  He stops, trembling, ready to throw up, 
           looking for something to grab, something to duck behind -- 
           but there’s nothing.  He breathes out, manic...

           And grabs the bottle.  And drinks, hating eyes on her all the 
           while.  A third of it gone, he sets it back on the table, 
           grimacing, wiping his purple lips.

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        Good, isn’t it.  It’s my husband’s 
                        recipe.  Now we’re going out the 
                        back --
           A RING TONE stops them both.  Keller looks down at his coat 
           pocket as his cell phone continues to RING -- 

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        Take it out of your pocket.  Do not 
                        answer it.

           With a little trouble due to his shackled hands, Keller pulls 
           out his ringing cell phone.  The caller ID displays: GRACE

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        Put it in the sink.

           Keller does as he’s told.  She motions for him to move aside.  
           Then she goes to the sink and pushes the phone down the 
           garbage disposal.  It’s still RINGING when --

           She turns on the disposal -- THE SOUND OF METAL GRINDING --

           EXT. BACK YARD - HOLLY JONES’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller, hands cuffed in front of him, exits the house through 
           the back door with Holly Jones following, pistol in hand.  

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        Walk to the car.

           She directs him to the bird crap covered Trans Am, parked on 
           the grass.  

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        The look on your face when I opened 
                        the door -- my husband had that 
                        very same look the day we took 
                        Alex.  
                             (beat)
                        He was the first kid we ever took.  
                        His real name was Jimmy or Eddie -- 
                        I can’t remember.  
                        I doubt he can either.  So many 
                        names.  I forgot all about Bobby 
                        until I read about him in the 
                        paper.  He never forgot us though -- 
                        neither will your neighbor’s bitch 
                        daughter.  They never really get 
                        away, their minds I mean.  Making 
                        children disappear is how we wage 
                        war with God.  Makes people lose 
                        their faith.  Breeds demons like 
                        you.  I’ve had to slow down since 
                        my husband disappeared, but I do 
                        what I can.  
           Keller continues on, woozy, steps on one of the maze book 
           pages the girls managed to slip out the boarded window -- 
           HELP scrawled in crayon --

           They arrive at the Trans Am.  She opens the driver’s side 
           door.

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        Get in.

           Keller gets behind the wheel.  The keys are in the ignition.  
           The key chain is an uspside down cross.  Standing inside the 
           open car door, Holly Jones puts the gun to Keller’s head.

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        Start the car.

           Keller turns the key.  The engine COUGHS --

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        Keep trying.  

           He keeps trying, while staring through the dirty windshield, 
           maybe planning an escape route...

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        You should know Alex didn’t lay a 
                        hand on the girls, just wanted to 
                        give them a ride in the RV.  I was 
                        the one who decided they should 
                        stay.  

           Guilt creasing his forehead, Keller starts to look a little 
           sick.  THE ENGINE FINALLY TURNS OVER -- IT’S LOUD.

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                             (yelling over the engine)
                        Put it in reverse.  Back up.  
                        Slowly.

           Keller shifts into reverse and the car starts to inch 
           backwards.  Holly Jones walks close beside it, keeping the 
           gun pressed to Keller’s head.

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        Stop.

           Keller stops the car, staring straight ahead.   

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        Turn it off.

           He hesitates for a moment, perhaps weighing his options.  
           She starts to push the gun barrel into his ear.
                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        Turn it off.

           He cuts the engine.

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        Out.  

           Keller steps out of the car, teetering, starting to lose his 
           equilibrium.  He sees the car was covering a big door-size 
           piece of plywood lying flat on the ground.

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead, take a look.  Maybe your 
                        daughter is underneath.  You never 
                        know.

           Frantic, Keller drags the plywood aside.  But when he sees 
           what’s beneath it, the verve just drains from his body...

           It’s a grave-like hole in the ground, maybe twelve feet deep.  
           Child-size skeletons blanket the bottom, snakes threading 
           through them...

                                 HOLLY JONES (CONT’D)
                        I hid the girls here before the 
                        police came to search the house.  
                        Should have left them down there, 
                        but I wanted them to last for at 
                        least a few weeks.  So lonely 
                        without Alex.
                             (beat)
                        Now get in.  

                                 KELLER
                        You want me to get in there, you’re 
                        gonna have to shoot me.  I’m not 
                        doing it just ‘cause you asked --

           BANG.  She fires a shot into Keller’s thigh.  He stumbles -- 
           the soil crumbles out from under him and he falls...

           INT. THE HOLE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller lands hard on a blanket of human bones, blood bubbling 
           from the gunshot wound in his thigh.  Snakes everywhere.

           Keller’s POV, staring straight up: Holly Jones staring down.
                                 HOLLY JONES
                        Make yourself a tourniquet.  If you 
                        can manage to stem the bleeding you 
                        might last as long as twenty-four 
                        hours.  I'd love for you to still 
                        be alive when I dump your 
                        daughter's body down there. 

           She starts dragging the board back over the hole... 

           Keller tries to get up, gritting his teeth, and then he sees 
           it: ANNA’S RED WHISTLE lying a few feet away from him.  
           But as he reaches for it --

           EVERYTHING GOES BLACK...  

           THE SOUND OF THE TRANS AM STARTING UP AND ROLLING OVER THE 
           COVERED HOLE...

           EXT. BACK YARD - HOLLY JONES’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Holly Jones cuts the engine and gets out of the car.  As she 
           walks back to the house IT STARTS TO SNOW...

           EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY

           Grace’s car pulls up in front of the apartment house.  Ralph 
           gets out of the driver’s seat, he opens the back door, grabs 
           a duffle bag...

           Eliza gets out of the passenger side.  Her cell phone rings, 
           she checks it --

                                 ELIZA
                        My Mom again.  Maybe I should call 
                        her back -- maybe something 
                        happened?

                                 RALPH
                        Don't tell her where we are.

                                 ELIZA
                        I’m not an idiot, I’ll tell her I’m 
                        at Jen’s house.

           She starts to dial --

                                 RALPH
                        Come on, wait until we get inside. 
                        I don't want anybody to see us --
           She puts the phone away and follows Ralph to the rear of the 
           building, trying to look inconspicuous.

                                 ELIZA
                        So how many girls have you taken to 
                        this crack house?

           Ralph pretends not to hear.  Eliza smiles and shakes her 
           head.

                                 ELIZA (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe that guy wouldn’t 
                        let us check in.  Since when do you 
                        have to be eighteen to get a motel 
                        room?  

                                 RALPH
                        This will be just as good and it’s 
                        free. 

                                 ELIZA
                        Didn’t your Dad pretty much destroy 
                        you when you snuck into this place 
                        with Kelly Day?

           Ralph scowls at the mention of his old man.

                                 RALPH
                        Fuck him.

           REAR OF APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           A low lying boarded window as Ralph removes the board.  

                                 RALPH
                        My secret entrance.

                                 ELIZA
                        Pretty slick.

           INT. FIRST FLOOR APARTMENT - APARTMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ralph and Eliza stand in the gutted first floor apartment.  

                                 ELIZA
                        Is this the floor you and Kelly 
                        hung out on?

                                 RALPH
                        Yeah.  

           She walks away --
                                 ELIZA
                        Let’s go upstairs.

           INT. STAIRS - APARTMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ralph’s sneakers as he climbs the stairs.  He almost trips on 
           one of Keller’s discarded whiskey bottles.

                                 RALPH
                        Shit.

                                 ELIZA
                        You OK?

                                 RALPH
                        Yeah.

           INT. THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - APARTMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The moment Ralph and Eliza walk inside they’re stricken by 
           something.

                                 ELIZA
                        I changed my mind.  Let’s go back 
                        downstairs.  

           Ralph toes a whiskey bottle with his sneaker, then spots the 
           discarded syringe on the floor.

                                 RALPH
                        Shit, looks like some junkie has 
                        been living here.

           A sound -- a HOLLOW THUMP -- from behind the closed bathroom 
           door.

                                 ELIZA
                             (whispering)
                        Let’s go.

           Eliza starts back for the exit.  Ralph starts to follow her 
           and then stops himself, as an intrepid, slightly nihilistic 
           look emerges in his eyes.

                                 RALPH
                        Take it easy, I’m going to kick his 
                        ass out of here.

           Ralph walks to the bathroom door...

                                 ELIZA
                        Let’s just go, Ralph.
                                 RALPH
                        Just relax.

           He opens the door.  They look inside at the cell.

                                 ELIZA
                        What the fuck is that?

                                 RALPH
                        I don’t know.

                                 ELIZA
                        Let’s go.  

                                 RALPH
                        Look.

           He takes a step inside...

           INT. BATHROOM - THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Eliza is right behind him as he steps inside.  

                                 ELIZA
                        What’s that smell?

           She takes another step inside, both her and Ralph standing in 
           front of the cell now, THE PICTURE OF THEIR MISSING SISTERS 
           nailed to the outside, staring at them.

                                 ELIZA (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God.  Oh my God, Ralph.  

           Ralph takes a cell phone out of his pocket and dials --

                                 911 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        911 emergency.  What is your 
                        location?

                                 ELIZA
                        Oh my God, Ralph.

           Ralph’s closes his eyes, thinking, his breath getting away 
           from him --

                                 RALPH
                        Thirty four Campello Street.  
                        My sister -- I think I found my --

                                 911 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        Just stay calm we’ll have someone 
                        out there in a couple minutes.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 911 OPERATOR (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I want you to stay on the line with 
                        me --

           THUMP -- from inside the cell.  Eliza SCREAMS.  Ralph drops 
           the phone.  They look at each other, too scared to move.  
           THUMP.

                                 ELIZA
                        Oh God.

           Eliza starts to back out of the room.  Ralph takes her by the 
           wrist.

                                 RALPH
                        Anna?  Joy?

           THUMP.

                                 ELIZA
                        Oh God, no.

           Ralph starts moving his palsied hands over the blackened 
           wood, searching for a way to break inside.  

                                 RALPH
                        Help me.  Come on.

           She shakes her head.

                                 ELIZA
                        I can’t.  I can’t.

                                 RALPH
                        Yeah you can, come on.

           She nods, tears streaming down her horrified face.  She joins 
           Ralph, trying to pull at the seams of the wood --

                                 RALPH (CONT’D)
                        Hold on --

           INT. THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - APARTMENT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Ralph bursts from the bathroom.  His desperate eyes scan the 
           trash strewn apartment...  

           A cardboard box.  Ralph looks inside, GASPS -- FULL OF 
           SNAKES.  He stands back, eyes searching...  A duffle bag.  
           Ralph unzips it and looks: blood spattered tools.  
           INT. BATHROOM - THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Eliza speaks into the tube.

                                 ELIZA
                        It’s OK, we’re getting you out -- 
                        we’re getting you both out of 
                        there.  Can you hear me?

           Ralph rushes in and drops the duffle bag to the floor.  

           He reaches in and pulls out the claw hammer.  

           He starts digging nails out.  Eliza pulls out a screw driver 
           and starts prying at the wood.

           Together they pull at a panel of wood.  It starts breaking 
           away as nails clink on the floor...  

           Eliza and Ralph stand back, horrified...

           INT. DEN - HOLLY JONES’ HOUSE - NIGHT

           Close on a TV: shaky news footage of the apartment house, as 
           Jones is loaded into the ambulance...

           A REPORTER stares into the camera, the commotion to his back.

                                 REPORTER
                        While police haven’t released any 
                        official statements yet, several 
                        sources maintain that Jones has 
                        been held captive for the last five 
                        days in the apartment building 
                        right behind me here.  

           Holly Jones stands in the entranceway watching this.  

                                 REPORTER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        We’ve also just learned that the 
                        building might be owned, in some 
                        capacity by Anna Dover’s father...

           She exudes a rage that seems ten sizes too big for her 
           body...  

           EXT. HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - NIGHT

           The lights in the windows go out one by one -- 
           INT. KITCHEN - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Holly Jones hoists Keller’s duffle bag up off the floor and 
           sets it on the kitchen table.  

           She unzips it and starts emptying the contents on to the 
           table: rope, the rifle, duct tape, ONE OF THE WHITE BOXES 
           WITH THE SKULL AND CROSS BONES, A SYRINGE...

           INT. BATHROOM - THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Loki stares at the empty cell, completely befuddled, as are 
           the rest of the cops and forensics techs moving in and out.

                                 O’MALLEY (O.S.)
                        Loki, get over here --

           INT. THIRD FLOOR APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Loki walks out of the bathroom.  O’Malley is there, finishing 
           giving orders to a UNIFORM COP.

                                 O’MALLEY
                        And if you let one more asshole 
                        with a camera get within twenty 
                        feet of that room, you’re fired.  
                             (to Loki)
                        Come here.

           He ushers Loki out of the rest of the cop’s earshot.  
           Loki looks completely deflated, lost.  

                                 LOKI
                        I’m gonna find Dover --

                                 O’MALLEY
                        No you’re not.  Holly Jones needs 
                        to be notified.  Go, now.

           INT. THE HOLE - CONTINUOUS

           DARKNESS -- the sound of BONES SNAPPING under Keller as he 
           shifts and writhes.  A LIGHT -- his mini mag-light key chain.  
           He pans the beam up...climbing out might not be an option.

           He looks down at his hands.  The rusted chain connecting the 
           handcuffs broke in the fall.     

           He keeps the mini-maglight on, but clips it back to his belt.  
           He reaches up, digs his hands in the wall and starts trying 
           to climb out...
           After a few feet the dirt crumbles like dry cake and he 
           slides back down.

           He shines the mini-maglight over the bones until he finds a 
           rib cage.  He moves in and snaps off a rib.  Then another.  

           He uses the ribs to climb the wall; stabbing them into the 
           dirt, PULLING HIMSELF UP, hand over hand -- 

           INT. BLACK SEDAN - TRAVELING - NIGHT

           Loki pulls up in front of Holly Jones’ house.  He turns off 
           the engine and sits for a moment, brooding.  He takes a 
           breath and gets out --

           INT. A ROOM - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           ANNA lies on the floor, asleep.  THE SOUND OF THE DEADBOLT 
           LOCK TUMBLING.  She starts to wake up...  

           The door starts to open -- when the DOORBELL RINGS -- 

           EXT. FRONT DOOR - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Loki, leaning on his cane, as he RINGS the door bell again 
           and waits...

           EXT. UNDER THE TRANS AM - CONTINUOUS

           Keller’s fingers peeking out from under the sheet of plywood 
           as he manages to push it off center, giving him enough space 
           to climb out...

           EXT. FRONT DOOR - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Loki turns and starts limping back down the walkway...

           EXT. UNDER THE TRANS AM - CONTINUOUS

           Close on Keller’s hand as it grabs hold of one of the Trans 
           Am’s underside pipes -- 

           The pipe BREAKS -- OIL SPRAYS IN KELLER’S FACE as he grabs 
           hold of another pipe, and pulls himself up and out...

           Keller crawls out from under the Trans Am.  He leans against 
           the car, blackened with dirt and motor oil, sucking air...
           INT. BLACK SEDAN - PARKED - CONTINUOUS

           Loki puts the car in gear and starts driving.  He barely gets 
           going before he SLAMS ON THE BRAKES --

           There’s a truck parked on the side of the road, and 
           emblazoned on the back: DOVER CARPENTRY.

           EXT. BLACK SEDAN - PARKED - CONTINUOUS

           Loki gets out of the car and limps to Keller’s truck.  
           He peers inside its windows as he gets on the phone --

                                 LOKI
                             (into the phone)
                        I found his truck.  Gun Hill Road, 
                        half a block from Jones’ Aunt’s 
                        house.  

           Loki starts limping frenziedly towards Jones’ Aunt’s house --

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                             (into the phone)
                        She’s not answering the door.  
                        I bet you anything he’s inside.

                                 O’MALLEY (O.S.)
                             (over the phone)
                        Don’t do anything.  Wait for us.  
                        You hear me?  Wait for --

           Loki hangs up and picks up the pace --

           INT. BACK DOOR - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The back door opens.  Keller creeps inside, his oil slicked 
           form almost invisible in the gloom...

           INT. VESTIBULE - HOLLY JONES’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Loki opens the front door and moves inside, keyed up, a 
           little awkward with the cane and the gun -- no free hands...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Loki limps inside.  Nobody there.  He goes to leave when his 
           eye catches a framed photo, basked in moonlight:
           Holly Jones’ husband wearing an unsettling smile, shirtless, 
           revealing he’s wearing THE FAMILIAR MAZE PENDANT.  HE’S THE 
           CORPSE LOKI FOUND IN DUNN’S BASEMENT.  

           SOMETHING’S KNOCKED OVER IN THE ADJACENT KITCHEN.  Loki snaps 
           back to attention, eyes darting, moving now...

           INT. KITCHEN - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Loki’s POV as he enters the kitchen: Keller’s duffle bag on 
           the kitchen table.  The open box with the skull and cross 
           bones: 

           POISON!  Fast acting, humane...

           INT. HALLWAY - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller, moves into the hallway, holding his breath, back to 
           the wall.  He opens a door and looks in at...

           A room stuffed with old furniture and junk...  

           He moves on to the next.  The closed door with the deadbolt 
           on the outside...  

           He turns the lock, bracing himself...

           INT. A ROOM - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller opens the door to see Anna huddled in the corner.  
           He limps towards her, eyes tearing, breath quickening...

           INT. HALLWAY - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Loki approaches the same room, then stops, seeing a shadow on 
           the wall, a figure, looming over Anna’s shadow...

           Loki takes a breath, gun at the ready, inching towards the 
           doorway...

           INT. A ROOM - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Keller, Anna in his arms now, rushing for the door -- when IT 
           SLAMS IN HIS FACE and they’re thrown into DARKNESS --

                                                               BACK TO:
           INT. THE HOLE - CONTINUOUS

           BLACKNESS...the click of Keller’s mini-maglight, shining up 
           under his chin.  His face, sea-sick, blinking, rubbing his 
           eyes, seeing: 

           Dirt walls, skeletons, snakes, ALL OF IT DISTORTING.  
           The laced grape-aid.  His escape was a hallucination.  
           HE’S STILL IN THE HOLE.

           EXT. BACK YARD - JONES’ AUNTS’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The Trans Am.  We hear Keller screaming beneath it ever so 
           faintly...

           INT. A ROOM - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Loki limps into the doorway, gun outstretched, eyes focusing:

           The shadow isn’t Keller -- it’s Holly Jones, now squatting 
           beside Anna, her back to Loki, injecting the remainder of the 
           poison into her arm. 

                                 LOKI
                        STOP -- PUT IT DOWN --

           She pulls out the empty syringe and drops it to the floor.  
           Then her back still to him, she straightens up.

                                 HOLLY JONES
                        Make sure they cremate me.  I don’t 
                        want to be buried in some box.

                                 LOKI
                        TURN AROUND -- SHOW ME YOUR HANDS --

           Holly Jones pulls the .38 from the front of her pants, swings 
           around and FIRES at the same time Loki does --

           SHE GRAZES LOKI’S FACE AND TAKES OUT HIS RIGHT EYE.  
           Loki HITS HER SQUARE IN THE FOREHEAD.  She collapses, dead.  

           Blood pouring from his right eye, Loki picks up Anna, now 
           semi-unconscious -- gritting his teeth --

           EXT. HOLLY JONES’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Loki bursts out the front door with Anna in his arms, 
           limping, blood running down his face --
           He gets her in the back of his car.  He limps around, gets 
           behind the wheel -- starts the car and GUNS IT --

           INT. BLACK SEDAN - TRAVELING - CONTINUOUS

           LOKI DOES SIXTY THROUGH FALLING SNOW, DRIVING WITH ONE EYE 
           DOWN RESIDENTIAL STREETS, ENGINE ROARING --  

           HE LEANS ON HIS HORN AND BLASTS THROUGH A RED LIGHT.  
           THREE CARS SMASH UP BEHIND HIM --

           ANNA IS STARTING TO CONVULSE IN THE BACK SEAT.  

                                 LOKI
                        Almost there, almost there.  Stay 
                        with me, Anna, stay with me --
                             (under his breath)
                        Don’t die don’t die --

           TWO KIDS PLAYING STREET HOCKEY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD -- 
           HE LEANS ON THE HORN --

                        GET OUT OF THE WAY!

           HE SMASHES THROUGH THE HOCKEY NET, ROLLS UP ON SOMEBODY’S 
           LAWN, PLOWS THROUGH SOME HEDGES -- GARBAGE CANS -- BACK ON 
           THE ROAD, ACCELERATING...

           A CAR IS SLOWLY DOING A THREE POINT TURN, BLOCKING THE ROAD --

                        MOVE!  GET OUT OF THE WAY!

           HE SWERVES, TAKES THE REARVIEW OFF A PARKED CAR, ROLLS UP ON 
           ANOTHER LAWN, ROLLS OVER A KID’S BIG WHEEL -- LOSES HIS 
           MUFFLER --

           BACK ON THE TARMAC -- ON A STRAIGHTAWAY, ACCELERATING...  
           ANNA’S CONVULSING IS GETTING WORSE --

                                 LOKI (CONT’D)
                        Stay with me, Anna, we’re almost 
                        there --
                             (under his breath)
                        Don’t die.  Please, God, don’t let 
                        her die --
           EXT. BROCKTON HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER

           Loki’s car rolls up on the curb, the front bumper inches from 
           taking out a shocked OLD MAN in a wheel chair.  Loki bursts 
           out of the car, opens the back door, grabs Anna out --

           He carries her, blood gushing down his face, limping through 
           the double doors -- SCREAMING:

                                 LOKI
                        POLICE OFFICER -- I NEED HELP!

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BROCKTON HOSPITAL - DAY

           A patient lies in his hospital bed, his face obscured by the 
           newspaper he’s reading: 

           EDDIE MILLAND AKA ALEX JONES
           REUNITED WITH FAMILY AFTER 27 YEARS

           A picture of Jones in the hospital, his beard shaved off, 
           revealing a previously hidden resemblance to the photos of 
           him at seven years old.

           Below that is another headline: STILL MISSING
           A picture of Keller.

           The patient folds up the paper.  It’s Loki, oxygen tubes in 
           his nostrils, bandages over one eye.  Someone approaches his 
           bedside...

           It's Anna, dressed in hospital pajamas, remnants of shock 
           still clouding her eyes.

                                 LOKI
                        Hello.

           She doesn’t answer.  Behind her is Grace, Nancy and Joy.  
           Grace seems possessed of some newfound strength, while Nancy 
           seems withered and shaky.

                                 GRACE
                        I hope we’re not intruding.  
                        Anna wanted to see her hero.  

           Anna stares at Loki, unable to speak.  He offers her his 
           hand, noticing she's wearing a red whistle around her neck.  
           She shakes his hand, regarding him like an apparition.  

           And while she does Loki looks over at Nancy, picking up on 
           the guilt that’s underlying her expression.  She senses him 
           reading her and looks away --  
           Loki’s gaze moves on to Joy.  There’s an unsettling darkness 
           in her eyes.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        OK --

           Grace gently ushers Anna from the beside. 

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                             (to Nancy)
                        Will you give me a minute?

           Nancy nods, takes Joy and Anna by the hand and leads them 
           out.

                                 NANCY
                        Say goodbye girls.

           With whisper voices:

                           ANNA
                                                           JOY
           Bye.
                                              Bye.

           Nancy leaves with the girls...

           INT. HALLWAY - BROCKTON HOSPITAL

           Nancy walks out with the girls.  Eliza is there, Ralph by her 
           side. Franklin is there too.  He looks greyer, washed out.  
           Nancy acts as if he’s invisible, and he returns the favor.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BROCKTON HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

           Grace stands by Loki’s bedside.

                                 LOKI
                        She found her whistle.

                                 GRACE
                        No.  She keeps insisting Joy helped 
                        her find it on Thanksgiving before 
                        they were taken, but I think she’s 
                        just confused...  I got her a new 
                        one.  
                             (beat)
                        He hasn’t contacted me.  I know you 
                        don’t believe me, but he hasn’t.

                                 LOKI
                        I believe you.
                                 GRACE
                        Do you think you’re going to find 
                        him?

                                 LOKI
                        Yes.  

                                 GRACE
                        They’ll send him to jail?  

                                 LOKI
                        Probably.

           Beat.

                                 GRACE
                        I miss him.

           Loki nods, not sure what to say to that.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        He did what he had to do for Anna.  
                        And I thank God that he did.

           Loki doesn’t answer, the two of them sharing the silence, 
           until:

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        He’s a good man.

           And with than she abruptly walks out...

           Loki picks the newspaper back up.  He looks at the picture of 
           Keller...  

           EXT. BACK YARD - HOLLY JONES’ HOUSE - NIGHT

           It’s the middle of the night.  The sound of GENERATORS 
           HUMMING, powering industrial spot lights, illuminating the 
           back yard as snow falls.  

           The Trans Am has not been moved.  The seats have been ripped 
           out, lying next to the car, eviscerated.  

           Closer to the house, two tired looking FORENSIC TECHS, late 
           twenties, kneel on the ground scraping at the frozen soil -- 
           they have a radio on, working to classical music --

           The back door opens and out walks Loki, eye bandaged, limping 
           on his cane.  He looks broken, left the hospital too early.

           He surveys the backyard.  
                                 LOKI
                        Find anything?

           Tech 1 holds up a plastic bag.  Inside is a frozen, partially 
           decomposed snake.

                                 TECH 1
                        Just this so far.  Ground’s frozen 
                        solid.  It’s gonna take us weeks to 
                        excavate the whole property.

           Loki surveys the yard for a moment with a weary expression.  

                                 LOKI
                        Pray for the best.  Prepare for the 
                        worst.  

           Finished for the night, Tech 1 shuts off the spotlights, and 
           with a loud CLICK CLACK the back yard goes dark.  

           Tech 2 shuts off the radio and follows his cohort into the 
           house.  Loki hangs back.  It’s dead quiet now.  

           Loki limps around the yard.  He takes a closer look at the 
           Trans Am, staring into its gutted interior, thinking...

           He limps back towards the house, looking bothered by 
           something, his mind grinding gears...  

           He takes a last look at the moonlit yard, then turns around 
           about to enter the house -- when he hears something...

           It’s very faint, but almost sounds like a whistle.  
           Loki turns around.  Could have been the wind, but...  

           There it is again.  It’s coming from the Trans Am.  

           Loki limps through the snow to the Trans Am, dread blossoming 
           in his eyes.  He hears the whistle again and picks up the 
           pace, almost there as we --

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                    THE END
