           The sounds of a drunken couple awkwardly making out fill the 
           black screen.  Competing with the grunts and moans is the 
           lone voice of a news anchor from a television left on.

                        Thanks, Chad, looks like it’s time 
                        to go jacket shopping.

           SUPERTITLE: YALE UNIVERSITY, 1987

           INT. YALE DORM ROOM

           A television fills the frame. On it a hair-sprayed anchor, 
           with shoulder pads to spare, reports the nightly news with a 
           seriousness that contradicts her eye shadow. 

                                 80’S NEWS ANCHOR
                        The annual Harvard-Yale game was 
                        played today in New Haven.  The 
                        rival football teams played a close 
                        game with Harvard ultimately 
                        defeating Yale, 14-10. 

           Two t-shirts lay on the floor: one reads Harvard, the other 
           Yale.  

           An amorphous mound moves from underneath the pastel covers of 
           a college-issued dorm bed. From beneath the blanket...

                        In other news, President Reagan and 
                        the First Lady arrived in London 
                        this morning where they were 
                        greeted warmly by Prime Minister 
                        Thatcher and her husband, Denis. 

           Pictures of the two leaders greeting each other effusively 
           fill the screen. 

                                 BRITISH GUY (O.S.)
                        God, you’re sexy.

                        Thanks. I like your penis.

                                 BRITISH GUY (O.S.)
                        Brilliant. Thanks.

                        Hold on. Let me take off my 
                        scrunchie.

           A neon pink scrunchie hits the tv screen as Reagan and 
           Thatcher wave ceremoniously out towards the cameras in front 
           of 10 Downing Street.

                        The two leaders have developed a 
                        close personal bond over the course 
                        of their tenures in office, not 
                        only as allies in the Cold War but 
                        also as friends. 

           The television projects images of Thatcher and Reagan riding 
           around merrily in a golf cart together. 

           BACK TO THE MOUND

           Identities still obscured by the pastel comforter.

                        That feels good.

           just colleagues.

                        Britain and America have long 
                        enjoyed what Churchill once called 
                        a “special relationship.”  However, 
                        not since World War II have the two 
                        countries been so intimate.

           A black and white photograph of Churchill and FDR laughing 
           with their arms around each other fills the screen.

                                 AMERICAN GIRL (O.S.)

                        the prime minister and the

           We pull back to reveal more of the dorm room. The desk is 
           stacked with National Reviews next to a vintage IBM whose 
           yellow cursor pulses silently where it was abandoned, mid-
           sentence: “Therefore, it is essential that the United States 
           reduce its greenhouse gas emissions....”

           The audience applauds as the British Guy moans triumphantly. 

           BACK TO THE MOUND

           The covers are finally thrown off revealing the faces of the 
           drunk couple. The AMERICAN GIRL, 19, is attractive - 
           especially by Ivy League standards - yet badly permed.  Next 
           to her in a post-coital coma is the BRITISH GUY, 20.  He’s 
           devilishly handsome, but he and everyone else knows it. 

                                 BRITISH GUY
                        That was fun.

                        Right. Good thinking.

           They lay there awkwardly in the uncomfortably-small dorm bed. 
           In the background we hear a Grey Poupon commercial.

                                 AMERICAN GIRL
                        Should I set an alarm?

                        Yeah, actually. I’ve got to get up 
                        and do some stuff, so.

                                 AMERICAN GIRL
                        Yeah, me too.

                        But we should definitely hang out 
                        next time I’m in New Haven.

                                 AMERICAN GIRL

                        Not really, but....

           Awkward beat.

                                 AMERICAN GIRL
                        Well, goodnight.

           They kiss awkwardly. 

                                 BRITISH GUY
                        ‘Night.

           She raises the remote and shuts off the tv.

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           A similar mound lies asleep, completely obscured by the 
           covers. The sun is just creeping through the dense curtains. 
           SUPERTITLE: 25 YEARS LATER

           Suddenly a distinctly modern alarm goes off. 6:30 am. The 
           same American girl shoots up, but now she is a woman, JO, 42.  
           She is beautiful, confident, and wearing only a ratty Yale t-
           shirt.

           MUSIC IDEA: PRESIDENT BY SOPHIE LUX

           JO gets out of bed and opens the curtains revealing a 
           stunning view of the Washington Monument. 

           With the sun pouring into the bedroom we can see its full 
           grandeur: like some gilded hotel room. 

           She throws off her shirt, and proceeds to put on a bullet-
           proof vest over her bra. 

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           She is dressed in a nice pants suit, which fits awkwardly 
           over her bullet proof vest, making her looking 20 pounds 
           heavier -- and she knows it.   

           She pours coffee into a mug.  Moving her hand we see the mug 
           has the presidential seal on it. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           She sits at the kitchen table, looking at the day’s Wall 
           Street Journal. She is on the cover shaking hands with an 
           Arab leader. The headline reads: “Abdullah Warns Brooks: 
           We’re Running out of Oil.”

           JO takes a bite of a jelly donut as she reads.  A drop of 
           jelly falls on the Arab leader’s face.  She wipes it with her 
           finger and licks it.  There is something incredibly sexy, yet 
           human about this portrait.  

           Beside her a note pad reads: TO DO LIST.  

           1) Call Mandela back 2) Finalize sanctions against N. Korea 
           3) Balance budget 4) Cut 10,000 extraneous government jobs 5) 
           Sign Ethics Bill 6) Do sit-ups.

           She looks at the daunting tasks in front of her and proceeds 
           to check off #5 as she takes another bite of donut.
           INT. WEST WING 

           Jo walks confidently down the halls of the West Wing as she 
           passes various obsequious staffers.

                                 STAFFER 1
                        Happy 4th of July, Madame 
                        President. 

                                 STAFFER 2
                        Congrats on the Ethics Bill, Madame 
                        President. 

           She arrives at the door of the Oval office and struts in.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE

           She sits down at the desk and fusses with the bulky vest. 

                                 JO
                        Connor can you double-check I 
                        really need this stupid vest for 
                        the parade? 

           A young aide, CONNOR, 23, log-cabin, sticks his head in. 

                                 CONNOR 
                        Yes, ma’am.

           Jo picks up a note sitting on her desk - suddenly her face 
           drops.  

           She turns on CNN.

           In walks MAX, 58, a fatherly man whose face is worn by years 
           of worry. He’s the kind of person you can never imagine young 
           -- like he popped out of the womb in a beige suit and black-
           rimmed glasses -- the love-child of some 8th grade science

                        only been in Commons three years.  

                                 JO
                        How do I know that name?

                                 MAX
                        His dad was Prime Minister for a 
                        second back in the 70's.

                             (realizing)
                        Oh my God. 

           On the television are various paparazzi photos of ALISTAIR, 
           45, with a potpourri of UK starlets: Sienna, Keira, Kate.... 

                                 MAX
                        Apparently he makes Clinton look 
                        like a Mormon schoolboy.

           ON THE TELEVISION

                             (to attractive reporter)
                        Absolutely. It’s time for the 
                        Tories to get serious about climate 
                        change, before it’s too late. 
                        (beat) Can I call you Cindy?

           Though he is a bit more wrinkled and a lot more clothed than 
           when we last saw him, there is no mistaking that charismatic 
           smirk: ALISTAIR is British Guy.
                                 JO
                             (clearly nauseous)
                        This isn’t happening.

           TITLE: ALLIES WITH BENEFITS

           EXT. GERMAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           SUPERTITLE: G8 SUMMIT, GERMANY

           EXT. GERMAN HOTEL - DAY

           Motorcades of limo upon limo crowd the hotel entrance, each 
           car with its own flag waving proudly from the hood.  Mixed in 
           with the sea of political officials are protestors, 
           reporters, and secret service. 

           A YOUNG REPORTER, 25, stands in front of the hotel, holding a 
           still pose as she waits for the camera to roll.  Her 
           manicured brows are furrowed to suggest intelligence.  

           THROUGH THE NEWS CAMERA

                                 YOUNG REPORTER
                        Thanks, Hank.  I am standing here 
                        in the heart of the picturesque 
                        German countryside in a little town 
                        called Koblenz, host of this year’s 
                        annual G8 Summit.  As we speak, the 
                        leaders of the eight most powerful 
                        countries in the world are arriving 
                        to tackle the most pressing issues 
                        of today like global poverty, 
                        terrorism, and (furrowing even 
                        more) AIDS. (beat) Cut. 

           The YOUNG REPORTER drops her “hard-hitting” act and reveals 
           the bratty Communications major she really is. 

                                 CAMERA MAN O.S.
                        What?

                                 YOUNG REPORTER
                        I need more lip gloss.

                                 CAMERA MAN O.S.
                        You look great. 

                                 YOUNG REPORTER
                        I can see myself in the camera, 
                        Ted. I look like a fucking lesbian.

           INT. HOTEL CONVENTION ROOM - SAME

           The medium-sized conference room looks more like a college 
           classroom than the scene of a world-class summit. Translators 
           and a handful of photographers weave in between the 
           conversations and finger food.  

           The eight leaders and their right-hand men stand around in 
           various cliques small-talking. Each leader in addition to 
           having a thick accent wears a flag pin from his or her 
           respective country.

           JO stands next to MAX as they chat with the President of 
           France, FRANCOIS, 48, diminutive yet confident.

                        President Gerard, so good to see 
                        you again.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        As for me, President Brooks. 

                                 JO
                        How are Veronique and the kids?

                                 FRANCOIS
                             (shrugging gaullicly)
                        Eh, my wife is good, my kids are 
                        good, my lover is good.  So life is 
                        tolerable. 

                                 JO
                        Wonderful.  You remember my Chief 
                        of Staff, Max Wolf.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        Ah yes.

                        Monsieur le President.

                                 FRANCOIS
                             (to JO)
                        And you, how is it possible, you 
                        are still single?
                                 JO
                        Single? I’m dating 300 million 
                        people. And 43% of them hate my 
                        guts.

           They laugh. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           The Prime Minister of Canada, JONATHAN, is in the middle of 
           talking to the President of Russia, YURI.  JONATHAN is doughy 
           and grating, like a 40 year-old hall-monitor. 

                                 JONATHAN
                             (in thick Canadian accent)
                        Let me see -- what else can I tell 
                        you aboot? (sic)

           Meanwhile, YURI, is angular and intensely Slavic, and looks 
           like he would rather kill himself than endure this 
           conversation. His equally miserable aide stands dutifully by 
           his side.

                                 JONATHAN
                        Oh! My wife and I celebrated our 
                        25th wedding anniversary in 
                        Vancouver. We caught the new Celine 
                        Dion show.  What a voice.  She's 
                        Canadian you know.  Quebecois. So 
                        is Alanis Morisette. People forget 
                        that. And Sarah McLachlan.  People 
                        just assume they are American which 
                        is so frustrating.  

           Russia leans into his aide. 

                                 YURI
                             (in Russian)
                        Call my cell phone. (beat) Now.

           ALISTAIR (ALI) stands in the corner clutching a leather-bound 
           notebook tight to his chest, with HRH Coat of Arms emblazoned 
           on it. His usual confidence replaced by unfamiliar jitters. 
           Not helping the situation is his perpetually jittery Deputy 
           Prime Mininster, SIMON, 45, a round, ruddy man, who nervously 
           fiddles with the hors-d’ouvres.
                                 SIMON
                        We can’t stand by the baby carrots 
                        the whole summit, Ali.

                                 ALI
                        Christ I’m actually nervous. 

                                 SIMON
                        This is your chance to mingle.

                        What if the other countries don't 
                        like me?

                                 SIMON
                        Then we're fucked. 

                                 ALI
                        Thanks a lot.

                                 SIMON
                        This is politics, Ali, if you're 
                        not one of the popular kids - 
                        you're fired.  

           ALI takes a deep breath and eats a baby carrot.  

                                 SIMON
                        Come on then, we’ll start off easy 
                        with Japan. No crisis if he thinks 
                        you’re a tool.

           The President of Italy, MORETTI, stands next to the 
           Chancellor of Germany, HANSEL. MORETTI (69) is the eldest of 
           the eight: an unflappable, leathery walrus, who perpetually 
           has a carcinogen dangling from his lips.

           HANSEL, other the other hand, is somewhat OCD: you can tell 
           small talk does not come easy to him.  He checks his watch as 
           compulsively as he trims his moustache.  

                                 HANSEL
                             (in thick German accent)
                        The hotel is nice, ja? And the 
                        food?

                                 MORETTI
                        Bellissima. 
                                 HANSEL
                        Ja, this is what I think as well. 
                        (leaning closer) I just hope we can 
                        get through one summit without the 
                        other leaders bringing up....you 
                        know.

                                 MORETTI
                        They’re over it, Hansel.  It is you 
                        who needs to move on. 

                                 HANSEL
                        Oh come on. It’s always Hitler 
                        this, Hitler that. How many times 
                        can we apologize? 

           MORETTI shrugs and takes another puff from his cigar.

           ALI walks up to the Prime Minister of Japan, YASHIMOTO, a 
           compact man, whose cryptic face is impossible to read.  You’d

                        Thank you. No complaints so far.

                                 YASHIMOTO
                        But it will onry get harder and 
                        harder.

                        I need to use the little Prime 
                        Minister’s room.

           ALI walks away from the unperturbed Prime Minister, back to 
           the uber-perturbed SIMON.

                        What?!

                                 ALI
                        Don’t worry about it.

                                 SIMON
                        I say we go to Canada next and 
                        leave America for last.

                                 SIMON
                        I’m going to get some baby carrots. 

           Simon walks away. 

                                 ALI
                        I’m really looking forward to 
                        working together. 

                                 JO
                        Definitely.  (awkward silence) So 
                        how are you enjoying your first G8? 

                                 ALI
                        It's great.  Only spoken to 
                        Yashimoto so far. 

                                 JO
                        Did he congratulate you on your 
                        erection?

                                 ALI
                        How did you know?

                                 JO
                        He says it to every new guy.

                                 ALI
                        Way to deflate a man's ego.  

           Suddenly ALI looks at JO differently, as if trying to place 
           her. 

                                 ALI
                        I have this weird feeling that 
                        I've....

           CLINK CLINK

           HANSEL impatiently taps his water glass to summon attention. 

                                 HANSEL
                        Everyone please take your seats.   

                                 JO
                             (to ALI)
                        I should sit down.
                                 ALI
                             (calling after her)
                        Nice meeting you.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MIDDLE OF THE MEETING

           The eight leaders sit around a conference table -- the 
           photographers and sherpas now gone for the closed session.

           Germany is the only one standing as he stiffly delivers a 
           power-point presentation. One has the feeling of sitting in a 
           bad college lecture. 

                                 HANSEL
                             (reading)
                        And we have to think about the long-
                        term strategy for dealing with 
                        hunger and poverty in Africa.  
                        While financial aid and food 
                        assistance programs.... 

           As Germany keeps lecturing, we pan across the faces of the 
           seven other leaders. Italy’s eyes are closed even though he 
           has a lit cigar in his mouth. France is stifling a yawn. 
           Canada looks super-interested and is merrily taking notes. 
           Russia looks like he is plotting everyone else’s demise.  
           Britain looks preoccupied with placing how he knows America. 
           And America, who keeps catching Britain staring at her, looks 
           increasingly uneasy.

                                 HANSEL
                        In this slide here, we see the 
                        benefits of increased trade through 
                        lowering existing tariffs best 
                        demonstrated by this algorithm....

           ALI scribbles a note on his G8 stationery and hands it to the 
           Prime Minister of Japan to pass to JO. Like a kid trying to 
           not get caught by the teacher, JO takes the note as 
           discreetly as possible from an ever-stoic YASHIMOTO.  

           The only G8 member who notices is Canada (of course) who 
           shakes his head disapprovingly before returning to his 
           rigorous notes. 

           JO cautiously opens the note and reads: 

                        “You look familiar.”
           JO rolls her eyes at ALI and points to her placard which 
           reads: THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. ALI shakes his 
           head like, “ I know, I know.” 

           JO tries to return her attention to the lecture, but she can 
           still feel England’s eyes staring at her as he searches his 
           mental directory. 

           Finally, JO discreetly writes a response back, which she 
           folds and passes through YASHIMOTO to ALI. 

           ALI unfolds the note and gasps.  The leaders turn.

                                 ALI
                        Sorry, I just remembered I forgot 
                        to...call my mum...for her 
                        birthday.  But back to poverty, 
                        shall we?

           A bit perplexed, the leaders return to the lecture as Germany 
           clicks to the next slide.  Staring at the note, ALI’s face is 
           ashen.

           On the note, written in confident, yet somewhat girlie 
           handwriting is simply:

                        “We fucked Sophomore year.”

           A CAMERA FLASHES

           EXT. GERMAN COUNTRYSIDE

           The leaders are lined up like in a school picture in front of 
           the lush and hilly Germany countryside. A stern, humorless, 
           overly masculine GERMAN PHOTOGRAPHER runs the shoot like he’s 
           invading Poland.

                                 GERMAN PHOTOGRAPHER
                             (in thick German accent)
                        We go again.  Canada blinked. 

                                 JONATHAN
                        I thought we were going on two.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        Who takes a picture on two?

                                 GERMAN PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Ein, zwei, drei, Cheeeeeeez.
           The leaders smile each in their own way. Canada beams.  Italy 
           shrugs.  Russia sneers.  Etc. 

           As soon as the camera flashes, Britain leans into America.

                                 ALI
                        I'd love to talk to you more about 
                        uh that thing you mentioned...you 
                        know, Operation Sophomore Year. 

                                 JO
                        Shhh. Not now.

                                 JONATHAN
                        What's Operation Sophomore Year? 

                                 ALI
                        Just this thing that....

                                 JONATHAN
                        Don't tell me you guys are planning 
                        another invasion.  

                                 JO
                        No! It's nothing. 

                                 GERMAN PHOTOGRAPHER
                        We go again.  This time pretend you 
                        are sailing by the ocean and you 
                        see a dolphin. Ein, zwei, drei, 
                        Cheeeeeze. 

           The leaders look bewildered at one another. 

                                 ALI
                        Maybe before lunch….?

                                 JO
                             (clenched photo smile)
                        Let's just talk about this later. 

                                 JONATHAN
                        I knew it! 

                                 JO
                        We are not planning an invasion. 

                                 JONATHAN
                             (conspiratorily)
                        Yeah, that's what you guys said 
                        before Iraq. (petulant) I want in -- 
                        or I’m gonna tell the U.N.
           JO looks at ALI like she wants to kill him.

                                 GERMAN PHOTOGRAPHER
                        We go one more time. This time 
                        pretend somebody just made a 
                        hilarious joke.  Ein, zwei, drei, 
                        cheeeeeze.

           The leaders pretend to laugh for the photo. CLICK.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - US/BRITISH BILATERAL MTG - LATER

           JO and MAX are seated across from ALI and SIMON.  In the 
           corner of the room a stenographer waits -- fingers poised -- 
           for them to speak.

           Silence. 

                                 SIMON
                             (nervously)
                        Well we are just so excited to be 
                        working with you.  Ali and I are 
                        big fans of your administration.  
                        And we just think it's great that 
                        America has finally elected a woman 
                        president. Not that I think of you 
                        as a woman.  I just think of you as 
                        a qualified person to be president. 
                        In fact nothing woman about you 
                        except for that extra x chromosome 
                        and your breasts.  Oh my god - do 
                        you have breasts? I didn't know. 
                        Cause I've never looked. I've only 
                        looked at your face. Because I 
                        respect you. Shall we start with 
                        terrorism then?

           JO smiles weakly.  MAX looks appalled.

                                 ALI
                        Simon, Max, would you mind letting 
                        the President and I have a few 
                        minutes alone to get better 
                        acquainted?

                                 SIMON
                        Yeah, great. Good.

                                 JO
                        I don't think it's really necessary 
                        for them to leave.
                                 ALI
                        Actually there are some things I'd 
                        love to talk over with President 
                        Brooks in private.  

                                 MAX
                        Great idea.  We can get more into 
                        the nitty gritty at our summit. 

           The two advisors walk out, leaving an uncomfortable JO and 
           eager ALI.

           The stenographer looks at them expectantly. JO motions 
           discreetly towards the stenographer.  

                                 ALI
                        Right. (to Stenographer) Ma’am, if 
                        you would.

           The stenographer types, then realizing he is talking about 
           her gets up and leaves. 

                                 ALI
                        Pardon my eagerness to get a word 
                        alone with you - it's just that you 
                        sort of blew my mind back there.  
                        Here I am, my first summit, in a 
                        meeting about poverty in Africa, 
                        and instead of thinking about clean 
                        water programs, I'm desperately 
                        trying to remember every girl I 
                        slept with at university. Which is 
                        no small task - mind you.  Until 
                        suddenly I realized - she's fucking 
                        with me.  There is no way I could 
                        have slept with her - after all she 
                        went to Yale, and I, Madame 
                        President, went to Harvard.  This 
                        is just a classic game of pick on 
                        the new leader at the global 
                        conference.  

                                 JO
                        The Harvard/Yale game, New Haven, 
                        fall of '87.

                                 ALI
                        You weren't joking?

                                 JO
                        You really don't remember?
                                 ALI
                        I mean, you look familiar - I just 
                        assumed we were at a luncheon 
                        together or something.

                                 JO
                        Not quite.

                                 ALI
                        Well lovely to see you again.

           Awkward pause. 

                                 ALI
                        So we really...uh....

                                 JO
                        Yes.

                                 ALI
                        How was it?

                                 JO
                        Forgettable.

                                 ALI
                        Look, I'm sorry.  That weekend was 
                        a complete blur of grain alcohol 
                        and mediocre football. Wait.

                                 JO
                        What?

                                 ALI
                        You didn't by any chance have a 
                        poster of Margaret Thatcher on your 
                        wall?

                                 JO
                        Forget I mentioned it.

                                 ALI
                        Holy shit.

                                 JO
                        What?

                                 ALI
                        You're the Margaret Thatcher girl. 
                        I can't believe this.

                                 JO
                        Let's just forget about it, okay?
                                 ALI
                        You don't understand what a mind- 
                        fuck that was. So I'm hooking up 
                        with this cute girl - uh, you - 
                        when all of the sudden I look up 
                        see my godmother staring at me.

                                 JO
                        Margaret Thatcher is your 
                        godmother?

                                 ALI
                        Yeah - like having sex with your 
                        priest watching. I had to pull the 
                        covers over me so I couldn’t see.  

           ALI starts laughing.  

                                 JO
                        What?

                                 ALI
                        No - nothing.  It's just. Talk 
                        about a bloody coincidence.

                                 JO
                        I think it's best if we just move 
                        on and not speak of this again.

                                 ALI
                             (laughing hysterically)
                        I mean how mental is that? I slept 
                        with the President of the United 
                        States.

                                 JO
                             (sternly)
                        Jesus, keep your voice down.

           KNOCK KNOCK

           Jo’s PRESS SECRETARY, waspy and bow-tied, pokes his head in. 

                                 PRESS SECRETARY
                        President Brooks, Prime Minister, 
                        the press corps is ready for you. 

           INT. PRESS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           JO and ALI answer questions from their podiums, their 
           respective flags standing flaccidly behind them.   
                                 REPORTER #1
                        Madame President, given this is 
                        your first bilateral meeting 
                        together, what did you two talk 
                        about?

                                 JO
                        The Prime Minister and I had a 
                        very, um, productive conversation 
                        about many different issues.

                                 REPORTER #1
                        Can you be more specific?

                                 JO
                        Of course, we spoke about issues 
                        that are important to both of our 
                        countries.

                                 REPORTER #1
                        Such as?

                                 ALI
                        Madame President, if I may, we 
                        spoke primarily about the past. 
                        President Brooks was reminding me 
                        of our countries' shared history.

                                 JO
                        I don't think we really need to get 
                        into that right now.

                                 ALI
                        She was reminding me that Britain 
                        once colonized America.

                                 JO
                        That was a long long time ago. I 
                        think everyone's moved on.

                                 ALI
                        Now, now - I think it's important 
                        that Britain acknowledge it's past 
                        transgressions.

                                 JO
                        Next question.

                                 ALI
                        We should never have put on our red 
                        coats and stormed your borders.
                                 JO
                        Maybe if Britain hadn't drunk so 
                        much tea.

                                 ALI
                        We did remember to wear red coats, 
                        right?

                                 JO
                        Yes.

                                 ALI
                        And so, Britain would like to 
                        formally apologize for ever, ever 
                        breaching America's shores.

                                 JO
                        As I recall we won that war.

                                 ALI
                        But the whole enterprise did last 
                        an impressively long time.

                                 JO
                        It was an amazing show of force 
                        from such a small country.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           SIMON waves to members of the press as they walk out of the 
           press room then turns to ALI.

                                 SIMON
                        Well that went well. I'm glad our 
                        two countries can finally work 
                        together now that we've put the 
                        Revolutionary fucking War behind 
                        us.

                                 ALI
                        Like you were Henry Kissinger back 
                        there.  

                                 SIMON
                        I've got the New York Times asking 
                        me if Britain is considering paying 
                        reparations for the battle of 
                        Bunker Hill.

                                 ALI
                        I'm sorry.
                                 SIMON
                        Are there any other allies you'd 
                        like to alienate? Ooh - how about 
                        Spain.  Why don't we hold a press 
                        conference apologizing for 
                        defeating their Armada?

                                 ALI
                        Alright, alright.

                                 SIMON
                        How did it go with Brooks?

                                 ALI
                        Good yeah.

                                 SIMON
                        Do you think she likes you?

                                 ALI
                        I mean.  Yeah.

                                 SIMON
                        Ali - don't fuck this up.  The US 
                        is the most important ally 
                        Britain's got.  If we've got her 
                        behind us - then we've got the 
                        muscle to actually matter.  Without 
                        her - we're the EU's bitch.

                                 ALI
                        Don't worry about it. She likes me.

           EXT. TREE PLANTING CEREMONY - LATER

           The eight leaders are knelt in a row, each planting his own 
           scrawny pine into the moist dirt.  Cameras flash gleefully at 
           the photo opp. 

           America and Britain are planting next to one another.  

                                 JO
                             (whispered to ALI)
                        You are such a jackass. 

                                 ALI
                        Oh come on - I was just having a 
                        little fun.

           Monitoring them, like some saccharine kindergarten teacher is 
           the TREE PLANTING COORDINATOR, a peppy young German fraulein. 
                                 TREE PLANTING COORDINATOR
                        Alright leaders, just dig a foot or 
                        so into the earth.

                        We know how to plant trees.

                                 JO
                        I should have never told you.

                                 ALI
                        Look, no one knows.  I'm not a kiss 
                        and tell.

                                 JO
                        Will you stop talking?

                                 TREE PLANTING COORDINATOR
                        Now place your tree into the hole.  
                        And cover it with the dirt.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        What is the point of this bastard 
                        exercise?

                        We are helping the environment, 
                        Francois.  See Germany cares about 
                        making the world a better place.

                                 YURI
                        Why is my tree smaller than the 
                        others? I want a new tree.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        It used to be bigger - but its 
                        branches decided to break off to 
                        form separate trees.

           The leaders laugh. 

                                 HANSEL
                        Nice one. 

           Russia utilaterally switches trees with Canada.

                        Hey! (to Francois) I told you we 
                        shouldn’t have made it group of 8.

                        President Moretti, can you please 
                        not smoke around the trees?

           MORETTI swears in Italian and drops his cigarette. 

                                 ALI
                        When you said that thing about the 
                        size of my country, you meant my 
                        country, not my country, right?

                                 JO
                        Would you please drop it already?

                                 ALI
                        Cause I've never had any complaints 
                        about my country, if you know what 
                        I'm saying.

                                 JO
                        Just shut up.

                                 JONATHAN
                        Looks like Britain and America are 
                        having their first fight.

                        Prime Minister Chadwick was just 
                        saying how overrated he thinks 
                        French cooking is.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        What?! How dare you talk bad about 
                        French food - two trees away from 
                        the President of France!

                        I was saying nothing of the sort.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        It is the best food in the world.

                                 JO
                        That's what I tried to tell him.

                        President Gerard, I assure you, I

                        mayonnaise sandwich and your

                        Monsieur Gerard, I would never say 
                        anything bad about French cuisine.  
                        It is the pinnacle of culinary

                                 FRANCOIS
                        Are you using sarcasm at me!

                                 ALI
                        Of course not.  President Gerard, I 
                        sincerely apologize for any 
                        misunderstanding.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        Bah. (he shrugs.)

                                 TREE PLANTING COORDINATOR
                        President Moretti, there is no 
                        smoking around the trees.

           MORETTI is now smoking a cigar.  He swears in Italian and 
           drops it on the ground. 

                                 ALI
                             (under his breath to JO)
                        Thanks for reigniting the Hundred 
                        Years War.

                                 JO
                             (devilishly)
                        That's for the press conference. 

                                 TREE PLANTING COORDINATOR
                        Now put a little fertilizer on top.  

           Flames erupt around MORETTI’s tree where he dropped his 
           cigar.  
                                 TREE PLANTING COORDINATOR
                        Oh sheisse - fire extinguisher! 
                        Someone get a fire extinguisher!

           EXT. GERMAN HOTEL - DAY

           The sun is just coming up over the horizon, but the hotel is 
           already abuzz.  Protestors and reporters swarm outside. We 
           see the same YOUNG REPORTER back -- now with tons of lip 
           gloss. Next to her stands a PROTESTOR: a young, Euro-trash, 
           acned teen.

           THROUGH THE NEWS CAMERA

                                 YOUNG REPORTER
                        I am here at day two of the G8 in 
                        Koblenz, Germany, where you can see 
                        I am surrounded by protestors.  
                        Sir, why are you here protesting?

                                 PROTESTOR
                             (German accent)
                        I’m just here to see Bono. 

                                 CAMERA MAN O.S.
                        Cut. I thought he was a protestor.

                                 YOUNG REPORTER
                             (shaking her head)
                        Just pay that homeless guy.

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           JO is in the middle of talking to her entourage when she 
           spots ALI.  She goes up to him. 

                                 JO
                             (polite, but not warm)
                        Look, I’m sorry if I was testy 
                        yesterday. 

                                 ALI
                        No, I acted like an immature 
                        schoolboy. 

                                 JO
                        I'm sure we can move beyond any 
                        awkwardness.  

                                 ALI
                        Good. Yes.
                                 JO
                        Well I should run.  I've got my 
                        bilateral with Francois.

                                 ALI
                        Ah yes - I just came from mine.  I 
                        had to eat 4 croissants and bowl of 
                        vichyssoise in front of him to make 
                        up for yesterday.  I feel like I'm 
                        going to barf. Thanks again.

                                 JO
                        Any time.

                                 ALI
                             (checking itinerary)
                        And now...Russia.

                                 JO
                             (smirking)
                        Well make sure to drink lots of 
                        water before.

                                 ALI
                        Why?

                                 JO
                        He likes to do vodka shots with the 
                        newbies.

                                 ALI
                        Jesus Christ - I feel like I'm 
                        rushing a fraternity.

                                 JO
                        You are.  Welcome to running the 
                        world.

           INT. BANQUET HALL - NIGHT

           A lavish dinner reception is underway. Tuxedoed waiters bring 
           out course after course of gourmet platters.  

           JO is in the middle of talking to MAX, when she spots ALI 
           having a blast with France, Italy and Russia across the 
           table.  JO stares jealously at the “fun side” of the banquet. 
           MAX notices.

                                 MAX
                        England seems to be making friends.
                                 JO
                        What have you heard about Chadwick?

                                 MAX
                        The word is that he's a joke. But 
                        he's young and attractive, and the 
                        Tories are desperate not to seem 
                        the like the party of old white 
                        guys.  I’m sure it didn’t hurt he’s 
                        a legacy. Policy-wise, he fancies 
                        himself Britain’s first “green” 
                        Prime Minister. Apparently, he’s 
                        even installing solar panels on 
                        Downing Street. 

                                 JO
                        How Jimmy Carter of him.

           Across the table the leaders erupt in laughter at some 
           brilliant joke ALI just told.

                                 MAX
                        Although, you've got to hand it to 
                        the guy: he's got a certain charm.  

           LATER 

           The dinner is winding down and all of the diners are 
           loosening their belts. ALI walks up to JO. 

                                 ALI
                        I thought I'd cross the Atlantic to 
                        say hello.

                                 JO
                        My you seem to be making best 
                        friends with everyone.  You're the 
                        belle of the ball.

                                 ALI
                        Oh you know everyone's just so easy 
                        to get along with.

                                 JO
                        Right.

                                 ALI
                        It's amazing to think about how 
                        much the fate of the world is 
                        determined by the chemistry 
                        of...us.
                                 JO
                        Indeed.

                                 ALI
                        Anyway, a bunch of us are going to 
                        hang out back at Francois' chalet - 
                        if you'd like to come with.

                                 JO
                        Hang out?

                                 ALI
                        Yeah - open some good wine and get 
                        to know one another.

                                 JO
                        I see.

                                 ALI
                        For the sake of world peace and 
                        all.

                                 JO
                        Of course.

                                 ALI
                        But if America would prefer to be 
                        isolationist and go to bed early - 
                        I'm sure the other countries would 
                        understand.

                                 JO
                        No.  I'd love to come.

                                 ALI
                        Great.

           ALI walks away.

                                 MAX
                        Are you sure this is a good idea?

                                 JO
                        I’ll have one drink. Relax.

           INT. FRANCOIS’ CHALET - NIGHT

           Chalet is an understatement: it’s more palace than quaint 
           country retreat. All of the leaders are there, except JO,  
           laughing and drinking up a storm.

           A very sober JO walks into the scene.
                                 JO
                        Jesus, where's the AP when you need 
                        them?

           The leaders turn towards the door and throw their arms up in 
           drunken glee.

                                 HANSEL
                        America’s here!  

                                 FRANCOIS
                        At least this time it didn’t take 
                        Pearl Harbor. 

                                 HANSEL
                        You had to go there, didn't you? 

           Jo takes off her coat and sits down.  

                                 JO
                        Sorry I'm late  - something 
                        domestic came up I had to deal 
                        with.  That's what happens when you 
                        are president of a big country

           JO high-fives Russia.  All of the leaders laugh.

                                 ALI
                        Ouch.

           Everyone laughs.

                                 JONATHAN
                        Very funny.  Laugh all you want -- 
                        then imagine a world without Bryan 
                        Adams.

                                 JO
                        God, it smells like Skull and Bones 
                        in here.

                                 ALI
                        Someone pour her a shot. America’s 
                        got some catching up to do.
                                 FRANCOIS
                        Yeah, like stem cell research.

           Everyone laughs again.

                                 JO
                        I'll just take some wine.  I've got 
                        a breakfast meeting with my 
                        advisors at six.

                                 JO
                        Fine - one shot.  But that's it. 

                                 ALI
                             (to JO, intimately)
                        I was afraid you weren't coming.

                        I couldn't leave you alone with the 
                        lions. 

           LATER
           The leaders are officially wasted.  More empty bottles, shot 
           glasses, and discarded ties litter the table.  

           FRANCOIS suddenly bursts into laughter.

                                 JO
                        What? What's so funny?

                                 FRANCOIS
                        Remember the time when Cameroon 
                        threw up on Canada at the U.N.?

                                 YURI
                        I wet myself.

                                 JONATHAN
                        Guys I hate when you bring this up. 
                        It wasn't funny.

                                 ALI
                        You got barfed on at the UN?

                                 JONATHAN
                        Guys.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        So we are in the middle of hearing 
                        about the threat of nuclear 
                        proliferation in Iran when all of 
                        the sudden we hear “Bleh.” And 
                        Canada starts shrieking like a 
                        girl. 

                                 JONATHAN
                        I did not.

                                 YASHIMOTO
                             (still solemn)
                        Yes, you did.

           YASHIMOTO high-fives YURI. They all start laughing 
           hysterically -- except Canada.

           LATER

           The leaders are beyond wasted, but still laughing and doing 
           shots.  YURI is standing holding a microphone attached to a 
           small machine. 

                                 YURI
                        I’ve got a joke. A Georgian and a 
                        Ukranian walk into an interrogation 
                        room.....
                                 MORETTI
                        Give it up, Yuri, you’re not 
                        getting them back.

                                 YURI
                        That’s it. No more natural gas for 
                        any of you.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        Yuri, careful, eh? My son will kill 
                        me if we hurt his stupid karaoke 
                        machine. 

           ALI looks devilishly at the other leaders. 

           LATER

           Japan and Canada are singing a duet by Barenaked Ladies: “If 
           I had a Million Dollars.”  Canada is totally rocking out, and 
           Japan sings as stoically as if he were singing the national 
           anthem.

           EXT. FRANCOIS’ CHALET - SAME

           An army of international secret service agents stand on guard 
           outside.  Through the walls they can hear muted karaoke 
           music.  Two RUSSIAN SECURITY agents look at each other 
           quizzically.

                                 RUSSIAN SECURITY GUARD 1
                             (In Russian)
                        Are they singing karaoke?

           The second guard nods. 

                                 RUSSIAN SECURITY GUARD 2
                             (in Russian)
                        Did you know the Barenaked Ladies 
                        are Canadian?

                                 RUSSIAN SECURITY GUARD 1
                             (in Russian)
                        You bullshit like Trotsky.

           INT. FRANCOIS’ CHALET - LATER

           The Chancellor of Germany is singing a heartfelt rendition of 
           “Margaritaville.” When he hits the chorus, all of the leaders 
           yell, “Salt, salt, salt, salt.”

           LATER
           ALI is holding the mic.  In the background the karaoke 
           machine is playing Meatloaf’s “I’d do Anything for Love (But 
           I won’t do That).”

                                 ALI
                        Ladies and gentlemen, live from the 
                        Rhineland, the President of the 
                        United States.

                                 JO
                        No way.  I'm not singing.

                                 FRACOIS
                        Come on, Jo.

                                 JONATHAN
                        Who else can sing the girl part?

           JO gets up relunctantly and stands next to ALI who is holding 
           the mic. 

                                 JO
                        I hate you guys.

           The leaders clap and cheer her on. 

                                 ALI
                             (singing)
                        I would do anything for love. But I 
                        won’t do that. Ooh no no. I won’t 
                        do.....

           ALI is really hamming it up, whereas JO sings sarcastically. 

                                 JO
                             (rolling her eyes)
                        Will you raise me up, will you help 
                        me down?....

           As the song comes to a close, JO’s sarcasm is dissolved by 
           the eerily personal lyrics, as if Meatloaf had penned the 
           verse from JO’s innermost thoughts.

                                 JO
                             (earnestly to ALI)
                        I know the territory, I've been 
                        around./ It'll all turn to dust and 
                        we'll all fall down. / And sooner 
                        or later you'll be screwing around.

                                 ALI
                             (looking into JO’s eyes)
                        I won't do that! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALI (cont'd)
                        No I won't do that! Anything for 
                        love, but I won't do that.

           ALI and JO share a moment as the song ends, which the others 
           notice. But JO quickly breaks the gaze, rolling her eyes at 
           the crowd. 

           LATER

           Everyone has gone to bed now except for Italy, England, and 
           America. The room is a mess with empty bottles, glasses, 
           cigarette butts. Through the window the sun is just beginning 
           to peak through, exposing the night’s debauchery. 

                                 MORETTI
                             (getting up)
                        I should go to bed. I forget I am 
                        an old man.

                                 ALI
                        You driving?

                                 MORETTI
                        I’ve got a three-limo motorcade.

                                 ALI
                        Good man.

           As Italy walks out he glances back at the two leaders, 
           clearly sensing the chemistry. 

                                 JO
                        What time is it?

                                 ALI
                        Five.

                                 JO
                        In the morning? I've got a meeting 
                        in an hour.

                                 ALI
                        You should go to bed.

                                 JO
                        Eh, not like I sleep anyway.

                                 ALI
                        No?

                                 JO
                        Weight of the world.  Tends to keep 
                        one up. You’ll see.
                                 ALI
                        My father never slept.

                                 JO
                        That's right - you're a legacy.

                                 ALI
                        Sore issue.

                                 JO
                        Oh?

                                 ALI
                        Let's just say my father and I have 
                        a complicated relationship.

                                 JO
                        Join the club.  My father was a 
                        drunk who left us when I was six.

                                 ALI
                        Oh wonderful.

                                 JO
                        Reagan's dad was a drunk, too.  
                        JFK's never gave him his approval.  
                        Neither did Churchill's.  
                        Apparently winning World War II 
                        wasn't good enough for the old man.  
                        Mao's dad used to beat the shit out 
                        of him.  Saddam's left when he was 
                        a baby.

                                 ALI
                        I didn't realize.

                                 JO
                        The only people who have more daddy 
                        issues than strippers are world 
                        leaders.

                                 ALI
                        That's reassuring.  Did you know 
                        who my father was?

                                 JO
                        You mean back in college?

           Ali nods.
                                 JO (CONT.)
                        I was a Poli Sci major.  But that's 
                        not why I...you know...brought you 
                        home with me.

                                 ALI
                        Oh and why was that?

                                 JO
                        You were cute.

                                 ALI
                        So were you.

                                 JO
                        You never called.

                                 ALI
                        You didn't give me your phone 
                        number.

                                 JO
                        You could have tracked it down.

                                 ALI
                        You could have tracked down mine.

           Their faces are getting closer and closer together.

                                 JO
                        I did.

                                 ALI
                        I did, too.

                                 JO
                        You did?

                                 ALI
                        Not per se.

                                 JO
                        Oh.

                                 ALI
                        I spared you, really, I was an 
                        idiot back then.

                                 JO
                        And now?

                                 ALI
                        An older idiot.
                                 JO
                        Then thanks.

                                 ALI
                        For what?

                                 JO
                        Not calling me.

                                 ALI
                        I'm very thoughtful that way.

                                 JO
                        Good to know.

                                 ALI
                        Funny coincidence.

                                 JO
                        What?

                                 ALI
                        Running into you here.

                                 JO
                        I suppose we are going to be seeing 
                        a lot of each other now.

                                 ALI
                        I suppose.

           They kiss. The kissing gets increasingly hot as ALI’s hand 
           slips down to JO’s breasts.

                                 ALI
                             (still kissing)
                        What is that - padding?

                                 JO
                             (still kissing)
                        I don't wear padding.

                                 ALI
                        It feels like you've got something 
                        in your bra.

           She pulls back suddenly, breaking the mood completely.

                                 JO
                             (defensive)
                        It's nothing. (beat) My launch 
                        codes.
                                 ALI
                        Oh. Right.

                                 JO
                        This outfit has no pockets.

                                 ALI
                        No, makes sense.

                                 JO
                        I should go to bed.

                                 ALI
                        Right, me too. Good catching up.

           INT. JO’S HOTEL BATHROOM - LATER

           The sun is now up.  Jo splashes water on her face and looks 
           at herself like, “you idiot.” 

           INT. PRESS ROOM - DAY

           JO is standing on the podium next to YASHIMOTO, both looking 
           a bit hung-over. 

                                 REPORTER #1
                        Prime Mininster, the Kyoto 
                        Agreement is about to expire. Are 
                        the countries of the G8 ready to 
                        draft a new emissions contract? 

                                 YASHIMOTO
                        It is more a question if America is 
                        ready. 

                                 JO
                             (dodging)
                        I’m sure we’ll get into that in 
                        more detail at our environmental 
                        summit in December. Yes, Rob?

                                 REPORTER #3
                        President Brooks, you have been 
                        criticized by Democrats for 
                        ignoring key environmental issues 
                        such as climate change. 

                                 JO
                        Being criticized by Democrats is my 
                        full-time job. 
           People laugh.

                                 REPORTER #3
                        But isn’t it true that you wrote a 
                        paper in college arguing that 
                        global warming is the single 
                        biggest threat facing our world?  

           JO is clearly rattled by the question, but regains her 
           composure.

                                 JO
                        That was a policy paper I was 
                        assigned, Rob.  How’d I do by the 
                        way?

                                 REPORTER #3
                        B-plus.

           Everyone laughs. Through the window JO sees ALI outside about 
           to board a British helicopter.

                                 JO
                        Thanks, folks. My press secretary 
                        can take any further questions. 

           JO hurries out of the press room. 

                                 MAX
                        Way to dodge a bullet.

                                 JO
                        Remind me when we’re gong to stop 
                        dodging and start fixing?

                                 CONNOR
                        Madame President, we’ve got the 
                        African leaders in five minutes.

                                 JO
                        This will just take a second. 

           EXT. GERMAN HOTEL - HELIPAD - MOMENTS LATER

           ALI is about to get on the helicopter with SIMON as JO rushes 
           out trailed by her baffled entourage.

                                 JO
                        You're leaving?
                                 ALI
                        Some IRA nonsense we have to deal 
                        with. I wanted to say goodbye - but 
                        you were in a press conference. 

                                 SIMON
                        Madame President, let me apologize 
                        again for your breasts. Mentioning 
                        them. (holding up a non-ringing 
                        cell phone) I should get that.

           SIMON walks away.

                                 ALI
                        Good times.

                                 JO
                        Yeah.  I think that AIDS package is 
                        going to be very effective.

                                 ALI
                        So I guess I'll see you at NATO?

                                 MAX
                        Actually, we've got our summit in 
                        DC in a month.

                                 ALI
                        Good - see you then, then. Then.

                                 JO
                        Yeah, see you then.

           She turns and walks away trying to mask her disappointment.

                                 ALI
                        Wait, President Brooks, is it 
                        alright if I email you?

                                 JO
                             (turning back)
                        I don't think that would be a good 
                        idea.

                                 ALI
                             (a bit stung)
                        Right.

                                 JO
                        Freedom of Information Act.
                                 ALI
                        Oh, makes sense.  Might I call you, 
                        then?

                                 JO
                             (masking her giddiness)
                        That’s how it’s usually done, Prime 
                        Minister.

                                 MAX
                        Bush and Blair used to talk every 
                        week.

                                 ALI
                        So I'll call you.

                                 JO
                        Good.

           ALI walks towards the helicopter.

                                 ALI
                             (calling back)
                        Oh and President Brooks - excellent 
                        Meatloaf.

           Jo smirks to herself as the helicopter flies away, then 
           immediately snaps back into her presidential persona.  

                                 JO
                        So who am I meeting with first?

                                 MAX
                        When did they serve meatloaf?

           THINKING ABOUT EACH OTHER MONTAGE

           MUSIC SUGGESTION: WOMANIZER, LILY ALLEN VERSION

           -- JO is sitting in the Oval Office trying to do work.  She 
           looks at her calendar: 4 days since the G8. She stares 
           anxiously at the phone. 

           -- ALI is shaving in the morning in his bathroom.

                                 ALI
                             (to the mirror)
                        Hey, President Brooks. It’s Ali. 
                        What’s up? (To himself) Christ, are 
                        you 12?”

           -- ALI is shaving a different morning.
                                 ALI
                             (to mirror)
                        President Brooks, hi. It’s me, Ali. 
                        I know this great Chinese place by 
                        the Hague, if you’re interested. 

           He shakes his head, frustrated and defeated.

           -- ALI is shaving yet another morning.

                                 ALI
                             (to mirror)
                        Hey President Brooks. Can I call 
                        you Jo? (beat) Great. So I’ve been 
                        jerking off to you a lot lately. 

           He bangs his head against the mirror.

           -- JO watches the Prime Minister Questions on BBC with a 
           carton of Haagen-Dasz and tries to ignore her silent phone.

           -- ALI is shaving a different morning. 

                                 ALI
                             (to mirror)
                        Hi, yeah. Just calling to say I’m 
                        not really in a relationship head-
                        space right now. I’m going to be 
                        pulling a lot of late nights in the 
                        office...

           -- ALI is shaving a different morning.

                                 ALI
                             (to mirror, earnestly)
                        Hi, Jo, it’s Ali.  I uh can’t stop 
                        thinking about you. (beat) What the 
                        fuck am I doing?

           Just then a half-naked MODEL, female, 22, languidly walks 
           into the bathroom and kisses ALI’s neck.  

                                 MODEL
                        I’ll call you when I get back from 
                        Milan.

           ALI smiles weakly. Then kisses her. 

           -- JO is in the office late.  She picks up the phone to call 
           ALI herself, but then puts it down. 

           END OF MONTAGE
           EXT. D.C. - DAY

           JO is running with an entourage of secret service men.  
           Amongst them are the guy who holds the nuclear football, 
           FOOTBALL DAN, 35, his face never changes expression in that 
           military sort of way, and AGENT TOM, 30, equally stoic.

                                 JO
                        Major?

                                 FOOTBALL DAN
                        Yes, ma’am. 

                                 JO
                        I need a guy's perspective on 
                        something. 

                                 FOOTBALL DAN
                        Yes, ma’am. 

                                 JO
                        One of my advisors - a woman - went 
                        out with this guy.

                                 FOOTBALL DAN
                        Yes, ma’am. 

                                 JO
                        Who sort of has a reputation for 
                        being a...ladies man.

                                 FOOTBALL DAN
                        Uh oh, ma’am.

                                 JO
                        No, but he wasn't like that with 
                        her. And at the end of the night 
                        they sort of, um, kissed.

                                 FOOTBALL DAN
                        With tongue, ma’am?

                                 JO
                        Yes, Major, with tongue.

                                 FOOTBALL DAN
                        Good sign, ma'am.  More passionate 
                        than without.
                                 JO
                        Good, yes, I thought so.  So, 
                        anyway, he told my advisor that he 
                        would call her.  

                                 FOOTBALL DAN
                        And he hasn't called, ma'am.

                                 JO
                        Exactly. What does that mean?

                                 AGENT TOM
                             (who has been listening)
                        Time elapsed, ma’am?

                                 JO
                        Just 2 weeks. 2 and a half weeks. 

                                 FOOTBALL DAN 
                        If I may venture a hypothesis, 
                        ma'am: it seems said man is not 
                        very into said advisor.

                                 JO
                        No way.  He just doesn't want to 
                        come off as too eager.

                                 AGENT TOM
                        The rule of thumb is to wait 4800 
                        hours, ma'am.  Not two weeks.

                                 JO
                        But maybe he's intimidated! She's a 
                        very impressive...advisor. Maybe 
                        he's scared of all the emotions 
                        he's feeling.

                                 FOOTBALL DAN
                        With all due respect, ma'am, that's 
                        something women say to make 
                        themselves feel better. 

                                 AGENT TOM
                        Especially ugly women, ma'am.

           Jo tries to brush off the unintended insult.

           INT. PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE - DAY

           ALI picks up his phone confidently and dials. 
                                 WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR O.S. 
                        White House Operator, how may I 
                        direct your call?

           Just then SIMON walks in. 

                                 ALI
                        Hello, hi, can I have the President 
                        of the United States please?

           SIMON looks at ALI like, “what are you doing?”

                                 WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR O.S.
                        Who may I say is calling?

                                 ALI
                        Uh yes....This is.....

                                 WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR O.S.
                        Hello?

                                 ALI
                        Sorry, this is Al...ton John.

                                 WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR O.S.
                             (dubious)
                        Elton John?

                                 ALI
                        Sir Elton Joh, actually. Singer of 
                        such songs as Rocketman and Bennie 
                        and the Jets.

           DIAL TONE.

                                 SIMON
                        Did you just prank call the White 
                        House?

                                 ALI
                        Maybe.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           JO jogs in, still in her running outfit, dripping with sweat.  

                                 JO
                        Connor? Did I get any calls?
                                 CONNOR
                        Newt called to confirm you brunch 
                        on Thursday. Oh and Nelson Mandela 
                        called.  Again.

                                 JO
                             (disappointed)
                        Great, thanks. 

                                 CONNOR
                        And not to point fingers because I 
                        know he was unfairly imprisoned in 
                        a South African jail, but I didn’t 
                        appreciate the tone he used with me 
                        on the phone. 

           INT. PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE - DAY

           The scene picks up where the last one left off with SIMON 
           staring in disbelief at ALI.

                                 SIMON
                        Ali, what’s going on?

                                 ALI
                        Right so there is something I've 
                        been meaning to tell you that is 
                        really not a big deal.

                                 SIMON
                        Who did you sleep with?

                                 ALI
                        No one.  Well alright....Look there 
                        is this American girl - woman - who 
                        I sort of had a thing with back in 
                        college and now she happens to work 
                        in the White House.

                                 SIMON
                        Is she blackmailing you?

                                 ALI
                        What? No. Not at all.  But anyway, 
                        she was at the G8 summit and we 
                        kind of kissed.  And that's it.

                                 SIMON
                        Just kissing?
                                 ALI
                        A little breast-fondling.  Barely 
                        2nd base.  Totally not a big deal.

                                 SIMON
                        Jesus Alistair. Don't tell me you 
                        got with some aide to the 
                        president.  The tabloids will have 
                        a field day if this gets out.

                                 ALI
                        No.  I didn't.

                                 SIMON
                        Well then who the hell is it? Who's 
                        the girl?

                                 ALI
                        The President.

                                 SIMON
                        I can't breathe.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           JO is still in her running outfit as she sits behind the 
           desk. A very concerned-looking MAX walks in.

                                 MAX
                        There’s a problem with H.R. 4600. 
                        Finley and Harris are threatening 
                        to vote present.  

                                 JO
                        I made out with the Prime Minister 
                        of Great Britain.

           Long beat.

                                 MAX
                        There is some alternate definition 
                        of “made out” that I just can't 
                        think of at the moment, right?

                                 JO
                        I french-kissed the Prime Minister 
                        of Great Britain.

           A young SPEECHWRITER sticks his head into the office.  
                                 SPEECHWRITER
                        Madame President do you want to 
                        lead with school vouchers?

           JO and MAX glare at the SPEECHWRITER who sheepishly leaves. 

                                 MAX
                        When?

                                 JO
                        At the G8.

                                 MAX
                        Jesus Christ. That night. I knew it 
                        was a bad idea.

                                 JO
                        No - look, I actually think it's a 
                        good thing.  We dispelled all of 
                        the sexual tension and now we can 
                        just be good old-fashioned allies.

                                 MAX
                        Did anyone see you?

                                 JO
                        No.

                                 MAX
                        Do you understand what will happen 
                        to this administration if anyone 
                        finds out about this?

                                 JO
                        No one is going to find out, Max.  
                        He's not a kiss-and-tell.

                                 MAX
                        How do you know that?

                                 JO
                        I slept with him in college.

                                 MAX
                        Of course - Well that makes me feel 
                        a lot better. Do you realize what a 
                        conflict of interest this is?

                                 JO
                        Jesus Christ, Max, you're acting 
                        like I slept with Kim Jung Ill.  
                        It's England, for godssake. We're 
                        supposed to get along.
                                 MAX
                        Yes, you are supposed to sign 
                        treaties...not stick your tongues 
                        in each other's mouths.

           INT. PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE - DAY

                                 ALI
                        I think you're making a bigger deal 
                        of this than it is.

                                 SIMON
                        This is not the Hapsburg Dynasty.  
                        Leaders of countries don't date 
                        each other.

                                 ALI
                        Oh god, we're not dating. It was 
                        just a kiss.

                                 SIMON
                        Oh brilliant - you're just going to 
                        kiss the leader of the free world 
                        and then conveniently lose her 
                        phone number.

                                 ALI
                        I mean she's not really my type.  
                        She's a little too career-woman…

                                 SIMON
                        This is such a fucking disaster.  
                        Any way this plays out we are 
                        screwed.  You know why? Because 
                        every time you stick your penis in 
                        a woman - she ends up hating your 
                        bloody guts.

                                 ALI
                        That's not fair.

                                 SIMON
                        You're not on speaking terms with 
                        any of your exes - but at least 
                        none of them had nuclear programs.  
                        You piss off Jo Brooks, forget to 
                        send her flowers on her birthday 
                        and suddenly there's a mushroom 
                        cloud over Buckingham palace.
                                 ALI
                        Look, I'm sorry. I fucked up.  But 
                        I promise - it won’t happen again.

                                 SIMON
                             (suddenly realizing)
                        But what if she wants it to happen 
                        again? What if she actually has 
                        feelings for you.

                                 ALI
                        She doesn't.

                                 SIMON
                        You opened this can of worms, 
                        Alistair, now you owe it to your 
                        country to see it through. Whatever 
                        Jo Brooks wants, Jo Brooks gets and 
                        if that means your sexy body then 
                        you need to suck it up and spread 
                        your legs.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           We see various members of the staff readying the White House 
           for a State Dinner: flower arrangements being set, lavish 
           linens ironed, expensive silverware polished, etc.

                                 TV ANCHOR O.S.
                        In other news, UK Prime Minister, 
                        Alistair Chadwick, will be arriving 
                        in DC this afternoon for day one of 
                        the three-day summit. 

           INT. JO’S BEDROOM - SAME

           JO is in the middle of trying on pants suits. She stares at 
           herself critically in the mirror and disrobes. Again.

           On the tv the news anchor continues her broadcast.  

                                 TV ANCHOR O.S.
                        This evening a state dinner will be 
                        held at the White House in his 
                        honor. 

           JO’s room is a mess of rejected pants suits: each virtually 
           identical to the next. The scene is one part teenage girl, 
           one part Inspector Gadget.
           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - LATER

           JO stands nervously next to MAX -- in a pants suit -- as 
           ALI’s motorcade approaches the White House entrance. 

                                 MAX
                        Are you wearing lip gloss?

                                 JO
                        No.

           As ALI gets out of the limo, he and JO awkwardly greet each 
           other amid cameras flashing -- like exes who just ran into 
           each other at Barnes & Noble.  

                                 JO
                             (through fake smile for 
                              the press)
                        Welcome.

                                 ALI
                        President Brooks, so good to see 
                        you again.

                                 JO
                        You remember my Chief of Staff, Max 
                        Wolf.

                                 ALI
                        Oh right. Yes. Hello.

                                 MAX
                        Welcome, Prime Minister.

                                 ALI
                        And my 2nd in command - Simon 
                        Graham.

                                 JO
                        How could I forget?

                                 SIMON
                        Thank you for your hospitality, 
                        Madame President. (leaning closer) 
                        The Prime Minister is eager to 
                        repay your hospitality any way he 
                        can.  As am I - if that should 
                        interest you. I'm guessing not. No 
                        pressure - just putting it out 
                        there.
                                 JO
                             (confused)
                        Right.

           Tension fills the air as they head toward the collonade.  

                                 ALI
                        So how have you been?

                                 JO
                        Good.

                                 ALI
                        Good.

                                 JO
                        Really good.

                                 ALI
                        Great.

                                 JO
                        Busy.

                                 ALI
                        Me too.

                                 JO
                        Really busy.

                                 ALI
                        Tell me about it. 

           Silence.

                            JO
           So how has...
                                                           ALI
                                              So what have.....

                                 JO
                        Sorry what?

                                 ALI
                        No you go.

                                 JO
                        No you.

                                 ALI
                        I don't even remember what I was 
                        going to say.

           SIMON and MAX look like they are going to kill themselves.
                                 SIMON
                             (to MAX)
                        Lovely house. So much whiter in 
                        person.

           Silence. 

                                 JO
                        I hope you don't mind they stuck us 
                        at the singles table.

                                 ALI
                        Actually I'm bringing a date.

                                 JO
                        Me too.  I just meant we're sitting 
                        at a single table, as opposed to 
                        pushing two together.

                                 ALI
                        Right.

                                 JO
                        Great well. I actually have to go 
                        talk to Congress about something.

           JO and MAX walk away, leaving SIMON and ALI alone.

                                 SIMON
                        We are so fucked.  That was more 
                        awkward than losing my virginity. I 
                        don’t care what you have to do -- 
                        just fix this!

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           JO is alone with MAX, fuming.

                                 JO
                        Who the hell is the Prime Minister 
                        bringing as a date?

                                 MAX
                        Why does it matter?

                                 JO
                        There is no way that he is bringing 
                        a date - and I'm going alone.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JO (cont'd)
                        Because then all of the sudden 
                        instead of looking like the leader 
                        of the free world - I look like 
                        that girl at the prom who couldn't 
                        get a date.

           The PRESS SECRETARY walks in.  

                                 PRESS SECRETARY
                        Did you hear Chadwick's bringing 
                        Odessa to the state dinner? Lucky 
                        bastard.

                                 JO
                        The model?

                                 PRESS SECRETARY
                        Hell no.  The super model. The 
                        press wants to know what you're 
                        wearing tonight.

                                 JO
                        Clothes.

                                 PRESS SECRETARY
                        Works for me.

           PRESS SECRETARY leaves. 

                                 JO
                        He's bringing a super model to my 
                        state dinner? Connor?!

                                 CONNOR
                             (walking in)
                        Yes, Madame President.

                                 JO
                        I'm going to need a date for 
                        tonight.

                                 CONNOR
                             (taking out notepad)
                        Right away, Madame President.  Is 
                        there any particular site you'd 
                        like me to use?

                                 JO
                        What?

                                 CONNOR
                        My friend met his fiancé on jdate. 
                                 MAX
                        Madame President don't you think 
                        you might be overreacting a tad? 

                                 JO
                        Overreacting? This is a classic 
                        power play.  He's trying to 
                        undermine me just like Krushchev 
                        did with Kennedy in Cuba. He's 
                        started a nuclear arm candy race 
                        with me - and I need a fucking 
                        Hydrogen bomb to trump his super 
                        model.  (to CONNOR) What 
                        celebrities have been trying to 
                        meet with me?

                                 CONNOR
                             (looking through notepad)
                        Let's see. Ooh Harvey Keitel has 
                        been wanting to talk to you about 
                        guns. I love him.

                                 JO
                        No.

                                 CONNOR
                        Paul Giamatti - global warming.

                                 JO
                        No.

                                 CONNOR
                        Steve Buscemi - child labor laws.

                                 JO
                        No.

                                 CONNOR
                        Gilbert Gottfried - Jewish stuff.

                                 JO
                        For Christ's sake - there must be 
                        some good-looking celebrity who 
                        wants to meet with the President of 
                        the United States.

                                 CONNOR
                        I'll make some calls.

           CONNOR leaves. 
                                 MAX
                        Tell me this is not about what 
                        happened at the G8?

                                 JO
                        This isn't personal, Max, it's 
                        political.  And in politics, it’s 
                        the small stuff that matters.  When 
                        Reagan met Gorbachev for the first 
                        time at the height of the Cold War, 
                        Reagan decided at the very last 
                        minute not to wear a coat.  

                                 MAX
                        Madame President....

                                 JO
                        So Gorbachev drives up, gets out of 
                        his motorcade only to be met by 
                        Reagan - 20 years his senior - out 
                        in the dead of winter in only a 
                        light suit.  Suddenly it was the 
                        Russian president - bundled from 
                        head-to-toe - who looked like the 
                        weak old man next to Reagan.  And 
                        that image was on the front page of 
                        every newspaper in the world. 
                        (showing him the photo) Reagan won 
                        the Cold War because he knew when 
                        to take off his coat. Now get me a 
                        fucking date.

           MAX stares at the president dubiously as CONNOR sticks his 
           head back in the office. 

                                 JUDY
                        Madame President, guess who has 
                        been dying to talk to you about 
                        genocide!!??

           INT. WHITE HOUSE RECEPTION ROOM - EVENING

           ALI is dressed in a tux talking to SIMON and ODESSA, 23, who 
           is gorgeous yet dull, never having gone through that awkward 
           stage in childhood which forces you to develop a personality. 

           Suddenly ALI looks up and sees JO at the head of the stairs 
           looking radiant in a strapless ballgown.  Their eyes meet in 
           slow-motion, and they smile at each other, until ALI’s smile 
           abruptly disappears. Standing next to JO in a shiny new 
           tuxedo is her H-Bomb: GEORGE MOTHA FUCKIN CLOONEY. 
           JO smirks at ALI like, “It’s on, bitch.”

                                 JO
                        Prime Minister, I'd like to 
                        introduce you to George. Clooney.

                                 CLOONEY
                        Great to meet you.

                                 ALI
                        The pleasure's all mine.  Oh sorry 
                        this is Odessa.

                                 ODESSA
                        You're so much prettier in person.

                                 JO
                        Thanks. I understand you are a 
                        model.

                                 ALI
                        A super model.

                                 JO
                        What an important job.

                                 ODESSA
                        Thanks.

                                 JO
                        Now do you have to study to learn 
                        to get your picture taken?

                                 ODESSA
                        No, I'm just naturally good at it.

                                 JO
                        Fascinating.

                                 ALI
                        George I didn't realize you were 
                        friendly with the president.

                                 CLOONEY
                        I'm not really.  I came by to talk 
                        to her about the crisis in Darfur 
                        and she asked me to stay on for the 
                        reception.

                                 ALI
                        Dinner and genocide - sounds like a 
                        wonderful evening.
                                 JO
                        And the night is still young.

           JO takes CLOONEY aside. 

                                 JO
                        This may sound a little - very - 
                        creepy.  But I would really 
                        appreciate it if you would flirt 
                        with me tonight.

                                 CLOONEY
                        I thought I was here to talk to you 
                        about ethnic cleansing?

                                 JO
                        You are.  Totally.  In addition to 
                        that if you could pretend that you 
                        are extremely attracted to me - 
                        that would be amazing.

                                 CLOONEY
                        Why?

                                 JO
                        Let's just say I have a diplomatic 
                        issue that could really use your 
                        help.

                                 CLOONEY
                        And what about my diplomatic issue?

                                 JO
                        10 million more in relief aid.

                                 CLOONEY
                        Let's go flirt.

           INT. STATE DINNER - LATER

           JO, CLOONEY, MAX, SIMON, ALI, and ODESSA are all seated 
           around the center table.  

           JO is about to unfold her napkin, when CLOONEY stops her, 
           sensually grabs the napkin from her hand and lays the napkin, 
           secuctively onto her lap. 

                                 JO
                        Thank you.
                                 CLOONEY
                        Madame President, has anyone told 
                        you how beautiful you look?

           ALI rolls his eyes. MAX rolls his eyes. SIMON nods like a 
           giddy schoolgirl. 

                                 SIMON
                        Thinking the exact same thing, 
                        myself, actually. Stunning.

                                 JO
                             (giggling)
                        No one named George Clooney.

                                 CLOONEY
                        You know who is so jealous I am 
                        here with you tonight?

                                 JO/SIMON
                        Who?

                                 CLOONEY
                        Brad.

                                 ALI
                        Pitt?!

                                 SIMON
                        Knew it. As soon as you said Brad, 
                        I thought must be Pitt.

                                 JO
                        Stop it.

                                 MAX
                             (to JO)
                        Yeah, stop it.

                                 JO
                             (to CLOONEY)
                        Don't stop.

                                 CLOONEY
                        He said - don't tell Angie, but 
                        I've had a crush on President 
                        Brooks since she was Governor of 
                        Illinois.

                                 MAX
                        New York.
                                 SIMON
                             (raising his hand)
                        Guilty.

           ALI looks at SIMON like “what the hell are you doing?”

                                 ALI
                        Odessa was just on the cover of 
                        Maxim.

                                 ODESSA
                        They named me the 2nd most 
                        attractive woman in the world. 
                        (pissed) I'm like thanks a lot.

                                 JO
                        What a slap in the face.

                                 SIMON
                        Well beauty fades. Doesn't it? I'm 
                        just saying.

                                 CLOONEY
                             (to Jo)
                        I know I probably shouldn't bring 
                        it up now.

                                 JO
                        No.  Do. Now is good.

                                 SIMON
                        Yeah, come on - let's hear it.

                                 CLOONEY
                        Have you ever stayed in a villa in 
                        Italy?

                                 SIMON
                        Oh I know where this is going.

                                 MAX
                             (unhappy)
                        So do I.

                                 JO
                        Not with George Clooney.

                                 CLOONEY
                        I've got 28 rooms that overlook 
                        Lake Cuomo.

                                 JO
                        I've read.
                                 CLOONEY
                        How would you like to experience?

           JO giggles.

                                 ALI
                        I thought you two were supposed to 
                        be talking about Darfur?

                                 SIMON
                        They can talk about anything they 
                        like now, can’t they?

                                 ALI
                             (whispered to Simon)
                        What are you doing?

                                 SIMON
                             (whispered)
                        Kissing America's ass like you 
                        should be doing. If she's dating 
                        George Clooney that means she's 
                        over you and we are out of the hot 
                        seat.

                                 CLOONEY
                        I'll tell you the truth. The only 
                        reason I got into humanitarian 
                        causes was as an excuse to meet 
                        President Brooks.

                                 JO
                        Call me Jo.

                                 CLOONEY
                             (intimately)
                        Jo.

           She giggles again. Simon giggles too.

                                 ALI
                        Odessa is a Victoria Secret Model.

                                 MAX
                        That's so great.

                                 ODESSA
                        I'm an angel.

                                 SIMON
                        But not really. You're not really 
                        an angel like in the bible. You're 
                        more of a bra and underwear angel.
                                 ALI
                        That's how we met.  I saw her in a 
                        magazine.

                                 SIMON
                        How mail-order-bride.

                                 ODESSA
                        My agent set us up.

                                 JO
                        Aww.

                                 MAX
                        Well I for one am glad to see that 
                        the Prime Minister is now attached.

                                 SIMON
                        Oh God - not even close.(whispered) 
                        I doubt he calls her tomorrow. 

                                 MAX
                             (clenched teeth)
                        They look pretty happy to me.

                                 JO
                             (whispered to Max)
                        What the hell are you doing?

                                 MAX
                             (whispered to Jo)
                        Saving your presidency. If the 
                        Prime Minister is taken that means 
                        he won’t go after you.

                                 CLOONEY
                        Madame President, would you like to 
                        dance?

                                 JO
                        I'd love to, George Clooney.

                                 ALI
                        If you excuse me, George, I feel I 
                        ought to have the first dance. 
                        After all this is our state dinner.

                                 CLOONEY
                             (reluctantly)
                        Be my guest.

           ON THE DANCE FLOOR
           JO and ALI dance with fake smiles plastered on their faces 
           for the crowd.

                                 ALI
                        I've been meaning to apologize.

                                 JO
                        For what?

                                 ALI
                        Kissing you.

                                 JO
                        No need to apologize.

                                 ALI
                        I don't know what I was thinking.

                                 JO
                        You didn't kiss me.

                                 ALI
                        I'm sorry?

                                 JO
                        I kissed you. I don't know what got 
                        into me.

                                 ALI
                        Ha ha.  Yeah right.

                                 JO
                        Excuse me?

                                 ALI
                        Remember it however you like, but 
                        the fact is I kissed you.

                                 JO
                        I'll remember it the way it 
                        happened. I had one too many shots 
                        and I...took advantage of you.

                                 ALI
                        Took advantage of me?

                                 JO
                        Yes.

                                 ALI
                        Correct me if I'm wrong - but I'm 
                        pretty sure it was my hand on your 
                        breast.
                                 JO
                        You mean, my breast on your hand.

                                 ALI
                        Huh?

                                 JO
                        Agree to disagree.

                                 ALI
                        Fine. Whatever.

           The dance in tense silence. Suddenly ALI begins to laugh. 

                                 JO
                        What?

                                 ALI
                        Our dates seem to be hitting it 
                        off.

           They look over to see CLOONEY and ODESSA cuddled up, 
           flirtatiously next to each other. 

                                 JO
                        Fucking George Clooney.

           AGENT TOM taps JO on the shoulder. 

                                 AGENT TOM
                        Madame President, Prime Minister, 
                        We have a problem.

                                 JO
                        Please tell me World War III just 
                        broke out and I have to leave this 
                        god-forsaken dinner.

                                 AGENT TOM
                        A water main burst at the Blair 
                        House where Prime Minister Chadwick 
                        is staying.  We need to find other 
                        accommodations immediately.

                                 JO
                        So a hotel.

                                 AGENT TOM
                        There's no time to do a proper 
                        security sweep, ma’am.

                                 ALI
                        Well, where then.....
           INT. JO’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           JO is asleep in a familiar mound under her covers, when she 
           is suddenly jolted awake by the sound of Coldplay blasting 
           from the kitchen.  

           INT. RESIDENCE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           JO, dressed in only a bathroom, eyes wincing from the light, 
           appears at the doorway to the kitchen looking like she wants 
           to kill a certain prime minister. ALI, meanwhile, is dressed 
           and merrily making breakfast as he rocks out to the radio.

                                 JO
                        Can you turn that down? I was up 
                        all night with Pakistan.

                                 ALI
                        Oh sorry. (turning radio off) 
                        Breakfast will be ready in 3 
                        minutes.

                                 JO
                        You’re cooking?

                                 ALI
                        To thank you for letting me stay 
                        here. 

                                 JO
                        You really didn’t have to.

                                 ALI
                        Nonsense. Scrambled eggs and...oh 
                        fuck.   

           ALI pulls a black mass from the smoking toaster. 

                                 ALI
                        This is actually toast - not an 
                        attempt to burn down the White 
                        House.  

                                 JO
                        Wouldn't be the first time.

                                 ALI
                        Pardon?
                                 JO
                        Anglo-American War.  The British 
                        set fire to the White House.

                                 ALI
                        And here I am trying to get back 
                        onto the right foot.

           The fire alarm goes off and the secret service comes rushing 
           in and foams the toaster, eggs, and Prime Minister.

                                 AGENT TOM
                        Are you alright, ma’am?

                                 JO
                             (amused at the scene)
                        Fine, thanks, Tom.

           AGENT TOM leaves. ALI stares at his foam-covered shirt.

                                 ALI
                        I never liked this shirt anyway. 
                        Too expensive.

           JO laughs and tries not to notice the Prime Minister’s toned 
           body as he unbuttons his soiled shirt.

                                 JO
                        I'm sorry about breakfast.  That 
                        was really sweet of you. 

           As ALI pulls his arms out of one of the sleeves he winces in 
           pain.

                                 ALI
                             (rubbing his arm)
                        Those receiving lines kill me.
                        They don't warn you about how many 
                        hands you have to shake.  

                                 JO
                        I used to have to ice mine after.  
                        Now I just put on a little Bengay.

                                 ALI
                        And here I thought I'd sufficiently 
                        built up my right arm strength.

                                 JO
                             (rolling her eyes)
                        Come here.

           JO begins to massage ALI’s arm, as platonically as possible.
                                 JO
                        One time Lincoln spent three hours 
                        in a receiving line before signing 
                        this important bill.  But by the 
                        time he gets to the bill, his arm’s 
                        so exhausted from shaking people’s 
                        hands he can barely hold the pen. 
                        Poor Abe was afraid that if his 
                        signature was wobbly that history 
                        would somehow infer that Lincoln 
                        was ambivalent about the 
                        legislation. Lucky for him the 
                        signature turned out fine.  

                                 ALI
                        Huh. What bill was it?

                                 JO
                        The Emancipation Proclamation.

           MAX and SIMON walk in on this flirtatious scene.

                                 MAX/SIMON
                        Oh fuck.

           The two men turn to each other wondering how much the other 
           knows.

           INT. WEST WING - MOMENTS LATER

           MAX and JO walk down the hallway towards the Oval.

                                 MAX
                        Well you two seem to be getting 
                        along well.

                                 JO
                        Max.  There's nothing going on. He 
                        made me eggs.

                                 MAX
                        Just remember this isn't just your 
                        job you're risking here.

                                 JO
                        For God's sake Kennedy used to have 
                        the Situation Room coordinate his 
                        mistresses.  He cooked me eggs.  
                        End of discussion. 
           INT. US BRITISH EMBASSY - MORNING

           ALI is at a morning reception at his embassy.  A gaggle of 
           hot women are clustered around him, like silicone vultures.

                                 HOT WASPY WOMAN
                             (stroking her pearls)
                        Prime Minister, I hope you are 
                        enjoying your time in D.C.

                                 ALI
                        Oh yes.  Definitely.

                                 HOT WASPY WOMAN
                        Let me know if you need a tour 
                        guide.

                                 HOT TWINS
                        Or three.

           SIMON interrupts the four-some, shooing the women away.

                                 SIMON
                        How did it go with Brooks?

                                 ALI
                        Good. All patched up.

                                 SIMON
                        Did you sleep with her?

                                 ALI
                        No. We're just friends.  Allies.

           A BIG-BREASTED WOMAN approaches ALI.

                                 BIG-BREASTED WOMAN 
                        Welcome to America, Prime Minister. 

                                 SIMON
                        Jesus Christ, are there only women 
                        at this luncheon?

           A roomful of women stare ravenously at the Prime Minister.

                                 SIMON
                        Fabulous. (to big-breasted woman) 
                        He’s gay, I’m afraid. So...

           She walks away.
                                 SIMON
                        Look, I hate to be the bearer of 
                        bad news, but we got some new 
                        approval numbers this morning.

                                 ALI
                        Bad?

                                 SIMON
                        Somewhere between abysmal and 
                        horrendous.  People don't take you 
                        seriously, Ali.  You were supposed 
                        to put a fresh face on the 
                        Conservative Party - not turn 
                        Downing Street into Studio 54.  

           SIMON shows ALI todays newspaper: PRIME MINISTER BRINGS 
           LINGERIE MODEL TO WHITE HOUSE.

                                 ALI
                        I was trying to make clear to Jo 
                        that we're just friends. Not leave 
                        any room for ambiguity.

                                 SIMON
                        Ali, you are a spoiled, horny 
                        little fuck-up - but I wouldn't be 
                        working for you if I didn't think 
                        you had the potential to be a great 
                        Prime Minister.  Where's the 
                        passionate, innovative politician I 
                        helped get into parliament?

           Across the room two women wave at ALI seductively, then begin 
           to make-out with each other. 

                                 ALI
                             (like an addict trying to 
                              resist crack)
                        You’re right. You’re right. 

           INT. CABINET ROOM - LATER

           JO, MAX, ALI, and SIMON are seated around the table along 
           with other members of JO’s staff.

                                 MAX
                        And, of course, we look forward to 
                        working with your administration to 
                        continue the initiatives put in 
                        place by Prime Minister Lloyd.
                                 SIMON
                        As do we.  Couldn't have said it 
                        better. Ditto completely.

                                 JO
                        Great well I'm glad we're all on 
                        the same page.

                                 ALI
                        With all due respect, I don't think 
                        we are on the same page.

           Suddenly the room is filled with tension.

                                 SIMON
                        I think the Prime Minister just 
                        means we are on the page right next 
                        to yours - like in a book.

                                 ALI
                        I understood the metaphor, Simon. 
                        I'm saying, I'm not interested in 
                        continuing the policies of Lloyd - 
                        because they are crap.

                                 SIMON
                        Ali’s just...his mom died today 
                        so....

                                 ALI
                        No, she didn’t. 

                                 SIMON
                        Remember?

                                 ALI
                        Look, I have no idea how long I'll 
                        be prime minister. But however long 
                        I do have this job, I intend to 
                        spend working on legislation that 
                        actually has a chance in hell of 
                        making a difference.  My father and 
                        Lloyd made decisions based off of 
                        poll numbers - I'm not going to 
                        make that same mistake.

                                 JO
                             (intrigued)
                        What are you proposing?

                                 ALI
                        As you know, the Kyoto Protocol is 
                        about to expire.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALI (cont'd)
                        So let's write a new emissions 
                        contract - one that actually 
                        matters.  One that America will 
                        actually get behind.

                                 JO
                        What do you want?

                                 ALI
                        A 50% reduction by 2020.

                                 JO
                        Impossible.

                                 SIMON
                        Do I hear 25?

                                 JO
                        In case you forgot, Prime Minister, 
                        I'm a Republican.  Half of my 
                        constituents don't even believe 
                        global warming exists.

                                 ALI
                        But you do. 

           JO studies him for a moment. 

                                 JO
                        Politics is the art of what's 
                        possible - not what's best.

                        Politics is the art of what's

                        (beat) From where I sit, the single 
                        biggest threat to our world is not 
                        Al Quaeda: it's us.  It's our 
                        addiction to fossil fuels.  We are 
                        heating the world up at such a rate 
                        that pretty soon England is going 
                        to feel like Club Med.  If it's 
                        people's pocketbooks you need to 
                        appeal to - then tell them that 
                        Hurricanes Katrina and Rita alone 
                        have cost them almost $100 billion 
                        dollars in damages. And those 
                        storms are going to keep getting 
                        worse unless we do something now.

                        I'd need a two-thirds majority in 
                        the Senate which means swaying at 
                        least 17 Republicans.  And 
                        unfortunately the environment is 
                        just not a Conservative issue.

                        Ronald Reagan, actually. (beat) The 
                        environment used to be a 
                        conservative issue - it can be 
                        again.  Who better than the darling 
                        of the GOP to lead the charge?

                        just thinking about it.  Tough - 
                        serious - and right on point.  I 
                        knew there was some reason I wanted 
                        you running a country.  Now if we 
                        could only cut your dick off you 
                        could be Winston bloody Churchill.

           MAX is pacing, as JO calmly sits at her desk.

                                 MAX
                        This is political suicide.  You're 
                        going to completely alienate the 
                        base - not to mention you can kiss 
                        Michigan's electoral votes goodbye.
                                 JO
                        There’s only two ways you become a 
                        great president, Max: do something 
                        really big - or get shot. This is 
                        our chance for the history books.

                                 MAX
                        Oh we will definitely be history, 
                        Madame President.

                                 JO
                        I've got two years under my belt 
                        and nothing to show for it.  My 
                        only real achievement as president 
                        is being the first female to hold

                        I were a man, would I be

                        If you were a man, you wouldn't 
                        have been nominated.  The 
                        Republicans needed someone they 
                        could run against Hillary.

                        believe in affirmative action.  
                        (beat) This is my chance to do 
                        something important. Our chance.

                                 MAX
                        I'll set up a meeting with Darring. 
                        If you can get him on board, you 
                        might have a chance in hell with 
                        the other Senate Republicans.

                                 JO
                        Great.

           MAX starts to walk out.
                                 JO
                        Oh and Max, why not invite the 
                        Prime Minister to join.  The man's 
                        nothing if not persuasive.

                        So I fear.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - LATER

           JO sits in the couch next to ALI. Across from them is a 
           REPUBLICAN SENATOR, old and southern.  

                                 REPUBLICAN SENATOR
                        Madame President, there is no 
                        conclusive proof that human beings 
                        are causing the world to heat up.  
                        So how can I in good conscience ask 
                        my constituents to stop driving 
                        their SUV’s when it might not make 
                        a lick of difference?

                                 JO
                             (frustrated)
                        Senator, I implore you....

                                 REPUBLICAN SENATOR
                        I'm sorry.

           As the senator gets up to leave, ALI leans into JO.

                                 ALI
                             (to Jo, whispered)
                        You play good leader, I'll play 
                        bad. (broad, like a bad actor) I'm, 
                        sorry President Brooks, but who the 
                        hell doesn't believe humans are 
                        causing global warming? You'd have 
                        to be an imbecile to go against 
                        every leading scientist in the 
                        world.

                                 REPUBLICAN SENATOR
                        Excuse me?

                                 JO
                             (catching on)
                        Now wait just a second, Prime 
                        Minister.  Don't throw your tree-
                        hugging rhetoric at me.
                                 ALI
                             (playing along)
                        I beg your pardon?!

           Senator is intrigued by what's going on.

                                 JO
                        I'll have you know that I'm not 
                        convinced humans are responsible 
                        for global warming either.

                                 REPUBLICAN SENATOR
                        You're not?

                                 JO
                        Could just be cows farting.

                                 REPUBLICAN SENATOR
                        I read that, too.

                                 ALI
                             (still playing along)

                             (feigned indignation)
                        You can tell the rest of the 
                        international community, Prime 
                        Minister, that I'm not supporting 
                        this treaty to protect the 
                        environment, I'm supporting it to 
                        protect America.  Reducing our 
                        dependence on foreign oil is 
                        essential for our national 
                        security.  And I know, Senator, how 
                        deeply you care about our national 
                        security, which is why I am 
                        reaching out to you.

                                 REPUBLICAN SENATOR
                        I wear my 9/11 commemorative pin 
                        every day - even on the weekends.  
                        Show me a Democrat who does that!

                                 JO
                        It's a miracle if they remember a 
                        flag pin.  Which is why I am asking 
                        you, and the other patriotic 
                        Republicans in the Senate to 
                        consider supporting this emissions 
                        treaty when it reaches the Senate.
                                 REPUBLICAN SENATOR
                        I would be honored.

           ALI winks at JO surreptitiously.

           EXT. OVAL OFFICE - LATER

           JO, ALI, and JUDY are sipping champagne, as MAX walks up.

                                 JO
                        Come celebrate with us, Max.

                                 MAX
                        You got Stanley?

                                 JO
                        No. (beat) We got Stanley, 
                        Brenneman, Parks, and Hillhurst.  
                        And the damn treaty hasn't even 
                        been written yet.  I think this 
                        could actually happen.

                                 MAX
                        How did you do it?

                                 ALI
                        It was all her.  She was brilliant.  
                        Absolutely brilliant.

                                 JO
                        So were you. Not bad for a legacy.

                                 MAX
                        Well hate to break up the party, 
                        but you've got your meeting with 
                        AIPEC in two minutes, ma’am.

           As President gets up to leave, she smiles at ALI. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           JO is in her Yale shirt and boxers.  She tip toes to the 
           kitchen so as not to wake ALI. 

           INT. RESIDENCE KITCHEN - SAME

           JO walks in to see ALI wide awake eating a donut and doing 
           some work.  He is only in his boxers. JO stares at him for a 
           moment until he sees her. 
                                 ALI
                        And here I thought you were a 
                        briefs president, not a boxers. 

           She smiles. 

                                 JO
                        Couldn’t sleep? 

                                 ALI
                        You warned me. 

           INT. RESIDENCE - LATER

           JO and ALI are sitting next to each other on an antique couch 
           watching JUDGE JUDY on tv.

                                 ALI
                        Surely he owes her the money for 
                        said sofa.

                                 JO
                        But he said she said it was a 
                        present.

                                 ALI
                        I'm afraid I'm leaning towards 
                        Paquita on this one. 

                                 JO
                        Shall I call Scalia? 

                                 ALI
                        I can't believe this show exists.

                                 JO
                        Hey that's my country you're 
                        knocking.

                                 ALI
                        I mean come on, there must be 
                        something more fun we can do.

           JO thinks to herself then smirks. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE BOWLING ALLEY - LATER

           JO and ALI are bowling, terribly, yet having a blast.  They 
           are both dressed in jeans: jarringly casual compared to their 
           normal uniform of suits. JO opens up a pair of beers which 
           they tap together, in a toast: Sam Adams and Guinness.
           INT. WHITE HOUSE MOVIE THEATHER - LATER

           The two sit next to one another in the otherwise empty 
           theater eating popcorn.   

           Playing on the big screen is a brat pack movie. 

           There’s a moment where they look at each other and it seems 
           like they might kiss, but then they turn away.  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE KITCHEN - LATER

           It’s the wee hours of the morning, and the kitchen is empty.  
           JO and ALI sit in the massive, restaurant-like kitchen and 
           eat a pie together out of the pan.  

           The WHITE HOUSE CHEF walks in, clearly startled by the scene.

                                 WHITE HOUSE CHEF
                        Good morning, Madame President. 

                                 JO
                        Good morning, Greta.

                                 WHITE HOUSE CHEF
                             (confused)
                        Will you be requiring breakfast 
                        this morning?

                                 JO
                        This should be fine. Thank you, 
                        Greta.  (to ALI) Now back to those 
                        trade deals we were discussing.

                                 ALI
                        Ah yes. Britain really must insist 
                        that you give David Beckham back.

           As the chef leaves, JO and ALI dissolve into laughter -- like 
           two kids who just got caught by the teacher.

           Suddenly MAX walks in and stares at the two leaders. 

                                 JO
                        Max! Grab a fork. (seeing Max’s 
                        expression) What happened?

                                 MAX
                        Madame President, you’re needed in 
                        the sit room. 
           JO suddenly flips back into her presidential mode. 

                                 JO
                             (to ALI)
                        Excuse me. 

           INT. RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           ALI is sitting on the couch watching more JUDGE JUDY.  

           JO walks in looking like a soldier returning from a long war.  
           She’s still in the same casual outfit.  

                                 ALI
                        You’re home late...in late.  You’ve 
                        got me absolutely addicted to this 
                        wretched show.

           JO takes a few steps in then starts to cry. Her face looks 
           like a dam breaking, after years of reinforcements.  She 
           tries to stop up the tears, and compose herself in front of 
           ALI, but there are just too many to keep inside anymore. 

                                 ALI
                             (turning tv off)
                        Oh God - what's the matter?

                                 JO
                        It's classified.

                                 ALI
                        Okay.

           There’s a long silence as tears stream down her face. 

                                 JO
                        If you tell anyone I cried, I'll 
                        kick you out of NATO.

                                 ALI
                        I don't think you can do that.

                                 JO
                        Oh god, I can’t stop seeing....

           More silence as JO cries.

                                 JO
                        This job complicates you in ways no 
                        one ever explains.
                                 ALI
                        That's why it takes a great person.

                                 JO
                        It takes a fucked-up person. Great 
                        people don't get elected.

                                 ALI
                        You're being too hard on yourself.

                                 JO
                        If people only knew who they've 
                        really put in this hallowed office 
                        they would be scared to death.  JFK 
                        was a cripple who had to be on 
                        amphetamines every day in office 
                        just so he could stand without 
                        crutches. So basically, the guy in 
                        charge of the Cuban Missile Crisis 
                        was on speed. Teddy Roosevelt was 
                        bipolar.  Coolidge and Lincoln were 
                        clinically depressed. Johnson and 
                        Nixon both suffered from extreme 
                        paranoia.  Not to mention Johnson 
                        enjoyed giving interviews while 
                        taking a shit.  Harrison was 
                        deathly afraid of light switches. 
                        Martin Van Buren used to lace 
                        himself up in a corset everyday.  
                        And of course, not to be outdone, 
                        Jo Brooks made out with the prime 
                        minister of England at the G8.
                        Presidents aren't great men - we 
                        are neurotic, insecure, power-
                        hungry lunatics- who desperately 
                        need 300 million people to give a 
                        shit about us. (beat) what am I 
                        doing? I shouldn't be talking to 
                        you like this.  You could use it 
                        against me.

                                 ALI
                        Jo, I'm your friend.

                                 JO
                        You're my ally. 

                                 ALI
                        So what? Allies are way better than 
                        friends: we actually go to war for 
                        you. And loan you billions of 
                        dollars when you need it. Show me a 
                        friend who would do that.
           Silence. 

                                 JO
                        It’s just.....I’m more comfortable 
                        with crowds than individuals. 
                        Individuals always want to know the 
                        real you. I’d much rather keep 
                        things superficial, truthfully. 

           ALI inching closer. 

                                 ALI
                        Me too.

           They start to kiss.  Suddenly they are taking each other’s 
           clothes off. 

           ALI runs his fingers along her bra. 

                                 JO
                        It opens in the front. 

           He undoes her bra with ease.

                                 ALI
                        I remember. 

           INT. THE QUEEN’S ROOM - LATER

           The two leaders lie naked in bed next to one another.  ALI is 
           running his fingers up and down the side of her body.

                                 JO
                        I see London.

                                 ALI
                        God, you're sexy.

                                 JO
                        This was probably not the best move 
                        on our part.

                                 ALI
                        If it makes you feel any better - 
                        you're not the first president to 
                        see the Prime Minister of Great 
                        Britain naked.

                                 JO
                        What? No. Who?
                                 ALI
                        I can't believe I’ve stumped the 
                        queen of presidential trivia. 

                                 JO
                        Maggie and Ronnie?

                                 ALI
                        Not saying they didn't want to.

                                 JO
                        Who? Come on tell me.

                                 ALI
                        Churchill and FDR.

                                 JO
                        No way.

                                 ALI
                        Churchill came to visit the White 
                        House after World War II and stayed 
                        in this very room, actually: the 
                        Queen's Room. So he's in the middle 
                        of dictating to his secretary butt 
                        naked - something he did often 
                        apparently.

                                 JO
                        Thanks for that visual.

                                 ALI
                        ...When all of the sudden Roosevelt 
                        knocks on the door.  Without 
                        batting an eye, Churchill opens the 
                        door with his crown jewels on full 
                        display and greets the president.  
                        Poor FDR immediately apologizes and 
                        turns to leave when Churchill stops 
                        him and says, “See, Mr. President, 
                        Britain has nothing to hide from 
                        America.” (pulling back the covers) 
                        See Madame President, Britain has 
                        nothing to hide from America.

           They kiss.

                                 JO
                        So what do we do?

                                 ALI
                        I have no idea. I like you. I 
                        really like you, actually.
                                 JO
                        We can't date. People would freak 
                        out.

                                 ALI
                        I know.  But we can be close.  
                        Hell, Britain and America are 
                        supposed to have a “special 
                        relationship” right?

                                 JO
                        “No lover ever studied every whim 
                        of his mistress as I did those of 
                        President Roosevelt.”

                                 ALI
                        Who said that?

                                 JO
                        Churchill.

                                 ALI
                        God, they were a bit gay with each 
                        other, weren't they?

                                 JO
                        No. They loved each other.  I think 
                        it's sweet. When Franklin was 
                        dying, Churchill said to him, “It's 
                        fun to be in the same decade as 
                        you.” I think that's the most 
                        romantic thing I've ever heard.

           They stare at each other for a moment.

                                 ALI
                        This is going to be hard.

                                 JO
                        I know.

           MONTAGE OF ALI AND JO’S CORRESPONDENCE

           -- JO and ALI are talking on the phone -- he in Downing 
           Street, she in the Oval.  They have the happy glow of a 
           couple during the Honeymoon period.

           -- JO and ALI are seated next to one another at the U.N.: 
           United States next to United Kingdom.  They have serious 
           expressions on their faces, but as we pan below the table we 
           see they are playing footsie. 
           -- JO is giving a speech in the British Parliament.  ALI is 
           in the audience looking politely on -- but giving no hint of 
           emotion.  JO stands presidentially at the podium as she reads 
           her speech off of the teleprompter. 

           ON THE TELEPROMPTER
                        “I was a sophomore at Yale when my 
                        hero Ronald Reagan was invited to 
                        speak in front of this very 
                        parliament by another one of my 
                        idols, Margaret Thatcher.”

           Then where the next line of text is supposed to be is 
           inserted.
                        “You look very sexy today.”

           Catching herself before reading the line out loud, JO looks 
           over at ALI who ever so slightly smirks in her direction.  JO 
           continues reading with a slight smile on her face. 

           END OF MONTAGE

                        reduction plan has been met with 
                        enthusiasm by the Democrats, 
                        ironically it has splintered her 
                        own party, many of whom feel 
                        betrayed by the president they 
                        themselves put in the White House.

           We pan out to reveal JO and MAX watching the tv.  

                                 MAX
                        We have to back out.

                                 JO
                        No way.  This is going to be a huge 
                        win for us - we're just feeling the 
                        backlash. It will pass.

                                 MAX
                        There's rumbling from the RNC that 
                        they are thinking of replacing you 
                        on the ticket.
                                 JO
                        I'm the incumbent president.

                                 MAX
                        Some people don't feel you are 
                        truly representing the party.

                                 JO
                        Do you?

                                 MAX
                        Why are you pushing this treaty?

                                 JO
                        Because we need to do something 
                        drastic about the environment.  
                        This is our Cold War, Max. Our 
                        Great Depression.  And it’s time 
                        for the Republicans to get on the 
                        right side of history on this 
                        issue.  Do you think Lincoln would 
                        have sat by and watched ice caps 
                        disappear? 

                                 MAX
                        You didn't care about the 
                        environment until Chadwick brought 
                        it up.

                                 JO
                        That's not true. 

                                 MAX
                        Why are you pushing this treaty?

                                 JO
                        It has nothing to do with him.

           CONNOR sticks his head in.  

                                 CONNOR
                        Madame President?

                                 JO
                        Not now, Connor.

                                 CONNOR
                        A package arrived for you from 
                        Downing Street.

                                 MAX
                             (rolling his eyes)
                        Great.
                                 JO
                        Just put it on my desk, Connor.

                                 CONNOR
                        It already peed on your desk, 
                        ma'am.

           A little English bulldog puppy runs in with a big bow made 
           from the British flag tied around his neck.  A huge smile 
           comes over Jo's face. 

                                 JO
                        It's fine, Max. It's going to be 
                        fine.

           INT. JO’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Jo is still in her suit laying on her bed.

                                 JO
                             (on the phone)
                        Good day?

           INT. ALI’S BEDRROM - NIGHT

           ALI is in bed half-asleep in his boxers. 

                                 ALI
                             (on the phone)
                        Eh.  Long.

           INTERCUT TWO SCENES

                                 JO
                        Tell me about it.  You?

                                 ALI
                        Thwarted a terrorist attack.

                                 JO
                             (non-chalant)
                        That's nice.

                                 ALI
                        You?

                                 JO
                        Vetoed some shit.

                                 ALI
                        Well done. How's Winston?
           The bulldog puppy is snoring next to her on the bed.

                                 JO
                        Amazing. You know Adams had a pet 
                        alligator when he was President.

                                 ALI
                        Wow. A first alligator. (his best 
                        Samuel L. Jackson) “I've had it 
                        with these motherfuckin' alligators 
                        in this motherfuckin' White House.”

                                 JO
                        What?

                                 ALI
                        Nevermind.

                                 JO
                        I'm looking forward to the summit 
                        next week. Be good to see you 
                        again.

                                 ALI
                        I was thinking if you wanted to - 
                        if you were free.  I'll be at 
                        Chequers this weekend.  If you 
                        wanted to come, maybe we could go 
                        prepare for the Summit together.

                                 JO
                        Let me check with Max.

                                 ALI
                        Also, my parents will be there.  
                        It's their 50th anniversary, so....

                                 JO
                        You want me to meet your parents?

                                 ALI
                        No...I mean since you'd be....

           JO smiles to herself.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM - DAY

           The press corps are all shouting to get called on. The PRESS 
           SECRETARY looks more stressed than usual.

                                 W.H. REPORTERS
                        Ben! Ben!
                                 PRESS SECRETARY
                        Neil?

                                 W.H. REPORTER #1
                        Is it true that the Prime Minister 
                        sent the President an English 
                        bulldog for her birthday?

                                 PRESS SECRETARY
                        Yes, he did.  And Winston is 
                        fitting into the White House 
                        nicely.

                                 W.H. REPORTER #2
                        Didn't he also send her flowers on 
                        multiple occasions?

                                 PRESS SECRETARY
                        Britain is one of our most 
                        important allies.  I'm not sure 
                        what you are implying, Len.  That's 
                        it for today, folks. 

           INT. OUTSIDE OF PRESS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           W.H. REPORTER #3 pulls the PRESS SECRETARY aside. 

                                 REPORTER
                        I'm saying this as a courtesy to 
                        you, Ben.  There are rumors 
                        circulating that the Prime Minister 
                        and the President are more than 
                        just colleagues.

                                 PRESS SECRETARY
                        Reagan dealt with that same 
                        bullshit with Thatcher.  They are 
                        close friends, Rob, that's it. And 
                        the only reason there are any 
                        rumors at all is because she 
                        happens to be a woman.  There's 
                        nothing there.

                                 REPORTER
                        I hope for your sake that's true.

           The reporter walks away, leaving the PRESS SECRETARY 
           unnerved. The PRESS SECRETARY grabs MAX as he walks by.

                                 PRESS SECRETARY
                        We need to talk.
           INT. OVAL OFFICE - LATER

           JO is going through some papers on her desk as MAX watches.

                                 JO
                        The Prime Minister invited us to 
                        spend the weekend at Chequers to 
                        prepare for the Earth Summit.

                                 MAX
                        Madame President....

                                 JO
                        He wants me to meet his parents.  
                        What does that mean? I mean that 
                        has to mean something, right? How 
                        many girls have you introduced to 
                        your parents?

                                 MAX
                        Do you want my honest opinion?

                                 JO
                        Of course.

                                 MAX
                        Over the last few months I have 
                        watched the smartest, most 
                        accomplished person I know, the 
                        President of the United States, 
                        turn into an idiotic teenage girl 
                        over a guy she barely knows who 
                        also happens to be the Prime 
                        Minister of Great Britain. If you 
                        keep going with whatever the hell 
                        you two have between you, I can 
                        promise you it's just a matter of 
                        time before you flush your legacy 
                        and mine down the toilet. Do you 
                        understand how this will look to 
                        people? It will confirm every fear 
                        America has about putting a woman 
                        in the highest office in the world.  
                        Oh you can't elect a woman - cause 
                        she'll fall in love with the first 
                        leader who winks at her. (beat) 
                        He's using you, Jo.  You're the 
                        leader of the free world.  And he's 
                        a trophy hunter.  Why else do you 
                        think he's screwed half of the 
                        Victoria Secret catalogue? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAX (cont'd)
                        You're a challenge, a novelty, but 
                        don't delude yourself into thinking 
                        you'll ever be his wife.  

           JO is clearly rattled by MAX’s words.

           EXT. CHEQUERS - DAY

           The presidential helicopter lands on the gorgeous manicured 
           grass.  A massive, house, like something out of a Jane Austen 
           novel, looms majestically in the background. 

           JO is escorted out of the helicopter, and greets ALI and his 
           entourage with an affected formality.

           ON THE GROUNDS

           The two leaders walk next to one another through the garden. 
           Their detail follows behind, just out of earshot.

           JO is distracted and distant, but putting on her best face.

                                 ALI
                        You look great, by the way.

                                 JO
                        No, I feel disgusting. I've been on 
                        a plane....

                                 ALI
                        God I wish I could kiss you.

                                 JO
                        Shhhh.

                                 ALI
                        Cocked-blocked by the secret 
                        service.

           Jo smiles - but you can tell there is a lot on her mind.

                                 JO
                        So, I've got the votes to ratify, 
                        but barely. I've basically spent 
                        all of my political capital....

                                 ALI
                        I know, I saw the latest poll.
                                 JO
                             (a bit bitter)
                        Yeah.  Meanwhile look at you.  
                        Above 50%. Quite a popular guy.

                                 ALI
                        You'll be back there.  I promise.

           They walk in a loaded silence.

                                 JO
                        You didn't call me.

                                 ALI
                        What? When?

                                 JO
                        The other day. You said you’d call.

                                 ALI
                        Oh right. I know. I was at the 
                        Kremlin. You know how it is -- bugs 
                        everywhere.

                                 JO
                        Uh huh.

                                 ALI
                        Are you mad?

                                 JO
                        Why should I be?

           INT. CHEQUERS DINING ROOM - EVENING

           ALI and JO greet LORD and LADY CHADWICK, a fiercely British 
           couple. ALI’s demeanor is definitely more tense around them. 

                                 ALI
                        Mum, dad I'd like to introduce you 
                        to the President of the United 
                        States.

           Jo looks somewhat hurt by the introduction.

                                 JO
                        Please call me Jo.

                                 LADY CHADWICK
                        What an honor.
                                 LORD CHADWICK
                        Pleasure.

                                 JO
                        Prime Minister, it is such a 
                        privilege to meet you.  

                                 ALI
                        Jo's a big Thatcher fan.

                                 LORD CHADWICK
                        Oh Maggie.  She's Alistair's 
                        godmother, you know.

                                 JO
                        So I heard.

           Ali's mom picks up on the flirtation. She see Ali lead Jo to 
           the table with his hand on the small of her back. This seems 
           more than a political alliance.

           They all take a seat.

                                 LADY CHADWICK
                        So I understand you are unattached, 
                        President Brooks...Sorry, Jo.

                                 JO
                        Uh, yes, I am.  First bachelor in 
                        the White House since Buchanan.

                                 LORD CHADWICK
                        Best way to be if you ask me. 
                        Absolute madness trying to run a 
                        country and a family at the same 
                        time. I'm afraid I wasn't very good 
                        at the latter when I was in Downing 
                        Street.

                                 LADY CHADWICK
                        Nonsense - every leader needs a 
                        loving arms to come home to at 
                        night.  I keep urging Alistair to 
                        find someone special.

                                 LORD CHADWICK
                        There's plenty of time for that 
                        later when he's in the House of 
                        Lords twiddling his thumbs.  For 
                        now, the boy needs to focus on his 
                        legacy.  57% approval rating.
                                 ALI
                        A fluke, I'm sure.

                                 LORD CHADWICK
                        Now I've always been one to admit 
                        when I'm wrong.  When you told me 
                        you wanted to go into politics I 
                        thought it was a terrible idea. 
                        You've never been good at the 
                        follow-through. Never held a job 
                        more than a couple months - a 
                        girlfriend even less.  It's my 
                        fault, I fear, raised you with too 
                        much a sense of entitlement.

                                 ALI
                        Inflating my ego is never something 
                        I'd accuse you of, actually.

                                 LORD CHADWICK
                        I figured you'd be tossed out of 
                        Commons within the year.  But then 
                        when your name was in the running 
                        for the top job, I thought to 
                        myself, what a bloody disaster.  It 
                        takes a certain seriousness to run 
                        a country, which Ali’s never had.

                                 LADY CHADWICK
                        Archie, that's enough.

                                 LORD CHADWICK
                        But look at you. I'm proud, son.

                                 ALI
                        You’re destroying my low self-
                        image.

                                 JO
                        I'm sure you've read that Ali has 
                        been spearheading some very 
                        important environmental 
                        legislation.

                                 LORD CHADWICK
                        Ah yes. The environment.  A bit 
                        queer, if ask me. What you need is 
                        another Faulklands.

                                 LADY CHADWICK
                        Well, I for one think the 
                        environment's lovely.  Ali's father 
                        and I are big golfers.
           LATER

           Everyone is eating a gorgeous array of food.

                                 JO
                        The turnip pie is amazing, Lady 
                        Chadwick. Thanks again for giving 
                        the recipe to my agents.

                                 LADY CHADWICK
                        I remember it from Carter.  
                        Couldn't eat one bite that the 
                        secret service didn't prepare for 
                        him.  I once made him this gorgeous 
                        trifle, took me 6 hours - and all 
                        he could do was stare at it.

                                 JO
                        That's awful.

                                 LADY CHADWICK
                        So what do they do then - cook the 
                        pie in Washington and then fly it 
                        all the way here?

                                 JO
                        In an armored plane.  Pretty 
                        ridiculous, I know.

                                 LORD CHADWICK
                        Ah I miss it.  The security, food 
                        tasters, the assassination 
                        attempts, you know - being that 
                        significant.  Tell me, Jo, how is 
                        the world these days?

                                 JO
                        Complicated.

                                 LORD CHADWICK
                        God what I wouldn't give to be back 
                        in the thick of things.  Although I 
                        don't envy you two with this whole 
                        terrorist nonsense.  The boundaries 
                        of war are so blurred now.  Back in 
                        my day, it was Russia, Russia, 
                        Russia.  Like being in some 
                        glorious spy movie.

                                 JO
                        Things certainly have changed.
                                 LORD CHADWICK
                        Savor it - every moment you've got 
                        in that office. Because the moment 
                        you leave - you'll never be that 
                        important again.

           This thought resonates deeply with Jo.

                                 LADY CHADWICK
                        You're important now.

                                 LORD CHADWICK
                        To you, my dear, to you.

           INT. CHEQUERS KITCHEN - LATER

           LADY CHADWICK is fixing some tea. JO brings in her dirty 
           plate and places it in the sink.  

                                 LADY CHADWICK
                        My son looks very happy.

                                 JO
                        I'm glad. He’s a wonderful Prime 
                        Mininster.

                                 LADY CHADWICK
                        Just be careful.  I know Ali well.  
                        He's never been short of passion.  
                        Like his father in that regard. But 
                        bad at sustaining.  I don't know 
                        what is going on between you - but 
                        it is clear he is quite smitten.  
                        Just, guard your heart, dear.  He 
                        would be lucky to get you - but I'm 
                        not sure he deserves to just yet. 

           JO is clearly unnerved by this comment.

           EXT. CHEQUERS GROUNDS - NIGHT

           The two leaders walk slowly side by side. Their security 
           detail in sight.

                                 ALI
                        Safe to say my family is completely 
                        in love.  
                                 JO
                        Why did you introduce me to your 
                        parents as the President of the 
                        United States?

                                 ALI
                        Because you are?

                                 JO
                        Is that all I am to you - the 
                        President of the United States?

                                 ALI
                        No of course not.  You're 
                        ...my...ally?

                                 JO
                        Oh your ally - well good to know.

           Tense silence.

                                 ALI
                        Jo, you're more than an ally to me. 
                        But I thought we both agreed this 
                        is just too complicated.

                                 JO
                        Right.  Then why the hell did you 
                        introduce me to your parents?

                                 ALI
                        I don't know.

                                 JO
                        I can't do this anymore - be in 
                        relationship limbo. What am I to 
                        you?

                                 ALI
                        I don't know.  Why do we have to 
                        define it?

                                 JO
                        Because I'm risking my entire 
                        career for “it.”  And if you can't 
                        even tell me what the fuck “it” is - 
                        then “it” is officially over.

                                 ALI
                        If that's the way you feel then 
                        fine.
                                 JO
                        That's it? No fight? You could just 
                        walk away from me like that?

                                 ALI
                        No.  I mean obviously we would have 
                        to still see each other in an 
                        official capacity.

                                 JO
                        God, I am such an idiot. You have 
                        the perfect situation right now - 
                        you get all the perks of a 
                        relationship without the 
                        commitment.

                                 ALI
                        I don't know what else you want 
                        from me.

                                 JO

           INT. CHEQUERS DINING ROOM - MORNING

           JO, MAX, PRESS SECRETARY sit eating breakfast in the middle 
           of what is clearly a serious conversation. 

           ALI bounds in with a huge smile on his face.  

                                 ALI
                        Good Morning America.  I hope I'm 
                        not interrupting anything too 
                        important. Might I steal your 
                        president for a moment?

           Jo nods - everyone leaves.

                                 ALI
                        I'm sorry about last night - I was 
                        an idiot.  I don't want to throw 
                        this away. I've never been good 
                        with titles - but I'd be honored if 
                        you'd be my girlfriend. Jesus 
                        Christ, I feel like I'm in 
                        secondary school.  Jo, you've got 
                        to trust me that this is serious. 
                        I've never felt this way about 
                        anyone before.  In fact...
                                 JO
                        There's a picture.

                                 ALI
                        Hold on - I've been practicing in 
                        the mirror all morning.(beat) What?

                                 JO
                        There's a picture of us kissing at 
                        the G8.  Some photographer snapped 
                        it outside of Francois' chalet.  I 
                        don't know what I was thinking 
                        standing so close to the window. 
                        The story is breaking in the papers 
                        tomorrow.

           Ali takes this in.

                                 ALI
                        You know what? This is great.  
                        Maybe this is just the nudge we 
                        needed to go public.

                                 JO
                        Are you kidding?

                                 ALI
                        Sure the press will have a field 
                        day for a bit - but it's not like 
                        we're doing anything wrong.  We're 
                        two consenting, single adults....

                                 JO
                        Who happen to be leaders of two 
                        different countries.

                                 ALI
                        Two allied countries.

                                 JO
                        You felt up my nuclear codes.

                                 ALI
                        I didn't look at them.

                                 JO
                        How do they know that?

                                 ALI
                        I'll tell them.
                                 JO
                        That picture is the end of my 
                        presidency.  And not only mine - 
                        but any female running in the next 
                        15 years.

                                 ALI
                        Jo I think you're overreacting.

                                 JO
                        Easy for you to say - this works 
                        out perfectly for you. You're the 
                        guy that slept with the most 
                        powerful country in the world.  
                        What better sugar momma for England 
                        than America?  Hell if you play 
                        your cards right maybe you can 
                        colonize us again.  After all most 
                        couples do eventually move in with 
                        each other, right?

                                 ALI
                        You think I've just been using you 
                        to expand my empire?

                                 JO
                        I think we've been using each 
                        other.  We're leaving today. My 
                        press secretary thinks it's best if 
                        the story breaks when we're in two 
                        separate countries.  Besides I need 
                        to go back to Washington and kiss 
                        every ass I can to try to salvage 
                        what I have left of a presidency.

                                 ALI
                        But what about the emissions 
                        treaty? You’re bailing on it, 
                        aren’t you?

                                 JO
                        No. The Republicans are willing to 
                        support a 15% emissions reduction 
                        at this time. 

                                 ALI
                        That’s meaningless and you know it. 

                                 JO
                        I have worked my entire life for 
                        this job - do you understand?  I 
                        have sacrificed everything to get 
                        here.

                                 JO (cont'd)
                        I never smoked weed, never got a 
                        bad grade, never went skinny 
                        dipping, or took goofy photos with 
                        friends in case they got leaked to 
                        the press.  I never kissed a girl, 
                        or bummed around Europe, or danced 
                        provocatively at a club or told 
                        someone to go fuck himself because 
                        someday I might need that guy's 
                        vote. I have spent my life shaking 
                        hands with people, memorizing their 
                        names, their children’s names, 
                        their parents' names, their dogs' 
                        names, all with a nauseating smile 
                        plastered on my face.  My whole 
                        life has been one long job 
                        interview for the most coveted 
                        position in the world.  And in less 
                        than three months I have managed to 
                        fuck up everything I have worked my 
                        whole life to achieve for some guy.  
                        Don't you dare talk to me about 
                        bailing when you have had 
                        everything handed to you on a 
                        silver platter.  I never fuck up. I 
                        never make a misstep.  Except when 
                        I'm around you.

           Silence as ALI processes.

                                 ALI
                        Right. I see.  I'll fix it.

                                 JO
                        How?

                                 ALI
                        I'm going to hold a press 
                        conference this afternoon 
                        explaining everything.

                                 JO
                        For god's sake don't.

                                 ALI
                             (cutting her off)
                        Explaining that I kissed you at the 
                        G8 as a joke  - and you immediately 
                        pushed me away. I was wasted and 
                        having a laugh.  If there is any 
                        blame to be had it is mine and mine 
                        alone.

                                 ALI (cont'd)
                        The good thing is that people will 
                        believe me - because that's what 
                        people expect from me - the playboy 
                        who can't behave.

                                 JO
                        You'll ruin your career.

                                 ALI
                        No, I started this mess - I should 
                        take responsibility. I kissed you, 
                        after all.

                                 JO
                        You didn't.

                                 ALI
                             (coldly)
                        I did.

                                 JO
                        You don't have to do this.

                                 ALI
                        It's fine. I was probably never 
                        meant to be Prime Minister anyway.  
                        My father predicted this would be a 
                        bad fit for me. I'm not inherently 
                        a serious enough person.

                                 JO
                        Yes you are.

                                 ALI
                        I think it's best if you and I keep 
                        our distance for whatever time I 
                        have left in this office. Any 
                        communication can go through our 
                        foreign ministers.

                                 JO
                        Ali.

                                 ALI
                        Good bye, President Brooks.

           SAD MONTAGE

           -- ALI gives the press conference back in London. The press 
           looks shocked. SIMON stands morosely in the corner. 

           -- JO laying in her bed cuddling the bulldog puppy.
           -- White House press conference. The PRESS SECRETARY is 
           fielding questions. 

           -- JO reads a newspaper. Headline reads: KISSING PM CAN KISS 
           HIS CAREER GOODBYE. Jo looks at another newspaper whose 
           headline reads: SEXUAL HARASSMENT AT THE G8?

           -- ALI’s limo getting pummelled by tomatoes by angry 
           feminists protesting outside Downing Street, as ALI sits 
           inside.  

           -- JO is riding in her limo as she passes female protestors 
           outside of the White House whose signs read: DON’T MESS WITH 
           OUR PRESIDENT. Etc. Jo feels guilty.

           EXT. LONDON CONFERENCE CENTER - DAY

           Motorcades of the various countries arrive at the Majestic 
           building in the heart of London.  Photographers, protestors, 
           and politicians abound. 

           Standing in front of the scene is the YOUNG REPORTER holding 
           her mic in front of her face, frozen in a phony smile in 
           anticipation of the camera rolling.

           THROUGH THE NEWS CAMERA

                                 YOUNG REPORTER
                        Thanks, Nance.  I’m standing at the 
                        Environmental Summit in London, 
                        England, where leaders of the world 
                        are arriving to discuss pressing 
                        issues in climate change.  Cut.

                                 CAMERA MAN O.S.
                        What? That was great.

                        Do you smell that.

                                 CAMERA MAN O.S.
                        I don't smell anything, Kris.

                                 REPORTER
                        Do you think someone farts while 
                        Christianne Amanpour is 
                        interviewing fucking Bin Laden in 
                        some fucking cave in fucking 
                        Afghanistan?
                                 CAMERA MAN O.S.
                        Let's go again everyone. And no 
                        farting.

                             (reporter mask back on)
                        The summit will culminate in an 
                        international emissions reduction 
                        pledge of 15% by 2020 signed by the 
                        members of the G8 along with 80 
                        other allied countries.

           INT. US PRESIDENTIAL LIMO - SAME

           JO sits stoically in the limo next to MAX and her secret 
           service detail.  On the tv in the limo we hear the YOUNG 
           REPORTER doing her segment.  

                                 YOUNG REPORTER O.S.
                        However, scientists warn that a 15% 
                        reduction is not nearly enough to 
                        make a real difference in the fight 
                        against global warming and slam the 
                        treaty as more symbolic than 
                        effective.  

           INT. PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE - SAME

           ALI is cleaning up his desk and putting everything in boxes.

           He picks up a photo of all of the leaders taken at the G8 and 
           after a moment dumps it in the box. 

           The tv is on in the office, tuned to the same YOUNG REPORTER.

                        The treaty, which was supposed to 
                        be the crowning achievement for new 
                        Prime Minister Chadwick, instead 
                        appears to be his swan song. There 
                        have been widespread cries for his 
                        resignation since he admitted to 
                        inappropriately kissing the 
                        President of the United States at 
                        last year’s G8 summit. Chadwick is 
                        expected to hand in his letter of 
                        resignation immediately after the 
                        signing ceremony this afternoon.

                        I think this incident just makes 
                        women like President Brooks more.  
                        We can all relate to that sleazy 
                        guy at the office who tries to hit 
                        on us.  And sadly, female leaders 
                        are not immune to such flagrant 
                        misogyny. Berlusconi once called 
                        Thatcher a hot piece of pussy.

                                 LARRY KING
                        Oh can't say that on air.

           BACK TO OFFICE

                                 SIMON
                        I had a feeling you're career would 
                        be unraveled by a woman.  Some 
                        floozy you had a one-night tryst 
                        with writing all of the salacious 
                        details in Hello Magazine.  But for 
                        the life of me, I never thought it 
                        would happen like this.

                                 ALI
                        It’s done, Simon.

                                 SIMON
                        For fuck's sake, Ali, you've done 
                        enough stupid shit with women to 
                        screw up your career, why confess 
                        to something you didn't even do?

                                 ALI
                        She deserves this more than I do.

                                 SIMON
                        Great time to become fucking 
                        chivalrous.  You think this is big 
                        of you?

                                 ALI
                        Not particularly.
           INT. US PRESIDENTIAL LIMO - SAME

           Larry King Live is on now in her limo as they approach the 
           conference center.

           ON THE TELEVISION

                                 FEMINIST PUNDIT
                        The former Pakastani Prime 
                        Minister, Shaukat Aziz, once told 
                        Condi Rice that he could conquer 
                        any woman in two minutes.

                                 LARRY KING
                        Two minutes, eh? I think there are 
                        pills to fix that.

                                 FEMINIST PUNDIT
                        It's not funny, Larry.  Sexism is 
                        alive and well in politics.

                                 LARRY KING
                        Don't we have that clip of Bush and 
                        then Chancellor of German Angela 
                        Merkel at the G8?

           He shows clip of G.W. Bush trying to give Angela Merkel a 
           very unwelcome massage.

                                 LARRY KING
                             (laughing)
                        Gets me every time.

           BACK TO LIMO

           JO turns off the tv, defeated.  FOOTBALL DAN takes his free 
           hand, the one not handcuffed to the nuclear football and 
           places it on top of JO’s. JO smiles at the gesture.

                                 MAX
                        This was always going to end in 
                        casualties.  Be thankful there was 
                        only one.

           INT. LONDON CONFERENCE CENTER - LATER

           Leaders and their sherpas mill about in the grand hall.  JO 
           stands nervously at the baby carrots. Just as she is about to 
           put one in her mouth, the secret service stops her.
                                 AGENT TOM
                        Those haven't been inspected, ma'm. 

           She drops the baby carrot. Suddenly she sees ALI across the 
           room. Their eyes meet for a moment, but he quickly looks 
           away.

           INT. MEN’S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           ALI is by himself.  He stare at himself in the mirror then 
           splashes some cold water on his tired face. 

           His privacy is broken when FRANCOIS, JONATHAN, and MORETTI, 
           who is smoking (of course), walk in.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        I don't give a shit about Shania 
                        Twain.

                                 JONATHAN
                        But I bet you didn't know she was 
                        Canadian. Everyone just assumes 
                        she's American.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        Who cares, eh? Ah Ali - our 
                        wonderful host.  Did you get the 
                        madeleines I sent you?

                                 ALI
                        Delicious.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        And he says French cooking is not 
                        the best.

                                 ALI
                        Never did.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        No see I let it pass.  Come piss 
                        with us.

           All the leaders line up in a row at the urinals.

                                 ALI
                        Wow - this is the greatest picture 
                        that was never taken.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        That is was Clinton said.
                                 JONATHAN
                             (to ALI)
                        I can't believe you did it.

                                 MORETTI
                        Lay off of him.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        I say bravo.  Everyone of us would 
                        kill to kiss Jo Brooks.

                                 JONATHAN
                        What? You guys never said that to 
                        me.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        That's because you cannot keep your 
                        damn mouth shut.

                                 JONATHAN
                        Can too.

                                 ALI
                        Look.  I'd appreciate it if you 
                        guys didn't bring it up.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        And for this they make you resign - 
                        kissing.  I kiss my mother more 
                        passionately than that.  No 
                        offense. Your country is I think 
                        too anal tight.  One time, I walk 
                        into press conference with big, 
                        huge, how do you say.  Comment dit-
                        on “trique” en anglais?

                                 JONATHAN
                        Ew I'm not saying that.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        Oh la la.

                                 JONATHAN
                        Boner.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        Thank you, big, huge, massive 
                        boner.

                                 ALI
                        I get it.
                                 FRANCOIS
                        And one reporter raises his hand 
                        and says, “Monsieur president, 
                        looks like it is time to get 
                        another mistress.”

                                 ALI
                        Yes, well thanks for the pep talk.

                                 FRANCOIS
                        And, you are much bigger than I 
                        imagined.

                                 ALI
                        What?

                                 FRANCOIS
                        I took a peak.

                                 MORETTI
                        Careful.  Whenever France sees 
                        something big - he tries to 
                        nationalize it.

           The triumverate walks out, leaving ALI alone again, until MAX 
           walks in. The two men stand in a tense silence as they wash 
           their hands. 

                                 MAX
                        I know what you did. (beat) Thank 
                        you.  

           INT. CONVENTION HALL - LATER

           All of the leaders are seated around a big table - it's much 
           bigger than the G8 - many more countries represented.  JO 
           stares at ALI, but he never turns towards her.

                                 JO
                             (to MAX)
                        Get the motorcade ready. As soon as 
                        I sign this thing I want out of 
                        here.

           INT. SIGNING CEREMONY - LATER

           ALI stands in front of press to announce the signing of the 
           treaty. The stage is packed to the brim with leaders ready to 
           sign. 
           ALI coldly passes JO the pen to be the first to sign, never 
           once looking at her.  She hesitates for a second then signs. 
           As soon as she passes the pen to Germany, JO fights through 
           the crowd of leaders to get off the stage. Noticing her 
           distress, MORETTI follows behind her. 

           EXT. LONDON CONFERENCE CENTER

           JO hurries out to her waiting motorcade surrounded by her 
           secret service as she fights back the tears. MORETTI calls 
           after her.

                                 MORETTI
                        President Brooks.

                                 JO
                        President Moretti, shouldn’t you be 
                        at the ceremony? 

                                 MORETTI
                             (lighting a cigar)
                        One thing I have learned: there is 
                        always time for a cigar. 

           JO smiles weakly as MORETTI passes her a cigar. They smoke in 
           silence.

                                 MORETTI (CONT’D)
                        5 more months and I am done.

                                 JO
                        God, that soon?  I'm sure Italy 
                        will miss you very much.

                                 MORETTI
                        Bah.  I will miss her.  But Italy 
                        will move on - find some younger 
                        man with new ideas who excites her 
                        and attach herself to him for a few 
                        years until he, too, is eventually 
                        dumped. No, Jo, countries don't 
                        care about you - they use you and 
                        throw you away.  And that's why 
                        they are able to go on. It is 
                        healthy.  It's dangerous for a 
                        country when a leader won't let go.  
                        Look at these dictators - like 
                        jealous lovers.  They spend their 
                        whole reigns holding onto power, 
                        because they become addicted to 
                        their country's embrace. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MORETTI (cont'd)
                        They try to make a fling a 
                        marriage, you understand?  Be 
                        careful not to get addicted to that 
                        embrace, Jo, for it isn't real. The 
                        limos, the staff, the office, the 
                        power are not ever really yours - 
                        they're only lent to you like a 
                        textbook you must give back when 
                        you graduate.

                                 JO
                        I should go.

                                 MORETTI
                             (perceptively)
                        It's too bad you'll miss the 
                        meatloaf.

           JO clearly didn’t know ALI was serving meatloaf.

                                 JO
                        I can’t.

                                 MORETTI
                        Every prince needs allies, Jo.  
                        Every princess, too.

           Jo hesitates for a second then gets in the limo.

           SIGNING CEREMONY/LIMO MONTAGE

           -- JO stares out of the window of the limo as the London 
           streets whizz by. 

           -- Canada signs the treaty with anal-retentive precision. 
           Russia then takes the pen and quickly signs. 

           -- Something catches JO’s eye outside of the limo.

                                 JO
                        Stop the limo!

                                 MAX
                        Madame President....

                                 JO
                        I said stop the limo now.

           The limo stops. JO gets out.  Tourists are gawking. 

                                 AGENT TOM
                             (into ear piece)
                        POTUS just exited the vehicle.
           EXT. BOND STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           The secret service agents are trying to fend off the curious 
           crowd gathered. 

           JO stands in front of a statue on Bond Street of Franklin 
           Delano Roosevelt and Winton Churchill sitting on a park bench 
           together, laughing and staring dotingly at one another. 

           JO sits between the two men and lays her head on Roosevelt’s 
           shoulder.

                                 JO
                        What the fuck am I doing? 

           -- We see more leaders signing the treaty. ALI is inching 
           closer to the front of the line. 

           -- Back in the limo, JO urges the driver to go faster.

           -- Japan signs the treaty and passes the pen to France. ALI 
           is next.

           -- JO is back in front of the conference center and runs into 
           the building surrounded by agents and MAX.

           -- ALI is about to sign when...

           INT. SIGNING CEREMONY - SAME

           JO bursts in the door with her winded entourage.

                                 JO
                        Don't sign that treaty!

                                 ALI
                        Jo - what are you doing?

                                 BRITISH REPORTER
                        What the fuck?

                                 JO
                        Don't sign that treaty!

                                 ALI
                        Why not?

                                 JO
                        Because...America doesn't want 
                        Britain to cool down just yet.
                                 ALI
                        It's too late.

                                 JO
                        No, please.  America really doesn't 
                        want Britain to cool down.

                                 ALI
                        As I recall, it was America's idea 
                        to cool down - remember?  Britain 
                        didn't want to.

           The leaders and the press look baffled, with the exception of 
           MORETTI who has a proud smile on his face.

                                 JO
                        That was just because America was 
                        scared - it hadn't experienced that 
                        kind of heat before.

                                 ALI
                        America should be scared - hasn't 
                        she seen “An Inconvenient Truth?”

                                 JO
                        Yes, but America is willing to 
                        overlook the dangers if Britain is.

                                 ALI
                        Britain can't handle being burned 
                        again - by the thinning ozone.

                                 JO
                        America doesn't want to burn fossil 
                        fuels with anyone else.

                                 ALI
                        England has spoken with many 
                        trusted scientists who say it's a 
                        bad idea.

                                 JO
                        Any ecosystem goes through natural 
                        ups and owns.  That doesn't mean 
                        we're doomed.

                                 ALI
                        It's over.

                                 JO
                        I'm in love with you.
                                 JONATHAN
                        This is the most passionate 
                        discussion of the environment I've 
                        ever seen.

                                 INDIAN REPORTER
                        What the fuck is going on?

                                 ALI
                        Jo, don't do this.

                                 JO
                        I'm in love with you. Okay that 
                        probably needs some explaining.  
                        When two countries love each other 
                        they....Nevermind.  Look, he didn't 
                        kiss me. I mean he did - but I 
                        kissed back.  We kissed each other.

           FRANCOIS shakes his head approvingly. CANADA is shocked.

                                 ALI
                        What are you doing?

                                 JO
                        Making amends.  I violated the most 
                        sacred international treaty: I 
                        abandoned my ally.  I thought that 
                        it was my duty as a president to 
                        push you away, Ali.  To deny my 
                        feelings. But actually it's just 
                        the opposite.  I can't do this 
                        without you.  Just like FDR 
                        couldn't have won World War II 
                        without Churchill.  Just like 
                        Reagan couldn't have won the Cold 
                        War without Thatcher.  Just like 
                        Bush couldn't have won the War 
                        against Terror without Blair. Well, 
                        bad example - but we really deserve 
                        most of the blame for that fuck-up 
                        not you.  You tried to tell us it 
                        was a stupid idea and anyway....We 
                        have a real threat now: global 
                        warming. And I can't defeat it 
                        without you.  I was wrong to make 
                        you rewrite this treaty which is 
                        why I’m tearing it up. 

           She tears up the treaty amidst gasps of shock from the 
           audience and other leaders. SIMON and MAX look like they are 
           going to pass out.
                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        15% is pointless -- which is why 
                        America is committing to a 50% 
                        reduction by 2020. America needs to 
                        deal with this threat now before 
                        the environmental equivalent of 
                        Pearl Harbor smacks us in the face.  
                        And to my Republican Senators who 
                        have decided that the environment 
                        is some leftist, liberal issue, I 
                        urge you to remember:Conservatives' 
                        lungs need the same clean air that 
                        Liberals’ do. And Conservatives' 
                        homes are no less vulnerable to the 
                        floods of hurricane waters than are 
                        Liberals’.

                                 ALI
                        Great. But I'm still resigning. I 
                        wasn't cut out for this job.

                                 JO
                        No you can't, because this treaty 
                        isn't enough.  It's just the 
                        beginning - a well-fought battle, 
                        but it isn't the end of the war.  
                        What about deforestation? Or 
                        pollution of the oceans? Over-
                        fishing? Who's going to help me to 
                        get China on board? And India?

                                 ALI
                        There will be another Prime 
                        Minister of Great Britain.

                                 JO
                        No. I don't want to be with any 
                        other prime ministers. I've had 
                        other prime ministers and they 
                        didn't make me feel the way you do.  
                        What did I get done with Lloyd? 
                        Nothing.  But with you...Don't you 
                        see, we were placed in the same 
                        moment in history for a reason. 
                        Even if I get voted out in two 
                        years, I don't care.  I'm going to 
                        make those two years matter. I've 
                        been so busy going after the 
                        battles I can win, I've ignored the 
                        battles that need to be fought. But 
                        that ends today.
           Beat.  As she looks nervously at him. Everyone in the room 
           seems to be nervously awaiting Ali's response.

                                 JO
                        So?

           Beat.

                                 ALI
                        President Brooks....It's fun to be 
                        in the same decade as you.

           They kiss.

           SIMON and ALI are outside of the press conference, sharing a
