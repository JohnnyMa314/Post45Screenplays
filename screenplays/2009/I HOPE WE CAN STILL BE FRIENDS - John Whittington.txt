         (cid:13)           FADE IN ON:

           THE MOST DEPRESSED MAN ON PLANET EARTH.

           KYLE HAMBERG, 31, wears an exhausted face, bloodshot eyes, 
           and several days worth of facial scruff.  He sports a short-
           sleeved shirt and tie combo, and he's working off at least a 
           week's worth of alcohol-induced hibernation.

           But more than anything, he has the look of a man resigned to 
           the fact that his misery isn't going away any time soon.

                                 KYLE
                        Um, ok... Here goes... It's been 
                        roughly thirty-two days since I 
                        lost my soulmate, lover, and all-
                        around best friend.  And so as a 
                        result, I'm still stuck in kind of 
                        a state of emotional disarray.

           PULL BACK to reveal that Kyle is standing in front of a large 
           CLASSROOM CHALKBOARD that reads: "WELCOME TO SCIENCE CLUB!!"

           In front of Kyle are roughly twenty-five TEENAGE NERDS, all 
           wearing various combinations of coke-bottled glasses, acne 
           scars, and Gandalf T-shirts.

           Kyle stares out at his class with eyes that beg for sympathy.

                                 KYLE
                        So, if you don't mind, there are a 
                        few things I need to get off my 
                        chest to anyone who will listen.

           INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY

           CLOSE on the similarly depressed face of a beautiful and 
           professional woman.  ASHLEY WALLS, 29, tears welling behind 
           her cute glasses, sits heavily in a leather chair and lets it 
           all out.

                                 ASHLEY
                        The pain of loss is universal.  
                        Every day people experience how it 
                        feels to lose someone they love, 
                        and somehow they find a way to 
                        survive.  I think if I keep 
                        reminding myself of this, at some 
                        point it'll start to help... Right?

           INT. KYLE'S APARTMENT - DAY - SIX MONTHS AGO

           Kyle paces anxiously in front of Ashley, who sits staring at 
           an assortment of APPLICATIONS and BROCHURES.

           (cid:13)                                 ASHLEY
                        What the hell is the Costa Rica 
                        Fellowship?

                                 KYLE
                        This is what I've been talking 
                        about.  It's a totally insane 
                        oceanography expedition.  This 
                        thing is huge! -- It's how that guy 
                        from last week's "Deadliest Catch" 
                        got his start!

                                 ASHLEY
                        Kyle, that guy from "Deadliest 
                        Catch" actually died.  Don't you 
                        remember, the episode was dedicated 
                        in his loving memory.  We both made 
                        contributions to his children's 
                        college funds.  You can't be 
                        serious!

                                 KYLE
                        I'm totally serious, this is my 
                        dream job.  And I want you to come 
                        with me.  

                                 ASHLEY
                        Come with you?  You mean to live?

                                 KYLE
                        On a boat!  For two years!  In the 
                        waters of the Pacific Ocean, the 
                        natural habitat of Kyle-3000 and 
                        Ashburger over here.

           Kyle gestures to a large aquarium where TWO TROPICAL FISH 
           swim about, oblivious to the scene in front of them.  

           Ashley just stares back at Kyle, totally speechless.

                                 KYLE
                        C'mon Ash, haven't you ever wanted 
                        to live on the precipice of 
                        something bigger than you?  
                        Something totally unknown?

                                 ASHLEY
                        No.  Absolutely not.  I want to live 
                        on the precipice of indoor plumbing, 
                        and air conditioning, and Quiznos.  
                        What about having a family together 
                        someday like we talked about?  Isn't 
                        that big and unknown enough for you?  
                                      (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, that's all great, but I'm 
                        trying to really expand our lives 
                        here.  Together.

                                 ASHLEY
                        So expanding our lives together 
                        means abandoning my family, my job, 
                        and my future so my boyfriend can go 
                        carry out his aquatic death wish?

           Kyle lowers his eyes and heads towards the bedroom.

                                 KYLE
                        You're upsetting the fish.  And 
                        it's not a death wish... It's a 
                        life wish!

           Kyle storms into the bedroom and SLAMS the door behind him.

           INT. ASHLEY'S PRIUS - DAY - TWO MONTHS AGO

           Ashley weaves through highway traffic while she and Kyle are 
           locked in the heat of an argument.

                                 ASHLEY
                        This makes no sense.  You're a 
                        teacher!  How could you decide you 
                        don't want to have kids now?  
                        You're surrounded by them all day!

                                 KYLE
                        Exactly, and those freak shows put 
                        the fear of God in me.  I mean, 
                        what if I wind up with a slut, or a 
                        super-depressed emo-freak, or a kid 
                        who refuses to wear anything but 
                        jean shorts?  I don't think I could 
                        handle that.

                                 ASHLEY
                        This is bullshit, Kyle.  You never 
                        used to be afraid of being a parent 
                        before.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, well that was until I 
                        overheard the captain of the field 
                        hockey team advising her lunch 
                        table that if a girl has sex with 
                        two guys who both have chlamydia, 
                        they cancel each other out.  Then 
                        there's the twenty-five kids in the 
                        Art Club.  Turns out they're all a

                        Yeah, they were supposed to meet 
                        last week to design the new 
                        Homecoming float, instead I found 
                        them all behind the equipment shed, 
                        pupils fully dilated and strung out 
                        on industrial strength paint 
                        thinner.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Ok, obviously some kids slip through 
                        the cracks.  But that's what makes 
                        getting it right as a parent one of 
                        the most rewarding experiences two 
                        people can share together.

                                 KYLE
                        Right, I know, but how am I supposed 
                        to help raise a decent kid if I'm 
                        spending every day struggling to 
                        survive the perils of life at sea?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Oh, so this is about you taking the 
                        fellowship then?  Because you don't 
                        think we can have a future together 
                        that will make us both happy?

           Kyle pauses for a beat before answering.  Ashley reads his 
           hesitation and angrily starts to FLOOR THE GAS PEDAL.

                                 KYLE
                        Whoa, ok, slow down, I didn't 
                        answer yet -- Let's just continue 
                        our dialogue!

                                 ASHLEY
                        You hesitated.  That's an answer.

           Ashley, super pissed now, digs her fingernails into the wheel 
           and SWERVES the car through several lanes of traffic.  Other 
           cars BLARE THEIR HORNS.  Kyle tries to control his fear.

                                 KYLE
                        Whoa-whoa -- Use your signal!  Use 
                        your signal!

           INT. KYLE'S APARTMENT - DAY - ONE MONTH AGO

           Kyle and Ashley, red-eyed and brokenhearted, face each other 
           in the center of a big WHITE COUCH.  Their arguing is over, 
           all that's left now is the gravity of this painful moment.  

           After a long beat of silence, Kyle finally speaks.

                                 KYLE
                        So... Are you sure?

           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                 ASHLEY
                        Yeah... Are you?

           Kyle nods sadly.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah.  So this is it then?

           She leans towards him, wrapping him up in her arms.  He 
           squeezes her back tightly, looking like he doesn't want to 
           ever let go.

           It is clear that this isn't just any other hug.  It's 
           serious, it's emotional, and it's final.  This is their 
           goodbye.

           After a long beat, Kyle and Ashley pull apart and stare into 
           each other's bleary eyes one last time.

                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KYLE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Kyle sits in a pathetic heap on a LAWN CHAIR in the center of 
           the room.  He's wrapped up to his neck in a blanket and 
           eating dried pasta from the box.  

           There's no sign of Ashley left anywhere.  Most of the 
           furniture and wall decorations are gone.  In the back closet, 
           T-shirts, sports jerseys, and tennis shoes line one side -- 
           Loose hangers and moth balls fill the other.

           Kyle stares sadly through the aquarium glass.  Kyle-3000 and 
           Ashburger are all he has left now.

           INT. FRIEND'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ashley wanders around a HALLOWEEN PARTY by herself, dressed 
           up as ARWEN, Liv Tyler's character from "Lord of the Rings."  
           She's the only person in costume at the party.

           A CUTE GUY in a cardigan walks by, eyeing her get up.

                                 ASHLEY
                        It's from "Lord of the Rings."  You 
                        know, Arwen the Elf Maiden?

                                 CUTE GUY
                        Uh-huh...

           He brushes past her, leaving Ashley alone and embarrassed.

                                 ASHLEY
                        The E-vite said costumes encouraged!

KYLE'S HONDA - DAY

           Kyle sits in a daze behind the wheel, stuck at a red light.  
           On the radio, the infectious chorus to "Every Little Thing 
           She Does Is Magic" by The Police blares out.  

           Kyle stews until he can't take it anymore.

                                 KYLE
                        FUCK YOU, STING!!!

           Kyle, shaking with rage, looks out his window to the driver 
           next to him.  It's a TERRIFIED OLD LADY.  The light turns 
           green and she speeds away.  Kyle is left to hate himself.

                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KYLE'S CLASSROOM - DAY - NOW

           Kyle leans against the chalkboard and lets out a big sigh.

                                 KYLE
                        So, that's all I've got.  Thanks to 
                        all of you for listening... I am 
                        now happy to take your questions, 
                        assuming you have any.

           A FRUSTRATED GEEK in the back row raises his hand.

                                 FRUSTRATED GEEK
                        Does this mean we won't be shooting 
                        off mini-rockets on the soccer 
                        field today?

                                 KYLE
                        Yes.  I'd rather die than shoot off 
                        mini-rockets with you right now.  So 
                        the answer to your question is yes.

           The Science Nerds all start to GRUMBLE to themselves.

                                 KYLE
                        Anyone who wants to go is free to 
                        leave the classroom.  You will 
                        still receive your extra credit.

           On cue, the ENTIRE CLASS OF GEEKS rises as one and FILES OUT 
           the open door.  Well, almost the entire class.  Left behind 
           is one LOVABLE LOOKING TEEN who remains quietly seated at the 
           center of the room.  His name is CHARLIE FORRESTER.

                                 KYLE
                        What about you, Charlie?  You 
                        taking off too?

                        No.  I thought I'd hang around.  You 
                        know, in case you still want to talk.

           Kyle smiles.  He's genuinely moved by Charlie's goodwill.

           INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY

           Ashley wipes a final tear from her eye and straightens out 
           her jacket, composing herself.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Oh boy... It feels good to let all 
                        that out.
                         (glances at her watch)
                        And it looks like we're finishing 
                        up right on time too.

           Glaring at Ashley from across the room is a CONFUSED PATIENT 
           laid out on a LEATHER COUCH.  

           The Patient glances up at a CERTIFICATE on the office wall 
           that reads "Ashley Walls - Clinical Psychologist."

                                 PATIENT
                        Ok, but what does droning on about 
                        your break-up for forty-five 
                        minutes have to do with my cat 
                        getting run over by a dump truck?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Well, uh, I was going to lead off 
                        with that next week, but... My 
                        relationship with Kyle was kind of 
                        run over by a dump truck... A 
                        figurative dump truck.  Kyle was 
                        sort of like the cat and I was--

                                 PATIENT
                        --I don't want to be charged for 
                        this session.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Ok.  Yeah-yeah, that's fair.

           The Patient grabs her purse and blusters out the door, 
           shaking her head as she goes.

                                 PATIENT
                        Un-frickin'-believable...

           As the Patient storms off, Ashley's white-haired, 65-year-old 
           colleague, CYNTHIA BREASTON, pokes her head in.  She sees 
           Ashley rubbing her temples in an obvious state of distress.

                        Ashley... What's going on?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Oh nothing, just bottling up all my 
                        worst feelings and darkest 
                        emotions... Hold on a sec, I'm 
                        almost done...

           Cynthia gently removes Ashley's hands from her temples and 
           pulls her up to her feet.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Let's take a walk.

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

           Kyle and Charlie methodically set up a series of MINI-ROCKETS 
           along the sidelines of the school soccer field.

                                 CHARLIE
                        So, if Ashley is so perfect, why'd 
                        you two break-up?  You have some 
                        internet chick on the side or 
                        something?

                                 KYLE
                        No, come on, nothing like that. 
                        It's just... When you're in love 
                        with someone, all you wanna think 
                        about are the things you both want 
                        that you already have, not the 
                        things that she wants that you 
                        can't give her.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You mean like an orgasm?

                                 KYLE
                        No, dude... Kids.  She wanted kids, 
                        ok?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ohhh... So you shoot blanks, huh?  
                        Holster's loaded but the chamber's 
                        empty?  Gotcha.  It's cool man, 
                        nothing to be ashamed of.

                                 KYLE
                        No, what I mean is... Oh, forget it.

           Kyle crouches and aligns the rockets in a perfect row.
                                       (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)

DC STREETS - DAY

           Ashley and Cynthia walk and talk down the busy sidewalks of 
           Washington, DC.  They each sip large coffees as they go. 

                                 ASHLEY
                        And then he had this crazy dream of 
                        taking an oceanography fellowship 
                        in Costa Rica and living on a boat 
                        together for two years... It was 
                        just never what we had planned, and 
                        I can't make a rash decision that 
                        will only cause us to resent each 
                        other in the end.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        That's a mature outlook.  It's 
                        difficult to be so self-aware in 
                        situations like this.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Do you think maybe I should call 
                        him?  I mean, just to check in?  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Is that all you want?  To check-in?

                                 ASHLEY
                        I just want something.  We were 
                        together for five years and there's 
                        this massive void in my life now.  
                        And it's all made up of these tiny 
                        things that I can't get back.  Like 
                        waking up in the morning, and him 
                        getting us coffee or me picking up 
                        muffins.  Is there anything so damn 
                        wrong about meeting for coffee and 
                        a muffin?

           Cynthia ponders for a moment.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        I saved a scone for myself in the 
                        fridge yesterday.  We could split 
                        it if you want...

           Ashley sighs.  Not quite the answer she was looking for.

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

           Kyle supervises as Charlie lights a LONG FUSE that connects 
           to the mini-rockets.  The fuse catches and starts to BURN.
                                  (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                 KYLE
                        This cold turkey approach to break-
                        ups is slowly killing me.  I think 
                        I should call her.  Just to say hi, 
                        you know?  Just to say hi.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don't know, man.  In seventh 
                        grade, I had my heart eaten alive 
                        by Melissa Cotello and I've sworn 
                        off women ever since.  Now my life 
                        revolves around hardcore gaming, 
                        classic rock, and the pursuit of 
                        science, and I have to say -- I'm 
                        much, much happier as a result.

                                 KYLE
                        So you think I should take up 
                        hardcore gaming instead of calling 
                        her?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Everyone has to find their own 
                        specific path in life, but... Yes.  
                        That's my advice to you, yes.

           Kyle and Charlie turn towards the rockets as the fuse burns 
           out.  The rockets BLAST OFF into the air.  

           For a couple of science geeks, it's an awesome sight.

                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KYLE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Kyle sits on the lawn chair at the center of his apartment.  
           He watches an old "Shark Week" on TV and stares at his cell 
           phone, which rests silently on the floor.

           INT. ASHLEY'S APARTMENT - SAME

           Ashley sits Indian-style on her couch, waiting at the exact 
           same moment for her phone to ring as well.

           Ashley has finally had it.  She grabs a bottle of beer, sucks 
           down a long chug of liquid courage, and gets set to dial, 
           when the phone suddenly starts to RING in her hand.

           It's Kyle.  She answers immediately.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Hello? -- He-hello?  Kyle??

KYLE'S APARTMENT - SAME

           Kyle quivers at the sound of Ashley's voice.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, hey, it's Kyle!  How are you??

                                 ASHLEY
                        I'm... I'm great.  I'm awesome, I'm -- 
                        Wait, no, I'm sorry.  That was all a 
                        lie.  I'm terrible.  How are you?

                                 KYLE
                        Oh, you know... Still generally 
                        wishing for death.

                                 ASHLEY
                        I'm glad you called.  I've really 
                        missed you.

                                 KYLE
                        I've really missed you too.

           A long beat.

                                 KYLE
                        Do you think... Maybe we should 
                        meet up?  Get together or 
                        something?  You know, nothing 
                        major, just something for--

                                 ASHLEY
                        --For closure.  Right?  Just as a 
                        way to--

                                 KYLE
                        --Exactly.  Yeah, closure.  We 
                        definitely need to close this thing 
                        up right here.  It still feels... 
                        relatively open, so yeah, let's just 
                        close her up while we still can.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Ok.  What's a good day for you?

                                 KYLE
                        Um... Well, I'm free right now.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Really?  It's one-thirty in the 
                        morning.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh... So, you've got something 
                        going on then?

                        No -- No, I'm free.  You want me to 
                        head over?

                                 KYLE
                        Door's unlocked, just come on in.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Ok, I'm on my way.

           They both hang up
                            and race to prepare for the meeting.

           INT. KYLE'S APARTMENT - HALF AN HOUR LATER

           Ashley lets herself inside the apartment and sees Kyle parked 
           in his lawn chair, watching TV.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Hey.  What're you doing?

                                 KYLE
                        Oh, hi.  Just, uh, watching some 
                        old VHS's from "Shark Week" 2003.

           They both turn to the TV and watch a MASSIVE GREAT WHITE bear 
           down and inhale AN ENTIRE SCHOOL OF UNSUSPECTING FISH.

                                 KYLE
                         (exceedingly depressed)
                        That was awesome.

           Ashley walks over to the fish aquarium and looks inside.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Hey, what happened to my fish?  Did 
                        you get rid of her?

                                 KYLE
                        Oh, Ashburger?  No, I fell into a 
                        deep depression sleep for about 72 
                        hours after the break-up and kind 
                        of forgot to feed them.  I'm pretty 
                        certain that Kyle-3000, um... Ate 
                        her.  I'm very sorry.
                         (sensitive beat)
                        Here, sit down.

           Kyle pulls another lawn chair into the center of the room.  
           Ashley parks herself inside it.

                                 ASHLEY
                        I'm the one who should be sorry.  
                        If I had known you were gonna be 
                        sitting in patio furniture I never 
                        would have taken the couch.

                        (cid:13)                                 KYLE
                        No, come on, that was your couch.  
                        You supplied the couch when we 
                        moved in, you had every right...

           Kyle smiles at her and scoots his lawn chair closer to hers.  

                                 KYLE
                        Do you feel any closure yet?

                                 ASHLEY
                        No.  Not really.  Do you?

                                 KYLE
                        No.  I'm still just a gaping, wide-
                        open hole of emotional agony.

                                 ASHLEY
                        This is just so impossible.  It's 
                        like losing so much more than just 
                        a boyfriend.  You're the best 
                        friend I've ever had in my whole 
                        life.  I mean, my next best friend 
                        was probably Jenny Bates in 
                        eleventh grade and I stopped 
                        talking to her after she told the 
                        wrestling team that I went down on 
                        our shop teacher, Mr. Lombardo.

                                 KYLE
                        Did you?

                                 ASHLEY
                        No!  She was a total bitch!  That's 
                        my point.  I'm twenty-nine years 
                        old and the only truly great friend 
                        I've ever had I all of the sudden 
                        have to erase from my life.  And it 
                        just... It fucking sucks!

           Ashley faces the floor and tries to keep her eyes from 
           welling up.  Kyle puts a hand on her arm to comfort her.

                                 KYLE
                        Well, who's to say we can't still 
                        be friends?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Friends like, you mean, start 
                        hanging out again friends?  Come 
                        on, that never works.  

                                 KYLE
                        No, not just as friends.  As best 
                        friends.  You said it yourself.

                        (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 KYLE(CONT'D)
                        That's what we were, and that's 
                        definitely what we can still be.

                                 ASHLEY
                        I don't know... What if that just 
                        makes things worse?

           Kyle is struck by a burst of inspiration.  He darts into the 
           bedroom and races back into the living room carrying a HUGE 
           MODEL OF A MOLECULAR COMPOUND.

                                 ASHLEY
                        What's that?

                                 KYLE
                        This is the key to saving our 
                        friendship.  Check it out, it's the 
                        molecular compound for water.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Ok...

                                 KYLE
                        Think of water as what our 
                        relationship was like for the past 
                        five years.  It's made up of two 
                        parts hydrogen -- a shitload of love 
                        -- and one part oxygen -- basic 
                        human companionship.  It's all held 
                        together by attractive forces, which 
                        for our purposes represent all the 
                        sex and stuff we had to combine the 
                        two elements.

           Ashley watches as Kyle starts to break apart the molecule.

                                 KYLE
                        Now, if we simply just eliminate 
                        the attractive forces, then we can 
                        create a reaction that separates 
                        the molecules.
                         (pulls apart the molecule)
                        Resulting in two totally unique 
                        elements!

           Kyle holds up the model, which now contains only oxygen 
           elements.  Ashley stares at it with wonder.

                                 KYLE
                        And this is what's left.  Oxygen.  
                        Perhaps the most vital substance on 
                        planet Earth.  And the scientific 
                        equivalent to friendship.  This is 
                        what we could still be together.   

           Ashley's mind is blown.  It almost makes too much sense now.

                        So, we could still be best friends?

                                 KYLE
                        Yes!  Total BFFs!

                                 ASHLEY
                        I mean, it could work... But we'd
                        have to lay some ground rules first.

           INT. KYLE'S KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER

           Kyle and Ashley pace around the cramped kitchen space, both 
           holding yellow LEGAL PADS and pens.

                                 ASHLEY
                        We'll need some kind of guide to let 
                        us know what is on and off limits 
                        for our friendship at all times.

                                 KYLE
                        Like a Declaration of Co-Dependence?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Sounds a little vague.  How bout 
                        the Ex-Monogamists' Manifesto?

                                 KYLE
                        A bit militant... Oh -- I got it.
                         (proud)
                        The Friendship Constitution.

           Ashley ponders it, then nods.

                                 ASHLEY
                        We should start drafting immediately.

           INT. KYLE'S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Kyle and Ashley are hunched over a tiny desk, scribbling out 
           the terms of their Friendship Constitution.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Ok, we need to start with the most 
                        important thing first and foremost.
                         (beat)
                        No sex.

                                 KYLE
                        Right.  None whatsoever under any 
                        circumstances.

           Kyle starts scribbling away on the legal pad.
                                      (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)

                         (reading aloud)
                        Thou shalt not... Have sex... With 
                        thee.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Yeah, um, you don't really have to 
                        write it up in Ten Commandments 
                        style.  It just sounds a little--

                                 KYLE
                        --Archaic?  Right.  Good call.
                         (scratches it out)
                        Ok -- NO SEX.  That says it all 
                        really.

           THIRTY MINUTES LATER

           Kyle and Ashley are pacing the room, brainstorming more rules.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Here's one.  No badgering the other 
                        person about their break-up 
                        reasons.  No whining from me about 
                        you not wanting to have kids, no 
                        nudging from you about us going to 
                        Costa Rica together.  Sound good?

                                 KYLE
                        Put her on the board.

           AN HOUR LATER

                                 KYLE
                        Alright, and if said friendship 
                        activities carry on well into the 
                        night and/or early morning of the 
                        day's chosen event, no party should 
                        feel obligated to sleep over at the 
                        other party's place of residence.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Ok, and if said party decides that 
                        it is best to sleep over at the 
                        other party's place of residence, 
                        Party #2 will provide sleeping 
                        arrangements in a room separate from 
                        Party #1's primary place of rest.

           Kyle scribbles it all down furiously.

                                 KYLE
                        Wait, hold on.  I don't think I have 
                        any idea what that actually means.

                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                 ASHLEY
                        It means one of us takes the bed, 
                        the other gets the couch.

                                 KYLE
                        Thanks.  Got it.

           AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER

           Kyle and Ashley are running on fumes.  Kyle is spread-eagled 
           over the bed, Ashley sucks down coffee straight from the pot.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Oh, I got another one.  Neither of 
                        us should feel obligated to talk 
                        about any new person we might be 
                        dating, but conversations regarding 
                        new relationships should be 
                        conducted with complete honesty.

           Kyle stirs on the bed, scribbling on the pad without even 
           lifting up his head.

                                 ASHLEY
                        You got that one?

                                 KYLE
                         (barely conscious)
                        Yeah.  Yeah.  Honesty.  Yeah.

           Ashley nods proudly and takes another swig of coffee.

           ANOTHER HOUR LATER

           It's finally dawn and Kyle and Ashley are both curled up in 
           exhausted heaps on the bed.  As first light starts to creep 
           into the room, Ashley's eyes slowly open.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Oh shit.  Kyle, wake up.  We're 
                        sleeping in the same bed.  We're 
                        already breaking rule number twelve!

           Kyle winces at the sight of sunlight.

                                 ASHLEY
                        It's ok.  I'll go sleep in the 
                        other room.

                                 KYLE
                        No -- No, wait.  It's just lawn 
                        chairs out there... I'll go.

                        Are you sure?

                                 KYLE
                        Uh-huh...

           Kyle pulls himself off the bed and grabs a pillow.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Thanks... You're a great friend!

                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KYLE'S CLASSROOM - DAY

           Kyle wheels a TV and DVD player into the classroom.  His 
           STUDENTS all stop their chatter and look up.

                                 KYLE
                        Ok, last second change of lesson 
                        plan today.  For purely educational 
                        purposes, we're gonna be screening 
                        the ground-breaking film, "Weird 
                        Science"... Which will, uh, teach 
                        you all about some exciting new 
                        properties of science... Which are 
                        sometimes weird.  Take notes.

           Kyle starts the movie and parks at his desk.  He whips out 
           the scribbled up Friendship Constitution and resumes editing.  

           INT. COMPUTER LAB - DAY

           Kyle sits in front of a school computer, typing up the final 
           draft of the Constitution.  He makes sure every word is 
           perfect and every margin looks as professional as possible.

           As he works, a super-cute teacher named NATALIE sits down 
           next to him.  Kyle makes nervous eye-contact with Natalie and 
           instantly MINIMIZES the document on his screen.

                                 NATALIE
                        You on Myspace?

                                 KYLE
                        What?  Uh, no.  Well, I used to be, 
                        back before it got too corporate 
                        and I started getting all these 
                        weird sex messages and erectile 
                        dysfunction emails.

           Natalie smirks.

           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                 NATALIE
                        No, I meant right now.  You looked 
                        a little nervous.  Like you had 
                        something to hide.  I know the old 
                        coot who runs the lab is really 
                        cracking skulls on that kind of 
                        tomfoolery.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh... Yeah.  Right.  I guess you 
                        caught me red-handed then...

                                 NATALIE
                        I'm Natalie.  Or Ms. Lawler.  It's 
                        my first year teaching.  I've got 
                        Algebra II Trig and AP Calc.

           Kyle would really like to sit and chat, but he's got bigger 
           fish to fry right now.

                                 KYLE
                        Ok... Cool.  Good luck with all 
                        that.

           Natalie gets up and takes the disappointing hint.  Kyle's in 
           no mood to flirt today.

                                 NATALIE
                        Alright, well... I'll let you get 
                        back to those boner emails then.

                                 KYLE
                         (not even listening)
                        Great, yeah, thanks.  I'll see ya 
                        around.

           Kyle pulls up the Friendship Constitution doc and resumes his 
           work, but then suddenly realizes he's been kind of a dick. 

           He calls out to Natalie before she reaches the door.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, wait -- You said Natalie 
                        Lawler, right?

                                 NATALIE
                        Yeah.

                                 KYLE
                        I'm Kyle Hamberg.  AP Chem, Bio, 
                        and Physics... I'll add you as a 
                        friend.  You know, on MySpace.

           Natalie smiles.

                        Ok.  Thanks.  I accept.

           Kyle nods to her as she leaves and then pulls up his Myspace 
           page.  He types in Natalie's name and clicks "Add Friend." 

           From across the lab, the crazy COMPUTER LAB LADY cries out.

                                 COMPUTER LAB LADY
                        Hey, you! -- Are you on Myspace?! 
                        How many times do I have to say 
                        it??  NO MYSPACE!!

           Kyle ducks down in his chair and minimizes the Myspace page 
           as fast as he can.

           INT. SILVER DINER - DAY

           Kyle and Ashley sit at a tiny table during the busy lunch 
           rush.  A WAITRESS arrives at their table and puts down TWO 
           COFFEES AND A MUFFIN in front of them.

           Ashley looks up at Kyle and smiles.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Thanks.

           Kyle nods and opens up his knapsack.  He pulls out two 
           LAMINATED COPIES of the Friendship Constitution.  He hands 
           one copy to Ashley and holds onto another for himself.

                                 KYLE
                        So, I worked on it all day.  I 
                        think it's perfect.  Every rule is 
                        completely airtight.

           Ashley scans the document, impressed.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Wow, nice.  And it's laminated.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, well, they do it free at 
                        school, so...

           Ashley looks up at him.

                                 ASHLEY
                        So, do you really think we can make 
                        this work?

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, of course I do.  Why else 
                        would we go to all the trouble if 
                        we didn't think--

                        --I know, I know, but... You're not 
                        afraid it might get weird?  I mean 
                        what if things get all screwed up 
                        and we wind up making it all so 
                        much worse?  What if we end up 
                        hating each other and filing 
                        restraining orders and leaving 
                        answering machine messages where we 
                        just breathe into the phone for 
                        like fifteen minutes straight... 
                        What if it, you know... Changes us.

           Kyle looks back at her, slightly pained.

                                 KYLE
                        You really think that could happen?  

                                 ASHLEY
                        No-no, I don't, I just -- I'm just 
                        trying to come at this in the most 
                        analytical way possible.  It's what 
                        I do.  And I just want to make sure 
                        that this is right.

                                 KYLE
                        Ash, this is a way for us to keep 
                        ourselves in each other's lives.  
                        That's most definitely right.

           Ashley thinks it over for a second and nods.  She's in.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Ok, so then what do we do now?

                                 KYLE
                        I don't know... You wanna hang out?

           EXT. NATIONAL MALL - DAY

           Kyle and Ashley PLAY FRISBEE on the green grass of the 
           National Mall.

                                 KYLE
                        Go long!

           Ashley takes off running and Kyle tears off a bomb of a 
           throw.  Ashley DIVES onto the grass to snag it. 

           She pops right up and shows off for all the joggers, dog-
           walkers, and picnickers who applaud her amazing catch.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Thank you!  Thank you, I'm awesome!

           Kyle and Ashley peruse a Georgetown furniture store in search 
           of a nice couch for Kyle.  The STORE OWNER directs them to a 
           gorgeous BLACK LEATHER SOFA.

           Kyle nods to Ashley, and Ashley nods to the Store Owner.

           INT.  PET STORE - DAY

           Kyle helps Ashley pick out TWO NEW TROPICAL FISH from a 
           massive aquarium tank.

           Ashley chooses her favorites and Kyle reaches in with a net 
           to fish them out.

           INT. KYLE'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Kyle and Ashley jump up and down on Kyle's new couch, 
           flinging pillows at each other and cracking up like a couple 
           of wild kids.

           INT. ASHLEY'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Kyle pours Ashley's new fish into her very own aquarium tank.  
           They both crouch down together and smile at the sight of the 
           fish swimming around happily.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

           Kyle and Ashley sit through a horrible romantic comedy 
           together.  They crack each other up while wolfing down 
           handfuls of popcorn.

                                 KYLE
                        This movie is so bad that it just 
                        gave me jock itch.

                                 ASHLEY
                        This movie is so bad that the 
                        Israelis and Palestinians called a 
                        cease fire so they could team up to 
                        beat the shit out of Hugh Grant.

                                 KYLE
                        This movie is so bad that I'm 
                        happily distracting myself with a 
                        montage of memories from my 
                        parents' divorce.

BAR - NIGHT

           Kyle and Ashley are sitting at their own private booth, 
           swapping stories and sharing drinks.

                                 ASHLEY
                        He was not that short!

                                 KYLE
                        Ash, the guy is a lawn ornament.  
                        I'm sorry, but the fact of the 
                        matter is you lost your virginity 
                        to a garden gnome.  He's like 
                        something I'd dangle from my rear 
                        view mirror to amuse myself while 
                        sitting in traffic.

           Ashley rolls her eyes and sips her beer.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Alright, well what about that moron 
                        you dated in college for a year and 
                        a half?

                                 KYLE
                        Which one?  There were many.  

                                 ASHLEY
                        You know... The one who tried to do 
                        her laundry in the dishwasher when 
                        she ran out of quarters.  The one 
                        who called Titanic "The best 
                        documentary I've ever seen."  The 
                        one who decided to become a Spanish 
                        teacher because she was really into 
                        tapas that week.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh, Danielle.  Yeah, I really 
                        thought she was the one for a while 
                        there.

           They both laugh and polish off what's left of their drinks.

           INT. KYLE'S APARTMENT - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           It's 3 AM and Ashley is passed out on the couch, while Kyle 
           sleeps soundly in the lawn chair. 

           Kyle's eyes creep open and he notices that Ashley's blanket 
           is falling off her leg.  Kyle leans over to tuck her in and 
           then parks himself back on the lawn chair.

                                                CUT TO:

           Ashley sits at her desk, multi-tasking with notes, emails, 
           and her schedule.  Cynthia sits across from her on the couch, 
           reviewing Ashley's copy of the Friendship Constitution.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        "Also expressly forbidden are bare 
                        hand massages, foot rubs, or 
                        suggestions of bubble baths that 
                        may be construed as an out of 
                        bounds sexual advance that could 
                        thereby threaten the foundation of 
                        the friendship."
                         (to Ashley)
                        Well, it's thorough.  I'll 
                        certainly give you that.

           Ashley sets aside her work business and turns towards Cynthia.

                                 ASHLEY
                        But is it stupid?  Is it a huge 
                        mistake?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        What are you instincts telling you?

                                 ASHLEY
                        My instincts?  C'mon, Cynthia.  Hit 
                        me with some hard stuff. You're 
                        supposed to be here to slap me 
                        upside the head or say sassy one-
                        liners like "Go get yourself some 
                        strange dick, chica."

                                 CYNTHIA
                        So, is that what you really want?  
                        Strange... Dick?

                                 ASHLEY
                        No!  I just want... The part of him 
                        that doesn't remind me of the 
                        reasons we can't be together 
                        anymore.

           Cynthia reads the conflict inside Ashley and decides to level 
           with her.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Ashley, do you remember four years 
                        ago when my husband died?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Yes.

           (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                 CYNTHIA
                        Well, even though a lot of time has 
                        passed, I still think of him.  
                        Every single hour of every single 
                        day.  I still hear his voice in my 
                        head.  I feel him pull the sheets 
                        while I sleep.  And even though I 
                        know that he's gone... There's 
                        still a part of him that I know 
                        will never truly go away.  And 
                        there is nothing -- Absolutely 
                        nothing -- That could ever get me 
                        to give up that small part of him 
                        that I have left.

           Ashley's heart starts to beat a little quicker as she takes 
           in Cynthia's words.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        So... If keeping Kyle as a friend 
                        is what you have to do to make sure 
                        you don't lose the last piece of 
                        the most important person in your 
                        life... Then do it.  And don't 
                        doubt yourself. 

           Ashley nods and smiles warmly.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Thank you.  I won't.

           INT. SCHOOL AQUATIC CENTER - DAY

           Charlie, wearing goggles and holding a stopwatch, TREADS 
           WATER in the deep end of the school swimming pool.

           After a long beat, Kyle BURSTS out of the water with a HUGE 
           GASP.  He sucks wind hard.  Charlie clicks his stopwatch.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Two minutes, fifteen seconds.

                                 KYLE
                        Dammit.  Still a ways to go.
                         (checking his watch)
                        My heart-rate is way too high too.  
                        There's no way I can survive a 
                        legitimate underwater predator 
                        attack with this level of panic.

           Kyle swims to the shallow end of the pool.  Charlie follows.

                                 KYLE
                        Ok, let's cool down with some water 
                        calisthenics.

           interspersed with underwater jogging.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey, do you still need a ride this 
                        weekend after your session in the 
                        decompression chamber?

                                 KYLE
                        Oh, no thanks.  Ashley said she 
                        could pick me up.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ashley?  What do you have the bends?  
                        Do you need to see Nurse Callahan?

                                 KYLE
                        No, really, it's cool.  We've got 
                        it all worked out.  We decided to 
                        be friends.

           Charlie cuts off his calisthenics mid-water squat.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Friends??  Jesus H., Mr. Hamberg.  
                        You're a cool guy and all, but you 
                        just took a flying leap into the 
                        deep end of an empty pool, pal.  
                        Prepare yourself for the massive 
                        skull fracture and brain 
                        hemorrhaging that await you.

                                 KYLE
                        We're not just friends, Charlie.  
                        We're best friends.  You understand 
                        what that means, right?  We share 
                        an unbreakable bond.  We're like 
                        the chlorofluorocarbons of 
                        male/female friendships.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That's horseshit.  Everyone knows 
                        Lewis acids can bust C-F bonds now.  
                        Your gross naivety astounds me.

           Kyle finishes up his last calisthenic exercise and pulls 
           himself out of the pool.

                                 KYLE
                        Dude, you're way too young to have 
                        this kind of pent-up bitterness 
                        towards females.  Don't you realize 
                        that girls are the greatest gift 
                        science has ever given us?

                        We have all these emotions, all 
                        these unlocked cavities of our 
                        brains, all these otherwise useless 
                        body parts that are so totally 
                        enhanced by the presence of a good 
                        woman...

           Kyle stops himself in mid-thought.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What?

                                 KYLE
                        Towel off.  We're gonna find you a 
                        girl,  Charlie.  

           Kyle grabs a towel and tosses it in Charlie's face.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Kyle and Charlie, both sporting messy wet hair, make their 
           way through the busy cafeteria during lunchtime.

           Kyle is on the lookout for Charlie's perfect match, while 
           Charlie hides nervously behind him.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No, seriously, Mr. Hamberg.  This 
                        isn't necessary.  I'm totally fine 
                        with my hardcore gaming and classic 
                        rock and--

                                 KYLE
                        --And your pursuit of science, 
                        yeah, I know, man.  But there's a 
                        big bleeding hole in your heart and 
                        we're gonna fill it up right now.

           As soon as Kyle puts the period on his sentence, he looks up 
           and sees the PERFECT GIRL.  

           She eats a PB&J with no crusts, wears cute Tina Fey-glasses, 
           and smiles with bright white teeth.  Even Charlie knows it 
           right away.  She's the one.  Her name is ABBY PRENTICE.

                                 KYLE
                        Buckle up, kid.  I'm about to blast 
                        you off into the stratosphere.

           Kyle moves in, as Charlie desperately tries to hold him back.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Mr. Hamberg, wait!  That's Abby 
                        Prentice!  I'm not ready for this!  
                        I need more training!

Kyle 
           flashes Abby and her friends a winning smile that causes 
           cheeks to blush all around.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, Abby.  

                                 ABBY
                        Um, hi, Mr. Hamberg.

                                 KYLE
                        Sorry to bug you girls during 
                        lunch, but I was just wondering... 
                        What's your favorite movie?

                                 ABBY
                        Uh... I don't know... Probably 
                        "Mean Girls."

                                 KYLE
                        That's amazing!  Did you know 
                        Charlie here's favorite movie is 
                        "Mean Girls" too??  That's 
                        incredible!  Tell her, Charlie.

           Kyle pulls out a chair and Charlie nervously sits down.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Uh... Yeah.  It's like totally my 
                        favorite.  Those girls are all just 
                        so mean.  Every time I watch it, 
                        it's just... It's riveting.

           Abby's slightly amused by Charlie's inherent dorkiness.

           Kyle nods in approval and whips out a ten-dollar bill.  He 
           closes it inside Charlie's hand.

                                 KYLE
                        Alright, well I've gotta run, but 
                        you guys keep talking.  Dessert's 
                        on me by the way.

           Kyle offers Charlie a casual fist-pump as he walks away, 
           leaving the two potential lovebirds to enjoy some privacy.

           Charlie slicks back his still wet hair and tries to hide the 
           mile-wide smile on his face.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Anybody want an Astro-Pop?
                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)

MINI-GOLF COURSE - NIGHT

           Kyle and Ashley are deep into a round of mini-golf.  Ashley 
           takes a big hack that sends her ball shooting into the water.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Son of a whore...

                                 KYLE
                        Sorry, that's a one stroke water 
                        hazard penalty.  And a warning for 
                        mild profanity.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Why don't you take a one stroke 
                        shut your hole penalty?

                                 KYLE
                        I think I'd rather watch you try to 
                        make par in two after you take your 
                        drop in the deep rough over there.

           Ashley fishes her ball out of the water and drops it into the 
           rough.  She lines up what appears to be an impossible shot.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Ok.  How 'bout this?  If I can save 
                        par, you have to come with me to 
                        the annual Walls family reunion at 
                        the beach in Maine next month.

                                 KYLE
                        Are you serious?  Missing out on 
                        that trip was like the chief reason 
                        I agreed to go along with the break-
                        up in the first place.  C'mon!

                                 ASHLEY
                        Please!  You know how anxious I get 
                        being around my whole family.  I 
                        need to have a friend there to keep 
                        me sane.

                                 KYLE
                        But don't you remember all the shit 
                        they gave me after I sabotaged your 
                        Dad's lobster traps and went on a 
                        hunger strike during the clam bake?

                                 ASHLEY
                        I told you, they're sympathetic to 
                        your ocean-life moral dilemma and 
                        respect your acts of civil 
                        disobedience... Can't you just do 
                        it for me?
                                        (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)           Kyle softens for a moment and thinks over the idea.

                                 KYLE
                        Alright.  How 'bout this: If you 
                        can save par from here, I'm in.  
                        With no complaints.  I promise.

           Ashley is re-energized as she lines up for the shot.  She 
           crouches down like a real pro golfer to get a proper read on 
           the green.  She stands up and takes a few practice strokes.

                                 KYLE
                        No rush.  Just sometime before the 
                        Earth crashes into the sun, please.

           Putting all the distractions out of her mind, Ashley rears 
           back and takes her cut.  The ball SHOOTS OFF THE COURSE into 
           a water hazard on ANOTHER HOLE.  Ashley's face falls.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Dammit...

           Kyle is about to gloat, until he sees the disappointment in 
           Ashley's eyes.  She really wanted this.

                                 KYLE
                        Alright.  I'll go with you.  Just 
                        because we're such great friends.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Yes!  Oh my God, I own you!

           Ashley's face lights up and she gives him a huge hug.

                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Kyle and Ashley are on-board their flight to Maine.  Ashley 
           puts her hand on Kyle's arm and nods with gratitude.

                                 ASHLEY
                        This is gonna be great.  You're 
                        gonna have so much fun.

           INT. WALLS FAMILY BEACH HOUSE - DAY

           Kyle and Ashley arrive at the family beach house, which is 
           already jam-packed with every Walls on the Eastern seaboard.

                                 ASHLEY
                        We're here!
                                                           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)           Ashley is mobbed by her parents, KEN, late 50s, a former 
           tough guy now a few decades past his prime, and MAGGIE, mid-
           50s, an adoring mom who can't keep the smile off her face.

                                 KEN/MAGGIE
                        You made it!  Come over here!  Give 
                        us a kiss!

           Kyle forces a smile and waits for his own awkward welcome.  
           Ken finally looks up and levels a heavy stare at Kyle.

                                 KEN
                         (deadpan)
                        Oh, look.  Kyle made it too.  Isn't 
                        that great?

           Kyle shakes hands with Ken, who delivers a crippling grip.  
           Kyle turns towards Maggie and gives her a hug.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, how are you guys?  This is 
                        awesome, isn't it?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Kyle, we were all just talking 
                        about what a trooper you are for 
                        still coming even after...

                                 ASHLEY
                        Mom, can we not?

                                 KEN
                        Not what?  Talk about those five 
                        years you guys had, three living 
                        together, which ended with pretty 
                        much the farthest thing from a ring 
                        on my daughter's finger?

           The entire room falls silent.  Kyle is frozen solid.

                                 KEN
                        I'm kidding!  Jesus, nobody around 
                        here gets my jokes.  Why is everyone 
                        else allowed to be funny but me?

           Maggie leads Ashley towards the countless AUNTS, UNCLES, and 
           COUSINS waiting to greet her.  Kyle hangs back with Ken.

                                 KYLE
                        I thought it was a good one, Mr. 
                        Walls.  I definitely laughed.
                                                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                 KEN
                        Yeah, whatever kid.  Now, I know 
                        it's a far cry from slumming it in 
                        that one bedroom landfill you call 
                        an apartment, but while you're 
                        under my roof, you're gonna be 
                        rooming with Mark, alright?

           Kyle turns and spots Ashley's 18-year-old brother, MARK.  He 
           wears a cut-off T-shirt and flashes guns that would make 
           Lebron James jealous.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh yeah, what's up man?  Wow, you 
                        been working out?  You're looking 
                        pretty cut there.  Lot of 
                        definition in the traps area...

           Mark shakes Kyle's hand and turns away.

                                 MARK
                        Yeah.

           The rest of Ashley's family crowds around in a big group, 
           leaving Kyle on his own.  

           Ashley turns and spots him.  She gives Kyle a huge smile and 
           mouths "Thank you."  Kyle puts on a brave face and gives a 
           genuine thumbs up in return.

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           As countless pairs of legs scurry through the chilly ocean, 
           Kyle swims underwater as hard and as fast as he can.  He 
           finally surfaces wearing a HIGH-TECH SCUBA MASK, which makes 
           him look like the biggest freak on the beach. 

           Ken takes a break from body surfing and calls out to him.

                                 KEN
                        Hey, Kyle.  What're you doing out 
                        there?  Dry humping a hermit crab?

                                 KYLE
                        Huh?  No, just practicing swimming 
                        against current while simultaneously 
                        skimming for sand dollars.
                         (pulls out a handful of 
                          sand dollars)
                        Want one?

           Ken blows him off and summons Mark and the other Walls men.
                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)
                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                 KEN
                        Hey, everyone bring it in, let's 
                        play a little beach ball.  Kyle, 
                        you're in too, unless you're too 
                        afraid to get sand in your pussy.

           Kyle glares at Ken, whips off his scuba mask, and puts on his 
           game face.

                                 KYLE
                        Alright, Ken.  Let's play.

           EXT. BEACH - MINUTES LATER

           Ken and Mark have picked teams, and the two sides are ready 
           to play.  Kyle heads over with Mark's team and huddles up.

                                 MARK
                        Ok, I'm all-time QB.  Here's the 
                        play: Andy, you run an eight-yard 
                        curl, Colin, a deep post, Uncle 
                        Rob, a stop and go to the end zone, 
                        and Kyle, a standard option route 
                        over the middle.  Ready?  Break!

           Kyle looks over at everyone else as they break the huddle.  
           They know exactly what to do.  Kyle is left clueless.  

           The team lines up on the sand against Ken's squad.  Ken 
           wastes no time covering Kyle.

                                 KEN
                        Kyle, keep your head on a swivel, 
                        ok son?  I play a physical game.

                                 KYLE
                        Only way to play in my opinion, Ken.

           Kyle looks over at Mark, who is ready to hike the ball.

                                 MARK
                        Hut!  Hut-hut!  Hike!

           Mark hikes the ball and everyone starts running.  Kyle tries 
           to find a patch of empty sand to park himself for the catch. 

           He settles down and looks over towards Mark, but something in 
           the distance catches his eye.

           It's ASHLEY, pulling off an over-sized T-shirt to reveal the 
           HOTTEST RED BIKINI ever worn since Phoebe Cates in "Fast 
           Times at Ridgemont High."  Kyle's jaw drops to the floor.

                                 KYLE
                        Sweet mother of Hey-zeus...

           (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)           Ashley looks like she walked off the cover of the SI Swimsuit 
           Issue.  Kyle is compelled to walk off the beach and mount her 
           right there, until the ball HITS HIM RIGHT IN THE FACE.  

           Kyle grabs his bleeding nose, as the ball floats into Ken's 
           hands for an easy interception.  Ken then lowers his shoulders 
           into Kyle, SENDING HIM FLYING face first into the damp sand.  

           Kyle looks up to see Ashley gasping in horror.  For a second, 
           Kyle is resigned to taking his beating like a chump, until he 
           looks up and sees Ken high-stepping towards the end zone.

           The bad news right now is the girl in the ultra-hot red 
           bikini is no longer Kyle's girlfriend.  But the good news is 
           the asshole who just laid him out isn't his future father-in-
           law anymore either.  

           And realizing that, Kyle decides to...

                                 KYLE
                        Fuck it.

           KYLE JUMPS TO HIS FEET and takes off in a DEAD SPRINT.  He 
           runs faster than he ever has before, taking two strides to 
           every one of Ken's.

           Before long, the two men are neck-and-neck.  Just a few feet 
           away from the end zone, Kyle DIVES onto Ken's back and 
           PUNCHES the ball out of his grasp.

           THE BALL IS LOOSE.  Kyle and Ken scramble on all fours across 
           the beach, both eating sand trying to wrestle the pigskin 
           away from each other.  Brutal manliness on full display.

           The scrum becomes increasingly dirty and personal, until Kyle 
           finally snatches the ball away and gets to his feet.  Now 
           it's a foot race in the other direction.

           The rest of the family is captivated.  Ashley stands with her 
           jaw-dropped, while the men in the family cheer as loudly as 
           they can.

                                 MALE FAMILY MEMBERS
                        C'mon, Ken!/Get his ass!/Drop the 
                        hammer!

           Kyle runs his ass off, utterly exhausted, until he looks up 
           and sees Ashley cheering him on.  He digs down deep, and with 
           Ken on his heels, he LAUNCHES HIMSELF IN THE AIR and dives 
           into the end zone for the score.

           Ken, hands on his hips, looks down at Kyle with a blank face.  
           A hush falls over the rest of the family as Kyle rises to 
           meet Ken's stare.
                                                                (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                               (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                              (cid:13)           After a long and brutally uncomfortable beat -- A SMILE 
           finally crosses Ken's face.

                                 KEN
                        C'mere, you son of a bitch!

           Ken pulls Kyle into a huge bear hug.  The rest of the family 
           gathers around, cheering and taking pictures.

                                 KEN
                        Was that a helluva play or what?!

           The men of the family applaud Kyle like he's some kind of 
           demi-god.  He soaks up every ounce of praise and glory, until 
           he turns and locks eyes with Ashley.

           She still looks amazing, but there's sadness in her smile now.  
           It's the sight of Kyle, utterly joyful and surrounded by her 
           adoring family. 

           This is what she's wanted for so long.

                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ASHLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ashley sits up in bed, wide-awake and unable to sleep.  She 
           shifts restlessly all over the mattress.  Something has been 
           keeping her up all night.

           INT. MARK'S BEDROOM - SAME

           Kyle and Mark are tucked into identical twin beds lined up 
           five-feet apart from each other in the cramped room.

           Kyle tosses and turns as well, desperate to find a comfortable 
           angle.  He finally settles flat on his back and we see the 
           source of Kyle's irritation -- He has PITCHED A HUGE TENT 
           under the covers.

           And this bad boy isn't going away any time soon.

           INT. ASHLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

           Ashley's frustration finally boils over and she digs deep 
           into her suitcase in search of her VIBRATOR.  

           She hops back into bed and sneaks the vibrator below the 
           covers, but as she turns it on, nothing happens.

           She pulls the vibrator up from underneath the sheets and 
           flicks it on and off again.  Still nothing.  She unscrews the 
           bottom and finds that the device has no batteries.

           (cid:13)           INT. MARK'S BEDROOM - SAME

           Kyle, huge tent still pitched, leans over the side of the bed 
           and stares at Mark to make sure he's still asleep.

                                 KYLE
                        Mark... Hey, Mark... Mark, there's 
                        a fire... Wake up, you're literally 
                        on fire right now...

           No response.  Convinced that Mark is out like a light, Kyle 
           sneaks his hand down under the sheets and starts to jerk off.  

           A RUSTLING SOUND underneath the covers starts to get a little 
           faster and a little louder.  Suddenly, Mark's eyes SHOOT OPEN.

                                 MARK
                        Hey, Kyle... You awake?

           Kyle freezes.

                                 KYLE
                        Um, I am now.  Ever since you just 
                        said that.

                                 MARK
                        Did you hear that weird sound?

                                 KYLE
                        No... Did you?

                                 MARK
                        Yeah, that's why I asked if you did.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh, ok... Cause I didn't.  I think 
                        you must have dreamt it.

           Mark knows he's being fed bullshit.

                                 MARK
                        Are you jacking off in my bed, dude?

                                 KYLE
                        What??  No!  Come on... That's 
                        disgusting.  Don't be absurd.

                                 MARK
                        Seriously, man.  I spent an entire 
                        month at sleepaway lacrosse camp 
                        last summer.  I know what a 
                        midnight jerk sesh sounds like.

           Kyle knows he's totally busted.

                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                 KYLE
                        Alright... Fine.  But honestly, I 
                        would never do it unless it was an 
                        extreme emergency.  Really, this 
                        was more of a medical concern for 
                        me than anything else.

                                 MARK
                        So, were you, like... Thinking of 
                        my sister?

                                 KYLE
                        Huh?  No!  No way.  I was thinking 
                        of Carmen Elecktra and that chick 
                        from "Lost"... Spanking each other 
                        and shit.  Swear to God.

           Mark stares down Kyle and shakes his head.

                                 MARK
                        Just do it in the bathroom if you 
                        gotta go, man.

           Kyle darts out of the bed hunching over to shield his boner.

                                 KYLE
                        You got it.  This'll never happen 
                        again.  You have my word.

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Kyle darts into the bathroom and parks himself on the toilet, 
           ready to finally kill the pain.

           He breathes for a moment and strikes up a good memory, but 
           the moment is over almost as quickly as it begins when Kyle 
           looks up and sees a FRAMED PICTURE OF JESUS CHRIST staring 
           right at him from the bathroom wall.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh, Jesus...

           Kyle tries to shut his eyes and block out the distraction, 
           until the DOORKNOB STARTS SHAKING.

                                 ASHLEY (O.S.)
                        Hey -- Who's in here?  Open up, 
                        this is an emergency!

           Kyle yanks up his boxers and unlocks the door for Ashley.  
           She's wearing nothing but a TOWEL over her naked body.

                                 KYLE
                        Holy shit.  What're you doing here?

                        I'm... I'm gonna take a shower.

                                 KYLE
                        It's two in the morning.

                                 ASHLEY
                        I know.  This is when I always take 
                        my shower.

                                 KYLE
                        No it's not. 

           Kyle follows Ashley's eyes to the REMOVABLE SHOWER HEAD 
           dangling harmlessly from the shower wall.  

           Ashley quickly blinks away and gets an eye-full of the 
           massive tent that Kyle still has pitched beneath his boxers.

           Both parties have now been exposed, and they try to save as 
           much dignity as possible while they still can.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Alright, I'm just gonna go -- I can 
                        shower up tomorrow.  No big deal--

                                 KYLE
                        --Oh no, you take over in here, I'm 
                        all done--

                                 ASHLEY
                        --No-no!  You were here first.  
                        It's all yours.  I'm just gonna... 
                        Yeah, I'll see ya.

           Ashley darts out of the bathroom and shuts the door, leaving 
           Kyle all alone.  Ashley then pokes her head back in.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Hey -- You wouldn't happen to have 
                        four triple-A batteries lying 
                        around by any chance, would you?

                                 KYLE
                        Uh, no... Fresh out.  Sorry.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Ok.  Goodnight.

           Ashley leaves again, and Kyle sits back down on the toilet 
           and sighs.  He leans back and receives one more awkward 
           glance from the picture of J.C. hanging on the wall.

AIRPLANE - DAY

           Kyle and Ashley both fidget and jerk around in their seats 
           during the middle of their flight.

           They each fiddle with their headphones, leaf through in-
           flight magazines, and skooch their seat-backs up and down, 
           desperate to find some much needed comfort.

           It's not happening for either one of them.

           INT. ASHLEY'S PRIUS - DAY

           Ashley white-knuckles the wheel as she drives her and Kyle 
           through rush-hour traffic.  She and Kyle continue to squirm, 
           until Kyle has finally had enough of the madness.

                                 KYLE
                        Ok -- You know what?  I've gotta 
                        start lobbing some knowledge bombs 
                        before I lose my mind here, so I'll 
                        just come right out and say it: I 
                        am outrageously horny right now.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Oh-my-God, you too?

                                 KYLE
                        Me too?  Fuck yes, me too.  What 
                        the hell were you thinking prancing 
                        around in that red bikini all 
                        weekend?  My dick feels like it's 
                        about to break itself off and punch 
                        me in the face right now.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Oh please, don't act like you're 
                        the only one.  You were being all 
                        heroic and masculine with your High 
                        School Hero act, winning the hearts 
                        and minds of my entire family.

                                 KYLE
                        Alright, well congratulations, that 
                        makes no sense whatsoever.  You're 
                        the one who has clearly been firing 
                        up five thousand tummy crunches a 
                        night in an effort to turn my 
                        schlong into a goddamn balloon 
                        animal.  Yet you're turned on by 
                        what?  The image of me eating a 
                        starfish sandwich while your Dad 
                        tries to Russian suplex me?

                        It was the idea of you that was sexy 
                        more than anything else.  I waited 
                        five years for my parents to buy 
                        into you, then we break up and all 
                        of the sudden my Dad wants to have 
                        you over for barbeque and a keg 
                        throwing competition.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh, so it was the idea of me that 
                        acted as the tractor beam pulling 
                        you towards the removable shower 
                        head at 2 o'clock in the morning?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Grow up.  It's not like you weren't 
                        locked up in there for the sole 
                        purpose of jerking it too.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, I was, until I looked up and 
                        saw the Messiah judging me from his 
                        perch on high on the bathroom wall.  
                        Do you have any idea how difficult 
                        it is to rub one out while you're 
                        being stared down by Jesus Christ?  
                        It's almost impossible.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Trust me, if there was a way to 
                        take care of this all painlessly, 
                        I'd do it in a heartbeat.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, well when you find out, let me 
                        know.  It feels like I'm carrying a 
                        fifteen pound free-weight in the 
                        place where my cock used to be.  I'm 
                        like a human sundial over here.  If 
                        I show up to school like this on 
                        Monday, I'm gonna wind up at the 
                        center of a Dateline special report.

           Ashley exhales deeply and looks over at Kyle.

                                 ASHLEY
                        So then what do we do?

           INT. KYLE'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Kyle and Ashley burst into the apartment, still as worked up 
           and sexually frustrated as ever.

                        Absolutely not.  The Friendship 
                        Constitution is airtight.  You said 
                        it yourself!

                                 KYLE
                        Ok-ok-ok, but this is a special 
                        circumstance.  A medical emergency.  
                        And I really doubt my HMO will 
                        cover me taking care of this 
                        situation in any other way.

           Ashley crosses her arms.  She doesn't want to give in, but 
           she's about to lose her mind too.

                                 ASHLEY
                        So, then what do we do?  Just throw 
                        out the Constitution?

                                 KYLE
                        No, of course not!  Just ask 
                        yourself -- What does Congress do 
                        when part of the real Constitution 
                        goes out of date?  They amend it.  
                        Why can't we do the same thing?

                                 ASHLEY
                        But... It's laminated.

           Kyle dives into his junk drawer and pulls out a BLACK SHARPIE.

                                 KYLE
                        And I'm all stocked up on permanent 
                        markers, bitches.

           INT. KYLE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Kyle and Ashley lay over the covers on Kyle's bed, gripping 
           the Friendship Constitution and the Sharpie.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Alright, so how do we amend this?  
                        It says "NO SEX" in capital letters.  
                        God, it's the very first rule!

                                 KYLE
                        How 'bout this?  No sex -- Unless 
                        absolutely necessary to protect the 
                        sanctity of the friendship.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Are you serious?
                                      (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)

                        Come on, you saw how we were going 
                        at it in the car.  We were a half-
                        step away from a full-blown domestic 
                        violence incident.  Seriously, this 
                        is for our own good here.

           Ashley sighs.  She knows it's wrong, but she can't help 
           herself either.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Ok.  But, really, just this once.

                                 KYLE
                        Of course.

           Kyle writes in the amendment and then hurls the Constitution 
           and Sharpie across the room.  He and Ashley tear off their 
           clothes and maul each other.

           TEN MINUTES LATER

           Kyle and Ashley lay naked under the covers, both completely 
           spent and relieved.  They each catch their breath and turn 
           towards each other.

                                 ASHLEY
                        So, hypothetically speaking, do you 
                        think the world would come spinning 
                        off its axis if we were to... I 
                        don't know... Do that again?

                                 KYLE
                        Honestly, I think what we just did 
                        helped restore equilibrium to the 
                        universe and it would be 
                        potentially reckless to dismiss it.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Maybe we should amend the 
                        Constitution to give us an open-
                        ended number of sex acts for the 
                        rest of the day?

                                 KYLE
                        Done.

           Kyle grabs the Constitution, makes another amendment, and 
           then pounces back on Ashley once again.

           INT. KYLE'S APARTMENT - ANOTHER DAY

           Kyle and Ashley fall onto the new couch and pull each other's 
           clothes off while sucking face hardcore.
                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)

                        God, this new couch is amazing.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Yeah, it's fantastic.

           Their mouths lock again and shirts, shoes, and everything in 
           between gets tossed onto the floor.

           INT. ASHLEY'S APARTMENT - ANOTHER DAY

           Kyle and Ashley watch another lame movie at Ashley's place.

                                 KYLE
                        This movie sucks so bad that... 
                        That it sucks.

                                 ASHLEY
                        This movie is so bad that... I 
                        don't even care anymore...

                                 KYLE
                        This movie is so bad that all I can 
                        think about right now is sex.

           Ashley grabs the remote and turns off the TV.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Fuck this movie.

           She pulls Kyle onto the couch and straddles him.  Her 
           tropical fish look on while they get down to it.

           INT. ASHLEY'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT

           Kyle and Ashley are making out and undressing each other once 
           again.

                                 KYLE
                        Be honest, was it embarrassing when 
                        you had to request a booster seat 
                        for your high school boyfriend on 
                        prom night?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Not as embarrassing as your ex-
                        girlfriend claiming that spray-on 
                        tans help combat the effects of 
                        Global Warming.

                                 KYLE
                        I'm just curious, what is it like 
                        to lose your virginity to a legally 
                        recognized dwarf?

                        Ok, shut up now.

           Ashley rips off Kyle's shirt and pins him on the bed.

           INT. KYLE'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT

           Kyle and Ashley are passed out asleep on Kyle's bed.  Kyle 
           suddenly stirs awake and realizes their rules violation.  

           Instead of pulling himself up and heading out onto the couch, 
           he reaches for the Constitution and makes another timely 
           amendment.

           He drops the Constitution on the floor and wraps his arms 
           around Ashley's sleeping body.

                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Kyle and Charlie eat lunch together.  Kyle sips a bowl of 
           soup, while Charlie tries to put his finger on something.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Did you wear that tie yesterday?... 

                                 KYLE
                        Huh?  Oh, this?  Uh, I don't 
                        know... Maybe.

                                 CHARLIE
                        And what's that stain on your 
                        shirt?  Looks like the remnants of 
                        yesterday's sloppy joes.

                                 KYLE
                        I, uh... I don't--

                                 CHARLIE
                        --Where you been spendin' your 
                        nights, Mr. Hamberg?

                        You nailing your ex?

           Kyle chokes on his soup.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, keep it down, alright?  That 
                        kind of talk could cost me my job.

                                 CHARLIE

                        Alright-alright... Maybe we're... A 
                        bit more involved than I originally 
                        anticipated.  But it's ok.

                                 CHARLIE
                        My white ass, it's ok.  Do you 
                        realize what you're doing here?  
                        You're sliding on a slippery slope 
                        down Shit Mountain, my friend.  
                        Better wear a raincoat.

           Kyle finishes up his lunch and leans in towards Charlie.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, Charlie, no offense, but I 
                        think I know how to manage my own 
                        relationships, ok?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I'm sorry, was that you talking, or 
                        was it your cock and balls sending 
                        a message directly through your 
                        central nervous system?
                         (beat)
                        Mr. Hamberg, I'm not trying to give 
                        you a hard time here, I just don't 
                        wanna see you get hurt.  I mean, 
                        there are plenty of available chicks 
                        out there for you to waste your 
                        energy on who aren't gonna leave you 
                        in an emotional straight-jacket.

                                 KYLE
                        C'mon, man.  You can't really 
                        expect me to take relationship 
                        advice from you.  It's only been a 
                        month since I set you up with Abby.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shit yeah, and I've already tallied 
                        three handjobs to my name because 
                        of it.

                                 KYLE
                        And... I'm fired.  Thanks, bro.  
                        Appreciate the real talk.

           Charlie pushes his tray aside and gets serious.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Look, Mr. H., I just want to return 
                        the favor here.  You and Abby have 
                        helped pull me out of a very dark 
                        and lonely time in my life, and I 
                        want to do the same for you before 
                        it's too late.  Ok?

                                 (cid:13)                                 KYLE
                        And how're you gonna do that?

           Charlie motions to a table across the room, where Natalie is 
           clearly checking out Kyle from afar.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Peep Ms. Lawler over there 
                        unbuckling your pants with her eyes 
                        while enjoying that breadstick a 
                        little too much.

           Kyle turns and makes brief eye-contact with Natalie.  She 
           glances away and takes a small bite of her breadstick.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Classic oral fixation and a phallic 
                        symbol to boot.  Plus have you 
                        smelled her hair?  It's like 
                        someone made a weave out of a 
                        vanilla candle.

           Kyle just shakes his head and then turns around to exchange 
           one more nervous smile with Natalie.

           EXT. DC STREETS - DAY

           Ashley and Cynthia, both decked out in jogging suits, power 
           walk down the streets of DC.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Ashley, I have to be honest with 
                        you, I really don't think engaging 
                        in an open relationship with your 
                        ex-boyfriend is the proper way to 
                        find closure here.

                                 ASHLEY
                        That's what I thought at first too, 
                        but I've experienced nothing but 
                        positive changes in my life since 
                        Kyle and I started doing it again.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Like what?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Like my power walking.  I'm moving 
                        at an unprecedented pace here.  And 
                        my metabolism is so high, I can eat 
                        whatever I want now.  I had a box 
                        of Double-Stuffed Oreos for lunch 
                        today.  And I'm pretty sure my 
                        astigmatism is cured.

                        Ever since we did it in the shower 
                        last week, I don't have to wear my 
                        contacts anymore.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Not to be contrarian, but I find 
                        all of that very hard to believe.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Come on, the mind is more powerful 
                        than the body, you know that.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        So you think having all this sex 
                        with Kyle is really just medicine 
                        for your mind?

           Ashley knows Cynthia can see right through her.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Ok, fine.  I'm pretty sure I have a 
                        collapsed lung from all this power 
                        walking, I gained four and a half 
                        pounds from the Oreos, and my 
                        astigmatism is--
                         (she walks straight into a 
                          fire hydrant)
                        OW!!  Son of a bitch!  That golden 
                        retriever came out of nowhere!
                         (deep breath)
                        Ok, so what do I do?  Start dating 
                        again?  I don't think I even know 
                        how to do that anymore.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Why don't you let me introduce you 
                        to some new men?  You're not the 
                        only one who's on the lookout here.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Really?  You wanna be my wing-lady?  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Is that what they call it now?  
                        Wing-lady?  I'm not really familiar 
                        with that term.  But ok.

           Ashley smiles and picks up her pace again.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

           It's the end of the day and the halls are nearly empty.  Kyle 
           and Charlie walk together and approach Natalie's classroom.

           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 CHARLIE
                        Alright, I'll toss the alley on 
                        this oop.  Just follow my lead and 
                        strike up an innocent convo.

           Before Kyle can back out, Charlie strides into Natalie's 
           classroom.  Natalie sits at her desk grading papers.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey, Ms. Lawler?

           Natalie looks up from her papers.

                                 NATALIE
                        Hi, Charlie.  What's up?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Um... Nothing.  Mr. Hamberg here 
                        was just wondering what your 
                        favorite movie is.

           Natalie peers forward and sees Kyle half-hidden behind the 
           doorway.  He casually lets himself into the room.

                                 NATALIE
                        Hmm... I guess if pressed I'd have 
                        to say... "Doctor Zhivago."  Mr. 
                        Hamberg, what's your favorite movie?

                                 KYLE
                        Uh... Probably "Ghostbusters 2."  
                        The sequel.

           Natalie puts her papers aside and smiles at Kyle.  Charlie 
           gives Kyle a thumbs up and slips away gracefully.

           EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

           Kyle walks Natalie to her car.  In the background, the soccer 
           and field hockey teams practice on nearby fields.

                                 NATALIE
                        And even though Zhivago is married, 
                        he falls in love with a political 
                        activist's wife who becomes his 
                        muse and basically forces him to 
                        choose between fidelity and passion 
                        all during the height of the 
                        Bolshevik Revolution.

                                 KYLE
                        Nice... That sounds pretty cool 
                        actually.

           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                 NATALIE
                        It is.  Maybe I could show it to 
                        you sometime.  And you could show 
                        me the Ghostbusters.  It could be 
                        like a double feature.

           Kyle and Natalie's pleasant moment is suddenly interrupted 
           when a SOCCER BALL sails off the field and into the parking 
           lot.  Kyle snags the ball and BOOTS it back onto the field.

                                 NATALIE
                        Whoa, nice leg.  Hey, you know, some 
                        of my friends out here just signed 
                        up for this adult kickball league.  
                        Have you ever heard of that?

                                 KYLE
                        Adult kickball?  No, but it sounds 
                        like the sole reason I was put on 
                        this earth.

                                 NATALIE
                        So, you wanna play then?  Can I 
                        sign you up?

           Kyle can't say no to that smile.  He just can't.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah.  Sign me up.

           INT. CONGRESSIONAL COUNTRY CLUB - BALLROOM - NIGHT

           Cynthia leads Ashley into the tastefully decorated ballroom 
           at the prestigious Congressional Country Club.  

           The floor is packed with OLDER AND DISTINGUISHED MEN AND 
           WOMEN, who all make Ashley look like a child by comparison.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Uh, Cynthia... What is this?  I 
                        thought you said we were going to a 
                        club?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        We are at a club, dear.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Yeah, but I thought you meant like 
                        Love, or H2O, or Zanzibar...

                                 CYNTHIA
                        I have no idea what those places 
                        are.  This is a country club.

           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)
                                 (cid:13)                                 ASHLEY
                        Oh... So, then what are we here for?

           Cynthia directs Ashley to a sign by the doorway that reads: 
           "WELCOME TO JEWISH SINGLES NIGHT!"  

           Ashley's face falls as she takes in the much older and wildly 
           un-sexy clientele out looking for love.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Oh no... No, Cynthia, this isn't 
                        what I was expecting at all.  
                        Everyone here is so...

                                 CYNTHIA
                        What?  Uptight?  Distinguished?  
                        Overdressed?--

                                 ASHLEY
                        --Fucking old.

           Cynthia is clearly embarrassed.  Ashley scrambles to recover.

                                 ASHLEY
                        I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like 
                        that.  I'm just feeling like a fish 
                        out of water here is all.

           Cynthia scans the club's slim pickings as the truth settles 
           in.  Then her eyes suddenly perk up.  She has an idea.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        You know, an old girlfriend of mine 
                        from college mentioned that her son 
                        moved out to DC to work as a 
                        lobbyist.  Jeffrey is his name.  I 
                        think she said he's newly single 
                        too.  I don't know if that sounds 
                        like someone you'd be interested 
                        in, but if you want his number I 
                        can--

                                 ASHLEY
                        --Actually, you know what, I've 
                        been thinking about it a lot and... 
                        What if Kyle's Costa Rica 
                        Fellowship isn't that bad after 
                        all?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Isn't that bad for what?

                                 ASHLEY
                        For us.

                        But what about your family, and 
                        your job, and your--

                                 ASHLEY
                        --I know, I know, but... It's only 
                        two years, right?  And if I give 
                        Kyle two years to have his 
                        adventure, then maybe he'll finally 
                        be ready to give me mine.  
                         (beat)
                        I told him I didn't want to go 
                        because I don't want to live on the 
                        precipice of the unknown... But 
                        looking around here... It feels 
                        like I'm already there.

           Cynthia watches Ashley stare into the abyss of sad and lonely 
           singles.  It's clear Ashley's mind is made up.

           INT. KYLE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Kyle is building the biggest multi-meat sandwich ever made.  
           He stands in amazement at his creation and gets ready to take 
           the first bite, until his phone RINGS.  He answers.

                                 KYLE
                        Hello?

                                                INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. ASHLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

           Ashley paces the floor, nervously clutching the phone.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Hey, it's me.  Um, I just wanted to 
                        call you real quick and ask you a 
                        question.

                                 KYLE
                        Ok, lemme guess.  There's a party 
                        in your pants and you need my 
                        Yahoo address so you can forward 
                        the E-vite to my dick.

           A long, awkward beat.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Um, no.  Look, I've been doing a 
                        lot of thinking lately about stuff.  
                        I don't know, mostly us... And I 
                        think we should sit down and talk 
                        things over soon.

                        (cid:13)                                 KYLE
                        Is everything ok?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Yeah, no, everything's fine.  I 
                        just think we should talk.  It's 
                        important, but... I think it's a 
                        good thing.  Don't be nervous.

                                 KYLE
                        Alright.  So, when can we do this?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Are you free for dinner tomorrow?

                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Natalie proudly walks down the crowded halls carrying a 
           BRIGHT RED T-SHIRT.

           She locks in on Kyle's classroom and walks inside.

           INT. KYLE'S CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kyle is at his desk amusing himself with a fun little science 
           experiment in which he holds a blown-up balloon over the 
           rising flame of a Bunsen Burner.

                                 KYLE
                         (turning the flame up)
                        Yes... Keep burning... The 
                        Invincible Balloon lives!

           Natalie enters and smirks at the sight of Kyle living out his 
           science fair dreams.

                                 NATALIE
                        Hey, Mr. Wizard, you still wanna 
                        kick some balls with us tonight?

           Kyle looks up and the over-heated balloon BURSTS in his hand.  
           He grabs at the floating pieces of charred balloon bits and 
           shuts off the burner.

                                 KYLE
                        What? -- Oh-Oh yeah.  I'm in, baby.

           Natalie holds up the T-shirt and hands it over to Kyle.

                                 NATALIE
                        Great!  Welcome to "Saved by the 
                        Balls."
                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                               (cid:13)           Kyle admires the shirt and pulls it on over his button-up and 
           tie to see how it fits.

           EXT. NATIONAL MALL - AFTERNOON

           Kyle arrives on the field just in time for the pregame warm-
           ups.  He spots Natalie waving him over to join the rest of 
           the team.  Kyle jogs over and Natalie gives him a hug.

                                 NATALIE
                        You made it, awesome.
                         (to team)
                        Hey guys, this is Kyle.  He's new 
                        to kickball, so go easy on him, ok?

           The rest of the team offers meek waves and hellos.  They look 
           like a pretty ragtag group.

                                 KYLE
                        So who's our first victim?

           Natalie points across the field.

                                 NATALIE
                        Them.

           Kyle's eyes go wide as he spots a team of FINELY-TUNED 
           ATHLETES engaging in a synchronized stretching routine.

           They all sport IDENTICAL HEADBANDS AND MATCHING HIGH-SOCKS, 
           which move in perfect rhythm as they count out an intense 
           round of jumping jacks.

           The team name on their jerseys reads: "SUCK MY KICKS"

                                 KYLE
                        They don't look so tough.

           The Suck My Kicks engage in a WILD MOSH PIT CELEBRATION that 
           fires the team up to a truly unnecessary level.

           EXT. KICKBALL FIELD - MINUTES LATER

           The two teams take their positions as the game is about to 
           get underway.  The Suck My Kicks are up first, and one by one 
           they BLAST the ball into the gaps, scoring almost at will.

           The Saved by the Balls crew looks lost, as their opponents 
           waste no time in breaking their spirit.  Finally, Kyle takes 
           control by calling a team huddle.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, guys!  Time out!  Bring it in!

           for some guidance and leadership.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, um, I know most of you guys 
                        don't know me, but I'm a science 
                        teacher.  And this game is at least 
                        90 percent pure physics.  If it's 
                        ok, I'd really like to pitch to the 
                        next few batters.

           Kyle's teammates have no qualms with his request.  The 
           PITCHER hands over the ball.  Natalie looks on, impressed.

           Kyle takes the mound and lines up for his first official 
           kickball pitch.  He breathes deep, rears back, and rips off a 
           SCREAMING PITCH that takes a WICKED CURVE over the plate.

                                 UMPIRE
                        Strike!

           The Suck My Kicks take notice and shut the fuck up.  Kyle 
           flashes a broad grin.  He knows it's on now.

           KYLE'S KICKBALL MONTAGE:

           --Kyle HURLS another NASTY PITCH that leaves the Suck My 
           Kicks befuddled.  Strike outs and easy pop flies abound.

           --Stepping up for his first at-bat, Kyle whips a ground ball 
           down the third baseline.  He races towards first as fast as he 
           can, just barely beating the throw with a HEAD FIRST SLIDE.

           --Kyle DIVES, JUMPS, and HURTLES in order to get his hands on 
           every fly ball within reach.  He scoops up grounders with 
           grace and PELTS opposing BASE RUNNERS square in the back for 
           easy and humiliating outs.

           --Kyle RUNS THE BASES like a madman, rounding third with home 
           plate square in his sights.  He acrobatically DODGES the 
           throw home and SWAN DIVES to score an amazing run. 

           --With a tie score in the final inning, Kyle steps up to the 
           plate with a chance to win it.  He stares down the PITCHER 
           and rears back to kick, launching a CRUSHING DRIVE deep into 
           centerfield and OVER THE FENCE.

           It's a HOME RUN!  Natalie and the rest of the team GO WILD, 
           as Kyle rounds the bases pumping his fist like Kirk Gibson in 
           the '88 NLCS.

           (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                           (cid:13)           EXT. NATIONAL MALL - EVENING

           The sun sets as the teams head in from the fields.  Kyle 
           slaps five with his new teammates.  Natalie chases from 
           behind to congratulate him.

                                 NATALIE
                        Hey Slugger, you coming to the bar 
                        to celebrate?  It's pretty much the 
                        real reason we play, so we have an 
                        excuse to drink excessively on a 
                        Tuesday night.

                                 KYLE
                        Are you kidding?  That's awesome...
                        Oh wait... Shit, I forgot I've 
                        already got something tonight.

                                 NATALIE
                        Can't you cancel?

           Kyle mulls it over for a long moment.  Natalie flashes 
           another smile that's impossible to say no to.

           INT. IRISH TIMES BAR - NIGHT

           Kyle shouts into his phone over the ROWDY BAR CROWD.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, Ashley?!  Can you hear me?

                                                INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. ASHLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

           Ashley, looking great in a new special occasion dress, yells 
           back into the phone.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Yeah, what's up??

                                 KYLE
                        I got kinda bogged down playing 
                        kickball tonight.  The team is out 
                        celebrating our historic victory... 
                        You think we can push this dinner 
                        back to another day?

                                 ASHLEY
                        You... You're playing kickball?  
                        With who?
                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                 KYLE
                        Nobody, just some new friends.

           Kyle looks over to Natalie, who's playing a fierce game of 
           flip cup against the Suck My Kicks.  Natalie nails her flip, 
           then turns and smiles at Kyle.

                                 KYLE
                        Actually, why don't you just come 
                        over here.  We can talk at the bar.  
                        Is that cool?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Uh... Yeah, I mean it was kind of 
                        something important, but I guess--

                                 KYLE
                        --Awesome!  Thanks, bud!

           Kyle hangs up and heads back to the action at the bar.  

                                                BACK TO:

           INT. ASHLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

           Ashley stands frozen, confused and annoyed.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Bud?... I'm a fucking bud?

           INT. IRISH TIMES BAR - HALF AN HOUR LATER

           Kyle, Natalie, and the rest of their team win another game of 
           flip cup against the dejected Suck My Kicks clan.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh my God, we're so good!  It's 
                        like physically impossible for us 
                        to lose at this point!

           Natalie, now more than a few sheets to the wind, grabs Kyle 
           around the neck and hugs him.

                                 NATALIE
                        We are fucking awesome!

                                 KYLE
                        I know!  It's so fantastic!

           Kyle hugs her back.  A long hug.  A hug that neither one of 
           them is in any rush to end.  Kyle then looks up and sees 
           Ashley entering the bar.  He pulls away from Natalie.

           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                 KYLE
                        Hey, I'll be right back, ok?

           Kyle slips away and meets Ashley on the other side of the bar.

                                 KYLE
                        Sweet, you made it.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Yeah.  This looks fun.  So, uh, 
                        who's the chick? 

                                 KYLE
                        What chick?

                                 ASHLEY
                        The one who was just dry humping 
                        your leg over there.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh, who, Natalie?  She's just... 
                        She's just this math teacher.  You 
                        know, nobody.  Just a friend.

           Ashley glances up towards Natalie and sees her scoping out 
           Kyle from afar.  Ashley knows it's time to spring her big 
           news now.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Ok... Well, um, I wanted to meet 
                        with you tonight to tell you...
                         (beat)
                        To tell you I've decided I want to--

                                 NATALIE (O.S.)
                        --Kyle!  You still playing?  C'mon!

           Kyle directs his attention up at Natalie.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, gimmie one second.  I'm 
                        coming right up.
                         (to Ashley)
                        Hey, uh, we're right in the middle 
                        of a game right now.  You mind if 
                        we do this a little later?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Um... Ok, but--

                                 KYLE
                        --Awesome, thanks.  Oh, and you're 
                        still in for chaperoning the Winter 
                        Ball with me next week, right?

                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                 ASHLEY
                        Uh, yeah.  Sure.

                                 KYLE
                        You rock.  I'll call you tomorrow.

           Kyle takes off back towards the flip cup game.  Halfway 
           there, he stops in his tracks and turns back to Ashley.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, wait, I'm sorry -- Didn't you 
                        say you had something important you 
                        wanted to talk about?

           Ashley stops on her way to the door and answers without 
           hesitation.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Don't worry... It's not important 
                        anymore.

           Kyle watches her go, confused.  After a moment, Natalie walks 
           up behind him and drags him back to the flip cup game.

           INT. DC STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           Ashley, struggling to mask her hurt, stomps down the sidewalk 
           on a mission.  Her phone is glued to her ear.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Cynthia?... You awake?

                                                INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. CYNTHIA'S OFFICE - SAME

           Cynthia pushes aside some work on her desk and removes her 
           eye-glasses.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Of course I'm awake Ashley, it's 
                        seven-thirty.  I'm not an invalid, 
                        you know?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Right, well... I think I'm gonna 
                        need that number.  Of that guy you 
                        know?  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Really?  What changed your mind?

                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 ASHLEY
                        Nothing, just... Just Kyle's out at 
                        a bar with this Algebra tramp with 
                        a great ass and really stupid shiny 
                        hair and I just need to...

           Ashley trails off.  She doesn't want to say it, but Cynthia 
           can read her mind through the phone.

                                 CYNTHIA
                         (cringing)
                        Go get yourself some strange dick, 
                        chica?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Damn straight.

           INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - AFTERNOON

           A group of TEACHERS and STUDENTS work to transform the 
           school's dusty gym into a winter wonderland in preparation of 
           the upcoming Winter Ball.

           Kyle struggles to carry an entire long table all by himself 
           across the length of the gym floor.  While Kyle strains 
           himself, Charlie simply surveys the room with a keen eye.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, it's cool, man.  Don't help 
                        me out or anything.
                         (drops the table)
                        I got it.

           Charlie helps Kyle straighten out the table.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Only because I admire and respect 
                        you, Mr. Hamberg.  But I'm here on 
                        a reconnaissance mission of my own.

                                 KYLE
                        And what're you running recon for?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Trying to scope out the top spots to 
                        share that special Winter Ball HJ 
                        with Abby tomorrow night.  I'm 
                        thinking behind the bleachers would 
                        be doable, but it's a little 
                        commonplace.  The fifty-yard-line is 
                        empowering, but a bit cliché.

           Kyle starts taping paper snowflakes along the wall.
                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                 KYLE
                        Nice to hear you two kids are 
                        working out.  By the way, I'm 
                        surrounded by superiors and 
                        colleagues right now, so can we 
                        keep this convo PG please?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No prob.  That reminds me, what's 
                        going on with you and Ms. Lawler's 
                        fine ass?

           Kyle sneaks a peak across the gym at Natalie, who stands atop 
           a ladder, hanging a LARGE BANNER.

                                 KYLE
                        Not much.  I just -- I don't think 
                        I'm ready to start dating someone 
                        new yet.  I mean, Ashley and I were 
                        together for over five years.  
                        Think of where you were five years 
                        ago.  It's like I hardly remember 
                        how dating even works anymore.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Mr. H., five years ago I was locked 
                        up in my room, sitting on the top 
                        bunk doing the same thing to my 
                        privates that my once-in-a-lifetime 
                        ladyfriend now does to me out of 
                        the pure goodness of her heart.  
                        The more things change, the more 
                        they stay the same.  Just keep 
                        talking to her.  You still know how 
                        females work.

           Kyle keeps watching Natalie as the banner goes up.  Her smile 
           radiates even from forty yards away.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, but I gotta lay off.  Ashley 
                        is gonna help chaperone the dance 
                        with me.  I don't wanna do 
                        something that could totally mess 
                        up our friendship.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Mr. Hamberg, come on, how are you 
                        not getting this yet? -- Women are 
                        non-recyclable.  It's not possible 
                        to eat a delicious chocolate chip 
                        cookie and then poop it out into 
                        something useful like a satellite 
                        radio.  When love has run its 
                        course, it just turns into shit

           stack of paper snowflakes.

                                 KYLE
                        Alright, Dr. Phil, deck the halls 
                        in this place and get out of my 
                        sight.  Go on.  Seriously, you're 
                        giving me a headache.

           Charlie shrugs and retreats to the other side of the gym.

           EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Ashley walks nervously towards the small coffee shop where 
           she is set to meet Jeffrey.  As she approaches the door, she 
           checks out her reflection in the window.  

                                 ASHLEY
                        Ugh, you hag.

           Ashley frantically adjusts her hair and clothes as fast as 
           she can.  She looks a bit crazed as JEFFREY, 30s and kind of 
           impossibly good looking, steps out of the shop.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Ashley?

           Ashley turns with one hand stuck in her hair and the other 
           tucking her blouse into her skirt.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Um... Yeah?...

                                 JEFFREY
                        Jeffrey.  It's great to meet you.

           Ashley removes the hand from her skirt and gives Jeffrey a 
           warm shake.  He turns to a small table right behind him.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I hope you don't mind I ordered for 
                        us.  Cynthia said you're a big 
                        blueberry muffin fan.

           Ashley looks over at the table.  A steaming hot coffee and an 
           amazing looking muffin are waiting for her.  

                                 ASHLEY
                        Wow.  That's perfect.  Thank you.

                                 JEFFREY
                        No problem.  And don't worry.  You 
                        look great.

           off her face.

           INT. KYLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Kyle stands in front of the mirror and ties a perfect Windsor 
           knot, completing the smooth ensemble he has put together for 
           the dance tonight.

           He adjusts his collar and blazer and admires how well he has 
           cleaned up for the special occasion.

                                 KYLE
                        I'm like a white Will Smith.

           He takes a satisfied breath and then holds up both hands in 
           front of him like the Lady Justice statue.

                                 KYLE
                        Ok...
                         (looks at one hand)
                        Friendship with Ashley...
                         (looks at the other hand)
                        Sex with Natalie.
                         (one hand)
                        Friendship with Ashley.
                         (other hand)
                        Sex with Natalie.

           He weighs both hands and makes his decision by holding the 
           Friendship with Ashley hand high above the other.

                                 KYLE
                        It is decided.

           INT. ASHLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

           Ashley stands in front of a mirror as well.  She looks great 
           in another knockout dress with her hair done perfectly.

           Just as she wraps up the finishing touches, her phone starts 
           to RING.  She grabs it and answers.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Hello?

                                                INTERCUT WITH:

                        Ashley.  It's Jeffrey from the 
                        other day.  How's it going?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Oh, hey.  I'm fine.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Great.  So, listen, I had a really 
                        awesome time meeting you and... 
                        Well, I got tickets to this gala 
                        tonight at the Museum of Natural 
                        History.  I know it's really late 
                        notice and it's totally ok if you 
                        don't wanna go, but... I think we'd 
                        have a great time together if you 
                        wanna check it out.

           Ashley tries to stall before she makes her choice.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Oh -- Um, can you just give me one 
                        second?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Sure.

           Ashley sets the phone down and weighs her options.  She turns 
           to a PICTURE on her dresser of her and Kyle holding each 
           other prom-photo style at last year's Winter Ball.

           She holds the picture up close and stares at it.  She's even 
           wearing the same dress now as she was then.

           She sets the photo face down on the dresser and picks the 
           phone back up.  She realizes it's time for a change.  

                                 ASHLEY
                        Hey -- I'd love to go.  I'm even 
                        already dressed for it.

           INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           Kyle stands against the wall and sways back and forth to the 
           beat of the hip-hop jam that the kids are all rocking out to.

           In the center of the floor, Charlie and Abby clutch each 
           other tightly and slow dance, while the rest of their 
           CLASSMATES jump around and go crazy.

           Kyle nods his approval to Charlie as he recognizes the sight 
           of first love.  Charlie gives Kyle a thumbs up in return.

           Kyle's mind quickly shifts to Ashley, and he whips out his 
           phone to send her a quick text reading "Hey where are you?"

           standing by herself on the other side of the gym.

           Ashley walks through the museum doors alongside a herd of the 
           rest of DC's best and brightest.

           She scans through the crowd and sees Jeffrey, decked out in a 
           smooth tux, waiting for her under a huge WOOLLY MAMMOTH.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Wow, you look better than 
                        Pocahontas.

                                 ASHLEY
                        I know, that bitch has nothing on 
                        me.

           Jeffrey laughs and gives Ashley a hug and a kiss on the cheek.  

                                 JEFFREY
                        C'mon, I want to introduce you to 
                        some people you're gonna like.

           The DJ starts up a smooth slow jam and all the kids instantly 
           pair off and start dancing cheek-to-cheek.  

           Kyle moves his way through the crowd, keeping one eye on all 
           the kids, and the other on the lookout for Ashley.

           He searches far and wide, but doesn't see her anywhere.  He's 
           just surrounded by a swarm of young lovers, leaving himself 
           feeling like the only single in the room.

           Jeffrey holds court with a group of WASHINGTON BIGWIGS, who 
           all sip flutes of expensive Champagne.  

           Jeffrey has them eating out of his hand.  Every other word 
           from his mouth earns big smiles and nods of approval.

                                 JEFFREY
                        So I sat him down and said -- Rich, 
                        I only want you to ask yourself one 
                        thing: Do you wanna live in our 
                        world, or in theirs?  That's all it 
                        took.

           (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                             (cid:13)           Off to the side stands Ashley.  Just like Kyle, she looks 
           swallowed up by the mass of social circles all around her.  

           Ashley checks her cell phone and sees she has a text from 
           Kyle.  She reads it and instantly feels like an asshole.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Shit...

           She texts Kyle back and glances up to see Jeffrey waving her 
           over.  She flips her phone shut and joins Jeffrey and his 
           audience.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - SAME

           The slow song reaches a powerful crescendo just as Kyle gets 
           a new text from Ashley.  It reads "So sorry. Big emergency 
           with a patient. Can't make it."

           Kyle closes his phone and slumps his shoulders.  He's 
           seriously bummed.  Charlie sidles up beside him and offers 
           his support.

                                 CHARLIE
                        She's not coming, huh?

                                 KYLE
                        No... Something about a work 
                        emergency.  What can you do, right?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I know what you can do.  That sweet 
                        piece of polynomial ass standing 
                        all by her lonesome against the 
                        wall over there.

           Kyle glances over to Natalie and sees her smiling at him.  He 
           offers a brief wave and smiles back.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Alright, Mr. H., I'm outta here.

                                 KYLE
                        Already?  But the dance just 
                        started.  Where're you headed so 
                        soon?

           Charlie motions towards the exit doors, where Abby is 
           anxiously waving Charlie over.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I got a date with the softest right 
                        hand in three states.

           Charlie takes off towards Abby with a spring in his step.  
                                                                   (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)

He sighs and then 
           turns back towards Natalie.  He starts walking towards her, 
           and she starts walking towards him.

           They meet in the middle of the dance floor, surrounded by 
           dozens of slow dancing kids.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey.

                                 NATALIE
                        Hey.

                                 KYLE
                        Do you... Wanna dance?

           Natalie nods and puts her arms around his neck.

                                 NATALIE
                        Absolutely.

           Kyle puts his arms around her waist and they sway together 
           looking not at all unlike the kids all around them.

           INT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - NIGHT

           Ashley and Jeffrey share a drink together by the bar.  The 
           rest of the party continues to bustle all around them.

                                 JEFFREY
                        So you're sure this isn't like 
                        pulling teeth for you?  I just hate 
                        going to these things alone, it 
                        makes it feel like more work.

                                 ASHLEY
                        No, come on.  This is... Fun.

           Jeffrey can tell she's faking it a little bit.

                                 JEFFREY
                        You wanna get out of here and find 
                        some place a little more private?

                                 ASHLEY
                        What do you have in mind?

           Jeffrey reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a couple 
           cookies made in the shape of tiny dinosaurs.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I don't know, but I've got cookies 
                        shaped like little dinosaurs.

The guy's a politician 
           alright, but he's still got charm.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Yeah.  Ok.

           Jeffrey takes Ashley's hand and leads her away from the 
           party, towards the woolly mammoth exhibition.

           INT. KYLE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Kyle and Natalie, still in their Winter Ball attire, sit on 
           the floor watching the tense finale to "Ghostbusters 2."  

           They both share a pint of Haagen-Daaz and watch with wide-
           eyes as PETER VENKMAN talks shit to the evil VIGO.

                                 BILL MURRAY/PETER VENKMAN
                        Only a Carpathian would come back 
                        to life now and choose New York.  
                        Tasty pick... Bonehead!  If you had 
                        brain one in that huge melon on top 
                        of your neck, you'd be living the 
                        sweet life in Southern California's 
                        beautiful San Fernando Valley...

           Vigo responds with a SCREAM and pulverizes Venkman and the 
           other Ghostbusters with a paralyzing wave of energy.

                                 BILL MURRAY/PETER VENKMAN
                        Oh, darn it... Oh, darn it!

           Kyle's eyes light up like he's watching the movie for the 
           first time.

                                 KYLE
                        Jesus!  He's amazing!  Who else can 
                        deliver a line like that?  
                        Seriously?  Who else can deliver a 
                        line like that?

           Natalie laughs and plays along.

                                 NATALIE
                        Nobody.

                                 KYLE
                        Who's the star of Doctor Zhivago?

                                 NATALIE
                        Um... Omar Sharif.

                                 KYLE
                        Ok, can Omar Sharif deliver a line

                        Only in dreams.

                                 KYLE
                        Exactly!  See, you get it.  You 
                        totally get it.

           As the slime-filled climax plays out on-screen, Kyle and 
           Natalie can't take their eyes off each other.

                                 KYLE
                        You know... I forgot to tell you... 
                        I really like your dress.

                                 NATALIE
                        Oh yeah?

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah.  The way it sparkles and 
                        everything.  It's great.

                                 NATALIE
                        This was actually my senior prom 
                        dress.  Thank God it still fits.

           A soft silence falls over them.  Natalie takes Kyle's hand.

                                 NATALIE
                        I was kind of a prude back then... 
                        I never got a chance to take it off 
                        for anyone on prom night.
                         (beat)
                        Do you want me to take it off for 
                        you?

           The Ghostbusters are still sliming the shit out of each other 
           on TV.  Kyle's gaze doesn't break from Natalie.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah...

                                 NATALIE
                        Alright...

           Natalie slips the straps down from her dress and unzips the 
           back.  Before she removes the rest, she leans in and KISSES 
           Kyle.  Hard.

           Kyle grabs onto the dress and takes care of the rest.

                                                CUT TO:

SILVER DINER - DAY

           Kyle and Ashley sit down for another important lunch.  Kyle 
           takes a breath and gathers his nerves.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, uh, I just wanted to get 
                        together because... Well, because I 
                        haven't seen you much lately, and I 
                        just wanted to talk and see how you 
                        were doing.

                                 ASHLEY
                        I'm great.  How are you?

                                 KYLE
                        I'm... I'm awesome.

           It starts to feel awkward.

                                 KYLE
                        Ok, and, um, just in keeping with 
                        the spirit of the Constitution... I 
                        think I should tell you that I'm 
                        kind of seeing someone right now.  
                        So, I don't know if we're gonna be 
                        able to keep... You know...

                                 ASHLEY
                        Oh... Oh, you mean keep... Yeah-
                        yeah, totally.  That definitely 
                        makes sense.

                                 KYLE
                        Ok.  Cool.  You know, it just says 
                        we're supposed to be completely 
                        honest about all this stuff.  I'm 
                        glad you under--

                                 ASHLEY
                        --I'm seeing someone too.

           Kyle flinches.  He's caught way off-guard.

                                 KYLE
                        Really?  Like, since when?

                                 ASHLEY
                        I don't know, not very long.  He's 
                        a lobbyist, he asked me out to this 
                        cool political event and... So, 
                        yeah...

                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                 KYLE
                        Oh, alright.  Alright, nice...
                         (beat)
                        Wait -- So, is that where you were 
                        the night of the Winter Ball?  When 
                        you cancelled on me?

                                 ASHLEY
                        What?  Oh -- Um... I-I can't 
                        remember.  There was a whole bunch 
                        of stuff going on that day, and it 
                        was just--

           Kyle hits back.

                                 KYLE
                        --So, I'm dating that girl from the 
                        kickball team.  You know, the math 
                        teacher?

                                 ASHLEY
                        The math teacher?  You mean the one 
                        who was "just a friend"?

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, well... She's kind of more 
                        than a friend now.  Obviously...  

                                 ASHLEY
                        Oh, well that's really nice.  A 
                        math teacher and a science teacher.  
                        You guys should be very happy 
                        leading the fight against Global 
                        Warming and disproving the 
                        existence of God together.

           The tension starts to rise between them, although neither 
           side wants it to get ugly.  Ashley takes a breath and tries 
           to soften.

                                 ASHLEY
                        But I'm happy for you, Kyle.  
                        Really.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh, thanks, yeah.  I'm happy for 
                        you too.

                                 ASHLEY
                        You don't have to be.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, but I am.

           Kyle reaches into his pocket and pulls out his copy of the 
           Constitution.  It's littered with amendment scribbles.
                                     (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                 KYLE
                        In fact, I'm gonna go ahead and add 
                        an amendment stating that I do have 
                        to be happy for you, no matter who 
                        you decide to date, or why.

           Ashley reaches into her purse and makes the amendment to her 
           copy of the Constitution as well.

                                 ASHLEY
                        And I'm making the same amendment, 
                        so we can both agree to be happy 
                        for each other.  Which is exactly 
                        what I am... For you...

                                 KYLE
                        Great.  Thank you.

           They each take a sip of water while grinding their teeth.  

                                 KYLE
                        We can still be friends though.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Oh sure.

                                 KYLE
                        Like, still be each other's best 
                        friend.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Why not?

                                 KYLE
                        Exactly.
                         (beat)
                        Uh, so... You wanna hang out?

                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. NATIONAL MALL - DAY

           Kyle and Ashley play another game of frisbee on the National 
           Mall fields.

           Kyle's eyes look like they've had all the fun sucked out of 
           them.  He throws a long pass to Ashley that goes way over her 
           head.  She doesn't even attempt to catch it.

           The frisbee sails into the waiting jaws of a DOG, who promptly 
           runs away with it.  Ashley just watches and gives no chase.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Screw it...

MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

           Kyle and Ashley check out another lame movie together.  They 
           both watch in obvious states of misery.

                                 KYLE
                        This movie blows cock.

                                 ASHLEY
                        No shit.  Can we just go?

                                 KYLE
                        Sure.

           They both get up and walk over the other patrons on their way 
           towards the exit row.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Kyle and Ashley pound beers and trade sideways glances, as 
           the bitterness between them starts to really swell.

                                 KYLE
                         (mean)
                        Hey, remember that time you lost 
                        your virginity to a fucking midget?

                                 ASHLEY
                         (meaner)
                        Remember that year and a half of 
                        your life you wasted pretending you 
                        were in love with a functional 
                        retard?

                                 KYLE
                         (muttering)
                        She didn't give head like a 
                        retard...

                                 ASHLEY
                        What??

           Kyle finishes his beer and looks away.

                                 KYLE
                        Nothing...

           EXT. KYLE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Kyle and Ashley stand awkwardly outside the door to Kyle's 
           apartment.
                                      (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                             (cid:13)

                        So, um... You know, I'd totally 
                        like to keep hanging out or 
                        whatever, but I've got dive 
                        training tomorrow morning so...

                                 ASHLEY
                        Oh yeah, no problem.  I've got stuff 
                        that needs doing too.  Somewhere.

                                 KYLE
                        Ok, cool.  Well, we'll do this 
                        again... You know, a little later.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Ok.  Yeah.  Sure.

           They both share the briefest hug possible and part without 
           even a goodbye.  Before long, Ashley fades into the herd of 
           foot-traffickers flooding the sidewalk.

           INT. ASHLEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Ashley watches TV on the couch next to Jeffrey, trying to 
           keep her irritation with Kyle from registering on her face.  

                                 JEFFREY
                        Hey, you alright?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just...

           She's suddenly distracted for a moment as she glances over at 
           her AQUARIUM.  She sees that ONLY ONE of the tropical fish 
           remains in the tank.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Hey, did something happen to my 
                        fish?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Oh yeah, it was the weirdest thing.  
                        You must have forgotten to feed 
                        them for a little while or 
                        something, 'cause when you were in 
                        the bathroom I saw one of them 
                        literally eating the other one.  It 
                        was insane!  Can you believe that?

           Ashley's shoulders fall as she keeps staring at her one 
           surviving fish, drifting alone in the water.

           A TINY BLUE GILL FISH wanders alone in the underwater depths.  
           Far off in the distance, Kyle swims through the dark and 
           dingy water, decked out in full SCUBA GEAR. 

           Kyle explores the vast underwater environment all around him.  
           It is still and empty.  Almost no sea life within sight.

           He keeps swimming and swimming as far as he can, but that 
           doesn't change the feeling that he's all alone down here.

           INT. NATALIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The doorbell rings and Natalie answers.  Kyle steps inside 
           and gives her a hug and a kiss.

                                 NATALIE
                        Hey you.  How was the dive today?

                                 KYLE
                        Awesome.  I got all the way to 100 
                        feet deep.  One more weekend of open 
                        water training and I'm certified.

           Kyle pulls a charming bottle of cheap wine from behind his 
           back and hands it over.

                                 KYLE
                        So, in case you wanted to celebrate 
                        by getting wasted and throwing 
                        yourself at me tonight, I got you 
                        this.

                                 NATALIE
                        Aw, how sweet.  Hold on a sec, I'll
                        pour us a glass.

           Natalie bounces into the kitchen, leaving Kyle to mill about 
           the room.  The apartment is intellectually decorated.  Lots 
           of thick books on the shelves and art on the walls.

           Kyle spots a row of FRAMED PHOTOS lined up on one of the 
           bookshelves.  He checks out the shots of Natalie with all her 
           friends and family.  

           One of the photos is of a TEENAGE NATALIE surrounded by a 
           group of classmates, all wearing matching vests.  A BANNER 
           reads: "St. Augustine Math Mavericks - 1998 State Champs."

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, congrats on winning the state 
                        math mavericks title ten years ago.  
                        That must have been sweet.

           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                 NATALIE
                        Oh, the photo?  Yeah, that was 
                        actually the day I decided that 
                        teaching math was my true calling 
                        in life.

           She comes back into the living room holding two glasses of 
           wine.  Kyle keeps looking at the photo.  He spots a GOOFY GUY 
           with AWFUL TEETH next to Natalie with his arm around her.

                                 KYLE
                        Whoa, who's this guy beside you 
                        giving you the rubdown?

                                 NATALIE
                        Oh, that's Daniel.  He was my high 
                        school boyfriend.

                                 KYLE
                        Seriously?  And you weren't 
                        bothered by the busted grill he's 
                        sporting there?

                                 NATALIE
                        What?

           Kyle keeps teasing in a playful way.

                                 KYLE
                        I mean, c'mon, those teeth are 
                        insane.  Did you wear a mouth-guard 
                        when you guys made out?  He looks 
                        like he's sucking on a bear trap 
                        for God's sake.

           Kyle anticipates a laugh, but instead Natalie just snatches 
           the photo from his hand and puts it back down on the shelf.

                                 NATALIE
                        You don't have to be a jerk...

                                 KYLE
                        Shit, no, I'm sorry.  I was just 
                        having a little fun.  I'm sure 
                        Daniel's a helluva guy.  And a 
                        brilliant mathematician.

           Natalie sees that Kyle meant no harm, so she lets it slide.

                                 NATALIE
                        It's ok.  Let's just watch the 
                        movie.

           Kyle and Natalie sit closely together on the couch, watching 
           another epic scene in "Doctor Zhivago."  

           Natalie is completely riveted.  Kyle looks like he wants to 
           jump out the window.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, uh, quick question.  About how 
                        long is this movie?  Approximately?

                                 NATALIE
                        Why?  You don't like it?

                                 KYLE
                        No-no, I'm just wondering if I'm 
                        gonna have to file for social 
                        security by the time it's over.

           Natalie pulls away from Kyle and glares at him.  He tries to 
           respond with a winning smile.

                                 KYLE
                        What?  You're offended?

                                 NATALIE
                        How can you not love this movie?  
                        It's a classic.

                                 KYLE
                        Well, yeah, on the list of all-time 
                        great film mustaches, Zhivago is 
                        top ten with a bullet, but c'mon, 
                        if I see one more sweeping 
                        landscape or fur hat I'm gonna 
                        thumb out my own eyeballs.

                                 NATALIE
                        It's incredibly moving.  It won six 
                        Oscars!

                                 KYLE
                        For what?  Most suicide attempts 
                        inspired by a feature film?  I 
                        mean, hell, I'm about two minutes 
                        away from opening up a vein right 
                        here on your couch.

           Natalie angrily turns off the TV.

                                 NATALIE
                        This is such bullshit.  I sat all 
                        the way through your shitty movie 
                        and never complained once!

                        Whoa-whoa-whoa, let's not say things 
                        we're bound to regret in the 
                        morning.  Ghostbusters 2 is and 
                        always will be an American treasure.

                                 NATALIE
                        Jesus, you're really serious about 
                        that movie, aren't you?  I thought 
                        you were just showing it to me as a 
                        gag.  It was horrible.  They made 
                        the Statue of Liberty walk by 
                        spraying it full of pink jizz!  On 
                        what planet does that even remotely 
                        make sense?

                                 KYLE
                        How many times do I have to tell 
                        you? -- It was positively charged 
                        slime!  It's not that complicated!

           They both pause for a moment to cool down and catch their 
           breath.  For the first time, Kyle looks legitimately troubled.

                                 KYLE
                        Can I ask you something?

                                 NATALIE
                        What?

                                 KYLE
                        Could you ever see us having a water 
                        balloon fight in the apartment?  Or 
                        dressing up as Han Solo and Princess 
                        Leia for Halloween?  Or racing to see 
                        who can be the fastest to chug a 
                        gallon of milk?

                                 NATALIE
                        Kyle... What's your point?

                                 KYLE
                        My point is how're we supposed to 
                        be a couple if we can't be each 
                        other's best friend first?

           Natalie sighs and shakes her head.

                                 NATALIE
                        I'm twenty-eight years old, Kyle.  
                        I've already got plenty of friends.  
                        If all you want out of a 
                        relationship is another buddy... 
                        Then maybe you should just go.

           Kyle nods and grabs his coat.

           (cid:13)                                 KYLE
                        Yeah.  You're right.  See you at 
                        school on Monday.

           He lets himself out, leaving Natalie utterly dumbfounded.  

           EXT. DC STREETS - NIGHT

           Kyle races through the streets, clutching his cell phone.

                                 KYLE
                        Ashley?  Ashley, you there??

                                                INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. ASHLEY'S APARTMENT - SAME

           Ashley, wearing an old T-shirt and sweats, talks on the phone 
           in the corner of the apartment.  Jeffrey watches TV well out 
           of earshot.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Kyle?  What is it?  What do you 
                        want?

                                 KYLE
                        I have to see you.  Meet me for 
                        dinner tomorrow night.  Our entire 
                        friendship -- No, our entire lives 
                        depend on it.

           Ashley looks over at Jeffrey, who is still none the wiser.  

                                 ASHLEY
                        Ok.  Fine.  But this better be 
                        important.  I don't have time to 
                        just goof around with you anymore.

                                 KYLE
                        I promise it's going to change your 
                        life.  For the better.

           Kyle hangs up and pumps his fist in the middle of the street.

           INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Kyle, wearing a dusty suit that hasn't come out of the closet 
           in years, sits anxiously at the best table in the house.  He 
           spots Ashley entering the room and waves her over.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey!  Ash, over here!
                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)           Ashley is confused, but still downright radiant.  She sits 
           and quickly starts angling for the fastest possible exit.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Hey.  So, I can't really stay long.  
                        Jeffrey's coming over later and--

                                 KYLE
                        --I decided I'm ready to have kids.

           Ashley blinks back at him for a beat.

                                 ASHLEY
                        I'm-I'm sorry?

                                 KYLE
                        I'm totally ready.  I'm good to go.  
                        The engine is primed and I'm fired 
                        up to start making babies.  

                                 ASHLEY
                        O-kay... Where the hell did this 
                        come from?

                                 KYLE
                        I thought about it and you're too 
                        important to me.  I want to do 
                        whatever it takes to keep you in my 
                        life.

                                 ASHLEY
                        So, having a child with me right 
                        now is your definition of "doing 
                        whatever it takes"?

                                 KYLE
                        Right.  Exactly.

           Kyle reaches under the table and hands Ashley a SHOPPING BAG 
           full of gifts.

                                 ASHLEY
                        What's all this?

                                 KYLE
                        Look inside.  Check it out.

           Ashley opens up the bag and pulls out a BABY ONESIE that 
           reads "I Heart My Daddy."

                                 KYLE
                        Isn't that the cutest thing ever?  
                        I mean can you imagine that being 
                        worn by an actual baby??  How 
                        freaking cute would that be?
           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)           Ashley keeps digging through the bag.  The next thing out is 
           a BOX SET of The Wiggles: Greatest Hits.

                                 KYLE
                        You know The Wiggles, right?  
                        They're huge with babies right now.  
                        Like Duran Duran circa 1984 huge.  I 
                        got another set for my car as well, 
                        I'm totally digging it so far.

           Struggling to control the look of horror on her face, Ashley 
           pulls out the last item in the bag.  It's a PICTURE FRAME 
           with a photo of a RANDOM BABY inside.

                                 ASHLEY
                        And what's this?

                                 KYLE
                        A picture... You know, of a baby.

                                 ASHLEY
                        But whose baby is it?

                                 KYLE
                        It's just the one that came with 
                        the frame.  I figured you could 
                        just look at that random baby until 
                        we have our own, and then we could 
                        replace it with a photo of whatever 
                        our baby looks like.  Which will 
                        totally be way cuter than that one. 
                         (beat)
                        So, what do you think?

           Ashley stuffs the items back in the bag and stares at Kyle, 
           pain rising in her eyes. 

                                 ASHLEY
                        I can't believe you.

           Kyle shifts uncomfortably in his seat, totally caught off 
           guard by Ashley's reaction.

                                 KYLE
                        What?  What's wrong?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Are you serious -- What's wrong??  
                        What's wrong is a month ago, I went 
                        temporarily insane and asked you to 
                        dinner to tell you that I was ready 
                        to uproot my life and live on a 
                        boat in Costa-fucking-Rica--

                        --Wait, hold on, you never said 
                        anything about coming with me on 
                        the fellowship.

                                 ASHLEY
                        I know, 'cause you had already 
                        blown me off for that geometry 
                        slut.  And now you want to come 
                        back weeks later and try to pull 
                        this shit?  After I've finally 
                        managed to move on?  Fuck off!

           Heads start to turn around the restaurant at the sight of 
           Ashley's anger.  

                                 KYLE
                        What is wrong with you?  I'm 
                        willing to give up everything I 
                        have, my future, my dream job... 
                        Just to make you happy!

                                 ASHLEY
                        Oh nice, I could really get used to 
                        having that held over my head for 
                        the next forty or fifty years.  You 
                        decide you'd rather settle down with 
                        me than contract scurvy and pull 
                        rabid Man-o-Wars out of your asshole 
                        for two years and that's supposed to 
                        make me want to be the mother of 
                        your child?  Christ, Kyle -- I don't 
                        even want to be your friend anymore.

           Kyle staggers as he absorbs the gut punch.

                                 KYLE
                        Ok, well, that's kind of fucked up.

                                 ASHLEY
                        No, what's fucked up is you telling 
                        me you want to be best friends, 
                        when you really just want to line 
                        me up for some cheap ass while you 
                        move in on other chicks.

                                 KYLE
                        I'm sorry?  Line you up for cheap 
                        ass?  From my perspective, it 
                        seemed like a pretty even split on 
                        who was soliciting the sex here.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Bullshit.

           meltdown happening right before their eyes.  Kyle doesn't 
           even notice as he whips out his cell phone.

                                 KYLE
                        Ok, well to confirm, I'm just gonna 
                        flip through a few of your old text 
                        messages.  Here we go.  "There's a 
                        hunger inside of me.  Come over."  
                        Real subtle.  "I like my vagina the 
                        same way I like my turkey -- 
                        Stuffed."  Thanksgiving-themed.  
                        How festive.  Oh, here's a good 
                        one.  It reads simply: "FUCK. NOW."  
                        All caps, bold, and underlined!

           An OLD MAN sitting at the next table has finally heard 
           enough.  He turns around and gets in Kyle's face.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Excuse me, I'm trying to have 
                        dinner with my family.  Can you two 
                        take this fracas some place else?

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, Pappy, this is a private 
                        conversation, so why don't you 
                        finish your veal, enjoy retirement, 
                        and mind your business, alright?  
                        Appreciate it.

           The Old Man stands up to wave over the MANAGER, while Ashley 
           tries to stifle the pain and rage she's feeling inside.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Well thanks for confirming how I 
                        felt all along.  I'm basically just 
                        your whore.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, well you know what they say 
                        about whores: You know it's time to 
                        quit when you start cumming with 
                        the customers.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Go to hell, Kyle.  Actually, no, 
                        first go take your stupid 
                        fellowship, get cock rot from Free 
                        Willy and choke on a blowfish, then 
                        go to hell.

                        Fine!  I'll do all those things, 
                        cause I'd rather wash up on a 
                        deserted island and suck dick for 
                        quarters for the Swiss Family 
                        Robinson than raise some shitbag 
                        kid in the suburbs with you for the 
                        rest of my life!

                                 ASHLEY
                        And I'd rather go home right now, 
                        fuck my new boyfriend stupid and 
                        then drink myself into a coma in 
                        hopes that I wake up someday and 
                        forget about the five years of my 
                        life that I wasted being with you!

           Just as the Manager makes his way over to the table, Ashley 
           darts up and storms out. 

                                 MANAGER
                        Excuse me, is everything ok over--

           Kyle nearly knocks the Manager over as he springs to his feet 
           and chases Ashley out the door.

           EXT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           Kyle races to catch up with Ashley as she hails a cab.

                                 KYLE
                        So that's how it's gonna be, huh?  
                        You're gonna walk out on us after 
                        five years of being the best thing 
                        in each other's lives?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Yeah, right after I make one more 
                        amendment to your stupid 
                        Constitution first.

           Ashley reaches into her purse and pulls out a pen and her 
           beat-up copy of the Constitution.

                                 ASHLEY
                         (scribbling)
                        Rule #34... In the event that Kyle 
                        suddenly turns into a complete and 
                        utter raging douchebag... HE CAN GO 
                        FUCK HIMSELF!!

           With that, Ashley throws the Constitution at Kyle, stomps 
           into a cab, and SLAMS the car door as hard as she can.

           Ashley has left behind.  He tries to rip the paper in half, 
           but it won't tear because of the laminating.

                                 KYLE
                        Goddamn!... Laminating!...

           INT. ASHLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ashley and Jeffrey lay in bed in the middle of the night.  
           Jeffrey is passed out, but Ashley is still wide-awake.

           Tears fall down her face as she cries as softly as she can.  
           Her gentle sobs finally stir Jeffrey out of his slumber.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Hey... What's wrong, babe?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Nothing, just... I was thinking 
                        about my pet fish that got eaten 
                        and... I'm just a little upset about 
                        it.

           Jeffrey pats her on the shoulder and rolls over, turning his 
           back to Ashley as she sniffles softly to herself.

           INT. KYLE'S CLASSROOM - DAY

           Kyle sits alone at his desk, holding the laminated Friendship 
           Constitution over a huge BUNSEN BURNER FLAME.  

           He watches in a daze as the plastic bubbles and burns, 
           allowing the paper underneath to toast.  Charlie enters the 
           room after smelling the harsh fumes from the hallway outside.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Jesus, Mr. Hamberg, what're you 
                        doing?

           Kyle doesn't even look up.  He just keeps watching the 
           Constitution burn.

                                 KYLE
                        What I should have done a long, 
                        long time ago, Charlie.

           Charlie pulls a seat up in front of Kyle's desk.  Charlie 
           sports a dejected look that rivals Kyle's for sheer misery.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I think I know what you're going 
                        through.  Abby dumped me last night.
           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)
           (cid:13)           Kyle finally snaps out of it and puts out the flame on his 
           Bunsen Burner.  He sees the pain written across poor 
           Charlie's face.

                                 KYLE
                        Shit... I'm sorry, man.  What 
                        happened?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don't know.  I asked a million 
                        questions and didn't get a single 
                        answer.  

           Charlie looks up at Kyle with pleading eyes.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Do you think we could go fire off 
                        some rockets or something?

                                 KYLE
                        I'll do you one better.

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - AFTERNOON

           Kyle and Charlie stand in front of a massive SUPER ROCKET, 
           which is really just a HUGE PYRAMID of tiny rockets all 
           stacked up and taped to each other.

           The guys construct their pyrotechnic monstrosity while 
           continuing their conversation.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I've decided it's just not worth 
                        it.  I refuse to subject myself to 
                        this level of hurt again.  I'm 
                        going back to a female-free life.  
                        Not even a thousand simultaneous 
                        handjobs could possibly cancel out 
                        the amount of pain I feel in my 
                        heart right now.

                                 KYLE
                        Tell me about it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I'm going to narrow my focus to 
                        hardcore gaming.  With enough 
                        practice, I can compete at a 
                        national level and maybe carve out a 
                        decent living for myself.  It's not 
                        really about the money, it's about 
                        what makes me happy at this point.
                             (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                 KYLE
                        You're exactly right.  I need to 
                        start doing what's gonna make me 
                        happy for once too.

                                 CHARLIE
                        And what's that?

           The guys finish taping up their SUPER ROCKET.  Kyle leans 
           down to light the fuse.

                                 KYLE
                        Word on the application for my 
                        fellowship came in... I set sail in 
                        two weeks.  I'm not a science 
                        teacher anymore, Charlie.  I'm a 
                        badass oceanographer.

           As soon as Kyle finishes his sentence, the fuse burns out and 
           the super rocket BLASTS into the sky above them.

           The bottom row of rockets IGNITES, setting off the row above 
           it and so on, until the entire pyramid EXPLODES in a 
           fantastic show of fire and colored smoke.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Holy shit.  It's beautiful.

                                 KYLE
                        It sure is.

           From the parking lot, the school PRINCIPAL sees the carnage 
           in the sky and rushes over to the field.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Jesus Christ, Kyle!  What the hell 
                        are you doing??  Are you trying to 
                        get yourself fired?!

                                 KYLE
                        No, sir, Principal Laski.
                         (beat)
                        I quit.

           The FLAMING WRECKAGE of the super rocket finally CRASHES to 
           the ground.  Charlie puts his arm on Kyle's shoulder as they 
           watch the smouldering heap char the grass in front of them.

           INT. CYNTHIA'S OFFICE - DAY

           Ashley sits up on Cynthia's couch, letting it all out again.
                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                               (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                 ASHLEY
                        This is just the right thing to do.  
                        I should have realized it from the 
                        beginning.  When you break-up with 
                        someone, you do it for a reason.  
                        Just cut each other off.  It's the 
                        only way to move on.

           Cynthia just nods and looks down at the floor.

                                 ASHLEY
                        So, now he can have whatever kind of 
                        life he wants in Costa Rica, and 
                        I'll get exactly what I'm looking 
                        for here.  It's the perfect set-up 
                        really.  Nothing like thousands of 
                        miles of distance to really put 
                        someone out of your mind for good.

           Ashley looks to Cynthia for confirmation, but she is silent.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Don't you think?

           Cynthia finally looks up and locks eyes with Ashley.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        No.  I think you're both making a 
                        big mistake.

                                 ASHLEY
                        What?  Why?  You saw how miserable 
                        he made me.  Why should I have to 
                        put myself through that?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Because it's worth it.  That's why.  
                        Because for all the hurt and the 
                        pain that you have to suffer 
                        through now, it's worth it to still 
                        have him there.  Just to tell you 
                        that everything is going to be ok 
                        in a way that no one else can.

           Ashley takes in Cynthia's words and focuses her thoughts.

                                 ASHLEY
                        I really appreciate you talking 
                        with me so much, Cynthia, but I'm a 
                        psychologist too.  And a damn good 
                        one.  All I'm looking for here is a 
                        little support.  I already know how 
                        to talk to myself like a shrink.

           (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 CYNTHIA
                        I'm not trying to talk to you like 
                        a shrink, Ashley.  I'm trying to 
                        talk to you like a friend.

           Without giving Ashley a chance to respond, Cynthia turns 
           around to her desk and buries herself in some work.  

           Ashley leans back on the couch and looks up at the ceiling, 
           left with only herself to help sort out her feelings now.

                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COSTA RICA BEACH - OCEAN DOCKS - DAY

           Kyle hauls his belongings across an awesome sandy beach.  

           He approaches the DOCKS up ahead and whips out a Fellowship 
           BROCHURE.  The brochure showcases a picture of the RUSTY OLD 
           DIVE BOAT that will be Kyle's home for the next two years.

                                 KYLE
                        Ok, made it... Home sweet--
                         (beat)
                        Ho-ly shit...

           Kyle lowers the brochure and gets his first look at the REAL 
           FELLOWSHIP BOAT.  

           It's a RIDICULOUSLY SWEET MEGA-YACHT, pulsating with loud 
           music and squeals of excitement coming from those already on- 
           board.

           Kyle looks up and spots a distinguished BEARDED MAN in his 
           60s peering down at him from the top deck.  This is DR. 
           WINSTON ZIMMET, the head of the Costa Rica Fellowship.

                                 DR. ZIMMET 
                        Hello there!  You must be Kyle!  
                        You're the last fellow to arrive, 
                        let's get you on-board!

           Before Kyle can respond, a team of CREW MEMBERS emerge and 
           take hold of his luggage, whisking him away to board the 
           fantastic ship.

           EXT. FELLOWSHIP BOAT - TOP DECK - MOMENTS LATER

           Kyle gets his first glimpse at the incredible set up he's 
           about to enjoy during his time at sea.

           Fellowship STAFFERS patrol the top deck carrying trays of 
           hors d'oeuvres and flutes of champagne.
                                       (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                               (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)           TWELVE OTHER GEEKED OUT FELLOWS chill out in a badass HOT 
           TUB, reel in FISHING POLES over the top railing, or speed 
           around in JET-SKIS in the water down below.

           The place is basically the sickest party Kyle has ever seen 
           in his life.  He stares in bewilderment as Dr. Zimmet 
           approaches with a huge smile.

                                 DR. ZIMMET
                        Not bad, huh?  Think you could get 
                        used to living like this for the 
                        next couple years?

                                 KYLE
                        This is... This is nothing like the 
                        brochure.  Are you sure I'm in the 
                        right place?

                                 DR. ZIMMET
                        Absolutely.  We made some upgrades 
                        to the program this year.  Remember 
                        the poor young man who died on that 
                        episode of "Deadliest Catch"?  One 
                        of our esteemed alumni and the heir 
                        to a massive oil fortune.  Can you 
                        say "endowment"?

           Kyle locks eyes with some of the other Fellows, who welcome 
           him warmly and invite him to join in on the fun.

                                 KYLE
                        This is incredible...
                         (beat)
                        Oh my God, is that an omelette 
                        chef?

           Behind the hot tub, an OMELETTE CHEF works his magic and 
           cooks up eggs made to order.

                                 DR. ZIMMET
                        Indeed it is.  Come on, I'll show 
                        you around.
                         (loud, to everyone)
                        And after Kyle settles in, 
                        everybody get ready because we'll 
                        be officially setting sail and 
                        preparing for our first deep sea 
                        dive together!!

           The Fellows all SCREAM AND APPLAUD, none louder than Kyle.

           INT. JEFFREY'S BMW - EVENING

           Jeffrey and Ashley, both dressed to the nines once again, 
           make their way through highway traffic.
           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                 JEFFREY
                        You sure you don't mind coming with 
                        me to one of these things again?

                                 ASHLEY
                        No, come on, of course not.  I 
                        think they're fun.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Alright, well I owe you one.  This 
                        weekend we'll do whatever you wanna 
                        do.  What kind of stuff did you do 
                        for fun before you met me?

           Ashley takes a moment to think it over.

                                 ASHLEY
                        I don't know... Nothing special.  
                        But I'll think of something.

           Jeffrey smiles at her and steps on the gas.

           EXT. FELLOWSHIP BOAT - TOP DECK - DAY

           Kyle stands on the deck getting fitted with his scuba gear by 
           Dr. Zimmet's trusty staff.  He and all the other excited 
           Fellows are decked out in full deep-sea diving suits, scuba 
           fins, and oxygen tanks.

                                 DR. ZIMMET
                        Ok, everybody ready?  Stay close as 
                        a group and keep your eyes wide 
                        open.  Remember, today's adventure 
                        is just the first of many!

           Zimmet leads the Fellows to the side of the boat.  He faces 
           them once more before getting set to jump.

                                 DR. ZIMMET
                        Get ready to see a part of the 
                        world you've only dreamed of!

           Kyle smiles and watches as Zimmet DIVES into the ocean.  Kyle 
           and the other Fellows all pour in behind him.

           INT. NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART - EVENING

           Jeffrey holds court over another elite political gala.  

           He reels in his crowd of onlookers with his usual spiel, this 
           time with his arm around Ashley.  She stands close by his 
           side, feeling very much like part of the group.
                                       (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                 JEFFREY
                        So, I said to him -- Anthony, think 
                        about it.  Whose world do you wanna 
                        live in.  Ours?  Or theirs?

           The crowd eats it all up, as usual.  Jeffrey shoots a winning 
           smile to Ashley, who returns it, proud of her man.

           EXT. OCEAN DEPTHS - UNDERWATER - DAY

           Kyle is 400 feet below the surface.  All around him is OCEAN 
           LIFE of every size, shape, and color imaginable.  

           MULTI-COLORED SCHOOLS OF FISH wander about.  JELLYFISH, EELS, 
           and SEA TURTLES all float past a stunning CORAL REEF that 
           shimmers against the bright blue water.

           Kyle soaks it all in with eyes wide open and a huge smile 
           under his scuba mask.  He swims to get as close as he 
           possibly can to all the stunning creatures surrounding him.

           He then turns and spots ONE SINGLE FISH swimming by itself in 
           a seemingly empty corner of the ocean.  

           The fish is identical to the tropical fish that Kyle once 
           shared with Ashley.

           Kyle locks onto the tiny fish and swims closer towards it.  
           Everything around Kyle fades away and it slowly starts to 
           feel as if he and the fish are now the only living things in 
           the entire ocean.  

           Just as Kyle makes it within inches of the lonely fish, it 
           looks at him for a moment and then swims away, disappearing 
           into the abyss.

           Kyle's face falls as he watches it go.  He stops swimming and 
           just drifts in the water alone while the other Fellows 
           continue their underwater explorations far off behind him.

           INT. ASHLEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Ashley is seated at the dining room table, waiting as Jeffrey 
           serves her a plate of freshly cooked food.

                                 JEFFREY
                        And for being such a good date at 
                        yet another painfully boring work 
                        function, I present you with my 
                        famous Chicken Marsala and homemade 
                        couscous.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Awesome, looks great, thank you.
                                       (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)           Jeffrey sets down the attractive plate and sits.  There's a 
           clear lack of conversation between them as they start to eat.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Hey, do you dare me to try and fit 
                        this entire piece of chicken in my 
                        mouth?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Um... Why would I do that?

                                 ASHLEY
                        I don't know... It might be funny.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Yeah.  But it would also be stupid.

           Ashley nods and they both go back to their food.

           INT. FELLOWSHIP BOAT - KYLE'S ROOM - SAME

           Kyle, still soaking wet and melancholy, sits on a KING SIZE 
           BED in the middle of his incredible room.

           The room is decorated like a five-star suite at the Plaza.  A 
           sick PLASMA TV hangs from the wall.  There's a fully stocked 
           WET BAR in the corner.  A HUGE AQUARIUM takes up half of the 
           rear wall behind the bed.

           Despite the incredible accommodations, Kyle couldn't look 
           more depressed.  Finally, he pulls a SATELLITE PHONE off the 
           wall and dials a number he knows by heart.

           INT. ASHLEY'S APARTMENT - SAME

           Ashley and Jeffrey are carrying their dishes to the sink.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Hey, I've gotta run to the 
                        bathroom.  I'll be right back out 
                        to help, ok?(cid:13)

                                 JEFFREY
                        No problem.

           Jeffrey turns on the sink and starts rinsing the dishes as 
           Ashley's phone starts to RING.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Ash, phone's ringing!  My hands are 
                        soaking!

                                 ASHLEY (O.S.)
                        Let it go to the machine!
                                                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)           Ashley's machine BEEPS.  A familiar voice fills the room.

                                 KYLE (V.O.)
                        Yeah, uh, hi.  Ashley, it's Kyle, 
                        calling from the middle of the 
                        Pacific Ocean... Um, I don't 
                        exactly know how to say this, but 
                        I'm sitting here in a ridiculously 
                        tricked out maritime suite that has 
                        satellite TV and a full wet bar for 
                        some reason and... It turns out all 
                        I can think about is how badly I 
                        screwed things up with you.

           Jeffrey listens with a blank stare.  Ashley emerges from the 
           bathroom, listening closely to every word.

           INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - SAME

           Charlie, still miserable and heartbroken, plays a game of 
           World of Warcraft on his computer.

           As he navigates the interactive world, he receives an IM from 
           someone named HannahShotFirst.  It reads: Hey, it's Hannah 
           from history class.  Sorry about you and Abby... 

           Kyle's voice carries over as Charlie reads.

                                 KYLE (V.O.)
                        I know the way we left things 
                        between us was bad, and now it must 
                        seem like there's no going back 
                        from there, but even if you'd 
                        rather swallow a cyanide pill than 
                        see my face ever again, I still 
                        can't have you out there thinking 
                        you're the kind of person that I 
                        can just leave behind for good.  
                        Because you're not...

           As Charlie types back, his WARCRAFT CHARACTER is approached 
           by a BEAUTIFUL ELF.  Charlie gets another IM reading: 

           HannahShotFirst: You're way too cute for her anyways.  I 
           always thought she was kind of a bitch.

           Charlie smiles again for the first time in days.

           INT. COUNTRY CLUB BALLROOM - SAME

           Cynthia meanders around another Singles Night populated with 
           plenty of DISTINGUISHED OLDER FOLKS.  She looks lonely and 
           saddened by her bad luck once again.
                                                                (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 KYLE (V.O.)
                        Today I finally got a chance to 
                        live on the precipice of the 
                        unknown.  I was 400 feet below the 
                        surface of the ocean, and I saw a 
                        part of the world I'd only dreamed 
                        of before.  But it didn't matter, 
                        because that part of the world 
                        didn't include you...

           Cynthia is about to leave the ballroom, until she is 
           approached by a kind-faced man named ALAN.  Alan doesn't say 
           a word, he just stands in front of Cynthia and smiles.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Can I help you?

                                 ALAN
                        I'm sorry, I'm just a little 
                        nervous.  It's not every day I 
                        decide to ask the most beautiful 
                        woman in the room to dance with me.

           Cynthia barely knows how to react, but the smile on her face 
           comes naturally.  Alan extends his hand and she takes it.

           INT. ASHLEY'S APARTMENT - SAME

           Ashley still stands outside the bathroom door, frozen as she 
           takes in the rest of Kyle's message.

                                 KYLE (V.O.)
                        And I don't care if you're in my 
                        life as a girlfriend, or a best 
                        friend, or whatever... But I know 
                        now that I need you here somewhere.  
                        I do.  And I just had to say it 
                        because I don't want to wait two 
                        whole years to finally tell you how 
                        important you still are to me.  So 
                        I'm telling you now... 
                         (beat)
                        Yeah, so that's everything I guess.  
                        Thanks for listening and have an 
                        excellent night.  Bye.

           Kyle hangs up and the machine BEEPS again.  Ashley is still 
           frozen where she stands, shock and raw emotion written all 
           over her face. 

           Jeffrey looks over at her, unsure how to proceed.

                                 JEFFREY
                        That... Was your ex-boyfriend?

                        Yeah.

           Jeffrey nods.  There's a long beat of silence between them, 
           until Jeffrey breaks it with a BURST OF LAUGHTER.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Holy shit!  That was like the most 
                        ridiculous thing I've ever heard in 
                        my entire life!

           Jeffrey keeps laughing his ass off, while Ashley just stares 
           at the blinking light on the answering machine.  

                                 JEFFREY
                        You seriously dated this guy?  Was 
                        he always this much of a raging 
                        puss-bag?

           Jeffrey keeps laughing to himself, until Ashley finally looks 
           up and glares at him.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Fuck you.

           The laughter stops in an instant.  Jeffrey looks back at her 
           with confusion.

                                 JEFFREY
                        What?  C'mon, I'm just messing 
                        around.  The guy's a total nut!

                                 ASHLEY
                        Here's a quick rule check for you, 
                        Jeff.  You don't get to talk crap 
                        about someone's ex until you've 
                        effectively made them forget about 
                        that person.  And so far the only 
                        thing you've made me forget about 
                        are the decent standards I used to 
                        have when selecting a rebound guy.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Ok, wait a second -- What's your 
                        problem?

                                 ASHLEY
                        My problem is that instead of 
                        watching shitty reality TV and 
                        eating Pop-Tarts with Kyle, I'm 
                        stuck here with you, picking apart 
                        dry chicken while pretending to give 
                        two shits about how you spent your 
                        day making it easier for twelve-year-
                        olds to buy assault rifles.
                                      (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                 JEFFREY
                        Ok, that is not what I do -- And 
                        hold on -- Are you saying you'd 
                        rather be back together with that 
                        clown than be with me?

                                 ASHLEY
                        No, what I'm saying is "that clown" 
                        is my goddamn best friend, and I'd 
                        rather do nothing with him than do 
                        anything with you.  Because Kyle 
                        may not shave regularly, he might 
                        not own a power suit, or drive a 
                        car with automatic locks and 
                        windows... But I know for damn sure 
                        that he'd never turn his back on me 
                        while I cried in my sleep.  And 
                        lately, that's pretty much the only 
                        thing I've really needed.

           Jeffrey's all out of bullets now.  There's nothing he can say 
           to that.  Ashley finally breaks off her hate stare and grabs 
           her coat.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Where are you going?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Out.  And don't waste your time 
                        being here when I get back.

           She reaches for the door and then turns back around.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Oh yeah, and one more thing.
                         (beat)
                        Your couscous sucks ass.

           With that, she's gone, leaving Jeffrey shaken by the sound of 
           the slamming door.

           EXT. FELLOWSHIP BOAT - TOP DECK - EVENING

           Kyle wanders aimlessly around the rocking top deck of the 
           fellowship boat.  All around him are other Fellows chowing 
           down on PLATTERS OF SUSHI, SINGING KARAOKE, or making use of 
           the sweet TETHERBALL AND BADMINTON COURTS.

           Kyle watches sadly as everyone around him has the time of 
           their lives.  

                                 KYLE
                        Seriously?... Tetherball?
                                       (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)           He turns and spots Dr. Zimmet sitting on the edge of the deck 
           by himself, gazing out at a MAGNIFICENT AMBER SUNSET.  Kyle 
           walks over to Zimmet in search of some peace and quiet.

                                 KYLE
                        Do you, uh, mind if I sit down?

                                 DR. ZIMMET
                        Kyle, hi.  Of course not.  Join me.

           Kyle takes a seat next to Dr. Zimmet and stares out at the 
           sunset with him.  It's one of the most amazing sights Kyle 
           has ever laid eyes on.

           Dr. Zimmet pulls out a BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE and offers a glass 
           to Kyle. 

                                 DR. ZIMMET
                        Care for some champagne?  

                                 KYLE
                        Oh, no thanks.

                                 DR. ZIMMET
                        You sure?  It's the real deal.  Dom 
                        Perignon.  Ever since the 
                        endowment, we're swimming in the 
                        stuff.  I'm starting to put it in 
                        my cereal now.

           Zimmet sits back and takes a long look out at the sunset.  
           It's the kind of sight that never gets old for him.

                                 DR. ZIMMET
                        It really is amazing, isn't it?

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah.  It is.

                                 DR. ZIMMET
                        So... Is it everything you hoped it 
                        would be?

           Kyle waits for a long beat before answering.

                                 KYLE
                        No.

           Dr. Zimmet reads the discontent on Kyle's face.  Zimmet's 
           reaction says this is something he's seen before.

                                 DR. ZIMMET
                        Let me guess... A woman?

                                 KYLE
                        You could say that.

           (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)           Zimmet nods and turns back towards the ocean.  The sun slowly 
           starts to fall behind the water horizon.

                                 DR. ZIMMET
                        Kyle, can I share with you a lesson 
                        I've learned from spending the past 
                        thirty-five years living at sea?
                         (beat)
                        The big difference between people 
                        and fish is... If you find a fish 
                        that you like, and you have to let 
                        it go... At least you know there's 
                        still a million more out there 
                        exactly like it.

           Kyle stares out at the water as the words sink in.  He knows 
           what he has to do now.  He hops to his feet and grasps Dr. 
           Zimmet's hand in a warm shake.

                                 KYLE
                        Dr. Zimmet, thank you for 
                        everything, but I think I have to 
                        get off this boat as quickly as 
                        possible.

                                 DR. ZIMMET
                        I know you do, son.  There's one 
                        like you every year.  And I haven't 
                        blamed a single one of you yet.

           Zimmet turns and WHISTLES to the members of his crew.

                                 DR. ZIMMET
                        Hey, Carlos!  Fire up the jet-ski!  
                        We got a waffler!

           Zimmet puts his arm around Kyle and walks him to the other 
           side of the deck, where the karaoke and tetherball rage on.

                                 DR. ZIMMET
                        Hey, how 'bout an omelette for the 
                        road?

           INT. CAB - NIGHT

           Ashley sits in the back of a cab weaving its way through 
           traffic.  She clutches her phone and waits for an answer.

                                 ASHLEY
                         (into phone)
                        Cynthia!  It's Ashley.  I just 
                        wanted to call and say... Thank you 
                        for being such a good friend.

           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)           INT. COUNTRY CLUB BALLROOM - SAME

           CLOSE on Cynthia's phone, sitting unattended on an empty 
           ballroom table.  As the phone's "New Message" chime RINGS, we 
           turn to see Cynthia dancing cheek-to-cheek with Alan.  

           Cynthia holds Alan's shoulders tightly, as they both get lost 
           in the moment together.

           EXT. OCEAN - SAME

           Kyle holds on tight as Dr. Zimmet's crew member, CARLOS, 
           navigates the jet-ski through the choppy ocean waters.  

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, thanks a lot for getting me to 
                        the airport, by the way!

                                 CARLOS
                        No problem, sir!

           Kyle pulls out his folded up omelette and offers a bite to 
           Carlos.

                                 KYLE
                        You want a bite of my omelette?

                                 CARLOS
                        No thank you, sir!

           Kyle nods and takes a bite as Carlos revs up the gas and 
           ZOOMS towards the shore.

           EXT. REAGAN NATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Ashley's cab pulls up at the departures gate and she rushes 
           out as fast as she can.

           INT. REAGAN NATIONAL AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

           Ashley runs her ass off towards the closest TICKETING AGENT.

           She cuts through the line full of TRAVELERS and nearly 
           collides with the ticket counter.

                                 ASHLEY
                        This is an emergency -- I'm in like 
                        three destination weddings this 
                        weekend.  I need to get on the next 
                        flight to Costa Rica!

COSTA RICA AIRPORT - SAME

           Kyle pulls the same stunt at the Costa Rica airport.  He runs 
           through a BUSY CROWD and barrels into the nearest ticket 
           counter.

                                 KYLE
                        I have to get to DC right away or
                        I'm gonna miss my liver transplant!

           INT. ASHLEY'S PLANE - NIGHT

           Ashley sits in her seat on the plane, looking like she's 
           about to hyper-ventilate.  She tries to get a grip and waves 
           down a FLIGHT ATTENDANT.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Excuse me.  You don't happen to know 
                        where I can score a Valium, do you?

           The Flight Attendant looks at Ashley like she's insane.

           INT. KYLE'S PLANE - SAME

           Kyle grips his armrests and holds his breath as his plane 
           gets in the air.  He's so nervous that he grabs his paper 
           BARF BAG and starts HUFFING AND PUFFING into it.

           The WOMAN sitting next to Kyle leans away from him and shifts 
           over to an empty seat in the next row.

           INT. ASHLEY'S PLANE - EIGHT HOURS LATER

           Ashley's plane has finally landed and the "Fasten Seatbelts" 
           sign DINGS off.  Ashley is the first one out of her seat.  
           She races past each row on the way to the exit.

                                 ASHLEY
                        I'm serious, I'm late for like 
                        eighteen weddings!

           INT. KYLE'S PLANE - SAME

           Kyle squeezes through a cramped row full of PASSENGERS trying 
           to unload their luggage.  He muscles his way towards the 
           exit, pissing off everyone within reach as he goes.

                                 KYLE
                        Sorry, sorry -- Excuse me!  I have 
                        a liver transplant!

           Ashley runs as fast as her legs will carry her through the 
           arrivals gate.

           INT. REAGAN NATIONAL AIRPORT - SAME

           Kyle does the exact same thing at Reagan, as he races towards 
           the taxi lane outside.  He blows through another long line 
           and jumps into the first cab he sees.

           INT. COSTA RICA CAB - MINUTES LATER

           Ashley is planted in a Costa Rica cab now.  It zooms onto the 
           streets away from the airport.

                                 COSTA RICA CABBIE
                        So, where we going?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Um... Oh shit... I have no idea.  

           EXT. ASHLEY'S APARTMENT - SAME

           Kyle dives out of his cab and sprints to Ashley's building.  
           He pounds on her BUZZER and yells upstairs as loud as he can.

                                 KYLE
                        ASHLEY!!  ASHLEY!!!  IT'S ME!!  
                        KYLE!!!

                                 PISSED OFF NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
                        SHUT THE FUCK UP!!

                                 KYLE
                        SORRY!!!  
                         (beat)
                        DO YOU KNOW WHERE ASHLEY IS?!?
                         (another beat)
                        ACTUALLY NEVERMIND -- I'LL JUST 
                        CALL HER!!

           As the Neighbor yells back, Kyle whips out his cell phone and 
           dials Ashley's number.

                                 KYLE
                        Hello?? -- Ashley??

COSTA RICA CAB - SAME

           Ashley's eyes light up at the sound of Kyle's voice.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Kyle, thank God!  Where are you?  I 
                        have to talk to you.

                                 KYLE
                        I'm on your front steps, screaming 
                        your name into the buzzer thingie.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Wait, what?

                                 KYLE
                        I'm in DC!

                                 ASHLEY
                        Why the hell are you in DC??  I'm 
                        in the middle of Costa Rica!

                                 KYLE
                        What the shit are you doing there??

                                 ASHLEY
                        I came to see you!  I just did the 
                        whole crazy sprint through the 
                        airport thing!

                                 KYLE
                        So did I!  I sprinted my ass off!

                                 KYLE/ASHLEY
                        FUCK!

           They both take a moment to catch their breaths.

                                 ASHLEY
                        We need to meet.  As soon as 
                        possible.  Where's somewhere 
                        directly in the middle?

                                 KYLE
                        I'll call Mr. Horowitz, the 
                        Geography teacher.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Great, call me back.

           They both hang up simultaneously and turn to their cabbies.

                        I need to go back to the airport!

                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - MORNING

           The arrivals gate is packed on a hectic morning.  Travellers 
           haul luggage and usher children on the PEOPLE-MOVERS that 
           slide across the busy floor in both directions.

           Kyle, red-eyed and utterly exhausted, rides on one side of 
           the people-mover, searching far and wide for Ashley.

           Ashley, ready to pass out on her feet, rides on the other 
           side, where she anxiously scans for any hint of Kyle.

           Everyone around them looks straight ahead and minds their own 
           business.  It seems like not a single pair of people in the 
           entire airport are making eye-contact.

           Until Kyle and Ashley finally lock eyes as they move towards 
           each other from opposite directions.

           They both break into sweet smiles as they creep closer and 
           closer to one another.  As their paths cross, Kyle holds up 
           two coffees.  Ashley holds up two muffins.  

           Neither of them have any trouble keeping their eyes open now.

           INT. AIRPORT ARRIVALS GATE - MORNING

           Kyle and Ashley walk down the airport floor together, picking 
           apart their muffins while they talk.

                                 ASHLEY
                        No way!  Tetherball and badminton??

                                 KYLE
                        Yes, it was ridiculous!  And you 
                        should have seen the toilets.  I 
                        would have slept on one if I didn't 
                        already have a King-size bed with 
                        1200 thread count Egyptian sheets.

           Ashley slows her stride and looks up at him.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Sounds like they had everything you 
                        ever wanted on that boat.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, they were close... Just not 
                        close enough.

                                 ASHLEY
                        So then what do we do now?

           Kyle looks around and spots the huge FLIGHT MAP that lists 
           all the arrivals and destinations of the day's flights.  He 
           leads Ashley over towards the map.

                                 KYLE
                        I don't know... I mean, we're both 
                        here, stuck in the middle of an 
                        international airport...

           Kyle and Ashley reach the flight map and gaze up at it.  The 
           swarm of travellers around them keeps moving.

                                 KYLE
                        Maybe we should go somewhere.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Yeah... I guess we could go pretty 
                        much anywhere we want.

                                 KYLE
                        Ok then, your choice.  Pick any 
                        place and we'll go there.  Together.

           Ashley scans the map for a moment and then looks back at him.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Actually... I think I'm pretty good 
                        right here.

           She gives him a sweet smile and he does the same right back 
           to her.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah... I think I am too.
                         (beat)
                        So... You wanna hang out?

           She nods and they start walking together, their eyes locked 
           on each other the whole way until they are swallowed up by 
           the herd of travellers and we...

                                                FADE OUT.

                                 THE END
