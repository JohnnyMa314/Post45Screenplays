           EXT. STRAWBERRY PLAINS BRIDGE - EAST TENNESSEE - DAWN

           A bridge burns with lusty violence.

           In the creek below, a glassy-eyed Confederate sentry bobs in 
           the black waters. MURDERED. Somewhere in the distance a train 
           whistle screams...

           Over the treetops we see the puff-puff-puff of a smokestack, 
           then the throw of a headlamp down the tracks, then the fire-
           breathing LOCOMOTIVE itself...

           It spooks off half a dozen shadowy figures into the dense 
           woods. Union loyalists.

           EXT. CARTER CABIN - DAY

           Two scrawny goats shiver outside a mountainside cabin. 
           Something spooks them out in the woods...

           INT. CARTER CABIN - DAY

           A pretty young mother, MARY CARTER, sits at the kitchen table 
           with her two young daughters stitching a man’s jacket. ROSE, 
           age six, pricks herself with the needle.

                                 ROSE
                        Ow!

                                 MARY
                        Rose, child, let me do that part. 
                        Come here.

           Rose does as she’s told. Her mother inspects the finger. A 
           tiny dollop of blood appears on the tip. Mary puts it in her 
           mouth and sucks.

                                 JANE
                        Mama, somethin’ happened to Mr. and 
                        Mrs. Billygoat.

           Mary looks up, mouth smeared with blood. She takes Rose’s 
           hand and they step over to Jane, age ten, gaping out the 
           window.

           IN THE YARD Mary sees one goat staggering against the fence, 
           arterial blood spurting from its neck. The other lay dead 
           nearby, throat also slit.

           Rose screams. Mary covers her eyes and yanks her away from 
           the window.
           Jane continues to peer out. She spots a band of saddled 
           horses in the woods, roped to trees.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Mama?

           FRONT DOOR

           is KICKED open and a half dozen Confederate soldiers storm 
           the cabin. Mary and the girls scream as the graybacks prod 
           them into a corner at bayonet point.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS
                        Don’t move, cunt.

           Enter COLONEL DANVILLE LEADBETTER (40s), the new sheriff in 
           town, who steps across the threshold like the devil on an 
           Easter stroll. He ignores his whimpering captives and wanders 
           the homestead, taking inventory. He finds himself plucking at 
           a broken fiddle.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        I’m looking for your husband. 
                        William Blount Carter.

           Mary says nothing. A bayonet jabs against her neck.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS
                        Answer the good Colonel.

                                 MARY
                        I don’t know where he is. Bastard 
                        left us. Gone since winter.

           Leadbetter goes to a doorway. The bedroom is already being 
           turned over by one of his men. No sign of the husband. 
           Leadbetter gives Vickers a look.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS
                             (barking orders)
                        Everyone out. Take the children.

           The graybacks grab the two girls and carry them away. Mary 
           claws after them but is reined back by Vickers.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Again, where’s that black snake 
                        bridge burner husband of yours?

                                 MARY
                        Please, my girls...

           Vickers flings her onto the tabletop, china sent crashing.
                                 LEADBETTER
                        Your girls will watch you thrown 
                        atop a stake like a bird feeder if 
                        you don’t tell me where he is.

                                 MARY
                        I told you. He left.

           Leadbetter holds up the man’s jacket they were sewing.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Then who the fuck is this jacket 
                        for?

                                 MARY
                        No one, my brother...

           Leadbetter nods to Vickers, who removes his belt and ropes it 
           under Mary’s chin and over her skull, binding her jaw shut.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Last fucking time... WHERE. IS. 
                        YOUR. HUSBAND.

                                 MARY
                        PleasehemovesIdon’tknowIdon’t...

           Leadbetter snaps off the needle and thread that dangles from 
           her husband’s jacket. Vickers grabs her lips.

                                 LEADBETTER
                             (whispering in her ear)
                        It’s okay. I understand. You don’t 
                        need to say anything.

           He leans in looking to sew.

           EXT. CARTER CABIN - DAY

           The two girls are held back by soldiers, forced to listen to 
           their mother’s stifled screams inside.

           EXT. STRAWBERRY PLAINS BRIDGE - DAY

           A hive of engineers, soldiers and slaves reconstruct the 
           bridge. The train from the opening waits patiently on one 
           side of the gap. Leadbetter lords over the scene. He sees:

           WILLIAM BLOUNT CARTER and half a dozen grizzled Tennessee 
           mountain men arrive in camp on their own volition, arms 
           raised stoically. They surrender before Leadbetter.
                                 CARTER
                        Where are my girls?

           Leadbetter points to the bridge, where a series of cages have 
           been built into the structure. Inside are little children, 
           including Rose and Jane.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        You mean the little birdies keeping 
                        an eye out for saboteurs?

           The girls see their father.

                                 ROSE
                        Daddy!

                                 LEADBETTER
                        I guess they’ve spotted one.

                                 CARTER
                        You have what you want. Let them 
                        go.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Of course.

           EXT. STRAWBERRY PLAINS BRIDGE - DAY

           The span has been rebuilt, the train and builders gone. The 
           mountain men have been left impaled on ten foot stakes in 
           front of their children, still simpering in their cages. A 
           warning to anyone who might try again...

           Confederate sentries watch the last slave pound a sign into 
           the earth beside the tracks. It reads:

                        “WELCOME TO CHATTA-FUCKING-NOOGA”

           INT. CONFEDERATE HOSPITAL - CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE - DAY

           Crammed with bunk after bunk of howling, suffering men, a 
           horror show of malarial sweats and amputated limbs. Behind an 
           operating curtain...

           A SURGEON cracks a crate marked “BIBLES”. Packed inside are 
           fifty 2-ounce bottles of white powder. QUININE. The Surgeon 
           dips a pinky, tastes and looks to CAPTAIN WHITSITT, a dashing 
           young Confederate officer.

                                 SURGEON
                        It’s good.
           Whitsitt nods to a QUARTERMASTER, who smacks down five 
           thousand Confederate dollars on the operating table next to 
           the crate of medicine.

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        That some kind of joke?

           The voice comes from a man who peruses amputation saws in the 
           corner. A handsome scoundrel of aristocratic bearing, he cuts 
           a striking figure in his black, ankle length duster. If John 
           Wilkes Booth had Sinatra’s panache, he’d be this man and we 
           wouldn’t give a shit if Lincoln were shot twenty fucking 
           times. Meet JAMES ANDREWS.

                                 CAPTAIN WHITSITT
                        It’s what we agreed. One hundred 
                        ounces of quinine at fifty an 
                        ounce.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Those are bluebacks. Confederate 
                        fucking dollars.

                                 CAPTAIN WHITSITT
                        Where do you think you are?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Gold, Captain. That’s what you pay 
                        me in. That or Union dollars.

                                 QUARTERMASTER
                        Our paper is just as good.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Yeah? Tell that to your boys next 
                        door dying of malaria.

           Andrews throws the lid back on the crate. Whitsitt draws his 
           saber and blocks him.

                                 CAPTAIN WHITSITT
                        I’m sure whatever the Union Secret 
                        Service pays you to spy on us while 
                        smuggling your contraband more than 
                        covers the cost of your trouble.

           Andrews smiles.

                                 ANDREWS
                        You would think.

           Viper-quick he bats away Whitsitt’s saber with the lid. 
           Whitsitt draws his pistol, as does the quartermaster. 
           Andrews draws two, ending it in a Mexican stand-off. The 
           surgeon reels back in horror.

                                 SURGEON
                        Gentlemen, please. This is a 
                        hospital for God’s sake.

                                 ANDREWS
                        So, doc, who you wanna attend to 
                        first?

                                 MIRIAM (O.C.)
                        Am I interrupting something, 
                        gentlemen?

           At the curtain is MIRIAM LEADBETTER (30), a stunning and 
           stately lady of the south, completely unruffled by the scene.

                                 QUARTERMASTER
                        Mrs. Leadbetter!

                                 MIRIAM
                        I was just stopping by to do my 
                        duty as a lady and see the wounded.

           Andrews looks her up and down, likes what he sees. 

                                 ANDREWS
                        Now there’s a reason for getting 
                        shot.

           She does too.

                                 MIRIAM
                        And you are?

                                 CAPTAIN WHITSITT
                        Nothing but a double-dealing snake 
                        wants to deny our boys the 
                        treatment they require. We’re 
                        persuading him otherwise.

           Pistols stay raised. They hold their awkward stand off. 
           Andrews brightens as if this were the most glowing of 
           introductions.

                                 ANDREWS
                        James Andrews. Pleasure.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Is there anything I can do to 
                        persuade you, Mr. Andrews?
                                 ANDREWS
                        You got five thousand in gold 
                        stashed under that dress of yours?

                                 SURGEON
                        Sir!

                                 CAPTAIN WHITSITT
                        Careful cocksucker, that’s a 
                        Colonel’s wife you’re talking to.

           Andrews pretends to be impressed.

                                 MIRIAM
                        If it’s gold you want, I’d be happy 
                        to help if it means relief for our 
                        good soldiers.

                                 CAPTAIN WHITSITT
                        You don’t have to do that, Miss. We 
                        can handle this.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Yes, clearly.
                             (to Andrews)
                        What do you say, Mr. Andrews? Join 
                        me and my husband for dinner 
                        tonight and we’ll satisfy your 
                        account.

                                 ANDREWS
                        And if you’re giving me the 
                        runaround?

                                 MIRIAM
                        Well, then you’ll be in my home and 
                        in a position to take whatever you 
                        want.

           It’s an invitation. Andrews accepts and the guns go down.

           EXT. LEADBETTER’S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           A hotel across from the train station, fortified like an 
           embassy in a hostile country. Andrews approaches the gauntlet 
           of guards outside. Snipers pace the rooftop.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Evenin’ boys.

           He’s frisked.
           INT. MIRIAM’S ROOM - LEADBETTER’S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           Miriam runs around getting dressed. Her CHAMBER SERVANT, a 
           slave girl, keeps up behind trying to tighten her corset.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Tighter.

                                 CHAMBER SERVANT
                        I don’t wanna hurt ya, Miss Miriam.

           Miriam smacks her hands away.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Please, I’m not some delicate 
                        fucking flower.

           INT. DRAWING ROOM - LEADBETTER’S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           Andrews wanders the room in waiting. He stops before a huge 
           framed MAP OF TENNESSEE mounted over the fireplace. 
           Leadbetter’s domain.

                                 LEADBETTER (O.C.)
                        Lincoln himself calls Chattanooga 
                        the keystone to the Confederate war 
                        effort.

           Entering, Leadbetter approaches Andrews.

                                 LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
                        By rail it connects Atlanta with 
                        rebel forces north, east and west. 
                        Whoever controls the city controls 
                        the flow of munitions, troops and 
                        supplies all across the south. 
                        Chattanooga falls, so will our dear 
                        Confederacy.

                                 ANDREWS
                        That’s why they’ve installed a man 
                        like you, Colonel. Keep a firm grip 
                        on things. James Andrews.

           He extends his hand. Leadbetter takes it and pulls Andrews 
           close.

                                 LEADBETTER
                             (menacing)
                        My wife may be naive about the 
                        guests she invites to her table, 
                        but I most certainly am not.
           Miriam shows at the door, a formidable and ravishing beauty.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Looks like you two boys have 
                        started without me.

           INT. PRIVATE DINING ROOM - LEADBETTER’S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           They dine in awkward silence. Leadbetter eyes Andrews with 
           each bite. Miriam tries to play innocent. Andrews just enjoys 
           the lamb.

                                 ANDREWS
                        So, Mrs. Leadbettter, how long does 
                        your husband have you?

                                 MIRIAM
                        Just a night or two, I’m afraid. 
                        Given the insurgents in these 
                        parts, Danny prefers me stay back 
                        at home in Marietta where it’s 
                        safe. You ever been?

                                 ANDREWS
                        I have an old friend there.

                                 MIRIAM
                             (smiling)
                        Now you have a new one.

           Leadbetter sniffs out the flirtation. He isn’t pleased.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        You seem to have friends all over 
                        the map. Many of them our enemies.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I’m a man of enterprise, Colonel. 
                        To do what I do you gotta play all 
                        sides.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Sooner or later you’ll have to pick 
                        one. If I were you I’d pick wisely.

                                 ANDREWS
                        The south? What makes you so 
                        confident?
                                 LEADBETTER
                        Because for all the Union’s 
                        advantages--men, money, industry--
                        our side has shown something the 
                        north hasn’t: guts. Every act of 
                        daring in this struggle has been by 
                        a rebel. Even your own generals 
                        know it: one confederate is worth 
                        ten bluebellies on the battlefield. 
                        That’s why they’re so timid. The 
                        fact is while those pussies are 
                        busy counting their men, our men 
                        are busy winning this war.

           Suddenly Vickers runs in, sooty and breathless.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS
                        Colonel! Come quick! There’s a 
                        fire. The stables next to the 
                        armory.

           Leadbetter leaps to his feet.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Guess your wife will have to see me 
                        through dessert.

           The Colonel looks to Andrews. No way does he trust this guy.

                                 LEADBETTER
                             (to Miriam)
                        Dinner’s over. Get this man what he 
                        came for, then get him out.

           He goes, turning back at the door:

                                 LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and Mr. Andrews, one more 
                        thing: You ever turn a gun on one 
                        of my men again and I’ll have you 
                        drained like a stuck pig.

           INT. DRAWING ROOM - LEADBETTER’S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           Miriam leads in Andrews and shuts the door behind them. She 
           moves behind a desk where she opens a safe and pulls out a 
           large pouch. Unlacing it, she empties its contents onto the 
           desk: $5000 in gold coins.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Satisfied?
           Andrews steps up beside her, brushing close. He can’t take 
           his eyes off her.

                                 ANDREWS
                        All those hospital visits you make. 
                        You’re quite the lady of 
                        compassion.

                                 MIRIAM
                        I do my part.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Rumor has it that includes inviting 
                        wounded men back for dinner.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Most of them are just boys.

                                 ANDREWS
                        But not when you’re done with them?

           He grabs her roughly by the hair, hikes up her dress and rips 
           down her undergarment. Without a kiss, or a word, he begins 
           to finger her against the desk. She writhes and bucks against 
           his hand, loving every minute.

           Done, Andrews swipes the gold coins off Leadbetter’s desk and 
           by the clutch of her hair spins Miriam around and bends her 
           over, pressing her pretty face against the Colonel’s papers 
           on the desktop.

           He unbuckles his pants and penetrates her from behind. Miriam 
           whimpers in pain and ecstasy as he fucks her hard in her 
           husband’s office, scattered gold coins clutched between her 
           white knuckles.

           LATER

           Miriam and Andrews adjust their clothing and pull themselves 
           together. Andrews scoops up his gold, notices the coins are 
           all marked “LB”

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        This gold is marked?

                                 MIRIAM
                        Yes, Danny likes to keep track of 
                        everything that passes through his 
                        hands.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I didn’t see any markings on you?
                                 MIRIAM
                        We didn’t get that far.

           Andrews looks her over, admiring.

                                 ANDREWS
                        What’s a woman like you doing with 
                        that prick?

                                 MIRIAM
                        Why do you do what you do, Mr. 
                        Andrews?

           She makes a show of slipping a gold coin into Andrews’ vest 
           pocket.

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, you two aren’t as different 
                        as you’d like to think.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Yeah, and how the fuck is that?

                                 MIRIAM
                        Let’s just say he shares your 
                        aversion to Confederate dollars.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I thought all loyal southern 
                        gentlemen of means were expected to 
                        trade in their gold for war bonds 
                        and bluebacks, make sure the 
                        Confederacy has the war chest it 
                        needs to deal oversees?

                                 MIRIAM
                        Not all it seems.

                                 ANDREWS
                        What, your husband been hoarding 
                        gold?

                                 MIRIAM
                        His entire fortune. Eight hundred 
                        thousand dollars.

                                 ANDREWS
                             (intrigued)
                        For a Colonel with a key city to 
                        defend that doesn’t show much 
                        confidence in the future of 
                        Confederate money, or the 
                        Confederacy.
           Nibbling on his ear...

                                 MIRIAM
                        That’s why he’s kept the gold a 
                        secret. Only his banker, his wife 
                        and a spy who appears to work for 
                        everyone and no one knows the man 
                        is hedging his bets.

           Andrews kisses her hard. As they claw at each other to 
           undress, he steals a glance at the:

           MAP OF TENNESSEE

           and the Western & Atlantic (W & A) railroad line running up 
           from Atlanta, Georgia through MARIETTA all the way to 
           Chattanooga, Tennessee.

           EXT. CHATTANOOGA STREETS - DAY

           Confederates everywhere. Andrews strolls down the busy, muddy 
           thoroughfare and ducks inside...

           INT. GAMBLING HALL - DAY

           A lively establishment of ill repute full of mercenaries, 
           horse thieves and whores. Andrews looks to the craps table, 
           where HENRY GREEN COLE, slick as oil, rolls the dice and 
           comes up big again. He’s everyone’s best friend.

                                 COLE
                        Well, well, if it ain’t my oldest 
                        friend on God’s green earth.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Who’s your newest?

           Andrews nods to a BODYGUARD by the piano, hand on a revolver 
           concealed under his jacket.

                                 COLE
                        You can never be too careful around 
                        old friends.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Especially if you’re you.

           Cole grins, guilty as charged. He gestures for the bodyguard 
           to stand down. They walk over to the bar.

                                 COLE
                        So how’s the contraband business?
                                 ANDREWS
                        Losing it’s luster with every 
                        picket I have to cross in the cold 
                        fucking rain. I was thinking of 
                        turning respectable, like you.

                                 COLE
                        Glad to hear it.
                             (to the bartender)
                        Bottle ‘a whiskey. On this gent 
                        here.
                             (winking to Andrews)
                        Who ya gonna screw to get there?

           Andrews pays for the bottle.

                                 ANDREWS
                        What if I told you I got a line on 
                        eight hundred thousand in gold that 
                        if it went missing, the cocksucker 
                        it goes missing from couldn’t alert 
                        the authorities without exposing 
                        himself as a hypocrite, possibly a 
                        traitor and definitely an asshole. 
                        And that this score just happens to 
                        be sitting in your backyard of 
                        Marietta.

           Cole is very intrigued. Shots are poured.

                                 COLE
                        I’d say you’re looking for a 
                        partner.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Cut you in for 25%.

                                 COLE
                        Fifty.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Thirty.

                                 COLE
                        Fifty.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Thirty-five.

           Cole flashes his hands. Five, zero. Fifty.
                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Fine. Fuck you. Fifty. But minus 
                        the twenty thousand you cheated me 
                        out of the last time to buy that 
                        Goddamn respectability of yours.

                                 COLE
                        Actually it was a hotel.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Plus interest.

           Cole entertains this, shrugs.

                                 COLE
                        Okay. Deal. But given our history, 
                        why not just do it yourself?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Cuz at this point I’m too well 
                        known as a Union agent, the gold is 
                        two hundred miles behind enemy 
                        lines, and the man we’re stealing 
                        it from just so happens to control 
                        those very lines.

           It hits Cole.

                                 COLE
                        You mean Colonel Leadbetter?

           Andrews smiles like a fox.

                                 COLE (CONT’D)
                        James, what’s the fucking 
                        difference if he can’t call a 
                        sheriff? The Colonel’s got an army 
                        not a posse. How the hell you gonna 
                        move that much gold fast and far 
                        enough before he knows what’s what? 
                        Cuz when he does, getting outta the 
                        south’ll be easier for a nigger 
                        with two heads and a white woman 
                        swinging on his cock than it will 
                        be for you. You got a plan?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Yeah. I’m gonna steal a train.

           He slaps down a railroad timetable for the Western & Atlantic 
           R.R., Atlanta to Chattanooga.
           EXT. UNION CAMP - SHELBYVILLE, TENNESSE - NIGHT

           A PICKET GUARD dashes through camp, zig-zagging down rows of 
           white tents and past dying fires...

           EXT. MEADOW - EDGE OF CAMP - NIGHT

           The picket guard runs up to a man looking through a telescope 
           at the stars above. A chart of the night skies is spread 
           across a small table with a lantern on it. 

                                 PICKET GUARD
                        General sir, a man just arrived in 
                        camp.

           The star-gazer finishes with his calculation, marks up his 
           chart, and finally turns to the guard, intrigued. Meet 
           GENERAL “OLD STARS” ORMSBY MITCHEL.

           EXT. HORSE CORRAL - UNION CAMP - NIGHT

           The picket leads Mitchel to the corral, where Andrews stands 
           under armed guard, amused by the rifles in his face.

                                 MITCHEL
                        I should have known. Whatever 
                        you’re selling I ain’t buying.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Why would you? I sell opportunity, 
                        and that’s shit you gotta act on. 
                        God forbid anyone in this army take 
                        action, especially its generals.

                                 MITCHEL
                        Go fuck yourself, Andrews. You’ll 
                        see action soon enough.

           Mitchel turns to walk away.

                                 ANDREWS
                        So it’s true. You’re marchin’ on 
                        Huntsville. Four days.

           Mitchel is startled. He pulls Andrews aside.

                                 MITCHEL
                        Nobody knows that but me and my 
                        closest officers.
                                 ANDREWS
                        Then lucky I work for you and not 
                        the graybacks. And trust me, you’ll 
                        catch ‘em with their pants down.

                                 MITCHEL
                        What is it that you want?

           INT. MITCHEL’S TENT - NIGHT

           By lamplight Andrews and Mitchel lean over a field map of the 
           eastern United States. Andrews plants his finger on...

                                 ANDREWS
                        Chatta-fuckin’-nooga. The keystone 
                        to the Confederacy. After taking 
                        Huntsville all you gotta do is pile 
                        your army into a troop train and 
                        breeze on down the line. Even with 
                        half your men dropped behind to 
                        hold points along the way you 
                        outnumber Leadbetter’s forces three 
                        to one. The cocksucker doesn’t 
                        stand a chance.

                                 MITCHEL
                        Neither will we when rebel 
                        reinforcements come rolling up from 
                        Atlanta.

                                 ANDREWS
                        That’s where I come in. I’m gonna 
                        steal a train. Here, in Marietta.

           He points to Marietta, Georgia, south of Chattanooga along 
           the W&A line.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        And drive it up the line torching 
                        bridges, ripping up track and 
                        cutting telegraph wire. By the time 
                        anyone knows you’ve moved on 
                        Chattanooga, your troops’ll be dug 
                        in with one hundred miles of fucked-
                        up rail between them and the 
                        nearest Confederate cocksucker who 
                        can do one Goddamn thing about it. 
                        All I need are twenty men and your 
                        word you’ll knock out Leadbetter.

           Mitchel considers the plan. He likes it. Still...
                                 MITCHEL
                        It’s a million to one.

                                 ANDREWS
                        23,000 men were killed a week ago 
                        at Shiloh. More Americans than in 
                        all the wars in all the history of 
                        our nation, total. That was one 
                        fucking day. And it’s only the 
                        beginning. My plan works you can 
                        put an end to this war, and start 
                        measuring yourself for a monument. 
                        If it’s a clusterfuck you can 
                        always pull back and say I went 
                        ahead without orders. I’ll be dead 
                        anyway.

           Mitchel is starting to buckle.

                                 MITCHEL
                        What do you get out of it?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Beside the warm and fuzzy feeling 
                        of knowing I served my country?

           Mitchel smiles. He knows Andrews is full of shit.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Fifty thousand if I make it back. 
                        Don’t even have to be in gold.

           Mitchel calls to the picket outside the tent.

                                 MITCHEL
                        Get me Captain Arbuckle.

           Andrews knows he’s just sold a bill of goods.

           EXT. MITCHEL’S TENT - UNION CAMP - DAWN

           They step outside. Mitchel lights a cigar. He offers one to 
           Andrews, who pockets it.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I think I’ll wait ‘til we catch up 
                        in Chattanooga.

           Mitchel gazes up at the last stars still visible in the 
           brightening sky.
                                 MITCHEL
                        You know, studying the sky I’ve 
                        come to accept we live in a violent 
                        universe. All fire and brimstone 
                        and cosmic destruction. Yet through 
                        it all comes something else...

                                 ANDREWS
                        What’s that?

                                 MITCHEL
                        Rebirth.

           CAPTAIN ARBUCKLE comes running up.

                                 CAPTAIN ARBUCKLE
                        You wanted to see me, General?

           Mitchel opens the tent flap.

                                 MITCHEL
                        Inside.
                             (to Andrews)
                        Excuse us for a moment. 

                                 ANDREWS
                        Do your thing, General.

           Mitchel ducks in after Arbuckle, Andrews left to wonder...

           EXT. UNION CAMP - MORNING

           A shame-faced Union deserter is paraded through camp as 
           soldiers razz him, ripping off his boots and uniform piece by 
           piece. Meet CPL. DORSEY. He’s buck naked by the time Andrews 
           and CAPTAIN ARBUCKLE come across the fracas.

                                 CAPTAIN ARBUCKLE
                        Sergeant! What’s going on here?

                                 UNION SERGEANT
                        We caught this peckerwood trying to 
                        skip camp. Coward don’t wanna wear 
                        the uniform so we’ll see how he 
                        likes goin’ without it.

           Arbuckle turns to Andrews. Oh no.

                                 CAPTAIN ARBUCKLE
                        Looks like we’ve found your first 
                        raider, Mr. Andrews.
           EXT. UNION CAMP - LATER

           Arbuckle brings Andrews in front of a big bruiser of a man in 
           civilian clothes and hood who stands balanced on a barrel, 
           something he’s clearly been doing for hours. A hand-painted 
           sign pinned to his chest reads “MURDERER”. Meet WILLIAM 
           CAMPBELL.

                                 CAPTAIN ARBUCKLE
                        The big man there is a civilian. 
                        Name’s Campbell. We caught him in 
                        camp, hiding out with a friend 
                        who’s enlisted. He’s from 
                        Louisville, worked a whorehouse 
                        there keeping the customers in 
                        line. He went on the run after 
                        knocking the life outta a Sheriff’s 
                        deputy. One punch. He’s all yours.

           Andrew starts to sense he’s being sandbagged.

           EXT. RIVERBANK - EDGE OF CAMP - NIGHT

           Four Union soldiers stand by watching one of their own lure 
           an unsuspecting duck to eat out of his hand. Meet PVT. 
           SHADRACH. When the animal ventures close enough Shadrach 
           seizes it’s neck.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Now this boys is what I like to 
                        call a Kentucky sparkler.

           He douses the duck with hair tonic, SETS IT ABLAZE and flings 
           it airborne. A frantic flapping fireball, the poor creature 
           finally splashes down to its death in the river.

           Shadrach laughs hysterically. The soldiers are appalled. 
           Arbuckle witnesses this with Andrews.

                                 ARBUCKLE
                        Soldier! A word.

           Andrews worst fear is confirmed: Mitchel’s handing him the 
           dregs.

           EXT. UNION CAMP - LATER

           Arbuckle kicks to life a pickled old geezer passed out under 
           a cannon, cradling a bottle of whiskey. Meet PVT. BUFFUM. 

                                 ARBUCKLE
                        Alright Buffum. Up and at ‘em.
           Andrews has seen enough.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Let the fucker sleep it off. I get 
                        it. Now how about a guy or two who 
                        might actually make this more than 
                        a suicide mission?

                                 CAPTAIN ARBUCKLE
                             (smiling coyly)
                        Who do you have in mind?

           EXT. UNION CAMP - LATER

           A whole regiment, the 21st Ohio, stands at attention. 
           Arbuckle paces the line. Andrews watches from the wings.

                                 CAPTAIN ARBUCKLE
                        I’m looking for locomotive 
                        engineers. Anyone who can run a 
                        steam engine.

           Two hands go up: CPL. LLEWELLYN, an old hand railroad man; 
           and portly PVT. SLAVINS, shy about his experience. Arbuckle 
           looks to Andrews who gestures fine, he’ll take ‘em.

           INT. MITCHEL’S TENT - DAY

           A soldier with fancy oval spectacles and the bearing of a 
           Russian intellectual has been summoned before Mitchel. Meet 
           CPL. PITTINGER.

                                 MITCHEL
                        You’re Pittinger, the young man 
                        who’s been serving as a 
                        correspondent for your hometown 
                        newspaper.

                                 PITTINGER
                        The Steubenville Herald. Yes, sir.

           Mitchel holds up a clutch of his articles.

                                 MITCHEL
                        I’ve read the dispatches. You paint 
                        a vivid portrait with the pen, 
                        Corporal.

                                 PITTINGER
                        I would hope so, General. I’m a 
                        teacher of English back in Ohio.
           Mitchel smiles, gets to the point.

                                 MITCHEL
                        I’m planning a top secret 
                        expedition. One that could quite 
                        possibly alter the course of the 
                        war. I’d very much like to have 
                        someone on hand who can record the 
                        events for posterity. I’d like it 
                        to be you.

                                 PITTINGER
                        I’m honored, sir. What’s the 
                        expedition?

                                 MITCHEL
                        You‘ll be briefed tonight by its 
                        leader, Mr. Andrews.

                                 PITTINGER
                        The man who arrived in camp?

                                 MITCHEL
                        Yes. Which brings me to something 
                        else about your role as my eyes and 
                        ears. Mr. Andrews is a man of, 
                        shall we say, varied agendas. If 
                        anything he does looks to 
                        jeopardize the mission...

           Mitchel opens a small jewel box and hands Pittinger a 
           concealable pistol.

                                 MITCHEL (CONT’D)
                        I’m authorizing you to take 
                        command.

           INT. PAUL REVERE ROOM - WIDOWS HALL - DAY

           Andrews commands the floor before his 18 RAIDERS: an 
           assortment of fuck-ups and misfits, crazies and cowards, now 
           outfitted in civilian clothes. They include Dorsey, Campbell, 
           Shadrach, Buffum, the engineers Llewellyn and Slavins, and 
           Pittinger, who Andrews clocks with a second glance.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Evenin’ raiders. My name is James 
                        Andr--

           A door swings open and the last two raiders come bumbling in, 
           the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of the bunch. Meet PVTS. 
           PARROTT and WOLLAM, a preacher and a Scotsman.
                                 PARROTT
                        Sorry, sorry, don’t mind us.

                                 ANDREWS
                        You two yahoos are late.

                                 WOLLAM
                             (thick Scottish brogue)
                        We got a wee turned around.

                                 ANDREWS
                        All you had to do was walk a wee 
                        quarter mile down the fucking road.

                                 PARROTT
                        We did. The good Lord just pointed 
                        us in the wrong direction.

           He flashes his bible.

                                 WOLLAM
                             (about to crack up)
                        The prick.

           Andrews takes in their goofy grins and bloodshot eyes. 
           They’re high as shit. He looks down the line of raiders.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Okay soldiers, I want you to look 
                        at the dipshit next to you.

           They do this.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        If you haven’t noticed, he ain’t 
                        exactly the prize of the Union 
                        army. Now look at the other way. 
                        See a theme here. He’s a fuck-up, 
                        cannon fodder, dead weight, 
                        expendable. Like you all are. See 
                        we got ourselves a dangerous 
                        fucking expedition, boys. So 
                        dangerous in fact it seems your 
                        commander General Mitchel doesn’t 
                        give it much of a shot. That’s why 
                        he’s handed me you shitheels. But 
                        I’ll tell ya something, I wouldn’t 
                        be leading this parade if I didn’t 
                        think we could make some noise. And 
                        maybe just come back heros.

           The raiders crack smiles.
                                 PITTINGER
                        So what’s the mission, sir?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Simple. First you’re gonna break 
                        into small groups, then posing as 
                        secesh sympathizers slip past 
                        confederate pickets. After that 
                        you’re gonna cover however you can 
                        the 90 miles to Chattanooga by 
                        Thursday afternoon. Those who make 
                        it will rendezvous at the train 
                        station where we’ll board the 5pm 
                        to Marietta. Once we’re down there 
                        the rest of the plan will be 
                        revealed.

           Andrews strides to a table arranged with 20 pouches and 
           begins to distribute one to each raider. 

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Now, in each of these pouches you 
                        will find a map, confederate cash 
                        and three gold coins for emergency 
                        only.

           Shadrach shakes out the gold coins and we see Leadbetter’s 
           markings. He pockets them greedily.

           Andrews stops before the youngest of the raiders, PVT. WOOD, 
           a boy not a day over fifteen.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        How old are you, son?

                                 WOOD
                        Eighteen, sir.

                                 ANDREWS
                        You’re gonna have to lie better 
                        than that if you want to make it 
                        past the graybacks.

                                 WOOD
                        Seventeen?

           Andrews shakes his head.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Sorry. This is a mission for men, 
                        not fourteen year old boys. Get 
                        yourself back to camp.

           Wood stands his ground.
                                 WOOD
                        Please, sir... I can do this. My 
                        folks wouldn’t let me enlist cuz I 
                        was too young. But I ran off and 
                        lied good and well to the recruiter 
                        and here I am. All I ever wanted to 
                        be was a soldier.

           Andrews is moved by the boy’s appeal. Shadrach snorts with 
           condescension. Andrews bounds over to him.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Find something funny about that?

                                 SHADRACH
                        I find somethin’ funny about this 
                        whole shady fuckin’ operation.

           Andrews grabs Shadrach by the collar and hurls him across the 
           room into a portrait of Paul Revere. Shadrach claws himself 
           up purple-faced with anger and humiliation and draws his 
           knife. Before he can charge Andrews blasts it away with his 
           pistol.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Make no mistake, cocksucker. You 
                        might not be wearing a uniform 
                        anymore but you’re still a Union 
                        soldier. And I’m in command.
                             (to the room)
                        Got it, raiders?

           They all nod, no doubt who’s in charge.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Good. We leave in ten minutes.

           Shadrach rubs his grazed knuckles, shit clearly not settled 
           between them. Not yet...

           EXT. WIDOWS HALL - NIGHT

           Pittinger, Campbell and Shadrach step outside. Turning up 
           their collars they begin their journey. 

                                 PITTINGER
                        You know they say not even 
                        Pinkerton knows who that man is 
                        really working for.

           From an upper window, Andrews watches them go...
           INT. PAUL REVERE ROOM - WIDOWS HALL - NIGHT

           Andrews looks back to the remaining raiders. He points for 
           Slavins and Wood to switch groups, so both engineers aren’t 
           traveling together, placing Slavins with Dorsey and Buffum 
           and Wood with Llewellyn. They go...

           EXT. ROAD - MORNING

           Llewellyn and Wood trudge along the road to Chattanooga. A 
           WAGON bounces past.

                                 LLEWELLYN
                        Those lucky sons ‘a bitches.

           Riding pleasantly in back are Parrott and Wollam, who wave...

           INT. WAGON - MOVING

           Parrott opens his Bible. Carved out of the pages inside is a 
           compartment filled with hash. They start rolling joints.

           EXT. LULU FALLS - DUSK

           Buffum and Slavins forge across a waist deep pool at the base 
           of a whooshing waterfall, Dorsey left back on the embankment.

                                 DORSEY
                        Why can’t we just look for a bridge 
                        ahead?

                                 SLAVINS
                        Cuz bridges mean confederates.

                                 DORSEY
                        Is it cold?

                                 BUFFUM
                        It ain’t the fuckin’ waters of 
                        Acapulco.

           He swigs some whiskey.

                                 DORSEY
                        What about catchin’ pneumonia?

           CRACK! A rifle shot snaps at Dorsey’s bootheels. He jumps 
           like a little girl. On the slope ahead he spots:

           ANDREWS on his horse, rifle out, monitoring their progress.
           Dorsey gets the message. He sloshes into the water and forges 
           his ass across. Andrews gallops off into the woods.

           EXT. TENNESSEE HILLS - EVENING

           Pittinger, Campbell and Shadrach hike through the woods. 
           Shadrach has taken a shine to Campbell.

                                 SHADRACH
                        C’mon, what was it like? Killin’ a 
                        guy with your bare hands?

           Campbell clearly doesn’t want to go there.

                                 PITTINGER
                        Enough. The big man doesn’t wanna 
                        talk about it.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Why not? I’d strut that shit around 
                        like it was a badge of fuckin’ 
                        honor.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I ain’t no killer, okay.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Cocksucker’s dead, ain’t he?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        It was an accident. He was a 
                        customer. I was just trying to stop 
                        the man from hitting one of the 
                        girls.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Shit, ain’t that parta what we pay 
                        for?

           Campbell shoves Shadrach hard against a tree and cocks his 
           fist.

                                 PITTINGER
                        Campbell! No!

           Pittinger tries to pull Campbell off. The big man swats him 
           away. Shadrach is defiant.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Try it motherfucker. You know you 
                        wanna.

           Campbell does everything in his power to resist.
                                 CAMPBELL
                        I told ya. I’m not like that.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Well boo-fuckin’-hoo.

           Shadrach bites into Campbell’s hand like a rabid dog. 
           Campbell howls and lets Shadrach go. The little man laughs.

                                 SHADRACH (CONT’D)
                        Guess he ain’t so tough after all.

           Campbell lunges. CRACK! A shot separates them. ANDREWS comes 
           riding up.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Like there won’t be enough guys out 
                        there who’ll wanna kill you 
                        assholes. Keep it movin’.

           INT. CHATTANOOGA STREETS - DAY

           Confederate soldiers scramble about the city. Raiders 
           Llewellyn and Wood wander through the chaos, clearly out of 
           place. They’re spotted by Lieutenant Vickers, Leadbetter’s 
           man from the cabin.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS
                        You two. Git over here.

           The two raiders exchange anxious looks. They step up to the 
           Lieutenant and several other officers.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS (CONT’D)
                             (to Llewellyn)
                        I never seen a shoe with tips like 
                        that. Perforated like. Where you 
                        from?

           Llewellyn freezes up. Wood jumps in.

                                 WOOD
                             (great southern accent)
                        We from Kain-tucky. Left to git rid 
                        ‘a Yankee rule. Headin’ to Geo’gia 
                        to enlist.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS
                        Wanna fight, eh? Guess you ain’t on 
                        top of the latest turn ‘a events?

           He gestures to all the scrambling soldiers.
                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS (CONT’D)
                        General Mitchel marched into 
                        Huntsville last night. Forget 
                        Georgia, we need us some new men 
                        right here.

           Oh shit.

           EXT. CHATTANOOGA STATION - DAY

           A train waits at the platform, engine snarling and steam 
           blasting everywhere: the 5 o’clock to Marietta. The raiders 
           loiter in small groups, trying to remain inconspicuous. 
           Andrews returns to Pittinger, Campbell and Shadrach with a 
           head count.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Looks like we’re down four men. The 
                        two village idiots, the boy and 
                        Llewellyn, our engineer.

                                 PITTINGER
                        That a problem?

                                 ANDREWS
                             (re: Slavens)
                        Not since we brought two.

           He gives the signal and his now 16 raiders board the train.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - FLETCHER HOUSE - MARIETTA, GA - DAY

           Wollam kicks back on the comfy bed. Parrott peers out their 
           window at MARIETTA STATION right next door, clutching his 
           bible.

                                 PARROTT
                        You sure we shouldn’t have waited 
                        up there for the 5 o’clock? I’m 
                        pretty sure we should have waited.

                                 WOLLAM
                        Why? We all gonna meet down here 
                        any-fookin’-how.

                                 PARROTT
                        Yeah, but we don’t know where. We 
                        don’t know anything.

           Wollam plugs a joint in his mouth and lights it.
                                 WOLLAM
                        That’s why we gotta room where we 
                        can see ‘em roll into town.

           EXT. GEORGIA COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK

           The 5:00 train to Marietta huffs and puff its way down the 
           tracks.

           INT. PASSENGER CAR - 5:00 TRAIN TO MARIETTA - MOVING - DUSK

           Andrews walks down the aisle slipping instructions on bits of 
           paper to each row of raiders, never making eye contact. 
           Dorsey unfolds the slip and flashes it to Buffum. It reads:

                        FLETCHER HOUSE 
                        ROOM 33 
                        MIDNIGHT 

           Buffum eats the note and washes it down with a slosh of 
           whiskey from his bottle.

           ANDREWS takes a seat next to Pittinger, who eyes him closely.

                                 PITTINGER
                        So, Mr. Andrews. Things going 
                        according to plan?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Don’t know. Depends on what plan 
                        we’re talkin’ about. The one I got 
                        with Mitchel, or the one he’s got 
                        with you?

           Pittinger’s mouth drops. Andrews grins. They face off for a 
           beat, until the CONDUCTOR steps into the car and announces:

                                 CONDUCTOR
                        Next stop Big Shanty! 

           Andrews attention quickly turns to the approaching station 
           outside his window:

           As they pull up glowing fires dot the entire meadow on the 
           west side of the tracks, their halos illuminating rows of 
           white tents.

           The blood drains out of Andrews’ face.
           EXT. BIG SHANTY - CONTINUOUS

           Their train stops at a dirt platform in front of a small inn 
           that’s basically smack dab in the middle of a Confederate 
           encampment, 200 strong. Welcome to Camp McDonald.

           INT. PASSENGER COACH - 5:00 TRAIN TO MARIETTA - STOPPED - 
           DUSK

           Andrews draws back from the window, tries to show he’s not 
           shaken, but Pittinger sees this is something unexpected.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - FLETCHER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Wollam and Parrot loll around on the floor, high as shit.

                                 PARROTT
                             (dead serious)
                        You know what I admire most about 
                        our lord and savior Jesus Christ? 
                        His sandals. Why don’t men these 
                        days wear sandals?

           Wollam is busy taking a big toke.

                                 WOLLAM
                             (exhaling)
                        The chinks do. I seen ‘em down in 
                        the coal mines. Clop, clop, clop 
                        every-fookin’-where.

           He passes the joint.

                                 PARROTT
                        That’s right. They’re godless 
                        heathens. But their feet are free.

           Wollam looks to his booted feet. He yanks one boot off then 
           the other and throws them both out the window. 

           Inspired, Parrot does the same. They wiggle their stockinged 
           feet at each other and start laughing like maniacs.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - FLETCHER HOUSE - LATER

           The two are passed out. Out the window they should be 
           watching we see a train has arrived. Andrews and the raiders 
           emerge onto the platform...
           EXT. FLETCHER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Andrews and Pittinger’s group cross over to the hotel. 
           Campbell and Shadrach notice two pair of boots strewn on the 
           sidewalk. They all step inside...

           INT. RECEPTION - FLETCHER HOUSE - NIGHT

           A CLERK looks up from behind the front desk.

                                 CLERK
                        May I help you gentlemen?

                                 ANDREWS
                        You may.

           Cole materializes at the balustrade top of the stairs, 
           watching them, saying nothing.

           INT. ANDREWS’ ROOM - FLETCHER HOUSE - NIGHT

           A large corner room on the third floor. A clock reads twenty 
           after midnight. Andrews holds the floor. Pittinger, Shadrach, 
           Campbell, Dorsey, Slavins, Buffum and 10 other raiders (save 
           Parrott and Wollam) are gathered before him. They look 
           scared.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Steal a Confederate train?

                                 ANDREWS
                        And drive it up the line wreaking 
                        havoc. By the time we roll into 
                        Chattanooga General Mitchel will 
                        have taken the city.

                                 SHADRACH
                        So what, we gonna just fuckin’ walk 
                        next door. Demand the cocksuckers 
                        hand over their train? We ain’t 
                        even got guns.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Actually next door is where we’ll 
                        board. We grab the train someplace 
                        else.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Where’s that?

           Andrews hesitates to say. Pittinger beats him to the punch.
                                 PITTINGER
                        Big Shanty.

           All the oxygen seems to leave the room.

                                 SLAVINS
                        The stop we just came through?

                                 DORSEY
                        But that’s in the middle of a 
                        Confederate camp?

                                 ANDREWS
                        It’s the first station on the line 
                        without a telegraph. This only 
                        works if no one ahead knows we’re 
                        coming.

                                 SHADRACH
                        And if they do?

                                 ANDREWS
                        We’re dead as dirt.

           The raiders start yammering and arguing amongst themselves. 
           Andrews sees it’s already cracking apart. He pulls a knife 
           sheathed in his boot and flings it across the room. It STICKS 
           A PERFECT LANDING in the opposite wall. Everyone shuts the 
           fuck up.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Okay, raiders. This is how it is. I 
                        know you’re all pissing in your 
                        boots. But the truth is if you 
                        weren’t here most of you’d be 
                        standing out front on a skirmish 
                        line getting your heads blown off, 
                        the rest staring at a prison 
                        latrine or worse. At least with me 
                        you got the element of surprise. At 
                        least here you got a shot to step 
                        up and reach for fucking glory. Cuz 
                        I don’t know about you assholes, 
                        but I wouldn’t mind making it back 
                        to Mitchel and shoving a whole 
                        confederate train up his ass.

           He can see them gaining confidence.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        So what do ya say? You’ve already 
                        come this fucking far. Let’s go all 
                        the way. All Chattanooga or all 
                        hell!
           Buffum, now shitfaced, toasts the mission with his whiskey 
           bottle.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Fuck it. All Chattanooga or all 
                        hell!

           Then Campbell.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        All Chattanooga or all hell!

           Then Pittinger.

                                 PITTINGER
                        All Chattanooga or all hell!

           Then all of them. Psyched up for battle.

           KNOCK-KNOCK 

           The door. Everyone hushes. Andrews pulls a revolver. So does 
           Pittinger. Mitchel’s gun. He and Andrews exchange an awkward, 
           knowing look. At least two of them are armed. Another 
           knock...

           Andrews opens the door. It’s Cole, standing behind a trolly 
           with a tea tray.

                                 COLE
                        Room service.

           He and Andrews exchange sly smiles. The raiders eye Cole 
           nervously as he rolls in with the trolly.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Who the fuck is this?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Mr. Cole here is the proprietor of 
                        this establishment. He also happens 
                        to be one of my oldest friends and 
                        a staunch pro-Unionist.

           Cole sets aside the tea tray and yanks off the tablecloth, 
           revealing the trolly to be a crate on wheels.

                                 COLE
                        Welcome to Georgia, boys.

           He cracks the crate, marked “BIBLES.” The raiders gather 
           around and gawk at what’s inside:
           REVOLVERS, RIFLES, GRENADES, DYNAMITE. Everything a man needs 
           for an insurrection. Except a bible.

           INT. BACK STAIRWAY - FLETCHER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Narrow, dimly lit. Andrews and Cole descend to the back door. 
           Andrews is pissed.

                                 COLE
                        Nice speech in there. First class 
                        horseshit. Very fucking impressive.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I had to come up with something. 
                        Why didn’t you tell me the rebs  
                        were throwing a party where we 
                        planned to steal the Goddamn train?

                                 COLE
                        They pitched camp three days ago. 
                        You and your raiders were already 
                        en route.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Yeah, or maybe you just didn’t want 
                        me to abort this whole operation, 
                        miss out on your fucking share.

           Cole grins coyly. Andrews opens the back door to a dark 
           alleyway.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Now how do I look?

           Cole tugs straight his friend’s lapel.

                                 COLE
                        I’d fuck you.

                                 ANDREWS
                        That’s what I’m afraid of. Meet you 
                        at the bank.

           Andrews strides off into the night. Cole watches him go. We 
           don’t trust him either.

           EXT. LEADBETTER’S MANSION - NIGHT

           A white townhouse fronted by huge Doric columns. Tracking up 
           the front porch and through the half open door we hear the 
           cries of two people having crazy, animal sex...
           INT. LEADBETTER’S MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Andrews fucks Miriam on the marble floor at the bottom of a 
           Gone with the Wind staircase, their clothes half ripped off. 
           He didn’t get more than ten feet.

           INT. BATHROOM - LEADBETTER’S MANSION - NIGHT

           Entangled together in a steamy bath, Andrews and Miriam 
           linger.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Come back with me.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Back where?

                                 ANDREWS
                        New York. London even. Get out of 
                        this country before it burns itself 
                        to the ground.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Spoken like a true patriot.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I’m fucking serious.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Maybe, but you can’t afford me.

                                 ANDREWS
                        What if I said I’m twenty-four 
                        hours away from making my fortune?

           Miriam smiles. There’s no way.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Lay a finger on my husband’s gold 
                        and he’ll have us both killed 
                        before we reach the state line.

                                 ANDREWS
                        And what if I said I had that 
                        covered?

           She’s intrigued.
           INT. MIRIAM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Miriam, naked under an open robe, gazes at herself into a 
           mirror, grappling with her decision. Andrews comes up behind 
           and strings a locket around her neck.

                                 ANDREWS
                        This the necklace?

           She snaps open the locket and takes out a little slip of 
           paper like a fortune cookie. On it are THREE NUMBERS.

                                 MIRIAM
                        The combination for the safe. You 
                        still need the banker’s key to open 
                        it.

           She turns to him.

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        What would you have done if I chose 
                        not to come with you?

           He pins her arms behind her back, presses close.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I probably would have beat it out 
                        of you.

           He kisses her hard. By the time he’s done her wrists are 
           bound and he holds the combo. She’s totally taken aback.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        And something tells me you would 
                        have enjoyed it.

           He flings her bodily onto the bed. Before she can recover 
           he’s pulling out another length of rope.

           LATER

           Miriam is tied to a chair, gagged and furious. Andrews scoots 
           her and into a closet.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I really do like you. You’re like 
                        me. Which is exactly why I can’t 
                        trust you ‘til we’re free and clear 
                        of your husband. After that I’ll be 
                        at the Biltmore in New York.

           He kisses her on the forehead.
                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        I’ll keep the bed warm and 
                        champagne on ice.

           He locks her in the closet and goes.

           EXT. MARIETTA SQUARE - NIGHT

           Deserted, with the town asleep. Andrews walks up to a BANK.

           EXT. BANK - CONTINUOUS

           Seemingly all shuttered up for the night. Andrews finds THREE 
           BULLETS lined up by increasing caliber on the threshold. He 
           throws on a feed sack with two eye holes cut in it as a mask 
           and slips right in the front door...

           INT. BANK - NIGHT

           It’s very dark inside. Andrews nearly slips in a pool of 
           blood. Beside it the NIGHT WATCHMAN, his throat slit.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Jesus. I thought no killing.

           Cole, in a similar mask, holds the BANK PRESIDENT at gunpoint 
           in his office. The man is still in his bedclothes.

                                 COLE
                        Fucker got frisky. You got the 
                        combination?

           Andrews flashes it.

                                 ANDREWS
                        You got the key?

           Cole flashes the BANKER’S KEY.

           INT. BANK PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           They crack open a concealed wall safe, eyes widening through 
           their feed sack masks. Inside is $800,000 in gold coins. It’s 
           a shitload to carry. They start loading up saddlebag after 
           saddlebag.
           EXT. BANK - NIGHT

           Andrews and Cole, masks off and weighed down by a half dozen 
           gold-filled saddlebags under their long dusters, duck out the 
           front door. Cole locks it up behind them and they walk 
           nonchalantly across the square toward Cole’s hotel.

           INT. ANDREWS’ ROOM - FLETCHER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Andrews and Cole throw down the saddlebags and begin to 
           divide up the spoils.

                                 COLE
                        I still don’t like leavin’ that 
                        fucking banker alive.

                                 ANDREWS
                        We need him to confirm what the 
                        bank’s ledgers show: the robbers 
                        got away with nothing.

           A CLICK comes from behind Andrews’ head. 

                                 COLE (O.C.)
                        You mean one of ‘em got away with 
                        nothing.

           He slowly turns, finds himself looking down the barrel of 
           Cole’s Remington.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Son of a bitch.

                                 COLE
                        I’m honestly doing both of us a 
                        favor. You know well as I what a 
                        damn shame it’ll be to see your 
                        share go to waste when you get 
                        yourself killed tomorrow. And just 
                        think, if you make it, who needs 
                        gold when you’re a hero.

           Andrews’ hand itches for his holster.

                                 COLE (CONT’D)
                        I wouldn’t. There’s a floor full of 
                        grayback officers bunking right 
                        above us. Any gunplay they’re gonna 
                        want an explanation. For the first 
                        time in your life you got more than 
                        yourself to worry about.
           Andrews looks out the window to the station next door, 
           considers his men. He seems to give in. 

                                 ANDREWS
                        You’re right.

           Cole relaxes his gun. With a roundhouse kick, Andrews knocks 
           it away onto the bed. They both lunge for it. Andrews again 
           swats the gun skittering into a far corner. 

           Cole jams Andrews head between the mattress and bed frame, 
           strangling his old friend with the rope support. Andrews, in 
           serious trouble, sees his knife still stuck in the wall from 
           before. With his last gasp he grasps the knife and STABS COLE 
           IN THE BACK.

           Cole rolls off him, getting tangled in the bedding as he 
           goes. Andrews, now with the advantage, wraps Cole up even 
           more and starts stabbing him repeatedly through the sheets. 
           After a while Cole’s thrashing subsides. 

           Andrews steps back from the body shaking and spent. He looks 
           at the white sheets now soaked crimson with his old partner’s 
           blood. He’s never quite killed a man like that. He spits good 
           riddance.

           EXT. WORKING CLASS STREET - ATLANTA - DAWN

           We push in on a modest little home. Over it, a subtitle 
           appears:

                        “ATLANTA 
                        138 MILES TO CHATTANOOGA”

           A tall, young man steps out the front door wearing the 
           checkered pants and dark, indigo coat of a train conductor. 
           This is WILLIAM FULLER. His YOUNG WIFE, infant cradled in her 
           arm, runs out the door after him...

                                 FULLER’S WIFE
                        I almost forgot...

           She delivers Fuller a small, wrapped GIFT and kisses him on 
           the cheek.

                                 FULLER’S WIFE (CONT’D)
                        Happy birthday, William.

           EXT. TRAIN YARDS - ATLANTA - DAWN

           Gift in hand, Fuller walks up to the railroad’s roundhouse.
           INT. ROUNDHOUSE - ATLANTA - DAWN

           Fuller enters. There, gleaming in the morning light, is his 
           beloved engine: THE GENERAL. Nothing less than a melody cast 
           and wrought in metal.

           A free black man, CAIN, finishes up giving a little extra 
           spit and polish to the engine. Fuller’s fireman.

                                 CAIN
                        Got her all nice and ready for you 
                        this mornin’, Mr. Fuller.

                                 FULLER
                        Good work, Mr. Cain.

           Fuller helps Cain with the last of it. It’s like they’re 
           grooming a thoroughbred.

                                 FULLER (CONT’D)
                        Nice to find someone who loves 
                        these machines much as myself.

                                 CAIN
                        I ain’t done scrimped and scraped 
                        for thirty years to buy my freedom 
                        so I could slouch on a real job.
                             (re: the gift)
                        Ain’t ya gonna open your gift from 
                        the missus?

           Fuller smiles, jumps into cab.

                                 FULLER
                        Let’s get things moving first.

           EXT. MARIETTA STATION - MORNING

           Pittinger, Buffum, Shadrach, Dorsey, Campbell and Slavins, 
           along with 10 other raiders, stand among passengers on the 
           platform. Andrews looks at the station clock. A steam whistle 
           signals the arrival of The General, right on schedule.

           The engine draws into the station hitched to a TENDER 
           (storing the wood and water that fuels the train) and THREE 
           EMPTY BOXCARS, with a mail/baggage car and two passenger cars 
           in the rear.

           Andrews approaches a PORTER pointing to the weapons crate 
           marked “BIBLES.”
                                 ANDREWS
                        Porter! That crate there is really 
                        medicine for our boys up the line. 
                        I’d rather it not get tossed around 
                        with the loose baggage.

           He slips him a gold coin. 

                                 PORTER
                        I can put it in one of the empty 
                        boxcars?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Perfect.

           Andrews looks to his men. It’s time. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - FLETCHER HOUSE - MORNING

           Wollam snores in bed. Parrott is splayed out on the 
           floorboards. A ringing train bell wakes him, head pounding. 
           Out the window he sees:

           ANDREWS and the raiders boarding the train. The CRATE is 
           loaded into the last boxcar.

                                 PARROTT
                        Dear God. Wake up!

           He shakes Wollam then scrambles around gathering up his shit.

                                 PARROTT (CONT’D)
                        It’s Andrews! They’re leaving!

                                 WOLLAM
                        But we just got here?

           Parrott stops, everything in hand. He looks around perplexed.

                                 PARROTT
                        Where the fuck are our boots?

           Outside the General leaves the station.

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - MOVING

           Cain, the fireman, feeds wood from the tender into the 
           boiler. The engineer, a fatty named MURPHY, leans on the 
           throttle.
           EXT. GENERAL - MOVING

           Hanging off the back of last car of the train is an old 
           brakeman, ANDERSON, who watches Marietta Station fall away.

           INT. GENERAL - PASSENGER COACH - MOVING

           Fuller comes down the aisle collecting tickets. Andrews hands 
           him his and the two lock eyes.

                                 FULLER
                        Mornin’. Headed up to Chattanooga?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Yes, sir. You?

                                 FULLER
                        Well, of course. It’s my train.

                                 ANDREWS
                             (smiling)
                        Of course.

           Fuller senses something off, but he moves on...

           INT. CONFEDERATE ENCAMPMENT - CHATTANOOGA - MORNING

           Young Wood, now wearing Confederate grays, is curled and 
           asleep alongside other rebels on the muddy ground. He’s 
           collared to his feet by Lieutenant Vickers, the man who 
           enlisted him.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS
                        Wake up, maggot.

           Wood gets his bearings and sees a dozen graybacks surrounding 
           him. They don’t look happy. He looks around for Llewellyn, 
           nowhere to be seen.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS (CONT’D)
                        Yer friend ain’t here. Coward 
                        skipped out last night. A deserter. 
                        Know where he was goin’?

           Wood shakes his head, clearly confused with the situation. 
           Vickers drops him on his ass in the mud.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS (CONT’D)
                        We’ll find him, that’s for certain. 
                        And when we do, well, let’s just 
                        say you don’t wanna be havin’ the 
                        same ideas.
           They go, leaving Wood to take in the unfamiliar, 
           unsympathetic faces of his awakened fellow soldiers, who now 
           eye him with suspicion. He shutters in the cold.

           INT. GENERAL - PASSENGER COACH - MOVING

           Fuller steps in for an announcement.

                                 FULLER
                        Next stop Big Shanty. We’ll be 
                        holdin’ for breakfast fifteeen 
                        minutes.

           Andrews looks to Buffum. This is it. Buffum throws back some 
           whiskey. Andrews snatches away the bottle.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I need you clear headed.

           Buffum snatches it back. He takes another, bigger swig.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Exactly.

           We flash across the steeled, anxious faces of the raiders 
           we’ve come to know: Dorsey, Campbell, Shadrach, Slavins and 
           Pittinger who watches out the window for...

           EXT. CAMP MCDONALD - BIG SHANTY - DAY

           The Confederate camp is just starting to stir. Rebels emerge 
           their from tents still in their long johns. Once again, a 
           subtitle appears:

                        “BIG SHANTY/CAMP MCDONALD 
                        110 MILES TO CHATTANOOGA”

           They yawn and watch the General pull to a stop in front of 
           the LACY HOTEL.

           EXT. BIG SHANTY STATION - CONTINUOUS

           A crowd of passengers and crew step off the train, including 
           Fuller, Murphy and Anderson. They all head to the hotel for a 
           quick breakfast. All but...
           INT. GENERAL - PASSENGER COACH - DAY

           Andrews and the raiders, the only passengers left in the car. 
           Andrews gestures for the men to stay put, then steps off 
           himself...

           EXT. BIG SHANTY STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Andrews walks the platform calmly but purposefully down the 
           length of the train. On the camp side of the tracks he sees 
           two rebel pickets pacing with muskets, bored as shit. 

           Arriving at the engine Andrews first checks the cab and finds 
           it empty, then looks ahead for the open switch: all clear. He 
           pivots and strolls back down the platform, keeping an eye on:

           EXT. LACY HOTEL - DAY

           Fuller and his crew clean off their greasy hands with soap 
           and water in a battered wash pan by the door. They go inside.

           EXT. BIG SHANTY STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Andrews stops where the last of three boxcars is coupled to 
           the mail and baggage car, itself coupled to the coaches that 
           make up the rest of the train.

           He waits for the picket to pace by then ever so stealthily 
           uncouples the boxcar from the mail and baggage car, 
           effectively splitting the train in two. It takes five seconds 
           and nobody notices a thing.

           INT. LACY HOTEL - DAY

           Fuller and his crew stands in the cafeteria line.

           INT. GENERAL - PASSENGER COACH - DAY

           Andrews hops back aboard, smiles to his waiting raiders.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Well, boys, I guess it’s time to 
                        go.
           EXT. BIG SHANTY STATION - DAY

           The 16 raiders hop off the passenger coach and herd up the 
           platform to the last open boxcar, where they begin to climb 
           in en masse as if this were nothing unusual. Andrews, Slavins 
           and Buffum continue on up to the engine...

           INT. LACY HOTEL - DAY

           Fuller and his crew finally sit down with their plates of hot 
           gravy and biscuits, oblivious.

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - DAY

           Andrews, Slavins and Buffum take over the cab. They’re 
           surprised by Cain in the tender.

                                 CAIN
                        What ya’ll think yer doin’?

                                 ANDREWS
                        We’re takin’ this train, my friend.

           Cain drops his breakfast and grabs a stoker.

                                 CAIN
                        Hell you are.

           Andrews draws his pistol.

                                 ANDREWS
                        We’re Union agents. On your side, 
                        boy. Now put down that stoker and 
                        let us do our business.

                                 CAIN
                        Boy, huh? I’m loyal to men, not 
                        sides. And to the man I’m loyal, 
                        this train is like our old lady. 
                        And I ain’t lettin’ nobody touch 
                        our old lady.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Have it your way.

           EXT. BIG SHANTY STATION - DAY

           Cain is thrown from the engine. He lands with thud on the 
           Camp McDonald side of the tracks. The pickets see this, as do 
           other rebels in camp.
           The General roars to life and with a pull, jar and clang 
           lurches forward out of the station.

           INT. BOXCAR - THE GENERAL - MOVING

           Shadrach hands out weapons like candy from the open crate. 

                                 SHADRACH
                        Here we fuckin’ roll!

           Dorsey and Campbell exchange uneasy glances.

           INT. LACY HOTEL - DAY

           Fuller jumps up from his breakfast, shocked at what he sees: 
           Outside the General, tender and three boxcars are skipping 
           the station. Its mail and baggage car and two coaches just 
           sit there on the tracks, left behind.

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - MOVING

           Buffum feeds wood into the firebox. Slavins presses the 
           throttle and they gain speed. Andrews holds his stove-pipe 
           hat and grins at Big Shanty falling away behind them.

           EXT. BIG SHANTY STATION - DAY

           Soldiers everywhere come running. The pickets stand over Cain 
           in the grass clutching his leg.

                                 CONFEDERATE PICKET
                        What’s going on, nigger?

           Fuller sprints out from the Lacy.

                                 FULLER
                        Mr. Cain! You okay? Who’s in the 
                        train?

                                 CAIN
                        Theys Union, sir. Three so far as I 
                        could tell.

           Fuller looks at the General building steam and starts running 
           after it down the tracks. The pickets eye Cain with 
           suspicion.

                                 CONFEDERATE PICKET
                        Your friends, eh?
           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - MOVING

           The raiders celebrate their success. Pittinger looks out the 
           open door at Fuller booking after them, and pursuing rebels 
           not far behind. Shadrach comes up, little man cocky.

                                 SHADRACH
                        What, that joker think he’s gonna 
                        catch us?

           The boxcar shutters and the train starts losing momentum.

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - MOVING

           The pressure gauge on the boiler quickly drops. Slavins 
           scrambles at the controls.

                                 ANDREWS
                        What’s the fuck’s happening?

                                 SLAVINS
                        I don’t know. We’re losing steam. 
                        We’re losing steam!

           EXT. TRACKS NORTH OF BIG SHANTY - CONTINUOUS

           Still running, Fuller and the Big Shanty rebels start to gain 
           on the General up ahead as it drifts to a complete stop.

                                 BIG SHANTY REBEL
                        They ours now, boys!

           They give a rebel yell and start shooting at the train.

           EXT. BIG SHANTY STATION - DAY

           Cain is manhandled to his feet by a scrum of Confederate 
           soldiers egged on by the irate passengers.

                                 CONFEDERATE PICKET
                        What we got ourselves here, folks, 
                        is a nigger collaborator.

                                 CAIN
                        No please wait!

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - DAY

           Musket shots crack off the cab around them. Andrews blasts 
           back. Slavins is at a loss.
                                 SLAVINS
                        Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

           Buffum shoves him aside and whacks a lever with his elbow. 
           The steam pressure kicks up and the train lumbers forward.

                                 SLAVINS (CONT’D)
                        What did you do?

                                 BUFFUM
                        Closed the damper, you ninny.

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - MOVING

           Campbell, bracing for a firefight, look relieved as the train 
           gets moving. Dorsey just vomits.

           EXT. TRACKS NORTH OF BIG SHANTY - CONTINUOUS

           Fuller, still running and oh so close watches the General 
           gain speed and race away. He finally stops, panting and 
           dejected. The pursuing rebels let loose a last, futile volley 
           of shots at the fleeing train. Fuller looks back to Big 
           Shanty just in time to see:

           CAIN hoisted from a telegraph pole and LYNCHED.

                                 FULLER
                        No!

           Fuller runs back toward his friend, but Cain’s flailing body 
           soon hangs limp. Dead. Fuller falls to his knees in despair. 
           He’s surrounded by the pursuing rebels.

                                 BIG SHANTY REBEL
                        That your barnburner? What in Sam 
                        hell’s happenin’ round here?

           Fuller glares in the direction of the General, now only a 
           belched trail of smoke over the treetops. He picks himself up 
           and pulls his shit together.

                                 FULLER
                        You need to get a man on a horse 
                        back to Marietta so somebody can 
                        telegraph the stations ahead.

                                 BIG SHANTY REBEL
                        And tell ‘em what?
                                 FULLER
                        The General has just been seized by 
                        Union agents drivin’ it north. And 
                        that William Fuller, the conductor, 
                        is in pursuit.

           The Big Shanty Rebel looks Fuller up and down, incredulous.

                                 BIG SHANTY REBEL
                        In pursuit? How are you in pursuit?

                                 FULLER
                        Any Goddamn way I can.

           They watch Fuller trot off up the tracks after the General.

                                 FULLER (CONT’D)
                             (calling back re: Cain)
                        And get that man down from that 
                        pole.

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - MOVING

           The countryside streaks by. The raiders whoop it up over 
           their clean(ish) getaway. Even Dorsey looks emboldened.

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - MOVING

           Andrews too is elated.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Nice work, gentlemen.

           Buffum takes another pull of whiskey, offers the bottle to 
           Andrews. Andrews takes a pull.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        How’d you know what to do about the 
                        damper anyway?

                                 BUFFUM
                        I never ran a engine, but I used 
                        the boiler to blow a shitload of 
                        ‘em up.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Blow ‘em up where?

                                 BUFFUM
                        Good ‘ol days back in bleedin’ 
                        Kansas. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BUFFUM (CONT'D)
                        I was fightin’ for the 
                        abolitionists. One of the few who 
                        escaped Harper’s Ferry.

           Andrews is impressed. Slavins grabs Fuller’s gift on the 
           dash, starts rattling it to his ear.

                                 SLAVINS
                        Hey what about this? Should we open 
                        it?

           Andrews nods for him to put it down.

                                 ANDREWS
                        We’re patriots, Mr. Slavins, not 
                        thieves.

           He winks.

           EXT. HUNTSVILLE STATION, ALABAMA - DAY

           A city under occupation. General Mitchel mobilizes his troops 
           into boxcars, coaches, flatbeds, anything that can hold them. 
           It’s a massive rolling convoy. A subtitle appears:

                        “HUNTSVILLE, ALABAMA 
                        100 MILES WEST OF CHATTANOOGA”

           Arbuckle comes up.

                                 CAPTAIN ARBUCKLE
                        Scouts say we should have no 
                        trouble pushing as far as Stevenson 
                        Junction.

                                 MITCHEL
                        Good. It’s a beautiful sight, isn’t 
                        it Captain? An army on the move.

                                 CAPTAIN ARBUCKLE
                        Yes, sir. Let’s hope Andrews is 
                        movin’ just the same.

                                 MITCHEL
                        Don’t worry. If he’s captured or 
                        killed we’ll hear at a telegraph up 
                        the line.

                                 CAPTAIN ARBUCKLE
                        And if we hear nothing?
                                 MITCHEL
                        That means wires are being cut and 
                        the raiders are on their way.

           INT. CONFEDERATE ENCAMPMENT - CHATTANOOGA - DAY

           Wood drills with his new regiment. Something causes commotion 
           within the ranks. All heads turn to:

           Llewellyn, marched back into camp by Lieutenant Vickers. He 
           and Wood make eye contact.

           A MOUNTED OFFICER comes riding through.

                                 MOUNTED OFFICER
                        Look sharp men, Colonel Leadbetter 
                        is comin’! Colonel Leadbetter!

           INT. MIRIAM’S BEDROOM - MARIETTA - DAY

           We can hear Miriam pounding away inside the closet. Finally a 
           female HOUSE SLAVE enters.

                                 HOUSE SLAVE
                        Miss Miriam?

           At first she’s confused about the source of the pounding and 
           the scattered state of the room.

                                 HOUSE SLAVE (CONT’D)
                        Miss Miriam? Is that you?

           She opens the closet and finds Miriam, still gagged and bound 
           to a chair.

                                 HOUSE SLAVE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my Lord!

           She removes the gag and unties her.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Tell no one about this, you 
                        understand.

           EXT. UP THE LINE PAST BOONE’S STATION - DAY

           The General has stopped again, this time on purpose. A gang 
           of raiders struggle to pry up the tracks, getting nowhere. 
           Finally Campbell jumps in, the big man ripping shit up with 
           his bare hands.
           Ahead at the engine, Andrews ties a red handkerchief to the 
           cowcatcher.

                                 BUFFUM
                        What the fuck you tyin’ a bow on 
                        this thing for? It Mitchel‘s 
                        birthday or somethin’?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Tell him Slavins.

                                 SLAVINS
                        It’s a signal to everyone up ahead. 
                        Says we’re running an emergency 
                        train.

                                 ANDREWS
                        We’re gonna have to stop at a 
                        station or two. It’s part of our 
                        cover for passing through 
                        unscheduled. We’ll say we’re racing 
                        extra munitions up to Leadbetter.

           He points to Shadrach shimmied atop a telegraph pole cutting 
           the lines.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        With the telegraph cut, there’s no 
                        one to tell ‘em any different.

           Pittinger comes running.

                                 PITTINGER
                        Andrews! You’re not gonna believe 
                        this.

           A man is running toward them up the tracks: 

           FULLER

           Rolling his eyes, Andrews draws his pistol and aims. 
           Pittinger jumps in front.

                                 PITTINGER (CONT’D)
                        Wait! He’s one man. On foot. A 
                        civilian.

           Andrews gives Pittinger a barbed look, then pops off a 
           warning shot at Fuller’s feet. Fuller pulls up, message 
           received.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I’m a lot of things, Mr. Pittinger, 
                        but cold blooded ain’t one of them. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANDREWS (CONT'D)
                        Don’t ever challenge me in front of 
                        the men again.

           He barks to his raiders.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Okay raiders, let’s get this show 
                        on the road.
                             (annoyed, to Pittinger)
                        And make sure you shut them boxcar 
                        doors.

           The raiders toss the torn up track into the last boxcar and 
           climb in behind it, pulling the doors shut.

           FULLER again starts chasing after them, again getting close, 
           only to lose the General once more. He lets go a primal 
           scream of frustration and pulls up.

           Doubled over and gasping for air, Fuller looks between his 
           legs and spots something coming up the tracks behind him. The 
           sweat in his eyes and the lack of oxygen make it hard to 
           recognize...

           A POLE CART, manned by Murphy and Anderson, Fuller’s engineer 
           and brakeman from the General. They propel themselves up the 
           tracks waving and shouting.

                                 MURPHY
                        Look at what we found at Boone’s 
                        Station!

           Fuller is so Goddamn happy he could cry.

           EXT. MARIETTA STATION - DAY

           Parrott and Wollam lurk the platform, panicked, their 
           bootless stockinged feet receiving looks from everyone.

                                 PARROTT
                        What are we going to do?

                                 WOLLAM
                        You’re the fookin’ one good with 
                        God, ain’t ya? Ask him.

           Right then the Big Shanty Rebel Fuller dispatched comes 
           galloping into the station. The two raiders watch as he jumps 
           off his horse, confers with the STATION MASTER, then 
           disappears into the TELEGRAPH OFFICE. A flustered Station 
           Master addresses the crowd:
                                 STATION MASTER
                        Uh, ladies and gentlemen, due to an 
                        unexpected, uh, situation on the 
                        line, there will be no passenger 
                        service to Chattanooga today. The 
                        Western & Atlantic Railroad 
                        apologizes for your inconvenience.

           Passengers grumble and twitter. The soldiers among them 
           suddenly look on alert. Parrott and Wollam look at each 
           other. Oh fuck.

           EXT. MARIETTA SQUARE - DAY

           Miriam, now dressed, hurries across the square, citizens and 
           soldiers frantic with the news of the raiders. She steps up 
           to the BANK, where a group of customers and employees stand 
           outside the locked doors.

                                 MIRIAM
                        What’s going on?

                                 BANK TELLER
                        Don’t know. They usually open the 
                        doors at eight.

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - MOVING

           The raiders sit rocking in the dark of the buttoned up 
           Boxcar. Shadrach scratches his head with his pistol. Dorsey 
           and Campbell play gin rummy. Pittinger peeks out a crack at 
           the world speeding by outside.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Why the fuck didn’t we wax that 
                        confederate back there?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Why’s everything gotta be about 
                        killing with you?

                                 DORSEY
                        Cuz he’s never done it.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Shit, at least I ain’t got the 
                        balls of school girl. You must be 
                        the pride of pussyville, Ohio.

           Shadrach shoves him into a corner. Dorsey is humiliated. 
           What’s sad is he knows it’s true.
                                 PITTINGER
                        Enough. If a man can’t hurt the 
                        mission, we’re not gonna hurt him.

           EXT. ETONAH STATION - DAY

           The General approaches a small hamlet sprung around the 
           Etonah Mining & Manufacturing Company. An old, rinky-dink 
           workhorse switch engine sits on the spur with a cart load of 
           coal. This is the YONAH. Again, a subtitle:

                        “ETONAH STATION
                        95 MILES TO CHATTANOOGA”

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - MOVING

           Buffum sprinkles oil into the fire. Slavins holds her steady. 
           They see the little engine and turn to Andrews with concern.

                                 SLAVINS
                        I thought we weren’t suppose to see 
                        any trains ‘til Kingston?

                                 ANDREWS
                        We weren’t.

                                 BUFFUM
                        So let’s stop and blow that fuckin’ 
                        engine?

                                 ANDREWS
                        I don’t wanna risk a skirmish and 
                        break appearances. We play our 
                        cards right we’ll ride into 
                        Chattanooga without another shot 
                        fired. That coal clunker’s nothin’ 
                        to worry about anyway.

           EXT. ETONAH STATION - DAY

           The General thunders past the brick platform and the dismayed 
           faces of passengers looking out for the usual train, the 
           Yonah left in its dust.

           EXT. UP THE LINE PAST BOONE’S STATION - DAY

           Fuller, Murphy and Anderson lift the pole cart over the gap 
           in the sabotaged tracks. They set it down, hop on and start 
           pushing up the line.
           INT. CONFEDERATE ENCAMPMENT - CHATTANOOGA - DAY

           Young Wood’s new regiment stands at attention. Colonel 
           Leadbetter paces before them.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        You boys know why we don’t give out 
                        metals in our Confederate army? 
                        It’s because you’re all heros. And 
                        it would be a mistake to single out 
                        one man from any other.

           He comes to Llewellyn, who stands naked on a barrel, arms 
           strapped to a crosstie balanced atop his shoulders like a 
           crucifix.

                                 LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
                        Unless, of course, that man’s a 
                        deserter. In that case you get to 
                        be a shining star, the one everyone 
                        talks about, the center of all our 
                        attention.

           The ranks laugh. All but Wood. This is not lost on 
           Leadbetter, who steps up to the boy.

                                 LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
                        You’re his friend, are you?

                                 WOOD
                        Just... just traveling together, 
                        sir.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Well, in that case you won’t mind 
                        doing the honor.

           He hands him a revolver. Wood looks up, horrified. Leadbetter 
           drags him over to Llewellyn.

                                 LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
                             (to Llewellyn)
                        Anything you’d like to say? A 
                        reason for me to spare you?

           Llewellyn looks to Wood. He could easily sell him out, but he 
           says nothing.

                                 LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
                             (to Wood)
                        Okay, private. Shoot him so we can 
                        all get on with our lives.
           Wood can’t even raise the gun. Leadbetter raises his own to 
           Wood’s temple.

                                 LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
                        You have twenty seconds.

           Llewellyn nods for him to do it, tries to give a forgiving 
           smile. Wood lifts the revolver, looks away and SHOOTS. 

           Llewellyn blows from the barrel and smacks in the mud. Wood 
           looks back to his friend, shot dead in the chest. Leadbetter 
           snatches the gun back.

                                 LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
                             (to Lt. Vickers)
                        Give that one the other’s rations 
                        for the day. Company dismissed!

           INT. ANDREWS’ ROOM - FLETCHER HOUSE - DAY

           A SHERIFF and two deputies unwrap Cole’s corpse from the 
           blood-matted bedding. He looks to the front desk clerk from 
           the night before.

                                 SHERIFF
                        You say a whole gang of men you 
                        never seen before bunked here last 
                        night?

           The clerk nods. Another DEPUTY comes to the door.

                                 DEPUTY
                        Sheriff, something weird is goin’ 
                        on at the bank.

           INT. BANK - DAY

           A SHOTGUN BLAST blows off the lock and the front door kicks 
           in. The sheriff and his deputies enter and see two bodies 
           with feed sacks thrown over their heads. 

           Yanking off the masks they find first the night watchman, his 
           throat slit, then Bank President, gagged but alive.

           Customers gawk from the doorway, Miriam among them.

           EXT. CASS WOOD & WATER STATION - DAY

           The General refuels under a water tower. Slavins draws down 
           the spigot and begins to fill the tender. A subtile reads:

                                 (MORE)
                                 DEPUTY (CONT'D)
                        “CASS WOOD & WATER STATION 
                        86 MILES TO CHATTANOOGA”

           Andrews hands the STATION TENDER a refueling ticket. The 
           station tender eyes Buffum, who grabs cords of wood.

                                 CASS STATION TENDER
                        Movin’ gunpowder you say?

                                 ANDREWS
                        By special order of Colonel 
                        Leadbetter. Those Yankee 
                        cocksuckers try to move on 
                        Chattanooga like they did 
                        Huntsville, he’ll blow ‘em sky 
                        high.

                                 CASS STATION TENDER
                        And where’s Mr. Fuller?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Mr. Fuller?

                                 CASS STATION TENDER
                        That there’s the General. They got 
                        plenty ‘a rigs down in Atlanta, 
                        curious they should give you his 
                        baby.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Yes, well, the Confederate High 
                        Command doesn’t need to run its 
                        mission’s by railroad employees.

                                 CASS STATION TENDER
                             (eyes narrowing)
                        Maybe not, but if this particular 
                        employee wants to keep his job, he 
                        better know what’s runnin’ through 
                        his station.

           Slavins and Buffum swap looks. The station tender goes to the 
           first boxcar.

                                 CASS STATION TENDER (CONT’D)
                        Open this door please.

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - STOPPED

           The raiders keep still in the dark. Shadrach ever so quietly 
           cocks his pistol.
           EXT. CASS WOOD & WATER STATION - DAY

                                 CASS STATION TENDER
                        Well? You gonna open her or am I?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Be my guest.

           The station tender throws open the boxcar door. Car’s empty. 
           He looks back to Andrews, not satisfied. He goes to the 
           second boxcar and does the same. Also empty.

                                 CASS STATION TENDER
                        Gunpowder, huh?

           Andrews is unreadable.

           The station tender goes to the last boxcar. Again he throws 
           open the door. He’s surprised to see:

           14 ARMED MEN crouched in the dark.

           BLAM! Shadrach shoots the man in the face. He drops like a 
           sack of dirt.

           Andrews stalks up to the boxcar.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Alright, who shot the bastard?

           Pittinger points a thumb at Shadrach.

                                 PITTINGER
                        Who do you think?

                                 SHADRACH
                        Woo-hoo! Bagged my first Johnny-
                        Reb!

           Andrews looks down at the corpse then to Shadrach, not happy. 

           CRACK! A rifle shot splinters the side of the boxcar just 
           missing him. Andrews rolls under the carriage on the tracks, 
           no idea where the fire is coming from.

           CRACK! One of the raiders is tagged. Shadrach and Dorsey duck 
           for cover inside the boxcar. Campbell drags the wounded man 
           away from the door. Pittinger flings it shut.

           CRACK! Aimed somewhere else. Andrews see Slavins smack the 
           ground a few cars ahead. He groans, begins to crawl.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Slavins!
           CRACK! A second shot ends him.

           INT. BANK - DAY

           The sheriff pours a shot of whiskey for the Bank President.

                                 SHERIFF
                        What do you mean no monies were 
                        taken?

           The Bank President dabs sweat from his upper lip, shifty and 
           nervous. He looks to Miriam, who gives a slight nod.

                                 BANK PRESIDENT
                        Not a cent. You can check the 
                        ledgers against what’s in the safe. 
                        Guess halfway through the thieves 
                        got spooked.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY BEHIND FLETCHER HOUSE - MARIETTA - DAY

           Parrott and Wollam peek around a corner into the square, 
           swarming with agitated soldiers and deputies.

                                 PARROTT
                        No doubt they’re combing the city 
                        for spies.

                                 WOLLAM
                        Maybe we lay low back at the 
                        fookin’ hotel?

           They look back to Fletcher’s back door which swings open. Out 
           steps the front desk clerk, a bundle of blood-soaked sheets 
           in his arms. He sees the two raiders--their bootless, 
           stockinged feet and guilty expressions.

                                 CLERK
                        Hey, you two--

           Before he can dump the bedding the raiders run off into the 
           square.

           EXT. CASS WOOD & WATER STATION - DAY

           Andrews is pinned beneath the boxcar, sniper shots 
           ricocheting around him.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Fuck this.
           He starts blasting back blindly, screams to his raiders.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Give me cover you shitheels.

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - CONTINUOUS

           Pittinger pumps his rifle and throws open the door.

                                 PITTINGER
                        You heard the man.

           The raiders blindly volley off a blister of gunfire.

           EXT. CASS WOOD & WATER STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Andrews scrapes to his feet and dashes out into the open, 
           covering the forty or so yards to the station tender’s SHACK, 
           and diving in. There, through a sooty window pane he sees:

           A 9-YEAR-OLD BOY with a Davy Crocket musket, positioned in 
           the woods. The boy sees him and shoots.

           The whole window blows out. By the time Andrews is reassured 
           he still has a head the boy is running off into the woods. 
           Andrews takes chase...

           EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           The boy runs like a jackrabbit, lugging a musket as long as 
           he is tall. Andrews, right on his heels, has his pistol out 
           but can’t bring himself to shoot...

           The boy finally trips up on his own gun and goes tumbling. 
           Andrews has him. The boy tries to whack him away with the 
           musket but Andrews ducks and puts a boot in the little 
           fucker’s face, knocking him unconscious.

           EXT. TRACKS SOUTH OF ETONAH STATION - DAY

           Fuller, Murphy and Anderson push up the line on the pole 
           cart. They spot the belched smoke of a locomotive over the 
           treetops.

                                 MURPHY
                        You think that’s them?

                                 FULLER
                        I don’t.
           They round the bend and Fuller breaks a huge smile. It’s the 
           Yonah.

                                 FULLER (CONT’D)
                        I think that’s our new ride.

           EXT. CASS WOOD & WATER STATION - DAY

           The station burns. Campbell and a gang of raiders have 
           mangled some track. They heave ties into a boxcar. Andrews 
           returns with the boy in his arms.

                                 PITTINGER
                        That’s the sniper?

                                 ANDREWS
                        My guess, the station tender’s boy. 
                        I didn’t want him running off to 
                        flag down some nearby group of 
                        cavalry. 

           He glares at Shadrach.

                                 SHADRACH
                        What?

           Andrews just shakes his head. He turns to Campbell.

                                 ANDREWS
                        You looked after whores, right? 
                        Back in Louisville?

           Campbell nods. Andrews entrusts him with the boy.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Put him in the boxcar. I don’t want 
                        him hurt. Just keep him quiet.

           Campbell cradles the kid with the greatest of care. He’s both 
           honored and frightened by the responsibility.

                                 DORSEY
                        What about Mr. Slavins?

           Andrews glances at the body beside the tracks.

                                 ANDREWS
                        He stays here.
           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - CONTINUOUS

           Buffum stares at the controls. He looks to his bottle of 
           whiskey then back to the controls then back to the bottle. He 
           takes one last long sweet pull.

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - CONTINUOUS

           The raiders mount up. Andrews goes to the weapons crate and 
           with a nonchalant boot-tap to its base checks on a secret 
           stash within. The gold.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Okay, boys, let’s get movin’.

           Andrews hops out. Shadrach looks to Pittinger.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Moving how? Who’s gonna drive the 
                        fuckin’ train?

           EXT. CASS WOOD & WATER STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Walking to the engine Andrews comes upon Buffum’s shattered 
           whiskey bottle.

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - CONTINUOUS

           Aboard Andrews finds Buffum familiarizing himself with the 
           controls.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Think you can handle it?

           Buffum smiles sheepishly.

                                 BUFFUM
                        I’ll try not to blow this one up.

           He pulls a lever and the boiler shutters and screams.

           INT. YONAH - DAY

           Fuller, now at the controls, with Murphy and Anderson 
           alongside him, waves farewell to the small crowd gathered 
           alongside the tracks, including the train’s normal crew.

                                 FULLER
                        Much obliged, fellas.
                                 YONAH’S ENGINEER
                        You nail them Yankee bastards!

                                 FULLER
                        We’re sure gonna try.

           He opens the throttle and the little Yonah races off.

           INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE - MARIETTA STATION - DAY

           Miriam, in a huff, speaks with the telegraph operator.

                                 MIRIAM
                        What do you mean I can’t send a 
                        message to my husband?

                                 TELEGRAPH OPERATOR
                        I’m sorry, Mrs. Leadbetter. But 
                        we’ve heard nothing from nobody 
                        that way all morning. We’re pretty 
                        confident the train thieves cut the 
                        wires alongside the track.

                                 MIRIAM
                        So no one up there knows what’s 
                        happened?

           He shakes his head.

                                 TELEGRAPH OPERATOR
                        Only message that’s gettin’ up to 
                        Chattanooga is one you carry 
                        yourself.

           Miriam decides that’s exactly what she’s going to do.

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - MOVING

           The train barrels ahead. Buffum, behind the controls, looks 
           like he’s getting the hang of it. Andrews feeds the firebox.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Not bad for a washed up old 
                        radical.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Shit. Getting her goin’ was easy. 
                        It’s stopping I ain’t so sure 
                        about.
                                 ANDREWS
                        Well, get ready cuz in about two-
                        three miles comes Kingston.

                                 BUFFUM
                        What’s in Kingston?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Our last stop before we start 
                        burning bridges.

           EXT. KINGSTON STATION - DAY

           The General approaches a junction station crawling with men 
           and clogged with cars. A passenger train, the William R. 
           Smith, waits on a spur headed toward Rome, Georgia. A long 
           freight bound south is parked on one of the four sidings. At 
           the center of it all is a stone depot with a broad, three-
           foot high platform around it on all three sides. Subtitle:

           Pittinger peers through a crack, Shadrach pestering.

                        What’cha see smart guy?

                                 PITTINGER
                        Two other trains, a depot, and a

                             (anxious)
                        Then why are we slowing down?

           Campbell gently cradles the boy, still unconscious.

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - DAY

           Buffum eases her onto one of the sidings. In an open field

                        here in no time.
           EXT. KINGSTON STATION - DAY

           Andrews hops from the engine and struts up to a group of 
           railroad men milling around chewing tobacco.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Mornin’, gentlemen. Know where I 
                        can find the stationmaster?

           A crusty, old SWITCHMAN nods to a dandy over by the depot.

                                 SWITCHMAN
                        That’s him. Stephens.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Thanks.

           The switchman spits and watches Andrews walk off toward 
           STEPHENS.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Stephens.

                                 STEPHENS
                        This the ten o’clock? I don’t see 
                        any passenger cars?

                                 ANDREWS
                        The regular train is due behind us. 
                        We’re on a special mission runnin’ 
                        ammunition up to Colonel 
                        Leadbetter. 

                                 STEPHENS
                        Ammunition?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Enough to blow this entire station 
                        to kingdom come.

           Stephens looks to the boxcars and frowns.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Now I’m sure both of us want to get 
                        this train outta here so if you 
                        could just direct the switchman 
                        with the key to our siding to let 
                        us loose.

                                 STEPHENS
                        You just spoke to him.

           He points back to the crusty switchman.
                                 STEPHENS (CONT’D)
                        But I can’t let you go just yet.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Why not?

                                 STEPHENS
                        There’s a freight coming down the 
                        line hasn’t arrived yet. You’ll 
                        have to wait for it to pass.

           Andrews looks to the freight already there.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Isn’t that the scheduled southbound 
                        right there?

                                 STEPHENS
                        Yes, but there’s another, 
                        unscheduled train. Seems Mitchel 
                        marching on Huntsville has the 
                        whole world scrambling up and down 
                        this line. You included.

           Andrews tries to remain calm.

                                 ANDREWS
                        How long you think it’ll be?

                                 STEPHENS
                        No more than 20, 30 minutes. Come 
                        inside for a coffee.

           Andrews surveys their predicament: the rail traffic, the 
           glaring railroad men, the baseball playing militia, the 
           impatient passengers. They’re sitting ducks.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Why not.

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - DAY

           Dorsey has found a crack of his own to peek from.

                                 DORSEY
                             (blurting out)
                        What’s he doin’? He’s heading in--

                                 SHADRACH
                             (shushing him)
                        We’re suppose to be gunpowder. Shut 
                        the fuck up.
           EXT. KINGSTON STATION - DAY

           The crusty switchman eyes the General with mounting 
           suspicion. He sees Buffum looking at him. He nods. Buffum 
           nods back. Something’s not right.

           EXT. COACH STAND - MARIETTA SQUARE - DAY

           Miriam climbs into a COACH. Parrot and Wollam traipse up.

                                 PARROTT
                             (bad southern accent)
                        Pardon me lady. The fella over 
                        yonder says you just hired the last 
                        coach to Chattanooga?

                                 MIRIAM
                        What’s it to you?

                                 PARROTT
                        Me and my associate here was kindly 
                        wonderin’ if we could travel with 
                        ya?

           She sizes them up: two jokers with no shoes standing in the 
           mud.

                                 MIRIAM
                        I don’t think so.

                                 PARROTT
                        Please. We’ll make it worth your 
                        while.

           Parrot holds out a clutch of gold coins, what Andrews gave 
           them in case of emergency. Miriam catches her breath. She 
           sees her husband’s markings.

                                 MIRIAM
                             (sly)
                        So you will. Get in.

           The clerk from the Fletcher watches this from the alleyway.

           INT. YONAH - MOVING

           Fuller and his crew draw up to the smoldering remains of the 
           Cass Wood & Water Station, stopping short of the gap in the 
           sabotaged track.

                                 MURPHY
                        The bastards.
           EXT. CASS WOOD & WATER STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Fuller jumps off, kneels next to the dead station tender, 
           hole in his face. He scopes around the station.

                                 FULLER
                        Eli? You here, son?

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR- DAY

           The raiders huddle in the dark, quiet as mice. ELI, the boy 
           in Campbell’s arms, stirs.

                                 CAMPBELL
                             (whispering)
                        He’s wakin’.

           Eli’s eyes open, adjust, and he knows he’s in trouble. He 
           recoils away from Campbell, but Shadrach is there with a 
           knife in his face.

                                 SHADRACH
                        One peep and it’ll be your last.

           Campbell wraps his giant hand around Shadrach’s wrist and 
           pushes the knife away.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You touch this boy and I’ll rip 
                        your throat out.

           They face off for a moment: the gentle giant and the 
           sociopath. Then the boy retreats back into the safe harbor of 
           Campbell’s mighty arms. Shadrach can’t conceal his amusement.

                                 SHADRACH
                        I thought you weren’t no killer.

           INT. DEPOT - KINGSTON STATION - DAY

           Andrews sips coffee in the stationmaster’s office with 
           Stephens and another big man, WILEY HARBIN, engineer of 
           William R. Smith. Harbin checks his timepiece.

                                 HARBIN
                        When you say Fuller’s usual train 
                        was gonna arrive behind you?

                                 STEPHENS
                        Mr. Harbin here runs the connecting 
                        train down from Rome. He’s a 
                        stickler for schedule.
                                 ANDREWS
                             (to Harbin)
                        I didn’t. But I’m sure it’ll come 
                        along soon.

           Harbin is skeptical.

                                 STEPHENS
                        By the way, you happen to see if 
                        any branches might ‘a blown down 
                        and snapped the telegraph line?

           He gestures to the TELEGRAPH OFFICE next door.

                                 STEPHENS (CONT’D)
                        We haven’t received a message 
                        coming up all morning.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Frankly, Mr. Stephens, the only 
                        thing I’m concentrating on is 
                        delivering Leadbetter his 
                        ammunition.

                                 HARBIN
                        Lil’ strange they wouldn’t 
                        telegraph ahead ‘bout it.

           Andrews, unflappable.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Not if you consider there are spies 
                        among the railroad men.

                                 HARBIN
                        Spies?

           An approaching train’s steam whistle blows. They all look out 
           the window where the second freight pulls into the station. 
           The CATOOSA.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Time to go.

                                 STEPHENS
                        Not just yet I’m afraid.

           Harbin points to a red handkerchief tied to the last flatbed.

                                 HARBIN
                        Looks like there’s a second 
                        unscheduled train comin’ up behind.
           EXT. CASS WOOD & WATER STATION - DAY

           Fuller, Murphy and Anderson have carefully pried up a section 
           of rail from behind the Yonah and carry it to the gap in the 
           tracks.

                                 MURPHY
                        You ever done this before?

                                 FULLER
                        Mr. Murphy, there’s not much about 
                        this morning I’ve done before.

           They insert the rail in the gap.

           EXT. KINGSTON STATION - DAY

           The crusty switchman strolls up to the General’s engine. 
           Buffum sits in the cab, anxiously counting down the minutes.

                                 SWITCHMAN
                        Looks like it’s gonna storm.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Darkenin’ up, alright.

                                 SWITCHMAN
                        Mighty fine rig you got here.

                                 BUFFUM
                        She’s a good one.

                                 SWITCHMAN
                        Baldwin. 4-4-0. Mighty fine.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Mighty fine indeed.

                                 SWITCHMAN
                        Only this one here’s a Rogers.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Right. Of course.

           Buffum knows he’s just fucked up. The switchman knows it too. 
           He smiles and moseys off, strolling down the length of the 
           train, eying each car as he goes. He stops outside the last 
           boxcar. He can sense something very wrong inside...
           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - CONTINUOUS

           The raiders. They too sense him right there. They dare not 
           move or breathe. Campbell smothers Eli’s mouth with his beefy 
           hand, keeping him quiet. Shadrach spies the boy’s left foot 
           shaking uncontrollably. He smiles. No one else notices.

           EXT. KINGSTON STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Something catches the switchman’s eye, something around the 
           boxcar doors:

           BULLET GASHES

           He works his finger in one of the gashes. The splintering is 
           fresh. He looks back to Buffum, who watches him. They’re both 
           startled by the... 

           SQUEALING WHISTLE of the third and final freight rolling 
           south. The TEXAS.

           EXT. DEPOT - CONTINUOUS

           Andrews steps out with Stephens and Harbin, relieved.

                                 ANDREWS
                        It’s about fuckin’ time.

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - CONTINUOUS

           Buffum watches as the Texas rumbles into the station, it’s 
           boxcars and flatbeds loaded to the hilt with artillery and 
           Confederate soldiers. Shit.

           INT. SWITCHMAN’S OFFICE - DEPOT - CONTINUOUS

           The switchman hangs up his switch key, grabs a revolver and 
           locks the door behind him.

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - CONTINUOUS

           Dorsey listens to the Texas outside wheezing to a stop. 
           Pittinger finally notices Eli’s glassy, bottomless eyes and 
           yanks Campbell’s huge hand from covering the boy’s mouth and 
           nose.

           Eli has suffocated. 
           Campbell is shattered. He looks down at his hands, hands that 
           have once again betrayed him, the hands of a killer. He’s 
           horrified at himself.

           Shadrach just cackles.

           EXT. SWITCHMAN’S OFFICE - DEPOT - CONTINUOUS

           Andrews and Stephens walk up to the switchman, who stands in 
           front of his office, gun in his waistband.

                                 STEPHENS
                        Mr. Bedloe, if you’d be so kind to 
                        turn the switch for Mr. Andrews.

                                 SWITCHMAN
                        I will not. There’s somethin’ fishy 
                        goin’ on. Who is this fella to 
                        order us all around? By what 
                        authority? And if he’s runnin’ 
                        ammunition up to Leadbetter, why’s 
                        the Colonel runnin’ his own forces 
                        south? Look at that train just 
                        arrived.

                                 ANDREWS
                        This is fucking absurd. I have my 
                        orders.

           He pushes past the switchman, but finds the door locked.

           EXT. KINGSTON STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Over at the General Buffum pretends to take a leak against 
           the wheels of the last boxcar. He whispers to the men inside.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Pssst! Shit is gettin’ a lil’ 
                        uneasy out here, boys.

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - CONTINUOUS

           The raiders listen up, all but Campbell, who just stares at 
           the dead boy he was entrusted by Andrews.

                                 BUFFUM (O.S.)
                        Be ready to jump out and let ‘em 
                        have it hot and fast.

           Shadrach is eager to start shooting. Dorsey not so much. 
           Pittinger has to literally put a gun in Dorsey’s hand.
           EXT. SWITCHMAN’S OFFICE - DEPOT - CONTINUOUS

           Andrews turns to the switchman, not fucking around.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Open this door old man or I break 
                        it down.

           The switchman draws his gun.

                                 SWITCHMAN
                        You do and I’ll shoot you dead as 
                        dirt.

                                 STEPHENS
                        Gentlemen, please.

           Andrews steps away from the door, conciliatory.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Fine. Telegraph Leadbetter up the 
                        line.

           The switchman relaxes and Andrews pounces, viper-quick, 
           twisting away the gun and heaving the old man through the 
           door, breaking it down.

           EXT. TEXAS - FLATBED - CONTINUOUS

           The scuffle is seen by a grayback PRIVATE, who turns to his 
           commander reading Voltaire next to a GATLING GUN.

                                 PRIVATE
                        Captain?

           It’s none other than Captain Whitsitt from the hospital.

                                 CAPTAIN WHITSITT
                        Yes, Private?

                                 PRIVATE
                        Something’s stirrin’ over by the 
                        depot.

           INT. SWITCHMAN’S OFFICE - DEPOT - CONTINUOUS

           Andrews grabs the switch key, steps over the groaning 
           switchman on his way out...
           EXT. SWITCHMAN’S OFFICE - DEPOT - CONTINUOUS

           Andrews strides past Stephens.

                                 STEPHENS
                        I don’t know how I feel about this.

           Ignoring him, Andrews stalks toward the SWITCH. A voice calls 
           out from behind.

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        Stop right there and identify 
                        yourself.

           Andrews turns. He can’t fucking believe it. It’s Whitsitt, 
           flanked by five Confederate soldiers. The Captain recognizes 
           Andrews immediately.

                                 CAPTAIN WHITSITT
                        Andrews?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Captain.

           He nods to Buffum, who flings open the boxcar door.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Showtime, boys.

           Lead by Shadrach, a dozen raiders spill out guns blazing.

                                 CAPTAIN WHITSITT
                        Union agents! Union agents!

           The massacre begins. Shadrach and Pittinger each notch up 
           kills. Dorsey fumbles with his pistol, fires it next to 
           Pittinger’s ear, blowing his eardrum.

                                 PITTINGER
                        Jesus Christ, Dorsey!

           Whitsitt scrambles away...

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - CONTINUOUS

           Campbell sits with Eli, catatonic with grief.

           EXT. SWITCHMAN’S OFFICE - DEPOT - CONTINUOUS

           Andrews sees Whitsitt duck into the telegraph office. He 
           tosses Buffum the switch key...
                                 ANDREWS
                        Get the switch.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Where the fuck you goin’?

                                 ANDREWS
                        That cocksucker shoots a wire off 
                        to Leadbetter we’re done for.

           Andrews races after Whitsitt. Pittinger, reading the 
           situation, follows on his heels...

           Bullets starts to fly from the Texas, tagging Dorsey with a 
           gut shot. He goes down howling.

           Shadrach and the remaining raiders blister fire back across 
           the station, keeping the rest of Whitsitt’s troops at bay.

           INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE - DEPOT - CONTINUOUS

           Captain Whitsitt rushes in, and oddly, shuts the blinds. To 
           the telegraph operator:

                                 CAPTAIN WHITSITT
                        We need to send out alarm.

                                 TELEGRAPH OPERATOR
                        About what?

           CRASH! 

           A piece of luggage shatters through the window. Andrews, 
           stepping up behind it, SHOOTS WHITSITT, then turns his gun on 
           the operator, frozen at the telegraph. Whitsitt, wounded but 
           alive, HURLS THE LUGGAGE back at Andrews, deflecting the kill 
           shot. The CAPTAIN LUNGES for Andrews and grappling with each 
           other, the two tumble back onto the operator. As they GO AT 
           IT HAND TO HAND the operator tries to somehow reach the 
           telegraph...

           EXT. DEPOT - CONTINUOUS

           Pittinger hustles up the platform to the shattered telegraph 
           office window and is WHACKED IN THE CHEST with a shovel by 
           Harbin, knocking him off his feet. Harbin swings again but 
           Pittinger dodges and blasts off Harbin’s kneecap...
           EXT. KINGSTON STATION - CONTINUOUS

           BUFFUM keys the switch, sees MILITIAMEN come running from the 
           baseball field with muskets.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Fuck me.

           He books back to the engine.

           THE REBELS ON THE TEXAS finally regroup and get the Gatling 
           going. They begin to strafe the station, mowing down 
           innocents, their own, three of the rifle-wielding raiders. 

           EVERYONE SCATTERS. Shadrach and some raiders grab the wounded 
           Dorsey and they take cover back at...

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - CONTINUOUS

           Where Campbell is still immobilized, numb to the boxcar 
           splintering around him.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Jesus Christ, Campbell, pick up a 
                        fuckin’ gun will ya!

           Campbell finally looks up, all hate and rage in his eyes...

           INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE - DEPOT - CONTINUOUS

           Andrews and Whitsitt thrash about, grappling over a pistol on 
           the floor. The operator gets to his desk. Thanks to Andrews 
           the gun discharges, the bullet STRIKING THE OPERATOR before 
           he taps anything out, his brains scattering across the 
           telegraph. Finally Whitsitt flings Andrews off of him, 
           controls the pistol, and HAS HIM DEAD TO RIGHTS...

           BLAM!

           Pittinger wastes Whitsitt from the window. Andrews nods, 
           grateful. They’re even.

           EXT. KINGSTON STATION - CONTINUOUS

           BUFFUM stokes the engine, ready to fucking fly. He blasts 
           away two militiamen who try to take the cab.

                                 BUFFUM
                             (shouting to the depot)
                        Andrews!
           SHADRACH and the rest take fire from all sides. The Gatling 
           has them pinned. Suddenly, thankfully, the shredding stops.

           THE REBELS ON THE TEXAS scramble to unjam the Gatling. It’s 
           barrel’s so hot it scorches their hands.

           CAMPBELL finally snaps into action. He grabs two double 
           barrel shotguns and a shitload of grenades from the “BIBLES” 
           crate. To Shadrach:

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I never wanted to be a killer.

           He jumps from the boxcar...

           INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE - DEPOT - CONTINUOUS

           Andrews and Pittinger smash the telegraph.

           EXT. KINGSTON STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Campbell rampages across the clearing between the two trains, 
           blasting buckshot and chucking grenades like a man possessed. 
           He takes bullets without blinking...

           Behind him, Andrews and Pittinger dash from the depot...

           Campbell storms the flatbed with the Gatling, slaughtering 
           everyone. At one point, running out of shotgun shells, he 
           beats a rebel to death with the butt of the shotgun. Then, 
           unjamming the Gatling, Campbell swivels it around and starts 
           shredding up the troop train.

           EXT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - DAY

           Pittinger dives in and sees the carnage. Two more raiders 
           dead, several others tagged and oozing blood, including 
           Dorsey.

                                 PITTINGER
                        Jesus Christ.

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - DAY

           Andrews climbs in with Buffum.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Let’s get the fuck outta here.
                                 BUFFUM
                        What about the big fella?

           He points to the Texas, Campbell at the Gatling... 

           INT. TEXAS - GATLING FLATBED - CONTINUOUS

           Campbell’s a KILLING MACHINE! He screams like a maniac 
           shredding everyone and everything in sight, unaware he’s 
           about to be ambushed by two dozen rebels advancing from both 
           directions.

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - CONTINUOUS

           Shadrach and Pittinger see this.

                                 PITTINGER
                        Campbell!

           INT. TEXAS - GATLING FLATBED - CONTINUOUS

           The rebels blister Campbell with barrage of hot lead, tossing 
           the big man around like a rag doll, his grip never loosening 
           from the wildly recoiling gun. It’s as violent and 
           spectacular a death as any of these men have ever witnessed.

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - CONTINUOUS

           Andrews is horrified. Their little heist has now moved into 
           all out war. He looks to Buffum, who opens the throttle.

           INT. TEXAS - DAY

           Slumped against the blood splattered Gatling, Campbell looks 
           up to the darkening sky with a final breath as RAINDROPS 
           BEGINS TO FALL...

           INT. YONAH - MOVING

           Approaching through the rain, Fuller sees Kingston.

                                 FULLER
                        Dear God.

           It’s a scene of corpse strewn carnage. The General flees fast 
           up the line.
           EXT. KINGSTON STATION - CONTINUOUS

           The Yonah stops short of the train clogged station. Fuller 
           steps through the death, blood mingling with mud. Women howl 
           over their men, wounded rebel soldiers wander in a daze. 
           Fuller is sickened and shocked. He finds...

                                 FULLER
                        Mr. Stephens.

           Stephens watches rebels rifle through Campbell’s pockets then 
           kick his bullet riddled corpse from the flatbed.

                                 STEPHENS
                        Who are these savages?

                                 FULLER
                        Union agents. And we need to keep 
                        after ‘em. It’ll take too much time 
                        to move all these trains. What rig 
                        can I get rolling north the 
                        quickest?

                                 STEPHENS
                             (pointing)
                        The Texas.

           Fuller’s already running to it. Stephens yells after.

                                 STEPHENS (CONT’D)
                        Only there’s no way you can turn 
                        her around!

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - MOVING

           Buffum throttles through the downpour. He looks to Andrews, 
           who watches the tracks behind them. For the first time he’s 
           rattled.

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - MOVING

           The raiders ride in stunned silence, only 10 left. Pittinger 
           attends to Dorsey, a gurgling bloody mess.

                                 DORSEY
                        They’re comin’ after us aren’t 
                        they?

           Pittinger nods. He sees the rain leaking in the countless 
           bullet holes.
                                 PITTINGER
                        If this keeps up we’re not gonna be 
                        able to torch bridges behind us.

           Shadrach, arming himself to the teeth, holds up a brick of 
           dynamite.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Guess we’ll just have to fucking 
                        blow ‘em.

           INT. MIRIAM’S COACH - MOVING

           Miriam stares at Parrott and Wollam as they bump along the 
           road. They have no idea the jig is up.

                                 MIRIAM
                        So what’s Andrews’ plan?

           They tense up.

                                 PARROTT
                        Huh? Who’s plan? What?

                                 MIRIAM
                        Don’t play dumb, hard as it may be.
                             (re: the coins they gave 
                              her)
                        This is my husband’s gold. Colonel 
                        Leadbetter? You were in on the 
                        heist.

           The guys look at each other, truly clueless.

                                 WOLLAM
                        I think ya got us mixed up with 
                        some other fookin’ fellas.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Do I now? Because one word from me 
                        that you’re Union agents and that 
                        coachman out there will shoot your 
                        dicks off.

                        Listen, Mrs. Bedwetter--

                        We swear, the each of us, on this 
                        holy fuckin’--

           She chucks his bible out the window. Parrott gasps.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Last chance, assholes. I want to 
                        know what you know. Now where’s 
                        Andrews headed with my husband’s 
                        fortune?

                                 WOLLAM
                        Lady, we ain’t even sure where he 
                        was headed with us. We got turned 
                        around before we were told word 
                        one.

                                 MIRIAM
                        What do you mean turned around?

                                 PARROTT
                        He means: do we look like two guys 
                        up to speed with any real plan?

           They wiggle their muddy stockinged feet at her. Miriam 
           realizes she’s snagged two useless buffoons.

           EXT. COVERED BRIDGE - OOSTANAULA RIVER - DAY

           The General idles just north of the crossing in the rain. 
           Andrews, Shadrach and two other raiders sprint from the 
           bridge unspooling a wire. They tie it to the detonation box, 
           crouch down behind the tracks and Andrews throws the plunger.

           Nothing.

                                 ANDREWS
                             (to Shadrach)
                        Go find out what happened.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Go your fuckin’ self.

           There’s no time to argue. Andrews runs back to the bridge, 
           its pylons strapped with bricks and bricks of dynamite. He 
           checks the fuses. Suddenly the SOUND OF A LOCOMOTIVE echoes 
           in the distance. Fuck.
           INT. TEXAS - MOVING

           Barreling up the tracks in reverse, pushing the tender, 
           Fuller, Murphy and Anderson at the controls. Behind them...

           The WILLIAM R. SMITH, Stephens in the cab, passenger cars 
           filled with rowdy soldiers and militiamen out for blood.

           EXT. COVERED BRIDGE - OOSTANAULA RIVER - CONTINUOUS

           Andrews returns from checking on the explosives.

                                 PITTINGER
                        Is that them?

           Andrews nods.

                                 ANDREWS
                        The fuses are soaked.

                                 SHADRACH
                        So we’re fucked.

           A weak voice rasps from the boxcar.

                                 DORSEY (O.C.)
                        I’ll keep ‘em lit.

           All eyes turn to Dorsey, more blood on him than in him.

                                 DORSEY (CONT’D)
                        You need someone right up against 
                        the gunpowder. I can’t do much, but 
                        I can do that.

           Andrews looks back to the bridge, their pursuers now visible 
           huffing and puffing up the line...

           He turns to his raiders. All but Pittinger look away. 
           Nodding, they take Dorsey to the bridge.

           INT. TEXAS - MOVING

           Up ahead Fuller sees the bridge and the General stopped 
           beyond it. Murphy spots some men scrambling around the bridge 
           pylons.

                                 MURPHY
                        Look! They’re gonna blow it.

           Ignoring him, Fuller throttles it faster. Murphy looks at him 
           like he’s crazy.
           INT. WILLIAM R. SMITH - MOVING

           Racing behind, unable to see much over the Texas, Stephens 
           keeps pace...

           EXT. COVERED BRIDGE - OOSTANAULA RIVER - CONTINUOUS

           Pittinger straps Dorsey to the bridge with the explosives.

                                 ANDREWS
                        You sure about this?

                                 DORSEY
                        No one back home thought I’d make 
                        it anyway. Or if I did, only be cuz 
                        I spent the war hiding behind 
                        trees. Guess they weren’t wrong.

           Andrews squeezes his hand.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Bullshit. You’re about to give ‘em 
                        something new to think about.

                                 DORSEY
                             (grimacing in pain)
                        What’s that?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Whether they’ll ever do anything 
                        half as brave as what you’re doing 
                        right here and fucking now.

           Dorsey eeks out a proud, toothy, blood smeared smile. Andrews 
           nods to Pittinger and the two run off, leaving Dorsey to 
           light the short fuses with the cigarette.

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - DAY

           Andrews and Pittinger jump aboard.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Is that Dorsey?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Just go!

           INT. TEXAS - MOVING

           Fuller races toward the covered bridge, only 100 yards now, 
           the rain subsiding. He sees the General start away...
           EXT. COVERED BRIDGE - OOSTANAULA RIVER - CONTINUOUS

           Dorsey, fading, sees the lit fuse spittle out... 

           INT. WILLIAM R. SMITH - MOVING 

           The soldiers and militiamen in the passenger car hoot and 
           laugh, no clue about what’s happening ahead...

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - MOVING

           Shadrach and the rest look out for the explosion...

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE - MOVING

           As does Andrews.

                                 ANDREWS
                        C’mon fucker, blow!

           Rounding a bend, the bridge crossing vanishes from view...

           EXT. COVERED BRIDGE - OOSTANAULA RIVER - CONTINUOUS

           Dorsey desperately tries to re-light the little nub of fuse. 
           The two pursuing locomotives, now almost on top of him, cause 
           the bridge pylons to shake violently. Finally success! The 
           fuse sizzles...

           INT. TEXAS - MOVING

           Fuller’s engine stampedes across the covered bridge, the 
           light at the end of the tunnel getting brighter and 
           brighter...

           BOOM!

           EXT. COVERED BRIDGE - OOSTANAULA RIVER - CONTINUOUS

           The Texas shoots out the other side just as the bridge BLOWS 
           TO SMITHEREENS. 

           The William R. Smith isn’t so lucky. It plunges into the 
           river below in a magnificent display of twisted cars and 
           flung bodies...
           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - MOVING

           Shadrach and the remaining raiders cheer the cloud of smoke 
           and debris rising over the treetop.

           EXT. NEARBY CLEARING DOWN THE RIVER - DAY

           A small cavalry detachment, bivouacking in the woods, sees 
           the explosion. Their leader is the infamous Confederate 
           marauder NATHAN BEDFORD FORREST.

                                 FORREST
                        Mount the fuck up, lads. Someone’s 
                        throwin’ a party and we just got 
                        invited.

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - DAY

           Andrews is ecstatic. Pittinger not so much.

                                 PITTINGER
                             (pointing)
                        Look!

           Chugging into view as the blast cloud dissipates: SMOKE FROM 
           A LOCOMOTIVE.

           Andrews can’t conceal his amazement and frustration.

           INT. TEXAS - MOVING

           Fuller hurtles them ahead, a little Ahab in his eyes. Murphy 
           and Anderson glance back at the blown bridge.

                                 MURPHY
                        What about survivors?

                                 FULLER
                        God help ‘em. We’re after the 
                        General.

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - MOVING

           Andrews turns to Pittinger and Buffum.

                                 ANDREWS
                        This chasing shit ends here.
           EXT. WHERE THE COVERED BRIDGE ONCE STOOD - CONTINUOUS

           Forrest’s cavalrymen gallop up to the blown bridge, train 
           wreckage everywhere. They too see the Texas’ smoke over the 
           treetops. A whistle from Forrest and they’re in hot 
           pursuit...

           EXT. TEXAS - DAY

           Fuller slams the brakes. They stop short of a BOXCAR dropped 
           from the General, left behind smoldering on the tracks.

                                 MURPHY
                        What do you think?

                                 FULLER
                        Attach it and push on.

                                 ANDERSON
                        What if it’s full of explosives?

                                 FULLER
                        They need what they got for the 
                        bridges ahead. Car’s only smokin’ 
                        cuz it’s too wet to torch.

           Fuller grabs an old musket in the cab and hops off...

           EXT. TRACKS AND DROPPED BOXCAR - CONTINUOUS

           Fuller walks up to the boxcar, black smoke wafting ominously 
           from its innards. He looks in the open door, the stack of 
           dead raiders barely visible through the smoke. A GUN BARREL 
           presses to his temple.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Don’t move fuck-face.

           Andrews, Pittinger and the rest of the raiders (except 
           Buffum) charge from the woods popping shots in the air. It’s 
           an ambush. Murphy and Anderson throw up their hands. The 
           Texas is easily overtaken.

           Andrews ambles up to Fuller, the two men surprised to see 
           each other.

                                 ANDREWS
                        You’re a persistent fucker, I’ll 
                        give you that.

                                 FULLER
                        You stole my train.
                                 ANDREWS
                        Yeah, well, I’m about to steal 
                        another one.

                                 FULLER
                        Our fireman, the one your side 
                        supposedly cares so much about...

                                 ANDREWS
                        The colored?

                                 FULLER
                        He’s dead cuz of you.

                                 ANDREWS
                             (unmoved)
                        Lotsa folks die for lotsa reasons.

                                 FULLER
                        I’m not gonna stop chasing you.

                                 ANDREWS
                        That’ll be a neat trick.

           He raises his pistol. Suddenly the sound of gunshots and the 
           thundering hooves.

           FORREST’S CAVALRY.

                                 PITTINGER
                             (from the Texas, looking 
                              down the line)
                        It’s the cavalry!

           Fuller bats away Andrews’ gun and barrel rolls into the 
           smoldering boxcar. Shadrach blasts blindly into the smoke.

           Emboldened, Murphy boots Pittinger from the cab into one 
           raider. Another is jumped by Anderson, who takes a bullet...

           The cavalry fast approaching, Andrews and the raiders abandon 
           the Texas and the dropped boxcar and high tail it to...

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - DAY

           Idle, just around the bend. Buffum hears the commotion and 
           sees Andrews come running, the rest of the raiders right 
           behind him. He screams his head off:

                                 ANDREWS
                        Start the fucking engine!

           Buffum does just that.
           EXT. TRACKS AND DROPPED BOXCAR - CONTINUOUS

           Forrest’s cavalrymen storm past the Texas, where Murphy 
           cradles Anderson’s corpse, and the boxcar, where Fuller 
           emerges unscathed. They blast away at the fleeing raiders, 
           rounding the bend...

           INT. GENERAL/EXT. CAVALRY CHASE - MOVING

           THE GENERAL is already pulling away. Andrews, Shadrach and 
           three raiders pile into the last of the two boxcars... 

           PITTINGER runs behind with three other raiders, hustling down 
           the tracks, Forrest’s cavalry closing fast. The two guys next 
           to Pittinger are blown away and drop dead...

           FORREST and his cavalrymen blast away with pistols. The 
           fallen raiders are trampled by the marauding horses...

           ANDREWS and a raider try to give cover, blasting cavalrymen 
           off their mounts while...

           SHADRACH and another guy punch a hole in the back of the 
           boxcar and start heaving out rail ties...

           THE RAIL TIES bounce and smack Cavalrymen off their horses 
           and trip up their steeds, causing a violent pile up of 
           howling, mangled flesh...

           FORREST, somehow getting past this, decapitates a second 
           fleeing raider with the swipe of his broadsword...

           PITTINGER makes the boxcar and is reeled in by Andrews. They 
           are surrounded by stampeding cavalrymen on all sides, some 
           shooting, some attempting to jump the train. Yet another 
           raider is shot dead fending them off...

           A BRAVE CAVALRYMAN gallops alongside the engine and jumps it 
           from his horse. He tackles Buffum at the throttle and the 
           train slows...

           ANDREWS spots the struggle in the engine three cars ahead. 
           Moving to get over there he shimmies atop the boxcar only to 
           run into Forrest, who licks his bloody broadsword.

                                 FORREST
                        Hello laddie.

           BUFFUM throws off the cavalryman and bashes his skull in with 
           a cord of wood. He retakes the controls and the train speeds 
           up...
           ANDREWS bobs and weaves as Forrest swings after him like a 
           maniac, the boxcar roof cracking under every broadsword blow. 
           Andrews finally outmaneuvers Forrest and boots him off the 
           moving train.

           THE CAVALRY has been left in the dust.

           ANDREWS flops back exhausted when the roof collapses from 
           under him. He goes crashing right onto the weapons crate 
           below, which splinters apart. Leadbetter’s stolen gold SPILLS 
           OUT from a false compartment in its base.

           THE RAIDERS gape back at Andrews in astonishment and dismay. 
           He grins like a politician.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I can explain this.

           Only Pittinger, Shadrach, Buffum and 2 other raiders remain.

           EXT. COACH ROAD - DAY

           Miriam’s coach comes upon a WAGON stuck in a rut, a 
           SLAVEHUNTER and his jailbait DAUGHTER flagging them down. 

                                 COACHMAN
                        Need some help friend?

                                 SLAVEHUNTER
                        Does a nigger like to jump?

           His cargo includes stacked cages of frothing, barking dogs 
           and CAPTURED SLAVES, their arms and legs badly bitten.

           INT. MIRIAM’S COACH - CONTINUOUS

           Miriam peers out, not pleased about the stop. She turns back 
           to Parrott and Wollam, scared shitless.

                                 PARROTT
                        You gonna blow the whistle on us?

                                 MIRIAM
                        I don’t know yet. We might just 
                        have to see who’s left standing in 
                        Chattanooga.

                                 WOLLAM
                        You mean who’s standing with the 
                        fookin’ gold?

           She opens the coach door.
                                 MIRIAM
                        Just get out there and push.

           EXT. TILTON STATION - DAY

           Another wood and water stop. The raiders gather in the boxcar 
           to discuss the little matter of the gold.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Can’t we refuel first and talk 
                        about this shit later?

           Shadrach stands shoulder to shoulder with two other raiders. 
           They look riled.

                                 SHADRACH
                        No, me and my boys wanna talk now.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Your boys, huh? I think you’re 
                        forgetting who’s in charge here.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Like you forgot to tell us about 
                        your little fuckin’ treasure trove?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Like I said, some parts of the plan 
                        were kept dark. Now you know you’ll 
                        be well paid.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Oh, I have no doubt about that.

           Shadrach and his two sidekicks draw their weapons.

                                 BUFFUM
                        What the hell you doin’?

                                 SHADRACH
                        We’re relieving Mr. Andrews here of 
                        his command. Along with the gold. 
                             (to Andrews)
                        Now step off my train, cocksucker.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I will not. This is treason.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Treason he says? Like throwin’ 
                        twenty soldiers into a meat grinder 
                        so you can cash in? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHADRACH (CONT'D)
                        I wonder what our dear departed 
                        comrades would have to say about 
                        that shit?

                                 ANDREWS
                        There’s still a mission to finish.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Not any more. This here’s now a 
                        getaway.

                                 ANDREWS
                        You can’t do one without the other.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Watch me.

                                 ANDREWS
                             (to Pittinger)
                        You gonna follow this jerk-off?

           Pittinger looks conflicted. He raises his gun. ON ANDREWS.

                                 PITTINGER
                        Sorry. Mitchel ordered if anything 
                        jeopardized the mission...

           He turns his barrel on Shadrach’s crew. BLAM! Shadrach drops. 
           BLAM! Raider 1 tags Andrews. BLAM! Andrews kills Raider 2. 
           BLAM! Buffum wastes Raider 1. In five seconds the boxcar is a 
           scene of blood and gunsmoke, only Andrews, Pittinger and 
           Buffum left standing.  

                                 BUFFUM
                        Well ain’t that just fuckin’ 
                        perfect!

                                 PITTINGER
                             (to Andrews)
                        You okay?

           Andrews, shoulder bloodied, ignores him and walks over 
           Shadrach, who writhes on the filthy floor shot in the neck. 
           Andrews cocks his pistol for the execution...

                                 PITTINGER (CONT’D)
                        No!

                                 ANDREWS
                        What, you wanna share your cut with 
                        this cocksucker?
                                 PITTINGER
                        My cut? You think any of us besides 
                        these assholes give two shits about 
                        the gold? You think that damn 
                        conductor who’s been dogging us is 
                        doing it for money? Or Dorsey 
                        blowing himself up on that bridge? 
                        Or Campbell taking on a whole train 
                        of Confederates? Or any of these 
                        men who put their lives on the 
                        line? They did it for you, you son 
                        of a bitch! Not because they were 
                        suckers, or they were conned, but 
                        because you gave ‘em a shot, you 
                        made ‘em believe they could be more 
                        than the fuck-ups and shitheels the 
                        army took ‘em for. And you were 
                        right. Look how they’ve stepped up. 
                        Look how they’ve sacrificed. Those 
                        raiders we lost were worth a 
                        hundred of any man who fights for 
                        fucking gold.

           He kicks a scattering of gold coins at Andrews.

                                 PITTINGER (CONT’D)
                        Worth a hundred of you, Goddamn it!

           Andrews lets this sink in. He looks at Pittinger, at Buffum, 
           at Shadrach who’s expired, at the shredded boxcar, the gold 
           underfoot, and for the first time the scales start to fall 
           from his eyes.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Pittinger’s right as rain. You got 
                        us into this shitstorm. We can’t 
                        let our boys die for nothin’. We 
                        need to finish this fucking 
                        mission. All Chattanooga or all 
                        hell.

           Once again smoke appears over the treetops. Here comes 
           Fuller. And all hell...

           INT. TEXAS - MOVING

           Still driving in reverse, the raider’s dropped boxcar now 
           coupled in front. A bloodied Forrest and his remaining 
           cavalrymen hang from it. Fuller and Murphy look out from the 
           cab.
                                 FULLER
                        Look like they’re leaving us 
                        another present.

           Up ahead the General pulls away, abandoning yet another 
           boxcar in Fuller’s path. The raiders are now down to an 
           engine, tender and their last boxcar.

           EXT. TILTON STATION - CONTINUOUS

           The Texas stops short of the second dropped boxcar. This time 
           Forrest and his men surround it guns raised, ready for 
           ambush. Inside they see...

           The carnage of the raiders last firefight. The gold is gone, 
           all but a stray coin that Forrest picks up. He turns to 
           Fuller.

                                 FORREST
                        They’re turning on each other.

           EXT. STEVENSON JUNCTION, ALABAMA - DAY

           A small encampment of Confederate soldiers are on their knees 
           having just surrendered to Mitchel’s massive troop-train. A 
           subtitle reads:

                        “STEVENSON JUNCTION, ALABAMA 
                        44 MILES WEST OF CHATTANOOGA”

           Captain Arbuckle reports to General Mitchel, who walks the 
           line of prisoners.

                                 CAPTAIN ARBUCKLE
                        I’ve fifty men in place to stay 
                        behind and hold the junction. We 
                        really gonna roll on Chattanooga?

           Mitchel’s still not sure. The picket guard from before ushers 
           up a MESSENGER.

                                 PICKET GUARD
                        General Mitchel?

                                 MITCHEL
                        Yes?

                                 PICKET GUARD
                        This man here says he’s from 
                        Marietta.
                                 MESSENGER
                        Henry Green Cole sent me.

           The messenger hands over a sealed letter.

                                 MITCHEL
                        Am I supposed to have heard of this 
                        Mr. Cole?

                                 MESSENGER
                        He’s a sympathizer. And an 
                        associate of a man you know. James 
                        Andrews.

           Mitchel and Arbuckle swap disturbed looks. Mitchel opens the 
           letter and reads it. His demeanor blackens. He whips out a 
           pistol and presses it between the messenger’s eyes.

                                 MITCHEL
                        You have thirty seconds to convince 
                        me this isn’t a confederate ploy.

                                 MESSENGER
                        I... I... I...

           The messenger faints at his feet. Mitchel turns to the 
           picket.

                                 MITCHEL
                        Get him out of here. String him up 
                        for interrogation.

           The picket drags the messenger away. Mitchel looks to 
           Arbuckle.

                                 ARBUCKLE
                        What’s it say?

                                 MITCHEL
                        Whoever this Cole character is, he 
                        knows our every move. He claims 
                        Andrews has been working for the 
                        Confederates all along. Says the 
                        man had no intention of carrying 
                        out his mission. Simply put, 
                        Chattanooga was meant to be an 
                        ambush.

                                 ARBUCKLE
                        And what if this note is the 
                        ambush?

           Mitchel has a big decision to make.
           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - MOVING

           The raiders plunge ahead at frightful speed, Pittinger 
           tossing wood from their dwindling supply to Andrews and 
           Buffum, who feed the firebox. They streak across yet another 
           bridge without torching it.

                                 PITTINGER
                        We can’t keep running up the line 
                        leaving bridges behind. If 
                        Mitchel’s gonna keep his end of the 
                        bargain, we need to keep ours.

                                 ANDREWS
                        We will. I promise.

           Andrews glances back at the Texas, still on their ass, now 
           pushing both of their dropped boxcars.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Only right now we need all the 
                        distance we can get for the next 
                        station at Dalton.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Why, what the fuck happens at 
                        Dalton?

           EXT. DALTON - DAY

           The largest town on the line north of Marietta. The General 
           barrels toward the red-brick depot at the center of town. A 
           subtitle appears:

                        “DALTON, GEORGIA 
                        38 MILES TO CHATTANOOGA”

           INT. TEXAS - MOVING

           Fuller’s falling behind, but still in hot pursuit.

                                 FULLER
                        Okay, this is the last telegraph 
                        office on the line. They’ll wanna 
                        clear the station before they stop 
                        to cut the wires.

           He hands Forrest a message meant for “COL. DANVILLE 
           LEADBETTER”
                                 FORREST
                        Give us just enough time to beat 
                        these bastards to the punch.

           INT. PAVILION - DALTON STATION - DAY

           Passengers crowd the ornate, covered platform, including a 
           MOTHER and her YOUNG BOY. The General fast approaches, steam 
           whistle screaming, showing no signs of slowing down.

           Nervous passengers begin to backpedal from the edge of the 
           platform. The mother pulls the boy close and holds him tight. 

           They all scatter in terror as the train blisters past in a 
           woosh of cinders and smoke...

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - MOVING

           Andrews looks back, relishing the havoc. He turns to Buffum 
           and Pittinger.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Alright. Soon as we get to the 
                        switch...

           EXT. SWITCH - JUST NORTH OF DALTON STATION - DAY

           The General squeals to a halt just before a fork in the line, 
           about a 300 yards from the station. All three raiders 
           dismount: Buffum running to check the switch ahead, Andrews 
           running to the telegraph line alongside the track and 
           Pittinger covering them both with a pair of rifles.

           INT. TEXAS - MOVING

           Unlike the General, Fuller’s train brakes as it approaches 
           the pavilion...

           EXT. SWITCH - JUST NORTH OF DALTON STATION - DAY

           Boots strapped into a spiked climbing wedge, Andrews quickly 
           scales the telegraph pole.

           INT. PAVILION - DALTON STATION - DAY

           The Texas pulls up, slowing just long enough for one of 
           Forrest’s CAVALRYMAN to jump off. He dashes along the 
           platform and into...
           INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE - DAY

           The cavalryman bursts in, causing a young TELEGRAPH OPERATOR 
           to spill coffee on himself.

                                 DALTON TELEGRAPH OPERATOR
                        What the heck?

           EXT. SWITCH - JUST NORTH OF DALTON STATION - DAY

           A surly RAILROAD MAN stalks up to Buffum as he returns to the 
           engine.

                                 DALTON RAILROAD MAN
                        Hey, you maniac! You can’t come 
                        barreling through like--

           Pittinger pops off a warning shot. The railroad man turns 
           tail and runs.

           Andrews, now atop the telegraph pole in reach of the wire, 
           pulls a knife from his boot. RIFLESHOTS splinters the pole 
           inches away from his face and he DROPS THE KNIFE. 

           The shots come from the Texas, rushing up the track from the 
           pavilion...

           INT. TEXAS - MOVING

           Forrest and his cavalrymen open fire. Fuller shouts to Murphy 
           at the throttle.

                                 FULLER
                        Give her all you got, Mr. Murphy!

           EXT. SWITCH - JUST NORTH OF DALTON STATION - DAY

           Pittinger blasts back at the Texas, now 200 yards and 
           closing. Buffum tosses the knife back up to Andrews, bullets 
           whizzing by...

           INT. DALTON TELEGRAPH OFFICE - DAY

           The operator taps out the message. Following the signal 
           bursts, the CAMERA SWOOPS up the telegraph wire to the 
           ceiling, past the ceiling, and to...

           THE TELEGRAPH LINES OUTSIDE

           ...where we travel with the message up the wire, swooping 
           from pole to pole to pole until we reach...

           EXT. SWITCH - JUST NORTH OF DALTON STATION - DAY

           Just as Andrews is cutting the wire with the knife. HE’S TOO 
           LATE! We shoot past with the signal and continue our burst 
           toward Chattanooga, looking back at Andrews and the cut line 
           as we go...

           INT. TEXAS - MOVING

           Fuller and Forrest exchange an excited, uncertain look. They 
           have no way of knowing that the raiders’ fate has just been 
           sealed. 50 yards ahead, the General begins to roll...

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - MOVING

           Andrews and Pittinger dive aboard under a maelstrom of 
           gunfire. Buffum cranks the throttle. 

                                 PITTINGER
                        We good?

           Andrews smiles.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Next stop Chatta-fuckin’-nooga.

           INT. LEADBETTER’S HEADQUARTERS OFFICE - NIGHT

           A SIGNAL PRIVATE arrives with a telegraph.
                                 SIGNAL PRIVATE
                        An urgent wire, Colonel. It’s from 
                        Dalton.

           Leadbetter snatches the message. As he reads his nostrils 
           flare.

           EXT. CONFEDERATE ENCAMPMENT - CHATTANOOGA - DAY

           Wood, miserable, labors alongside others in his regiment 
           digging a trench. Lieutenant Vickers gallops over.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS
                        Throw down your shovels, boys. We 
                        got ourselves a turkey shoot to 
                        attend.

                                 DIGGING REBEL
                        What is it? General Mitchel?

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS
                        Even better. Yankee fuckin’ spies.

           Wood’s heart leaps in his chest.

           EXT. COACH ROAD - DAY

           Miriam is impatient to get back on the road. The coachman, 
           slavehunter, Parrott and Wollam sweat like hogs as they try 
           to lift the wagon from the rut. It’s no use.

                                 MIRIAM
                             (re: the slave cages)
                        What about having those men help?

                                 SLAVEHUNTER
                        Men? Shit, these here are runaways.

           He slaps at one of the cages.

                                 MIRIAM
                        They still have shoulders don’t 
                        they?

                                 SLAVEHUNTER
                        Feet too. We open them cages 
                        nigs’ll just abscond again. Took me 
                        and my sweet daughter here two days 
                        to hunt ‘em down the first go.

           Parrott can’t keep his eyes off the slaves’ bloody feet.
                                 COACHMAN
                             (pointing)
                        Hey, who’s that comin’ up the road?

           Kicking up dust, men on horses charge toward them. Parrot and 
           Wollam shoot panicked looks.

                                 SLAVEHUNTER’S DAUGHTER
                        Looks like a posse.

           The two raiders dash off into the woods. Everyone looks to 
           Miriam, who throws up her hands in faux-dismay.

           The sheriff and his deputies ride up, the hotel clerk among 
           them. The slavehunter’s dogs bark wildly.

           INT. GENERAL - MOVING

           Andrews and Pittinger cannibalize the last remaining boxcar, 
           ripping off planks and heaving the wood into the firebox. 
           It’s the only fuel they have left.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Can’t this fucker go any faster?

                                 BUFFUM
                        Sure, fast as you tear up that 
                        Goddamn boxcar.

           They chug up TUNNEL HILL, a ridge with a horseshoe shaped 
           tunnel ahead, the Texas falling further and further behind.

                                 PITTINGER
                        What about blowing the tunnel?

                                 ANDREWS
                        We need the explosive for what’s on 
                        the other side. Biggest fuckin’ 
                        bridge on the line.

           He points to a route map and “THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE”

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        We take that out, mission 
                        accomplished.

           They barrel into the tunnel...

           INT. THE TEXAS - MOVING

           Fuller sees them vanish into the tunnel.
                                 FORREST
                        We’re losing ‘em.

                                 FULLER
                        Their rig’s lighter. Pullin’ one 
                        boxcar to our two. But see the 
                        white smoke...

           Fuller points to the WHITE SMOKE wafting around the mouth of 
           the tunnel.

                                 FULLER (CONT’D)
                        If their fire was hot goin’ through 
                        the tunnel that smoke would be 
                        black.

           Forrest gets it.

                                 FULLER (CONT’D)
                        They’re running out of fuel.

           INT. WOODS - DAY

           The sheriff's posse and the slavehunter race through the 
           woods shooting pistols, the dogs leading the way...

           Parrott and Wollam stumble through the brush in their socks, 
           their pursuers gaining with every step.

           INT. COACH ROAD - DAY

           Miriam looks off into woods, which echo with the savage bark 
           of the dogs. The coachman maneuvers Miriam’s coach around the 
           slavehunter’s stuck wagon.

                                 COACHMAN 
                        Shall we, Miss? No need to stay for 
                        the lynching.

           Miriam looks to the slavehunter’s daughter, who slaps at the 
           slave’s cages like her father.

                                 SLAVEHUNTER’S DAUGHTER
                        Quit yer whinin’, nigger.

           EXT. THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           A scary-as-shit railroad trestle, spanning a huge gorge 
           between two sheer ridges, white rapids raging 200 feet below. 
           It looks built with matchsticks.
           On the span’s north side Leadbetter and his army spill from a 
           troop train and dig in for ambush. Vickers and some men rip 
           up the tracks leading off the trestle. Young Wood, the 
           shanghaied raider, helps haul cannons into position. A 
           subtile reads:

                        “THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE
                        4 MILES TO CHATTANOOGA”

           INT. GENERAL - MOVING

           Andrews and Pittinger have all but picked the boxcar clean. 
           All that’s left are explosives. They look back with a modicum 
           of relief that the Texas is no longer visible behind them.

                                 PITTINGER
                        We’re almost out of shit to burn.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Don’t worry. We’re about to make 
                        some kindling.

           The TRESTLE comes into view. The sight is breathtaking.

           EXT. THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Leadbetter sees the General approach. His men hunker into 
           position.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Here they are, gentlemen. Hold your 
                        fire ‘til they reach the gap in the 
                        tracks. If we can I wanna take the 
                        engine intact and the thieves alive 
                        and kickin’.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS
                        Alive, sir?

                                 LEADBETTER
                        So I can personally gut these sons 
                        ‘a whores.

           INT. GENERAL - MOVING

           They race out across the trestle, Andrews and Pittinger awed 
           by the abyss of the gorge. Only Buffum is looking ahead, 
           squinting at what looks to be a...

           BREECH IN THE TRACKS
           Buffum slams the breaks. Everything squeals and shutters to a 
           stop. All three raiders are flung forward, Andrews almost off 
           the side, caught in just in time by Pittinger.

                                 ANDREWS
                        What the fuck, Buffum!

           Buffum points to the span’s north side. Andrews eyes go wide. 

                                 BUFFUM
                        There’s a breech. It’s a fuckin’ 
                        ambush!

           Indeed it is. 200 CONFEDERATES, dug in the woods with rifles 
           and cannons. Leadbetter’s army.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Right. Get us back. Off this 
                        Goddamn trestle. Fuckers try to 
                        cross and we’ll blow ‘em to baby 
                        Jesus.

           Buffum tugs the lever and they begin to creep in reverse.

           EXT. THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Leadbetter strides up to the breech in the tracks.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS
                        Should we fire? They’re gettin’ 
                        away.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        They’re not going anywhere.

           He spots the Texas, racing down the slope.

           INT. TEXAS - MOVING

           Fuller approaches the trestle, the General backing toward 
           them.

                                 FORREST
                        You did it. We have ‘em.

           Fuller looks guarded. He’s had them before.

           INT. GENERAL - MOVING

           Andrews can only laugh. Pittinger is incredulous.
                                 PITTINGER
                        I should have let you fuckin’ shoot 
                        him.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Yes, you fuckin’ should.

           The Texas crawls to a stop on the south side of the span, 
           blocking any escape. Buffum lays on the lever.

                                 BUFFUM
                        I’m gonna ram the cocksuckers!

           Andrews pulls his hand away.

                                 ANDREWS
                        You do and we’ll derail into the 
                        motherfuckin’ abyss. I didn’t come 
                        all this way to die in a train 
                        accident.

           EXT. THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           They stop about two thirds of the way across the rickety 
           span, suspended 200 feet above the gorge, stuck between the 
           hounds and the hunters. It’s a sight to see.

           Leadbetter slowly walks out onto the trestle, victory at 
           hand.

           INT. GENERAL - DAY

           The raiders look to Andrews for their next move. The direness 
           of their situation begins to sink in. Andrews sees:

                                 ANDREWS
                        Shit. Leadbetter.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Ain’t he supposed to be gettin’ 
                        spanked by Mitchel’s army right 
                        about now?

                                 ANDREWS
                        That was the plan.
                             (to Pittinger)
                        Unless there was another one I 
                        don’t know about?

                                 PITTINGER
                        We stepped up. So will he.
           Andrews wants to believe this. 

                                 ANDREWS
                        You better be fucking right.

           He steps off onto the trestle.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Where you goin’?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Where do you think? Let this 
                        cocksucker know who he’s 
                        surrendering to.

           EXT. THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Andrews and Leadbetter meet half-way. It takes a moment for 
           Leadbetter to register the man who only the week before was 
           at his dinner table.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        You?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Afternoon Colonel. Fancy meeting 
                        you here.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Am I to understand you’re the man 
                        behind this... act.

                                 ANDREWS
                        One of ‘em. Shouldn’t you be back 
                        in Chattanooga? Or did General 
                        Mitchel already drive your ass out.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Mitchel? Mitchel’s army stopped 
                        short at Stevenson.

           Andrews can’t conceal the blow. Their last chance. Gone.

                                 LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
                        Is that what this is all about? 
                        Taking my city?

                                 ANDREWS
                        That’s right, and on behalf of the 
                        Union Army, me and my...
                             (re: Buffum and Pittinger)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANDREWS (CONT'D)
                        ...my forces, demand that you and 
                        your men surrender your weapons and 
                        give up Chattanooga immediately.

           Leadbetter laughs.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        I like you Andrews. I’m going to 
                        like seeing you thrown off this 
                        bridge.

           He turns to walk away.

                                 ANDREWS
                             (calling after)
                        You know you got more riding on 
                        that train than just a few Union 
                        spies.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Do I now? And what’s that?

                                 ANDREWS
                        For starters, your fortune.

           Andrews flips him a coin.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Recognize the marking? We got six 
                        saddlebags of the stuff from a bank 
                        in Marietta. Pretty sure there’s 
                        nothing left. I heard about it from 
                        your wife. After fucking her on 
                        your desk while you were out 
                        dousing a fire I paid some opium 
                        fiend to start. When you get back 
                        to Marietta you might not find her 
                        there either, most likely cuz she’s 
                        on her way to meet me up in New 
                        York. We like each other. Cut from 
                        the same cloth I think. We might 
                        even cut some kids from that cloth, 
                        name ‘em all Lincoln. The boys and 
                        the girls. How does that sound, 
                        cocksucker?

                                 LEADBETTER
                        You’re never getting off this 
                        bridge.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Then neither is your gold.

           He spits into the rapids below.
                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Unless we strike a deal.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Like what?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Like I hand you the train and the 
                        loot, you get us horses and let us 
                        go on our way.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        I do that in front of all these 
                        men, all the gold in the world 
                        won’t save me from getting strung 
                        up for treason.

                                 ANDREWS
                        That would be a shame, but it’s a 
                        risk I’m willing to take.

           Leadbetter is not amused.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        How about this: I let you go. You 
                        deliver me what’s mine and your two 
                        boys there, and you can walk away. 
                        Given your reputation to play all 
                        sides I’ll say you were the one who 
                        tipped me off. I’ll even promise 
                        not to slice up my wife next time I 
                        see her.

           It’s Andrews turn not knowing what to say.

                                 LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
                        This should be easy for you. You’ve 
                        just been sold out by Mitchel, why 
                        not do the same. We both know James 
                        Andrews has no allegiance to anyone 
                        but himself.

           Andrews glances back at Pittinger and Buffum, the two men 
           bloodied and exhausted, heros both. He grapples with what to 
           do, looking at once genuinely pained and cynically torn, at 
           war with himself. Everything is on the line...

           EXT. COACH ROAD - DAY

           The barking dogs are now distant. The coachman holds the 
           coach for Miriam, who’s mesmerized with disgust by the 
           slavehunter’s daughter.
                                 SLAVEHUNTER’S DAUGHTER
                        I see you judgin’ me. All ya bells 
                        of the ball. You keep yer hands so 
                        pink and clean. House niggers all 
                        dressed up and pretty like dolls to 
                        tie your corsets. But who do you 
                        think breaks ‘em for ya?

           She gets in Miriam’s face.

                                 SLAVEHUNTER’S DAUGHTER (CONT’D)
                        You think yer better than me but 
                        you ain’t.

           Miriam locks eyes with one of the slaves in the cage: a woman 
           the same age as herself. It’s the first time she’s really 
           ever looked at one of them. 

           A RIFLE SHOT rings out from...

           INT. WOODS - DAY

           Wollam falls, shot in the back. Parrott tries to drag him to 
           his feet but it’s no use...

                                 WOLLAM
                        I’m done. Go!

           Parrott dashes off, leaving Wollam bleeding against a stump. 
           He listens to the dogs get closer and closer until they 
           spring through the weeds and maul him apart.

           INT. GENERAL - DAY

           Andrews steps back aboard swimming in his own head. Pittinger 
           and Buffum look to him eagerly.

                                 PITTINGER
                        What he say? What’s our next move?

           Andrews needs time to think. He sees Fuller stepping out in 
           front of the Texas.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Gimmie a second.

           He grabs FULLER’S GIFT on the dash.

           EXT. FULLER’S POSITION  - THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - CONTINUOUS

           Andrews crosses over to Fuller.
                                 ANDREWS
                        I think that’s yours.

           He hands over the gift. Fuller says nothing, wary.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Birthday present from your wife?

                                 FULLER
                        Yes.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Happy fuckin’ birthday.

           Andrews grins like a snake-charmer. Fuller stays stone-faced, 
           not willing to cede Andrews an inch.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        I’ll bet you’re a pretty good man 
                        to know in personal life. When this 
                        shit is over we should get a drink.

                                 FULLER
                        I don’t think so.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I’ll buy.

           He flashes a gold coin. Fuller doesn’t flinch.

                                 FULLER
                        How much you get paid to start this 
                        little bloodbath? Cuz I’ll bet it 
                        was a hellva lot more than those 
                        poor saps.

           Fuller nods to Buffum and Pittinger.

                                 ANDREWS
                        You’d like those men if you knew 
                        ‘em. They’re like you.

                                 FULLER
                        How’s that?

                                 ANDREWS
                        They got grit. And they’re loyal.

           Fuller is disarmed. Andrews offers his hand. It’s an offer of 
           respect between worthy rivals. Fuller takes it.
                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        I’m afraid I’m not gonna be able to 
                        return your engine in exactly the 
                        shape it was took.

                                 FULLER
                        I’d wish you luck, but I’m glad 
                        it’s run out.

           With that, Andrews walks back to the General.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Parrott stumbles along, gasping and out of juice, the dogs 
           and men still on his trail. His only option is to quit or...

           He looks up to a treetop and starts to climb.

           INT. GENERAL - DAY

           Andrews climbs into the cab for the last time.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Help me with those saddle bags.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Tell us you just bribed ‘em?

           He glances back at Fuller, admiring.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Not that man.

                                 PITTINGER
                        Then what?

           Andrews smiles like a rogue. Saddle bag in hand he steps to 
           the edge and...

           Tosses the gold into the gorge.

           EXT. THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - CONTINUOUS

           Leadbetter watches with shock and dismay as coins go 
           showering into the rapids below, where the bag finally 
           splashes down and vanishes under the current.
           INT. GENERAL - CONTINUOUS

           Pittinger and Buffum each turn to Andrews, mouths agape. The 
           three men share a loaded look. They know exactly what this 
           means. Thus resigned they start throwing over the rest of the 
           saddle bags, Leadbetter’s entire fortune...

           EXT. THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - CONTINUOUS

           Leadbetter let’s out a rancorous, guttural howl.

           EXT. GENERAL - CONTINUOUS

           The deed done, Andrews pulls out the cigar he got from 
           Mitchel and looks to his raiders.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Well boys, care to share a last 
                        cigar?

           Damn right.

           EXT. FULLER’S POSITION - THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Forrest steps beside Fuller.

                                 FORREST
                        Are they--

                                 FULLER
                        Yes, I believe they’re smoking a 
                        cigar.

           FULLER’S POV: The raiders have split the cigar in thirds and 
           light up like men in victory.

                                 FORREST
                        But they’ve lost?

           Fuller smiles. He’s not so sure.

           EXT. LEADBETTER’S POSITION - THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Leadbetter charges back to his side of the gorge.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Prepare to blow ‘em back to hell, 
                        gentlemen. Or at least New fuckin’ 
                        York.
           WOOD sits behind a cannon. He looks over the 200 guns waiting 
           for his friends, sick about the slaughter to come.

           EXT. COACH ROAD - DAY

           Miriam looks from the slave woman back to the slavehunter’s 
           daughter, still sneering in her face. She notices something 
           in the air, a sound, or lack of one...

                                 MIRIAM
                        You hear? No dogs?

           Barking can no longer be heard.

                                 SLAVEHUNTER’S DAUGHTER
                        They musta caught the bastards.

           Something finally clicks in Miriam. She turns and steps over 
           to the coach, perhaps as if to leave. Instead she snatches 
           the coachman’s shotgun, pivots, and BLOWS A HOLE in the 
           daughter’s chest.

                                 COACHMAN
                             (aghast)
                        What are you doing?

           Miriam fishes keys from the corpse’s pockets, her smoking 
           shotgun trained on the coachman.

                                 MIRIAM
                        What the fuck do you think?

           She goes to unlock the cages.

           INT. GENERAL - DAY

           Andrews, Pittinger and Buffum throw every last scrap of wood, 
           cloth, you name it in the firebox to get it stoked for their 
           final run. Even the last of their cigars.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Well boys, looks like we’re down to 
                        all hell...

                                 BUFFUM
                        You know I was really fuckin’ 
                        hopin’ this would be the one train 
                        I wouldn’t have to blow up.

           He nods to the bricks of dynamite stacked three deep against 
           the boiler. They all smile slyly.
           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           The sheriff’s posse surrounds the base of a tree, dogs 
           snapping their bloody snouts at Parrott trapped on a branch 
           above. The sheriff throws up a rope with a noose.

                                 SHERIFF
                        Up to you, my friend. The dogs or 
                        the rope.

           Parrott stares at the noose in his hand.

           INT. GENERAL - DAY

           The boiler pressure gauge red-lines off the charts. Buffum 
           nods to Pittinger who nods to Andrews who nods back to 
           Buffum. This is it. Buffum cranks the throttle, launching 
           them with a full head of steam. Andrews and Pittinger hold on 
           for dear life...

           EXT. FULLER’S POSITION - THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Fuller watches them go. Forrest can sense his admiration.

                                 FULLER
                        I don’t know. Guess ‘til today it 
                        was our side took all the risks. 
                        One rebel for every ten yanks. But 
                        no more. And that was our only

           Sabre raised over his head, Leadbetter watches the General 
           snarl toward them.

                                 LEADBETTER
                             (dropping the sabre)
                        FIRE!

           Rifles blast and cannon’s boom.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Parrott leaps from the tree and lynches himself.
           INT. GENERAL - MOVING

           Barrelling through a shitstorm of enemy fire. The raiders 
           brace themselves as they reach the breech in the tracks 
           and...

           EXT. LEADBETTER’S POSITION - THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           THE GENERAL DERAILS! It careens headlong into the woods along 
           the ridge of the gorge, splintering trees and singing brush. 
           Finally the wreckage digs to a stop.

           LEADBETTER relishes his triumph. His men stop their shooting 
           and wait for the smoke to clear...

           EXT. FULLER’S POSITION - THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Fuller watches from across the gorge. Looking to the gift in 
           his hand, he notices a tiny rip in the wrapping.

           EXT. LEADBETTER’S POSITION - THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           ANDREWS, cut up but alive, belly-crawls among the wreckage 
           looking for his friends.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Buffum!

           He finds BUFFUM pinned beneath the boiler, his legs crushed.

           PITTINGER, thrown from the train, staggers to his feet. 
           Lieutenant Vickers spots him through the clearing smoke...

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS
                        There!

           CONFEDERATES blast away. 

           Pittinger scrambles for cover, diving behind the boiler with 
           the others. He sees Buffum.

                                 PITTINGER
                        Shit. How is he?

                                 BUFFUM
                             (agonized)
                        I sure as shit could use a drink.

           LEADBETTER stalks up to a line of cannons, Wood among the 
           artillerymen. He points over to the toppled engine.
                                 LEADBETTER
                        You men! Rotate these cannons.

           The artillerymen scramble to turn their cannons on the 
           raiders.

           ANDREWS grabs Pittinger, points through the blazing woods...

                                 ANDREWS
                        Listen, you can get outta here. 
                        Just keep along the ridge. We’ll 
                        keep these cocksuckers occupied.

                                 PITTINGER
                        What about you?

           THE LINE OF CANNONS are aimed for the kill. WOOD can stomach 
           it no more. He jabs the rebel in front of him with his 
           bayonet...

           Andrews looks to Buffum, who’s fading fast.

                                 ANDREWS
                        We still got a mission to finish. 
                        And it’ll all be for shit if no one 
                        knows what these men did here 
                        today.

           Pittinger gets it. Someone has to tell their story.

           WOOD swivels his cannon ON HIS OWN RANKS!

           LEADBETTER raises his sabre, the artillery prepared to 
           fire...

           BOOM! Wood’s canoon blasts point blank down the line of 
           artillerymen, wasting everyone and wiping out their cannons.

           ANDREWS sees the mayhem and mass confusion among the 
           Confederate ranks.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                             (to Pittinger)
                        This your chance. Go go go!

           Pittinger races off into the woods sight unseen. Andrews 
           looks back just in time to recognize...

           WOOD, surrounded by an angry mob of graybacks lead by 
           Vickers.

           The boy gives Andrews a proud Yankee salute before getting 
           impaled by dozens of bayonets.
           BUFFUM begs to Andrews. 

                                 BUFFUM
                             (rasping)
                        The damper. Gotta close the damper.

           Andrews whacks a lever and the boiler pressure spikes.

           LEADBETTER turns his attention back to the overturned 
           General, and the raiders dug in behind it.

           EXT. COACH ROAD - DAY

           The slavehunter and sheriff’s posse return to the wagon on 
           fire, his daughter and the posse’s horses shot dead, and the 
           coachman gag-tied and stripped of his uniform.

                                 SHERIFF
                        Is it me, or is the whole world 
                        goin’ crazy?

           Miriam’s coach is gone.

           EXT. LEADBETTER’S POSITION - THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Leadbetter and his men advance upon the overturned engine, 
           guns raised.

           EXT. FULLER’S POSITION - THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           FULLER opens his birthday gift. Inside the box is empty.

           EXT. LEADBETTER’S POSITION - THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           ANDREWS admires his new TIMEPIECE, “With Love” engraved on 
           the back. He looks to Buffum, defiant down to his last gasps.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Patriots, huh?

           The boiler pressure gauge is now so hot it’s cracked.

           LEADBETTER and his men are just steps away.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Andrews? You still breathin’, you 
                        fuck.

           ANDREWS lights the dynamite all around them.
                                 ANDREWS
                        You ready to surrender, cocksucker?

           LEADBETTER turns the corner with fifty men, guns raised. 
           Andrews and Buffum grin like schoolboys. We see the 
           overheating boiler, the bricks of explosive, the crackling 
           fuses...

           KER-POW!

           The General EXPLODES SPECTACULARLY, taking with it a good 
           chunk of the ridge supporting the trestle.

           EXT. FULLER’S POSITION - THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Fuller watches everything, feels the trestle quake under his 
           feet.

                                 FULLER
                        Off the bridge! Off the bridge!

           They get the fuck off the bridge.

           INT. WOODS - THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Pittinger, fleeing along the ridge, stops for a moment to 
           witness the ENTIRE TRESTLE COLLAPSE into the gorge, the Texas 
           plummeting with it.

           EXT. FULLER’S POSITION - THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Fuller, Forrest and the others make it to safety. Forrest 
           spots Pittinger across the gorge, raises his rifle, aims... 

           Fuller pushes it down.

                                 FULLER
                        Enough killing for today.

           INT. WOODS - THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Pittinger runs off into the woods, his voice over rising up:

                                 PITTINGER (V.O.)
                        For their actions the Andrews’ 
                        Raiders became the first men in 
                        American history to be awarded the 
                        Medal of Honor--the nation’s 
                        highest decoration for gallantry
           INT. MIRIAM’S COACH - MOVING

           They race north, one of the runaways disguised as a coachman. 
           Miriam sits across from two women from the cages, shotgun 
           over her lap. They exchange grateful but unsettled looks, not 
           at all sure what just happened, or what comes next...

                                 PITTINGER (V.O.)
                        Because he was a civilian, James 
                        Andrews was not among the 
                        recipients.

           It’s a moment of catharsis and ambiguity, not unlike the end 
           of the Civil War itself, although for Miriam one thing is 
           certain: New York. The thought of Andrews cues a sly, half 
           smile.

                                 PITTINGER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        No doubt he would have preferred 
                        gold.

                                                           CUT TO BLACK
