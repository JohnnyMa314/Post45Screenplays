           NIGHT SKY

           The winter stars, impossibly big and bright, fill the 
           sky.  We gaze on these ancient beacons of hope and 
           inspiration; the same stars that stood witness to the 
           birth of kings, inspired poets, gave hope to the 
           hopeless.  Then we trace a silver string of starlight 
           down through the too-huge universe, to where this 
           inspirational, ancient and magical light comes to rest 
           on...

           Beer cans.  Milwaukee’s Best, to be specific.    

           The beer cans are frozen in a kiddie pool.  Next to a 
           broken trampoline.  In a yard with a rusted pick-up 
           truck. Surrounded by many other yards decorated in much 
           the same manner and all of it covered in a layer of snow.

           Welcome to winter in SPOKANE, WASHINGTON - a city 
           comprised of churches and strip bars equally - who’s 
           chief export seems to be its endless supply of footage 
           for the Cops TV series.

           SOMEWHERE IN THE DISTANCE

           A bottle rocket traces a green path across the star-
           filled sky and then--

           POP!  It explodes in a shower of green sparks.  A chorus 
           of barking dogs calls out--

           INT. BEVERLY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The muffled sound of dogs barking outside--

           In the dark, a massive tangle of hair rises from the 
           pillow.  The light flicks on.  Beside the lamp a little 
           framed PICTURE OF A YOUNG COUPLE, we don’t get a good 
           look at it yet-- 

           By the light of the lamp we can see the girl beneath the 
           bed-head. BEVERLY MOODY (13), chubby, caught fully in 
           those “awkward years”. She reaches up and tries her best 
           to regain some control over the mess she calls hair.    

           OUT THE FROSTED-OVER WINDOW

           All we can see is the blurred glow of light spreading and 
           then getting dimmer like some kind of mysterious magic as 
           another bottle rocket explodes. Beverly climbs out of 
           bed.  Opens her window and sticks her head out.

           BEVERLY’S POV:
           From some far house, a red streak races up to the stars 
           and POP! Explodes in a beautiful bloom of sparks 
           reflected in the snow below so that the ground looks like 
           a million red jewels dancing in the cruddy backyards.

           INSIDE

           Beverly pulls a chair to the window and watches another 
           burst of color shower the dark houses below.  Another 
           chorus of dogs howl in the distance in some kind of 
           mysterious dog applause...

           MORNING

           And Beverly’s passed out in the same spot, head resting 
           on the frame of the open window.  

           A KNOCK at the door--

           Beverly jolts awake - CRACKS her head against the window--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Crap!

           INT. KITCHEN TABLE - MORNING

           Beverly sits at the table, a perfect breakfast in front 
           of her - eggs, bacon, pancakes, orange juice - the works.  
           Standing over her is Beverly’s grandmother, GAIL MOODY 
           (55-65).  She dabs at Beverly’s head with rag while 
           Beverly speaks with that pre-teen girl intensity:

                                 BEVERLY
                        It was probably like the coolest thing I 
                        ever saw.  Why doesn’t everyone let off 
                        fireworks in the snow? We should move the 
                        fourth of July to winter and then we 
                        could always have fireworks in the snow.  

           Gail, while still pretty, has the look of a woman whose 
           age is just beginning to catch up with her; not so much 
           in wrinkles and gray hairs, but in mannerisms and style 
           (or lack thereof).  None of which is helped by her ill-
           fitting postal workers uniform that gives her a definite 
           “warden” vibe.    

                                 GAIL
                        Eat.
           Gail washes off the rag in the sink.  Beverly shoves some 
           pancake in her mouth and stares at her bacon thoughtfully-
           -

                                 BEVERLY
                        Do you think you could feed a pig bacon?   

           Gail puts the rest of Beverly’s breakfast in one big roll 
           of tin-foil.  

                                 GAIL
                        I think you’re going to be late for 
                        school.  

           EXT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - MORNING

           The world’s become a great gray-brown layer of snow 
           slushy.  Gail and Beverly move through it quickly - 
           shivering beneath their bundles of hats, sweaters, coats 
           and scarfs.  

           Gail’s Postal Service van waits for them.  Gail jumps in 
           quickly and starts the engine.  Beverly pauses before 
           getting in, taking a dramatic drag from an imaginary 
           cigarette like some awkward, chubby Audrey Hepburn and 
           letting go of a puff of frosted breath.

           At the same time she catches sight of--

           DOWN THE STREET

           A Fussy ASIAN MOTHER shuffling her kids into a gigantic 
           SUV.  An ASIAN girl, Beverly’s age, puts her hand up in a 
           kind of apathetic hello before being yelled at and 
           shuffled inside the car.  

                                 GAIL
                        Move it, Beverly!

                                 BEVERLY
                                 (under her breath)
                        Okay.  Geeze.

           Beverly tosses her imaginary cigarette and hops in the 
           postal van.

           INT. POSTAL VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Some monotone political radio show buzzes while Gail 
           offers a grunt of approval - or, more likely, a snicker 
           of derision.  
           We scan the back of the van for Beverly and, at first, we 
           don’t even notice she’s there.  She’s just another 
           overstuffed bag of hopes and dreams sitting immobile in 
           the back-seat.  The van goes over the bump and she’s 
           jostled around like all the other bags of letters and 
           mail around her.

           She looks to a bag on her left and sees something 
           interesting.  A piece of air mail with the distinctive 
           red and blue border around it - the return address is 
           somewhere in France.   

           One eye on Gail, Beverly stealthily pulls the letter out 
           and slips it into her jacket.  

                                 GAIL
                                 (re: the radio)
                        Cripes!  This is what I pay taxes for?!

           EXT. JAMES K. POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - MORNING

           A sign in front that reads “James K. Polk Junior High” 
           accompanied by a less than flattering caricature of the 
           man himself with a full lion’s mane of a mullet.  Around 
           the sign are swarms of cold-looking kids - coming and 
           going and moving in every direction.  It’s a well-
           rehearsed school morning chaos.

           Gail rolls up the back door of the postal van revealing a 
           less than thrilled Beverly.

                                 GAIL
                        Special delivery!

           Beverly crawls out - looking like a condemned prisoner.  
           This is not a kid that likes school.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Bye.

           Beverly watches Gail’s van disappear into the maze of 
           school traffic and then, like a brave little prisoner, 
           heads toward the entrance. 

                                 MEAN KID (O.S.)
                        Hey blubberly!

           Beverly turns - WHAM!  A snow ball explodes against the 
           side of her face.  Beverly doesn’t even flinch - this 
           obviously isn’t the first time she’s caught a snowball 
           with her face.  
                                 MEAN KID
                        Special delivery!

           A group of kids LAUGHS.  Beverly keeps walking - head 
           down and fast, like the weakest prisoner in the prison 
           yard, which, in a way she is...

           INT. JAMES K. POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAYS

           That odd mix of kids that only exists in the Northwest: 
           REDNECKS with confederate flag shirts, PUNKS with combat 
           boots, PREPPIES with messenger bags and HIPPIES with 
           flower dresses.

           Beverly, still keeping her head down, moves through the 
           crowds managing to not-quite-fit-in with any group.  

           ABOVE THE MAIN ENTRANCE

           A banner with a WILDCAT on one side and an OWL on the 
           other and in between: 

           Vote for the School Mascot March 15th.  You decide!!

           A rather unfortunate looking GIRL hands out Owl buttons.  
           She hands one to Beverly--

                                 GIRL
                        Vote Owl for mascot!

           BEVERLY’S LOCKER

           Beverly opens her locker right as--

           STEVEN, a-hole of the Junior High, rolls up in his 
           wheelchair.  At his side is the vice-president of a-
           holery DONNY, a kid that got an early start on acne.  
           Both wear “Wildcat for Mascot” buttons.  

                                 STEVEN
                        She has an owl button.

                                 DONNY
                        It’s not surprising.  The owl button is a 
                        magnet for losers.  They can’t resist its 
                        pull.

           Beverly tries her best to ignore them.

                                 STEVEN
                        Do you smell that?  
                                 DONNY
                        Ugh, gawd, yeah.  What is it?

           They both look around dramatically - then look at 
           Beverly.

                                 STEVEN
                                 (to Beverly)
                        Do you by chance use Pert Plus?

           Meekly--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yeah...

                                 STEVEN
                        That’s what it is.  Jesus, it’s 
                        disgusting.  It smells like choad.

                                 DONNY
                        -- and poor people.

                                 STEVEN
                        Poor people’s choad.

                                 STEVEN
                        Let’s get the f.o.h. before I puke.

           A disgusted look on his face, Donny pushes Steven’s 
           wheelchair away.  When they’re far enough away Beverly 
           smells her hair sheepishly...

           CLASSROOM

           The GYM TEACHER is subbing in English.  A burly man 
           (40’s) with a full sweat-pant outfit, a gnarly mullet and 
           a whistle finishes writing on the board--

           Poetry ROCKS!!

           Beverly rushes into the room - only two seats left.

           One, the SAFE SEAT in the middle of the room.  The other 
           in the back corner next to the scariest girl in school - 
           NICKY.  Dressed in all black, busy drawing skulls in her 
           notebook.

           Beverly is about to sit down at the safe seat when 
           another MEEK LOOKING GIRL practically dives into it--
                                 MEEK GIRL
                                 (motioning towards Nicky)
                        Please don’t make me sit back there.

           Beverly’s about to say something when the Teacher spots 
           her standing in the middle of the room.

                                 TEACHER
                        You are...

                                 BEVERLY
                        Beverly.

           Looking down his list--

                                 TEACHER
                        Beverly...

                                 BEVERLY
                        Moody.

           He makes a little mark in his notebook--

                                 TEACHER
                        Ah, there we are.  Well, Moody you look 
                        like a volunteer to me.  Why don’t you 
                        read us your assignment?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Um.  Okay.

           Beverly digs through her papers, pulls out a notebook, 
           flips through the pages and, hands-shaking and out of 
           breath reads--

                                 BEVERLY
                        There’s a dog next door I feed bologna 
                        through the fence.  A dog across the 
                        street whose owner forces him to wear 
                        sweaters in the summer - it doesn’t make 
                        sense.  There’s a yellow lab that’s blind 
                        and deaf named Nutter.  And in an empty 
                        lot behind the Ben Franklin’s there’s a 
                        dog buried there who died from eating a 
                        whole tub of “I Can’t Believe it’s Not 
                        Butter”.  
                                 (beat)
                        The end.

           The TEACHER claps - he looks around the room and keeps 
           clapping until others join in.
                                 TEACHER
                        Great.  Very, uh, Emily Dickinson-eque I 
                        think.  Just great.  Okay, whose next?  
                        Someone can volunteer or I can choose...

           Beverly makes her way back to the dreaded seat--

           NICKY

           Finishing a drawing of a snake eating a skull eating a 
           knife stabbing a snake in the eye.  Beverly tries to look 
           at it and Nicky gives her a dirty look and covers it up 
           like Beverly’s trying to cheat off her math test.

           Beverly tries to nonchalantly smell her hair again - 
           Nicky looks over just in time to catch her in the act, 
           holding her hair over her noise, taking big whiffs.  
           Nicky gives her a “what the hell are you doing?” look.  
           Beverly drops her hair, embarrassed.

                                 TEACHER
                        Excellent, a volunteer.  And you are?

           A SKIMPILY DRESSED GIRL stands up - well, not exactly a 
           girl - more of a woman: a full figured woman. It’s as if 
           she exists simply to show how very much a child Beverly 
           still is.  

           The boys’ mouths open, books go to laps.  The girls look 
           on jealously.  Without thinking Beverly’s hands go to her 
           own, not-yet-existent breasts.  

           Again, Nicky looks over just in time to catch her.  

                                 NICKY
                        Are you feeling yourself up?

           Beverly’s hands fly down to her desk--

                                 BEVERLY
                        No--

                                 NICKY
                        Yeah, you definitely were--

                                 BEVERLY
                        No, I--

                                 TEACHER
                        Okay, ladies.  Enough with the chit and 
                        the chat.  Time to open your ear-holes 
                        and be a good audience.
           Nicky gives Beverly one last disgusted look--

                                 NICKY
                                 (whispering)
                        You have serious problems.

                                 TEACHER
                        Please, begin.

                                 MATURE GIRL
                        The throbbing night humped my soul--

                                 TEACHER
                        Okay.  Good.  Very, very good.  

                                 MATURE GIRL
                        There’s more.  

                                 TEACHER
                        Yes.  I know. I’m sure it all rocked.  
                        That’s why I’m moving on.  
                                 (beat)
                        Okay, who’s next?  Someone can volunteer 
                        or I can pick. Anybody...?

           A classroom of KIDS immediately look down.  Beverly lays 
           her head down on her desk...

           EXT. JAMES K. POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

           More chaos - this time the after-school variety.  

           Gail’s postal van pulls to the front of the school and 
           finds a spot among all the other waiting parents.

           INT. POSTAL VAN

           She takes a look at herself in the side mirror.  Her eyes 
           are red, as if she’s been crying.  She wipes them, takes 
           a big breath and plants a big smile on her face as--

           OUT THE WINDOW

           Beverly makes her way toward the postal van.  Head down, 
           defeated.  Beverly’s almost there when - WHAM!  Another 
           snowball to the cranium.  Beverly pauses, just for a 
           second, just long enough to let it register, then climbs 
           in.
           INT. POSTAL VAN

           Half a snowball still stuck to Beverly’s head as she 
           moves to the back of the van.  Gail stops her - a slight 
           look of concern on her face that quickly gets replaced by 
           toughness.  Gail peels the snowball off of Beverly’s 
           stocking cap--

                                 GAIL
                        How was your day?

           Beverly shrugs - heads back to the back of the van and 
           lays down amongst the now empty bags, looking just as 
           empty.  

                                 BEVERLY 
                        Same as every day.

           INT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - DAY

           The front door flies open, then

           INT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - THE BASEMENT

           It’s a musty room, orange-ish industrial carpeting, lined 
           with piles and piles of boxes and lit by a single bulb 
           dangling down from the ceiling.

           A soda and potato chips at her side Beverly begins her 
           after-school ritual - playing out the days events:

                                 BEVERLY
                                 (as Steven)
                        Only losers wear owl buttons.

           Beverly throws a punch into the air - looks down at an 
           imaginary opponent writhing on the ground.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        Oh, yeah?  Who’s the loser now, loser?

           UPSTAIRS

           Gail sits on the couch with the TV blaring.  A LOUD THUD 
           comes from the basement.  Gail hits mute and listens to 
           the mumblings and rumblings coming from her granddaughter 
           downstairs.  
           She gets up, walks to the basement door like she has a 
           hundred times before - and then puts her ear to the door.  
           More ramblings from downstairs.

           Gail goes to open the door, to go down there and talk to 
           her granddaughter - just like she has probably everyday - 
           but something in her just won’t do it.  

           THE BASEMENT

           Beverly continues the show--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Excuse me?  Did you just say I smell like 
                        choad?  Did you?  No, I know what you 
                        said.  You said I smelled like choad.  
                        Okay, well, how does this smell!?  

           Beverly swings around and kicks - right into a stack of 
           boxes, it falls into another stack and down they go, 
           dominoes style--

           All Beverly can do is sit there and watch as a wall of 
           boxes goes crashing to the ground.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        SHITake mushrooms.

           LATER

           Beverly stuffs Christmas decorations back into a box.  
           Tinsel and lights all tangled together, a reindeer with 
           its head broke off.  

           She starts on the next box - mostly what looks like bills 
           and then something else - something special--

           A MIXTAPE CASE

           The cover has a an anatomical skeleton cut out from a 
           text-book with a heart drawn in red in its ribcage.  
           Above it is written “New Beginnings” and below it is 
           written “The Sarah loves Zach Mix”.  

           Beverly opens up the tape case - the tape is still there.

           She digs through the box - not finding what she wants she 
           dumps it.  And there it is - a Walkman held together with 
           a rubber band.  She hits the radio - the batteries still 
           work.
           Beverly puts the tape in the Walkman.  She stops a second 
           to absorb what’s happening--

           This is her wardrobe to Narnia, her invitation to 
           Hogwarts.  This is where the adventure begins and 
           somewhere, deep down inside, Beverly can sense it--

           She pushes play.  

           And waits.  She strains her ears.  Then that familiar 
           hiss of a cassette tape beginning followed by one strum 
           of a guitar before...

           A HORRIBLE SCREECHING SOUND--

           Beverly opens the Walkman.  The tape hangs out like a 
           corpse, hopelessly tangled and definitely destroyed.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        No... 

           But all is not lost - she turns the tape cover over 
           revealing a list of songs.  Exotic sounding bands and 
           songs:  “Carnival” by Bikini Kill and “Teacher’s Pet” by 
           The Quick.  And then others that aren’t songs at all - a 
           listing that says, “The song that reminds me of that day  
           in the park” and the last song, “The parental unit’s 
           happy song”.  

           And around all of the songs are hand-drawn fireworks, 
           swirling up and exploding--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Fireworks...

           Beverly stuffs the list in her pocket.

           UPSTAIRS

           Beverly races by the sofa, toward the upstairs--

                                 GAIL
                        I heard something fall.  What was it?

                                 BEVERLY 
                        Nothing.

           Gail goes to say something, but Beverly’s already racing 
           loudly up the stairs--
           BEVERLY’S ROOM

           Beverly practically dives under her bed.  While she’s 
           under there we get a better look at the picture beside 
           her bed: a young punk couple, pierced, dyed hair, the boy 
           holds a beer, the girl a cigarette.  They’re cool in that 
           grunge way.  We don’t know it yet, but these are Bev’s 
           parents...

           Beverly re-emerges from under the bed with a beaten-up 
           converse shoebox.  She opens it up, revealing the 
           contents:

           A couple of pictures - of that same couple as in the 
           picture sitting by Beverly’s bedside - a small notebook 
           and lots and lots of unopened mail that Beverly’s 
           pilfered with addresses from all over the world.    

           Beverly deposits her newest letter - the piece of air 
           mail from France.  Then she pulls out one particular 
           picture - a picture of that same hipster couple holding a 
           little smiling baby while fireworks explode in the sky 
           above them.  She sets it beside the mixtape decorated 
           with fireworks and opens the small notebook and writes--  

           Mixtape.  New beginnings.  Fireworks.  

           INT. FOOD LION - CONTINUOUS

           We can hear Beverly and Gail before we see them--

           The shopping cart’s wheels - SCREECH SCREECH SCREECH.  
           Gail steers past the bread aisle, past the frozen foods, 
           past the canned foods, past the--

           Beverly stops.  Gail keeps going...

           THE SHAMPOO AISLE

           Bottles of shampoos of every variety. Beverly sniffs a 
           bottle of Orange blossom.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Mm-mmm.

           A bottle of Tea-tree oil and lavender

                                 BEVERLY
                        Ahhh.
           A bottle of Jasmine and Melon Blossom.  A picture of a 
           beautiful woman flipping her hair on the bottle with the 
           words - Smell Gorgeous!  

                                 BEVERLY
                                 (reading)
                        Smell gorgeous.

           REFRIGERATED SECTION

           Beverly runs up to Gail, clutching her bottle of Jasmine 
           and Melon Blossom shampoo--

                                 GAIL
                        Pick out some Lunchables.

           Beverly drops the shampoo in the cart.  Gail immediately 
           plucks it out--  

                                 GAIL
                        What’s this?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Shampoo.

           Holds it out to Beverly--

                                 GAIL
                        We already have shampoo.

                                 BEVERLY
                        But this one smells really good.

                                 GAIL
                        We can discuss it when we finish the 
                        shampoo we have.

                                 BEVERLY
                        But we’ve had that bottle for like two 
                        years and it’s still half full.

                                 GAIL
                        I said no, Beverly.  Now pick out some 
                        Lunchables and let’s get home before 
                        “Deal or No Deal” comes on.  

           Gail puts the shampoo on the shelf among the hotdogs and 
           lunch meat and squeaks away.  Beverly picks up the 
           shampoo and follows her.  

           REGISTER 
           The usual crowded line of impatient shoppers--

           Gail is busy thumbing through her coupons.  Beverly loads 
           items onto the check-out counter - including the Jasmine 
           and Melon Blossom shampoo.

           The CHECKER scans milk.  Five Lunchables.  The bottle of 
           shampoo.

                                 GAIL
                        What is that?

                                 CHECKER
                        Uh, shampoo.

           Looks at Beverly--

                                 GAIL
                        We don’t want that.

           Checker unscans it--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Please!

           Checker looks at Gail--

                                 GAIL
                        No.  And that’s my final answer. 

                                 BEVERLY
                        But I don’t want to use Pert Plus.

           With finality--

                                 GAIL
                        No.  
                                 (to the Checker)
                        We don’t want it.  We have plenty of 
                        shampoo at home.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I don’t want Pert Plus!  It smells like 
                        choad!

           Everyone in line stops what they’re doing, stares at 
           Beverly in shock.  Gail’s mouth is wide open--

                                 CHECKER
                        It does smell kind of nasty.
           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Gail - still fuming.  

                                 GAIL
                        Where did you hear a word like that?

           Beverly doesn’t answer--

                                 GAIL
                        Answer me, Beverly Moody.  Where did you 
                        hear that word?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Nowhere.

                                 GAIL
                        As far as I’m concerned you can use Pert 
                        Plus until you’re eighteen.  

           Beverly steams the window with her breath and writes 
           “CHOAD” against the glare of passing headlights...

           INT. POSTAL VAN - MORNING

           Gail grumbles at the radio.  Beverly sits in the back 
           looking like the queen of the sad sacks amongst the mail 
           bags...

           EXT. SCHOOL TRACK - DAY

           The same TEACHER as in English class surveys the class.  

           Everyone doing laps.  Beverly gets to the end of the 
           track and just keeps running - off the track and past the 
           school...

           EXT. WAL-MART - DAY

           Beverly marches along a busy street and into the store.

           INT. WAL-MART - CONTINUOUS

           A CLERK, looking just out of high school, pretends to 
           work - scanning various things at random--

           He walks by Beverly and scans her.  
                                 HIGH SCHOOL CLERK

                                 BEVERLY
                        What?

                                 HIGH SCHOOL CLERK
                        The scanner says you’re worth 7.99.    

           Beverly looks offended--

                                 HIGH SCHOOL CLERK
                        No, that’s good.  I’m only worth 3.99.

           A SECOND CLERK emerges - a humongous woman with a badge 
           that reads, “Hello!  I’m Ruth!”

                                 RUTH
                        Will you please leave this girl alone and 
                        do some work?

                                 HIGH SCHOOL CLERK
                                 (to Beverly)
                        She’s just mad ‘cause she’s only worth 
                        fifty cents.

           Swatting at him with a huge hand--

                                 RUTH
                        Lou, I’m not gonna tell you again...

           High School Clerk continues his rounds - scanning things 
           absently.  Ruth turns to Beverly, as sweet as can be--

                                 RUTH
                        I can’t find anything by that artist...

           Ruth hands the song list back to Beverly

                                 RUTH
                        But I think we might have CD’s by some of 
                        the other artists.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        It has to be the first one.

           Off of Ruth’s confused look.

                                 BEVERLY
                        It has to be in order.
                                 RUTH
                        Well, I’m sorry, sweetie.  We don’t carry 
                        that song.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        Do you know who would?

                                 RUTH
                        You could try the Westside Wal-Mart.  
                        They tend to have a little bigger music 
                        selection.

           EXT. WAL-MART - CONTINUOUS

           Beverly walks out into the sea of minivans and SUV’s, 
           kids in shopping carts and frazzled moms.

                                 CLERK (O.S.)
                        Hey! Girl!  Hey, 7.99!

           Beverly turns around, the Clerk jogs toward her--

                                 CLERK
                        Let me see that list.

           Beverly hesitates--

                                 CLERK
                        If they don’t have the songs here, it 
                        must be something good.

           She hands him the list.  He looks it over, smiles...

                                 CLERK
                        This is really rad...I know where you can 
                        find the first song.  Maybe all the 
                        songs.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           A crummy record store on a crummy street.  A train roars 
           by behind it.

           INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

           Beverly pushes the door open, setting off an 
           extraordinarily loud bell.  It’s filled with CD’s, 
           records, posters of bands we’ve never heard of - a few we 
           have...but no customers.
           Beverly moves cautiously through the store - does a lap 
           and returns to the counter to find a menacing but frumpy-
           looking guy behind it.  

           This is ANTI - 40’s - aging hipster, rocker, and rebel.  
           He looks like a mix between Henry Rollins and your creepy 
           Uncle who’s always asking your parents for money.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        I’m looking for a song.

                                 ANTI
                        What an amazing, impossible coincidence.  
                        I sell songs.

           The sarcasm zips by Beverly.  Confused, she simply holds 
           out her song list.  Anti takes it - a visible shift in 
           his countenance, from harsh to, well, slightly less 
           harsh.

                                 ANTI
                        Not bad.  Sequencing needs work.  What’s 
                        this, “The song that reminds me of that 
                        time in the park”?  

                                 BEVERLY
                        Um...I don’t really know.  I thought it 
                        was a song.  

                                 ANTI
                        Where’d you get this?  You steal it off 
                        somebody?

                                 BEVERLY
                        It’s my parent’s - the tape broke.  Now I 
                        wanna get the songs.

                                 ANTI
                        You’re parents have some good taste.  I 
                        have some of these.  
                                 (noting one of the songs)
                        Nobody has this one that I know of...

           Anti starts making his way through the story, plucking 
           records from their spots--

                                 BEVERLY
                        I just need the first one for now.

                                 ANTI
                                 (reading the list)
                        “Carvinal - Bikini Kill”?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANTI (CONT'D)
                        You want vinyl or CD?  I’d go vinyl if 
                        you have the stereo to handle it.

           Anti pulls a record out--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Do you have it on tape?

           Off Anti’s perplexed look--

                                 BEVERLY
                        I only have a Walkman.

           Anti looks out the window toward the street - looking for 
           something--

                                 BEVERLY
                        What are you looking for?

                                 ANTI
                        I was looking for your Delorean.   The 
                        flux capacitor acting up again?  Can’t 
                        just pop back into 80’s and pick the tape 
                        up there?

           Beverly looks at him blankly--

                                 ANTI
                        Back to the Future?  The car...?  
                        Nevermind...how much money you got?

           Beverly rummages nervously through her pockets.  Pulls 
           out some sweaty bills and change - puts it in Anti’s 
           hand.  He sets the money down - disgusted.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I’m sorry.  I was sweating.

                                 ANTI
                        Wonderful.  Wait here.  

           Anti takes the record and disappears into a back room.

                                 ANTI (O.S.)
                        And don’t steal anything!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           RECORD STORE - LATER

           Beverly looks through the album covers.  Fantastic images 
           of fantastic people in all sorts of dangerous looking 
           poses.  Anti emerges - tape in hand.
                                 ANTI
                        I recorded the song for you on an old 
                        tape I had.  The rest of it is from an AA 
                        talk.  That’s free of charge.  Good 
                        stuff.  If you ever want to get clean.

           He hands her the tape.  Beverly beams back at him.  Anti 
           scribbles on a piece of paper--

                                 ANTI
                        We’ll say a dollar for a used tape - a 
                        dollar for the song, labor...carry the 
                        four, Pythagorean theorem.  With tax your 
                        total comes to...

           He counts out the money.

                                 ANTI
                        Five damp dollars and sixty-three sweaty 
                        cents.  Exactly.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Thank you.

                                 ANTI
                        Okay.  Now get outta here before I call 
                        the cops.

           Beverly heads for the door--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Wait, what’s your name?

                                 ANTI
                        Anti.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Anti?  Anti what?

                                 ANTI
                        Anti pretty-much-everything.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Oh.  I’m Beverly Moody.

                                 ANTI
                        That’s great.  Have a nice day, Moody.  

           Beverly can’t tell if he’s grinning or grimacing as she 
           heads out the door.
           EXT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Beverly runs from the Postal Van into the house.  Gail 
           watches her go, totally perplexed...

           BEVERLY’S ROOM

           Beverly bursts into her room - grabs the ancient Walkman 
           off of her desk and puts the tape in.  She presses play 
           and waits...

           The drums kick in - the guitars rip through the 
           earphones.  Beverly looks a little shocked.  Pushes stop 
           and looks down at the Walkman. 

                                 BEVERLY
                        Holy crap.

           She puts the headphones back on, hits play and the music 
           blares.

           EXT. JAMES K. POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

           Beverly stands in front of school like a gunfighter at 
           noon.  She pulls her Walkman out of her bag.  Puts her 
           head-phones around her neck.  Checks the tape inside. 
           Secure.

           And walks inside--

           INT. JAMES K. POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL

           The Jungle.

           Kids scream, running through the halls.  Pushing.  
           Shoving.  Name-calling.  Papers flying.  

           Beverly puts the headphones over her ears.  She presses 
           play and as the music comes in--

           Something magic happens...

           Everyone moves in slow motion, as if in time to the 
           music.  The entire mood of the hallway changes from 
           violent to welcoming.  Students smile and wave; the 
           pubescent chaos parts before Beverly as she walks down 
           the hall...
           BEVERLY’S LOCKER

           Steven rolls up in his wheelchair with Donny in tow.  
           Beverly looks over at them - the music blaring from her 
           headphones, a huge smile on her face.  

           She speaks loud, over the sound in her headphones--

                                 BEVERLY
                        HEY GUYS.

           And walks away happy.  Steven watches her go happily 
           along her way--

                                 STEVEN
                        What a goat scrotum.

           EXT. SCHOOL TRACK - ANOTHER DAY

           More laps.  Again, Beverly hits the end of the track and 
           keeps right on going--

           INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

           Beverly walks in - waves happily to Anti.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Hi Anti!

           Anti just looks at her.  Beverly takes out the list - 
           puts it on the counter.

                                 BEVERLY
                        That was probably the best song I’ve ever 
                        heard in my entire life.  I have to have 
                        the next one.  

           Anti stares at her blankly--

                                 BEVERLY
                        I brought the tape and everything.  And 
                        I’ve got like--
                                 (pulls out some change)
                        --three dollars and--

                                 ANTI
                        Listen, Moody.  I’m not in the mix making 
                        business.  I sell records and CD’s.  And, 
                        I’m sorry, but your lunch money isn’t 
                        going to buy anything in this store.
                                 BEVERLY
                        Maybe I could work for you.  I could come 
                        here and like sweep, or organize stuff.  

                                 ANTI
                        Sorry, kid, but you scare the customers 
                        away.  The last thing people want to see 
                        when they go to a cool record store such 
                        as this hip establishment is a pre-teen 
                        girl in junior high gym clothes.

                                 BEVERLY
                        But you never even have customers.  

                                 ANTI
                        My point exactly.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        Please?

                                 ANTI
                        Compelling argument, but no.  This is 
                        your parents mix-tape, correct?   So I 
                        suggest you pester them for the music.  

           An awkward beat.  One very large tear forms in Beverly’s 
           eye.

                                 ANTI
                        What?  What’s wrong with your eye?  What 
                        are you doing?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I can’t ask my parents.  They’re gone.

           Anti cringes--

                                 ANTI
                        Gone like, to the store to get a gallon 
                        of milk?

           Beverly doesn’t answer.  But that very large tear rolls 
           down her cheek.

                                 ANTI
                        I’m sorry.  I-- don’t cry.  Jesus, okay,

           He grabs the mixtape and disappears into the backroom.  
           We can hear him mumbling to himself, but we can’t quite 
           make out what he’s saying.  

           He re-emerges and gives her the tape.

                                 BEVERLY

                        You’re welcome, Moody.  Now if you’ll 
                        excuse me I need to return some Christmas 
                        presents to Whoville.

           EXT. JAMES K. POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

           Lunchtime and, sure enough, Beverly is eating a bagel 
           pizza and green jello.  Some things never change.  She 
           takes out her Walkman, puts the tape in and listens...

                                 VOICE
                        ...you’re traveling a road that’s full of 
                        pot-holes.  Those pot-holes being the 
                        heart-break, the disappointment and hurt 
                        in your life.  What so many of us try to 
                        do is patch up this road with alcohol and 
                        drugs - but what we should be doing is 
                        paving a new road...

           The voice cuts off - the tape begins to hiss--

           The drums kick in.  The guitars kick in.  Then the singer 
           begins to sing - but it’s not in English - it’s Japanese.

           ON BEVERLY

           Looking thoroughly confused.  She looks at the song 
           listing again:  “Linda Linda Linda - The Blue Hearts”.

           EXT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - MORNING

           The first signs of spring.  The snow is slowly retreating 
           to become muddy puddles.  An arm falls off a melting, sad 
           looking snow-man--
           INT. BEVERLY’S ROOM - MORNING

           Blinds conceal the bright light of morning.  Beverly 
           snores lightly, the Walkman beside her on the bed.

           Somewhere outside someone starts shouting--

                                 BOY’S VOICE
                        It’s Saturday everybody!  It’s Saturday!!

           Beverly gets up - opens her curtains--

           DOWN THE STREET

           At the Asian house - the Boy is outside his window on the 
           roof doing a dance and singing his song about Saturday in 
           his Spider-man pajamas.

                                 BOY
                        It’s Saturday, for sheezy my neezies!  
                        Anarchy!  Attica!  

           And then he pulls down his drawers and moons the 
           neighborhood.  His Mom bursts out the front door and 
           starts hollering at him.  The Asian girl, her head out of 
           the other upstairs window, laughs hysterically.

           Finally, the DAD reaches out the Boy’s window and yanks 
           him back inside.

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           Gail’s postal van cruises up to a line of mail-boxes. 

           INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY

           Beverly grabs a gob of mail from a bag.  She notices a 
           letter, from India, and discreetly stuffs it in her 
           pocket.  The rest of the mail gets handed off to Gail who 
           crams the junk-mail and bills unceremoniously into the 
           boxes.  

           Then it’s off to the next group of houses--

           They turn past a yard with a cardboard sign with the 
           message “Free Kittens to LOVING home,” scrawled in awful, 
           child-like handwriting.
           Beside the sign is the advertised box-full-of-kittens.  
           And sitting on a lawn-chair beside the box is a mom with 
           a crying little girl in her lap, holding one of the 
           kittens.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Can I get a kitten?

                                 GAIL
                        You’re allergic.

                                 BEVERLY
                        How do you know?

                                 GAIL
                        Genetics.

           Beverly thinks about it...

                                 BEVERLY
                        Mom and dad were allergic to kittens?

           Gail just nods her head and pulls up to the next mailbox.

           INT. BEVERLY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Beverly opens the converse box, drops in her newest 
           letter and pulls out her notebook--

           NOTEBOOK PAGE

           Under a list of things like:

           Drink beer, did not graduate high school, freckles, liked 
           pizza, and MUSIC!

           Beverly writes - allergic to kittens.

           She looks 

           OUT THE WINDOW

           The Asian girl and her family walk into the house.  
           Beverly sets her notebook down and grabs her Walkmen.  

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Beverly, armed with her headphones, marches down the 
           sidewalk towards--

           THE ASIAN HOUSE
           Beverly rings the doorbell.  The Asian Boy appears in the 
           window.  He calmly flips her off with one hand and then 
           the other.  A double bird.  Beverly’s not sure what to do 
           at first, finally she flips him off back - right as his 
           Mom opens the door--

                                 ASIAN MOTHER
                        Can I help you?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yeah, uh...is your daughter home?

                                 ASIAN MOTHER 
                        No, I’m sorry she’s--

           And then the Asian Girl appears by her side.

                                 ASIAN GIRL
                        Hi.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        Hi.  I’m Beverly I live down the street.

                                 ELLEN
                        I’m Ellen.  I live here.

           The Asian Mom says something in Korean to her daughter, 
           who says something in Korean back.  Their tone says it 
           all - Beverly cringes...

                                 ELLEN
                        Wanna go outside?

           As Ellen walks away her mother scolds her in Korean.

                                 ELLEN
                        Fine, come on Justin.

           Ellen’s little brother runs out the door behind her.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Beverly and Ellen sit on the sidewalk.  Justin busies 
           himself mutilating a melting snowman in the background.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I saw your brother on the roof yesterday.
                                 ELLEN
                        Justin?  Yeah, I triple dared him.  He’ll 
                        do anything if you triple dare him - even 
                        something he really doesn’t want to do.  
                        It’s kind of amazing. You wanna see?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Sure.

                                 ELLEN
                                 (to her brother)
                        Justin, I dare you to eat that brown 
                        snow.

                                 JUSTIN
                        No way!

                                 ELLEN
                                 (calmly)
                        I double dare you to do it. 

           He knows where this is going--

                                 JUSTIN
                        Knock it off, Ellen!  I don’t wanna eat 
                        no brown snow.

           Ellen, looking at Beverly like a magician about to 
           perform her big trick--

                                 ELLEN
                        I triple dog dare you.

           JUSTIN

           Stomps his feet angrily.  Looks like he’s about to cry - 
           and then grabs a handful of brownish, slushy snow and 
           stuffs it in his mouth--

                                 JUSTIN
                                 (mouth full)
                        I’m telling!

           He runs into the house--

                                 BEVERLY
                        That is amazing.

                                 ELLEN
                        Yeah.  We should probably go now...
           EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

           Beverly and Ellen walk slowly down the street.

                                 ELLEN
                        You have any brothers or sisters?

                                 BEVERLY
                        No.  I don’t have any uncles or aunts or 
                        cousins either.  Just me and my Grandma.

                                 ELLEN
                        Back in New Jersey I have like 2 million 
                        cousins.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Why’d you move here?

                                 ELLEN
                        ‘Cause of my dad.  He didn’t like his old 
                        job, so we had to come here.  Now he 
                        doesn’t like this job either.  But my mom 
                        says we can’t move all over the country 
                        like vagabonds.  So we’re staying.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Anybody give you a tour of the 
                        neighborhood yet?

                                 ELLEN
                        No.  No one really talks to me.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I could give you a tour.  I’ve lived here 
                        my whole life.  I know the names of all 
                        the dogs and which ones you can pet and 
                        which ones will bite you and everything.

                                 ELLEN
                        Okay.

                                 BEVERLY
                        But first you have to do something for 
                        me.

                                 ELLEN
                        What?
           EXT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

           The two sit on the front lawn of Beverly’s house.  
           Beverly puts the headphones on Ellen--

                                 BEVERLY
                        So you listen to this and tell me what it 
                        says, ‘kay?

                                 ELLEN
                        ‘kay.

           Beverly pushes play. 

                                 ELLEN
                                 (overly loud)
                        It’s just some guy talking about roads.

                                 BEVERLY
                        It’s after that.

           Ellen listens - then squints hard in concentration. 
           Beverly watches her nervously.  A few beats--

           Ellen takes off the headphones.

                                 ELLEN
                        This is Japanese.

           Beverly - not getting it.

                                 ELLEN
                        I’m Korean.  

           Hands the headphones back--

                                 ELLEN
                        Can I still get the tour?

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Beverly pedals an old junky Huffy while Ellen rides on 
           the pegs.

           They move past a cute little house with an immaculate 
           yard.

                                 BEVERLY
                        That’s where two men live - Les and Ray.  
                        They dress their dog in sweaters even in 
                        the summer.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BEVERLY (CONT'D)
                        I asked them once, “Why do ya dress your 
                        dog in sweaters even in the summer?”  And 
                        Ray said, “Fashion before comfort, 
                        sweetie.”  My Grandma tries to tell me 
                        they’re just friends, but I know they’re 
                        gay.  I think they’re pretty fabulous. 

           A run-down house with dead grass--

                                 BEVERLY
                        This is where the other Asians live.  
                        They’re old and have a name I can’t 
                        pronounce so I just call them Mr. and 
                        Mrs.  One year a kid went trick-or-
                        treating there and they gave him a 
                        chicken leg from KFC.  So don’t go trick-
                        or-treating there unless you like KFC.

           An ordinary looking corner--

                                 BEVERLY
                        This corner is famous.  It was in Cops 
                        one time where the police pulled this guy 
                        over and he was like, “I don’t have no 
                        crack.”  And they were like, “Then what’s 
                        that crack-pipe doing on your seat?”  And 
                        he got out and ran and they caught him by 
                        his pony tail and arrested him right 
                        here.  He just kept screaming, “Where’s 
                        my old lady!  I wanna see my old lady!”  
                        Over and over. 

                                 ELLEN
                        Why do you live with your Grandma?

           Beverly shrugs.

                                 BEVERLY
                        My parents are gone.  

                                 ELLEN
                        Where’d they go?

                                 BEVERLY
                        They went to get a gallon of milk.

           They can see the sun beginning to set down at the end of 
           the road, where the street meets the horizon...

                                 BEVERLY
                        You like breakfast for dinner?
           INT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Beverly munches on bacon.  Gail holds out another waffle 
           to Ellen--

                                 GAIL
                        More waffles, honey?

                                 ELLEN
                        Yes, please.

           Gail puts the waffle down and pours more batter in the 
           waffle maker.

           Ellen leans over to Beverly--

                                 ELLEN
                                 (whispering)
                        Do all white people eat breakfast for 
                        dinner?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yeah, I think so.

           INT. BEVERLY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ellen sits on the bed looking at the framed picture of 
           Beverly’s parents.  Beverly emerges from underneath the 
           bed with her converse box.

                                 ELLEN
                        They don’t look like parents.

                                 BEVERLY
                        My mom was only 15 when she had me.  It’s 
                        called “babies having babies”.  I saw it 
                        on Maury.

           Beverly sets the box on the bed and opens it--

                                 ELLEN
                        What’s with all the letters? 

           Beverly carefully pulls out her pictures of her parents.

                                 BEVERLY
                        When I was a little I always thought 
                        maybe my mom and dad would write me a 
                        letter from wherever they were, so I 
                        started stealing them.  Now I just kind 
                        of like them.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BEVERLY (CONT'D)
                        I have one from every state.  Pretty soon 
                        I’ll have one from every country.

                                 ELLEN
                        Cool...

           Ellen digs through the letters.  One from New York is 
           obviously a love letter, hearts drawn all over it.

           Beverly hands Ellen the picture of her as a baby with her 
           parents, fireworks exploding in the background.

                                 BEVERLY
                        This is me with my mom and dad.  

                                 ELLEN
                        How’d they die?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Car wreck.  I never really knew them.  
                                 (beat)
                        The other night I woke up and there were 
                        these amazing fireworks outside.  It was 
                        pretty much the most beautiful thing that 
                        ever happened outside my window.  And 
                        then I found this--

           She hands her the mixtape next...

                                 BEVERLY
                        I think it might be a sign--

                                 ELLEN
                        --like a message!  From beyond the grave!

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yeah.  But I’m not sure what they’re 
                        trying to tell me.  

           Footsteps coming up the stairs.  Beverly panics, grabs 
           the pictures and letters and stuffs them in the box, then 
           throws the box under the bed.

           Beverly’s door opens and Gail peaks her head in.  Two 
           highly guilty looking kids peer back.

                                 GAIL
                        I think it’s time you headed home, Ellen.  
                        It’s getting late.

                                 ELLEN
                        Okay, Mrs. Moody.
           Gail closes the door.  Ellen looks at Beverly - what was 
           that all about?

                                 BEVERLY
                        My Grandma can’t know.  If I even mention 
                        my parents she’ll cry for a week.

           Ellen looks at the mixtape still in her hands--

                                 ELLEN
                        I think I can help.  Come over tomorrow.

           INT. BEVERLY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Headphones on...her parents’ picture in her hand...her 
           eyes begin to close...the picture begins to drop from her 
           hand...until...she’s asleep

           DREAM

           FANCY COCKTAIL LOUNGE

           “Linda Linda Linda” is playing--

           Beverly is standing on stage, mic in hand, dressed in an 
           opulent kimono and mouthing the words to the song. 

           Ellen stands behind her playing bass, while Anti keeps 
           time on drums.  

           OUT IN THE CROWD

           We spot Beverly’s parents.  They’re looking the same as 
           they do in the picture, holding hands and holding beers.  
           They beam proud smiles at Beverly who smiles back--

           As the song reaches it’s crescendo, fireworks burst from 
           the back of the stage--

           THE CROWD

           Rises to its feet in jubilant appreciation.  Rampant 
           applause--

           BEVERLY

           Puts her arms up to the sky and belts out the song--

                                 GAIL (O.S.)
                        Beverly!
           The song stops.  

           The crowd looks around - confused--

           Gail

           Stands up in front of Beverly’s Mom and Dad who recede 
           into the shadows, disappearing--

                                 GAIL
                        Beverly!

           BEVERLY’S ROOM - MORNING

           Gail stands over her--

                                 GAIL
                        Beverly!  You planning on sleeping all 
                        day?

           EXT. ELLEN’S HOUSE - DAY

           Ellen’s little brother Justin is in the front yard 
           throwing mud at his parents SUV over and over, covering 
           it on one side.  

           Beverly walks up--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Hi, Justin.  Is Ellen home?

           Justin stops throwing mud.  Dramatically turns to Beverly 
           and says, with poetic flair--

                                 JUSTIN
                        Booger.

           Then he turns around and keeps throwing mud at the car.

           INT. ELLEN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Two huge posters - one of Tupac, the other of Notorious 
           B.I.G.  Ellen types on her computer--

                                 ELLEN
                        I-tunes is the greatest invention ever.  
                        All the songs are like free.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        Free?
                                 ELLEN
                        Well, almost.  You just have to get your 
                        parents to put their credit card 
                        information in - then the songs are free.

           ON SCREEN

           An instant message appears from Sergio:

           Y NOT CHATING LATLY?

                                 ELLEN
                        Just a sec.  I have to break up with 
                        Sergio first.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Sergio?

                                 ELLEN
                        He’s my Ukranian boyfriend.

           Ellen types:

           ON SCREEN

           Sry.  Cant date sumbudy that uses caps ALL THE TIME.

                                 BEVERLY
                        You have a Ukranian boyfriend?

                                 ELLEN
                        Yeah.  I have a boyfriend in England too. 
                        And Canada, Korea, and India.

                                 BEVERLY
                        God.  I wanna computer so bad... 

                                 ELLEN
                        Wanna hear the next song on your tape?  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           ELLEN AND BEVERLY

           Facing the camera.  Frozen in place.

           The song starts to play and Beverly starts to mouth the 
           words while Ellen remains frozen.

           Then the music kicks in and Beverly and Ellen begin a 
           choreographed dance in sync with the song.
           From the looks of it they must have spent a couple of 
           days practicing.

           INT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - MORNING

           CLOSE ON A CALENDAR

           Picture of a man climbing a mountain with a strained look 
           on his face, the sun setting behind him.  Below is the 
           inspirational phrase:

           Whenever you are asked if you can do a job, tell 'em, 
           'Certainly I can!' Then get busy and find out how to do 
           it.

           Theodore Roosevelt (1858 - 1919)

           Beverly flips the page to the next month 

           APRIL

           A picture of a man with a gold medal around his neck and 
           underneath:

           Be bold!  Go for the gold!

                                 BEVERLY
                        Be bold.  Go for the gold.

           KITCHEN - MORNING

           The same carefully choreographed routine Gail’s been 
           doing for years now.  She finishes up Beverly’s 
           breakfast, sets her plate on the table, then looks at the 
           ceiling and shouts to Beverly--

                                 GAIL
                        Beverly Moody!  You’re going to be late!

           BEVERLY

           Standing in the kitchen doorway--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Geez, Grandma. I’m right here.

                                 GAIL
                        You’re up already?

           Beverly grabs some bacon, shoves it in her mouth--
                                 BEVERLY
                                 (mouth full)
                        Yeah, I’m getting a ride with Ellen 
                        today.

                                 GAIL
                        With Ellen?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yeah, her mom’s got the greatest car in 
                        the world.  It has like enough seats for  
                        25 people and has a TV and air 
                        conditioning and seat-belts and 
                        everything. We each get our own row to 
                        sit in.  Ellen says it’s like riding in a 
                        movie theater.

           Beverly heads out of the kitchen.

                                 GAIL
                        I’ll pick you up then...

                                 BEVERLY
                        That’s okay, Ellen’s mom’s gonna pick us 
                        up too.

                                 GAIL
                        What about your...

           Beverly already has her headphones on, some song blaring 
           and she’s out the door--

                                 GAIL
                                 (to herself)
                        ...breakfast.

           INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY

           Gail hops in the postal van, starts it up.  The radio 
           kicks on - that same, monotone voice doing practically 
           the same political commentary as every other day.

           Gail looks into the back - where Beverly usually sits 
           among the full bags of mail.  Then she looks forward.  A 
           flash of sadness that, just as quickly, is gone.

           She turns off the radio.  Puts the van in gear and starts 
           her day.
           EXT. JAMES K. POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - LUNCH

           The school just before lunch - quiet and peaceful.  And 
           then the BELL RINGS and the commotion begins, carrying 
           over to...

           INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - LUNCH

           Lunchables for Beverly.  Rice and kimchi for Ellen.

           The song list lies in front of them.  The songs that 
           they’ve already found are highlighted, up to:

           Teacher’s pet - the quick.

                                 ELLEN
                        They only put out one album and it’s like 
                        impossible to find.  And this other one - 
                        “the song that reminds me of that time in 
                        the park”.  I don’t even know what that 
                        is.  I googled the crap out of it and 
                        nothing came up. 

           Beverly goes to take a drink of milk when - SLAM.  Steven 
           rams into her with his wheelchair.  The ever present 
           Donny snickers beside him--

                                 STEVEN
                                 (to Ellen)
                        Word to the wise, Madame Butterfly, 
                        unless you want to smell like warm butt-
                        hole I’d stay away from this one.

           Ellen just ignores him - hoping he’ll go away.  

                                 STEVEN
                        I don’t think she understands.  Donny, 
                        could you translate please?

                                 DONNY
                        Sure.  Ching-chong, ching-ching warm butt-
                        hole chong, ching.

                                 STEVEN
                        Thanks so much.

                                 DONNY
                        You’re so welcome.

           Steven rolls away, Donny in tow...
                                 BEVERLY
                        You ever skip school?

                                 ELLEN
                        No.

                                 BEVERLY
                        You want to?

           Ellen watches Steven and Donny continue their tour of the 
           cafeteria, making everyone’s lives miserable.

                                 ELLEN
                        Yeah.

           INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

           Anti - sound asleep in his chair.  Beverly and Ellen 
           stand on either side of him.

                                 ELLEN
                        He doesn’t look cool.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Trust me, he is.  He’s like 10,000 times 
                        more cool when he’s awake.

           Ellen peers into his ears--

                                 ELLEN
                        It looks like a furry little animal 
                        crawled into his ears.

           ANTI

           Opens his eyes sleepily, meeting the gaze of Ellen - only 
           inches from his face--

                                 ANTI
                        AAH!

           He falls out of his chair.  Then looks up to see the two 
           girls looking down at him--

                                 ANTI
                        What the...why would...how...

           Picks himself off the floor.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Did we scare you?
                                 ANTI
                        No, I always try to wake up to the sight 
                        of the village of the damned standing 
                        over me.  

           He leans on the counter and feels his heart, catching his 
           breath--

                                 BEVERLY
                        This is my friend, Ellen.

                                 ANTI
                        Yeah, we met.

                                 ELLEN
                        You have amazing ear hair.

                                 ANTI
                        Thanks.  I hoped someone would notice.

           Beverly hands him the song list--

                                 BEVERLY
                        I need the next song, please.

                        I suppose I need to make a tape for you 
                        too, huh?

                                 ELLEN
                        No.  I’m just helping her.

                                 ANTI
                        Super.

           Turns his attention to the list.  He looks it over and 
           frowns--

                        Out of print?

                        Old copy might turn up at a garage sale 
                        if you’re lucky, but it’s a long shot.
           EXT. RECORD STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Ellen and Beverly begin the long walk back to school 
           empty handed--

                                 ELLEN
                        We could find the other ones first.

           Unable to hide her disappointment--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yeah.  Sure.

           INT. ELLEN’S HOUSE - DINNER

           A perfectly set table.  Ellen’s Dad sits at the head in a 
           shirt and tie.  Ellen sits on one side while Beverly and 
           her brother sit on the other.

           Ellen’s Mom comes in from the kitchen with a fish on a 
           platter.  She sits down and they all start to grab hand.  
           Ellen’s brother quickly licks his hand before they do--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Ugh...

           Beverly hesitates - but Ellen’s Mom catches her and 
           shoots her the evil eye--

           Beverly grimaces and grabs the brother’s hand.

           They close their eyes and bow their heads while Dad 
           begins the prayer--

           Beverly lifts her head, opens her eyes a little and--

           BEGINS TO DAYDREAM

           At the head of the table is Beverly’s dad - looking as 
           young as in her picture of him, but now dressed in the 
           same clothes as Ellen’s dad.  

           And next to him, holding his hand, is Beverly’s Mom, but 
           wearing Ellen’s Mom’s clothes.

           They finish praying and both of them look up at Beverly 
           and smile.  Beverly beams back at them...

           A voice from somewhere far away...
                                 ELLEN’S DAD
                        Would you like some fish?  Beverly?

           REALITY

           Beverly stares off into space like an idiot--

           Everyone stares at her.  Ellen taps her on the shoulder.

                                 ELLEN
                        Beverly?

           Beverly snaps to, looks around her--

                                 ELLEN’S DAD 
                        Would you like some fish?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Uh, yes please.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Your friend’s weird.

                                 ELLEN
                        At least she isn’t afraid of the toilet.

                                 JUSTIN
                        So.  

           INT. BEVERLY’S ROOM - DAY

           Beverly has her headphones on.  The music is blasting so 
           loud that even we can hear it.

           She sings - badly - along.

           Gail enters--

                                 GAIL
                        Would you help me unpack groceries?

                                 BEVERLY
                                 (way too loud)
                        WHAT?

           Gail motions for her to take off the headphones--

                                 GAIL
                        You’re going to ruin your hearing that 
                        way.
                                 BEVERLY
                        What?  I can’t hear you.

                                 GAIL
                        Funny.  Come help me downstairs.

           KITCHEN

           Beverly and Gail unpack groceries.  Gail hands Beverly an 
           armload of Lunchables...

                                 BEVERLY
                        If you were going to lose your hearing to 
                        one song, what would it be?

                                 GAIL
                        I wouldn’t give up the precious gift of 
                        hearing for anything.  And definitely not 
                        for one song.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yeah, but pretend you had to - what song 
                        would you want it to be?

                                 GAIL
                        I can’t imagine a situation where I would 
                        HAVE to lose my hearing for a song.

                                 BEVERLY
                        There’s this song by this band Bikini 
                        Kill called “Carnival.”  That’s the song 
                        I’d pick.

                                 GAIL
                        Why does everything nowadays have to deal 
                        with murder?  Kill this.  Kill that.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        ‘Cause it’s cool.

                                 GAIL
                        Humph.  Unpack that bag over on the 
                        counter, will you?

           Beverly reaches into the bag--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Grandma!  You got it!

           Beaming, she pulls out the bottle of Jasmine and Melon 
           Blossom shampoo.
                                 GAIL
                        I just thought...we have had that bottle 
                        of Pert Plus for a long time.

           Beverly wraps her arms around Gail and squeezes--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou!

                                 GAIL
                        Okay, okay.  You’re welcome.

           BATHROOM

           Post-shower.  Beverly wipes steam from the mirror.  She 
           looks at herself and flips her hair glamorously.  Then 
           she smells her hair - AH!  Wonderful!

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS - MORNING

           Beverly comes bounding down the stairs like she’s walking 
           on air.  She flips her hair dramatically for Gail--

                                 GAIL
                        Oooh, well don’t you smell good.

                                 BEVERLY
                        No, Grandma.  I smell gorgeous.

           INT. JAMES K. POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - LOCKERS

           Beverly waits by her locker--

           HERE THEY COME

           Steven and Donny cruise up and look at Beverly with 
           scorn.  Beverly can’t help but smile a little--

           Trying to look casual, Beverly gives her hair a couple of 
           flips - willing the sweet scent of jasmine and melon 
           blossom to reach the guys--

           Donny and Steven look at each other - wtf?

           Steven drops one of his books beneath Beverly’s locker--

                                 STEVEN
                        Do you mind, Bev?  I’d get it, but - as 
                        you might have notice - I no longer have 
                        the use of my legs.
           Beverly bends over to pick it up - at the same time Donny 
           makes a locker-shaking FART NOISE.

           EVERYONE in the hallway turns and looks at Beverly, bent 
           over with Steven’s book in her hand.

                                 STEVEN
                        Oh my GOD!  Beverly farted!

                                 DONNY
                        UGH!  It stinks so bad it’s burning my 
                        eyes.

           Donny covers his eyes dramatically--

                                 STEVEN
                        It’s like mustard gas - I can’t breath.  
                        Someone save me!

           Beverly drops the book.  Stands up.  And slowly walks 
           away through the laughing crowd.  As she walks away--

                                 STEVEN
                        I think it’s melting the plastic on my 
                        wheelchair!

           EXT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE

           Beverly stops at her door, wiping the tears from her 
           face.  She takes a breath...

           INSIDE

           Gail’s sitting on the sofa watching TV--

                                 GAIL
                        Well, there she is.  Doesn’t you’re hair 
                        look gorgeous.

           Beverly looks like she might cry again, then bolts 
           upstairs leaving Gail looking perplexed.

           BATHROOM

           Headphones on, angry song blasting - Beverly pours the 
           entire bottle of Jasmine and Melon Blossom shampoo down 
           the drain...
           INT. JAMES K. POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAYS - DAY

           Ellen walks down the hallway, sees Steven and Donny 
           heading toward her and immediately turns backwards - 
           right into two very important words--

           THE QUICK

           Written in tall silver letters.  All Ellen can do is 
           stare - not even noticing the person wearing the shirt on 
           which these important silver letters are written--

           NICKY looks down at her - pissed--

                                 NICKY
                        You done looking at my tits yet?

           Ellen looks up at her--

                                 ELLEN
                        The Quick.

                                 NICKY
                        Whatever.

           Nicky walks away.

           Ellen stares after her - speechless - and then breaks 
           into a run the other way.

           EXT. FRONT OF THE SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           Ellen drags Beverly behind her--

           BUS LINE

           They arrive just in time to see Nicky as she’s about to 
           get on the bus.  Ellen points--

                                 ELLEN
                        The Quick!

           BEVERLY’S POV:

           Nicky turns and through the crowd of people we see her 
           shirt--

           THE QUICK written in big silver letters--

           And then the letters start to glow brighter and brighter 
           from some mysterious inner light--
           THE QUICK

           Glowing brightly, shining until those two words are all 
           we can see--

           Just as quickly - the glow is gone--

           Nicky gets on the bus--

                                 ELLEN
                        We found it...

           INT. JAMES K. POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

           Nicky is in her permanent seat in the corner, in her 
           permanent posture - head down, scribbling in a notebook.

           Beverly heads toward the open desk next to her--

           But ANOTHER STUDENT sits down right in front of her. 
           Looking a little lost, she heads toward another seat--

                                 TEACHER
                        Okay, class - who would like to read some 
                        poetry today?

           EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

           School’s out.  People wander this way and that.  Some 
           wait for the bus.  Some just wait.

           ACROSS THE STREET

           Nicky, dressed all in black, smoking by herself.

           BEVERLY AND ELLEN

           Sit in the grass making a daisy chain.  They keep their 
           eyes on Nicky.

                                 ELLEN
                        You can’t just go talk to her.  She’s 
                        like a wild animal.  You have to start 
                        slow.  Build trust first.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I think she’s just lonely.  People hate 
                        her even more than they hate us.
                                 ELLEN
                        Yeah, but she doesn’t care.  She hates 
                        them back.

           Beverly puts on her daisy chain with authority.  Ellen 
           puts on hers too.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Be bold.  Go for the gold.

                                 ELLEN
                        What?

                                 BEVERLY
                        To get the gold, you have to be bold.  
                        It’s from my calendar.
                                 (a big wave to Nicky)
                        Hi!

           Nicky stops - looks at them.  She takes a drag and 
           crosses the street.

                                 ELLEN
                        She’s coming!

                                 BEVERLY
                        I told you.  Be cool.

           They arrange their daisy chains.  Nicky stops in front of 
           them - a Queen before peasants--

                                 NICKY
                        Cool daisy chains.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Thanks.  I can make you one if you want.  
                        Once I made one that was like three feet 
                        long and--

                                 NICKY
                        I was kidding.  It doesn’t look cool.  
                        You look like a couple of chumps.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Oh.

                                 NICKY
                        If you two lesbos keep staring at me I’m 
                        gonna knock your heads off.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Okay.
           Nicky flicks her cigarette between the two girls - they 
           dodge out of its way.  Nicky takes one last moment to 
           register disgust and turns to walk away--

           When she’s safely out of reach--

                                 ELLEN
                        She’s like a bear.  You’ve just got to 
                        find the right bait.

           Nicky reaches her smoking spot and lights up another.  
           Beverly notices the shirt she’s wearing today - CHEAP 
           TRICK.

           INT. JAMES K. POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAYS

           Beverly sneaks down the empty hallway between classes.  
           She reaches the door of a classroom and waits--

           A beat.

           The BELL RINGS--

           And the class begins to empty.  Beverly forces her way 
           through the oncoming crowd and into the classroom--

           INT. ENGLISH CLASS - CONTINUOUS

           Enter Nicky--

           An empty classroom - except for the corner, next to 
           Nicky’s seat, where Beverly sits and waits.  Nicky goes 
           over and sits down.  Beverly starts to say something--

                                 NICKY
                        If you talk to me I’ll knock your head 
                        off.

           LATER

           The class is full.  The Teacher reads off a list--

                                 TEACHER

                        Lisa Moser, Michael Ottinger, Nicole 
                        Cruz.  You are the lucky three who still 
                        need to share your poems with the class. 

           As each name is read - the corresponding student winces 
           and puts their head a little further down.  
           Nicky stops drawing and tries to will herself invisible.

                                 TEACHER
                        So which one of you would like to read 
                        something today?

           A beat.  Silence.

           The Teacher looks at each of the three condemned students 
           one by one - the weight of his gaze making them shrink 
           down even more--

           And then Nicky makes the fatal mistake - she looks up and 
           makes eye contact--

                                 TEACHER
                        Ni--

           Beverly’s hand shoots up--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Is it okay if I read another poem?

                                 TEACHER
                        Well, this is a first.  Sure, Beverly, I 
                        don’t see why not.

           Beverly stands up - looks at Nicky pointedly--

                                 BEVERLY
                        This poem is called “Surrender.”
                                 (looks at her paper)
                        Whatever happened to all this season’s 
                        losers of the year?  Every time I got to 
                        thinking, where’d they disappear?  When I 
                        woke up, Mom and Dad are rolling on the 
                        couch.  Rolling numbers, rock and 
                        rollin’, got my Kiss records out.  
                        Mommy’s alright, Daddy’s alright, they 
                        just seem a little weird.  Surrender, 
                        surrender, but don’t give yourself away.  

           The Teacher gives a polite little clap--

                                 TEACHER
                        That was very cool Beverly.  Just, uh, 
                        really cool.  And that poem was about...?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Cheap Trick.

           Nicky looks at her and for the first time and...smiles.
           EXT. JAMES K. POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - SMOKERS CORNER - DAY

           Nicky hands Beverly a cigarette. 

           ACROSS THE STREET

           Ellen watches - but tries to look like she’s not 
           watching.

           NICKY

           Takes a drag.  Hands the lighter to Beverly.  Beverly 
           looks nervous--

                                 BEVERLY
                        I think I’ll save mine for later.

                                 NICKY
                        Later, like when?

                                 BEVERLY
                        When I take a bath.  I like to have a 
                        bubble bath and, uh, smoke and stuff and 
                        just relax.

           Nicky laughs--

                                 NICKY
                        You’re really weird.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yeah, I know.

                                 NICKY
                        I like it though.  Usually I’m the 
                        weirdo.

           She takes another drag.

                                 NICKY
                        I can’t believe you like Cheap Trick.  
                        They’re so underrated.  “Surrender” is 
                        like one of the greatest rock songs of 
                        all time.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yeah.

           Motioning toward Ellen across the street--
                                 NICKY 
                        So why have you and your friend been, 
                        like, stalking me?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Well...we just thought you look like you 
                        know a lot about music.

                                 NICKY
                        Kind of.  I guess.

                                 BEVERLY 
                        Have you heard of a band called The 
                        Quick?

           EXT. NICKY’S HOUSE - DAY

           The white-trash part of town.  A white-trash house.  A 
           car in the yard.  Beer cans decorating the shrubs.

           A LOUD roar comes from inside the garage--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Sounds like something is dying in your 
                        garage.

                                 NICKY
                        Kind of.

           She lifts up the garage door--

           FOUR SQUINTING HARDCORE KIDS blink at them like rats 
           exposed after lifting up a crate.

                                 NICKY’S BROTHER
                        Whattya think you’re doing, slut bag!?

                                 NICKY
                        Showin’ my friend what a crappy band 
                        looks like!

                                 NICKY’S BROTHER 
                        You better shut your mouth or I’ll knock 
                        your head off, slut!

           He slams the garage door back down--

                                 NICKY
                                 (into the garage door)
                        I’ll knock YOUR head off, dildo breath.

           Then calmly to Beverly--
                                 NICKY
                        Come on, my records are inside.

           INT. NICKY’S ROOM - DAY

           Walls covered in Skull drawings - some with hearts for 
           eyes, some with wings, one with horns, another with a 
           halo...

           Nicky digs through a crate of records.

           From the garage the painful sound of Nicky’s brother’s 
           band starts again--

                                 BEVERLY
                        How can boys so cute make music so bad?

                                 NICKY
                        You don’t know much about music, do you? 
                        Cute boys are responsible for the 
                        majority of awful music in this world.

           Gets to the end of her records--

                                 NICKY
                        That asshole.  He stole my goddamm 
                        record.

           She looks out her door like a spy going on some secret 
           mission - glances one way then the other--

                                 NICKY
                        I have to go into my brother’s room to 
                        get the record.  Keep a look-out okay?  
                        If he comes in just yell or something.

           Nicky sneaks into her brother’s room, leaving Beverly 
           alone in the living room.

           She looks over the spoon collection - spoons from all 
           fifty states.  Next she surveys the snow-globe collection 
           - again, one from each state.

                                 KYLE
                        Who the hell are you?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Um...NICKY!

           A rustling in Kyle’s room.  Nicky emerges with the record 
           in her hand--
                                 KYLE
                        Whattya doin’ in my room!

                                 NICKY
                        Gettin’ my record that you stole!

                                 KYLE
                        That’s my record!

           He grabs her in a headlock and takes her down to the 
           ground.

                                 NICKY
                        Stop!  You’re gonna break the record!

           Kyle lets her up.  Nicky hands the record to Beverly, 
           standing there in shock--

                                 NICKY
                        Hold this while I kick his ass.

           She turns and runs at him, tackling him to the ground.  
           Kyle grabs her by the hair and pulls her off of him--

                                 NICKY’S DAD (O.S.)
                        What the hell do you two think you’re 
                        doing?

           NICKY’S DAD - a burly construction worker stares down on 
           the two kids. Kyle and Nicky look up guiltily - still 
           locked in combat.

                                 NICKY’S DAD
                        How many times I gotta tell you two?  
                        This ain’t a honky-tonk bar - if you’re 
                        gonna fight there’s gonna be rules.  No 
                        hair pullin’.  No bitin’.  And no 
                        punchin’ in the face.  Now get up.

           Kyle and Nicky get up.  Dad acts as referee.  

                                 NICKY’S DAD
                        Okay...fight!

           Nicky looks over Kyle’s shoulder--

                                 NICKY
                        Hey, Mom.

           Kyle looks back--BAM!  Nicky nails him with a swift knee 
           to the groin.  Down he goes in a groaning pile--
                                 KYLE
                                 (groaning)
                        She cheated.

                                 NICKY’S DAD
                        Oh, christ, Kyle.  She’s your little 
                        sister.  Quit bein’ a goddamn baby.
                                 (to Nicky)
                        Get over here and give your old dad a hug 
                        before I knock your head off.  

           Nicky gives her dad a hug and he kisses her on the head. 
           Beverly just stands there, still frozen with awe.

           DINNER TABLE

           NICKY’S MOM, still in her waitress outfit, drops a plate 
           of soggy fishsticks on the table. Beverly watches Nicky’s 
           Mom as she lights up a cigarette.

           Suddenly Nicky’s Mom and Dad are replaced by Beverly’s 
           Mom and Dad looking, for the most part, like they did in 
           the picture - but just a little trashier...

                                 BEVERLY’S MOM
                        Christ, I’m tired.

                                 BEVERLY’S DAD
                        Too tired to give your old man a little 
                        sugar?

           He puts a fish-stick in his mouth - sticking halfway out - 
           and leans toward Mom a la Lady and the Tramp.

                                 BEVERLY’S MOM
                        Aw Christ.  You’re disgusting.

           She turns away and he leans in closer.  She smiles coyly--

                                 BEVERLY’S DAD
                        Come on now, sugar.  Give me a little 
                        fish-stick kiss...

                                 BEVERLY’S MOM
                        Geez-us.  Fine.

           She turns and takes a bite of the soggy fish-stick.  He 
           bites until their lips meet and...

           They kiss - obviously still very much in love.
                                 NICKY (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry you have to see this - they’re 
                        totally gross.

           The spell breaks - Beverly’s Mom and Dad are gone.  
           Beverly snaps back to reality looking a little dazed, a 
           little sad...

                                 BEVERLY
                        I don’t mind.

           EXT. JAMES K. POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

           Ellen and Beverly meet by her locker--

                                 ELLEN
                        So then what?

           Beverly shrugs--

                                 BEVERLY
                        She put the song on a tape for me.

                                 ELLEN
                        Holy crap!  I can’t believe you’re 
                        friends with like the most bad-ass girl 
                        in school.  No one will mess with us now.

           On cue--

           Donny and Steven roll up.  They all hold their noses as 
           they approach the locker next to Beverly’s.  Beverly and 
           Ellen instinctively drop their heads like puppies before 
           the alpha male--

           And then Nicky arrives--

                                 NICKY
                        Hey.

           Nicky looks at Beverly - looks at Donny and Steven - 
           still holding their noses.

                                 NICKY
                        Do I smell?

           She smells her pits - makes a disgusted face.
                                 NICKY
                        Oh my god, my B.O. smells like sausage.  
                        I guess that’s what happens when you 
                        don’t shower for like a week.  
                                 (to Beverly and Ellen)
                        You guys wanna come over after school?

           INT. NICKY’S ROOM

           The music blasting.  Nicky puts the finishing touches on 
           Beverly - dark black eyeliner.  The record ends--

                                 NICKY
                        Don’t move.

           Nicky flips the record.  The hum and scratch begins.  
           Ellen comes in dressed all in black - heavy make-up and 
           hair-sprayed hair.

           The music kicks in again--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Can I move yet?

                                 NICKY
                        No!

           Nicky goes back to Beverly’s make-up.

                                 NICKY
                        Don’t blink.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I have to.

           Ellen touches her hair--

                                 ELLEN
                        I can’t move my hair.

                                 NICKY
                        Okay, finished.

           IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR - LATER

           Beverly, Ellen and Nicky.  All dressed in Nicky’s clothes 
           and in Nicky’s style.  All black, dark make-up, wild 
           hair.  On Beverly the clothes are a little too tight.  On 
           Ellen a little too baggy.
                                 ELLEN
                        We look so bad-ass

           EXT. NICKY’S GARAGE - DAY 

           Ellen sits behind the drum kit with Beverly on guitar and 
           Nicky on bass.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Are you sure we won’t get in trouble?

                                 NICKY
                        Don’t worry.  My brother’s at work.  His 
                        band doesn’t even practice today. 

           Nicky puts her finger on the boombox.

                                 NICKY
                        You ready?

           The other two nod.  Nicky presses play--

           Bikini Kill’s “Carnival” blasts from the speakers.  The 
           girls pretend to play along...

           INT. THE NORTHTOWN MALL - DAY

           A Saturday at the mall.  Crowded with kids, parents, 
           eaters, shoppers, wanderers - the works.

           Gail and Beverly make their way through the crowds 
           towards--

           SEARS

           Gail holds up a yellow sweater - exactly like the blue 
           one that Beverly has on and a perfect, though smaller, 
           version of the red one Gail is wearing.

                                 GAIL
                        This is nice.

                                 BEVERLY
                        It’s just like the one I have on.

                                 GAIL
                        No, it’s not.  This one is yellow.

           Beverly moves down the endless rows of clothes - looking 
           totally uninterested.  Gail picks out another shirt--
                                 GAIL
                        This is pretty.

           Beverly’s not so sure...

           INT. MALL - PRETZEL PALACE

           Gail and Beverly are busy people watching while munching 
           pretzels.

                                 GAIL
                        We could try JC Penny’s next.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Do you think we could go to a new store 
                        instead?

           HOT TOPIC

           Gail follows Beverly into the land of black clothing and 
           fishnets.  The GOTHS, the MALL PUNKS and NEO-RAVERS 
           barely manage a sneer of acknowledgement.

           A stranger in a strange land.

           She catches the eye of ANOTHER PARENTAL FIGURE and they 
           share a quick desperate “How did we end up here?” look.

           Beverly picks up a black shirt with a skull and 
           crossbones on it.  Gail grimaces.

           Beverly picks up a dog collar with spikes on it - fastens 
           it around her neck.  Gail is about to say something - but 
           Beverly quickly puts it down.

           She stops in front of a row of shirts.  All of them 
           black.  Beverly grabs a black shirt with a fish skeleton 
           on it and writing that says, “Spawn ‘til you Die’.

           Beverly holds it up for Gail.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Can I get this one?

                                 GAIL
                        “Spawn ‘til you die.”

           Gail’s face says it all - absolutely not.
           INT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The front door SLAMS.  Beverly stomps through the living 
           room.  Gail walks behind her, carrying a JC Penny’s bag.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I can’t do anything I want!

                                 GAIL
                        You can do lots of things.  But wearing a 
                        t-shirt about sex is not one of them.  

           Gail pulls out the yellow sweater, holds it up and 
           admires it.  

                                 GAIL
                        I don’t see what’s so wrong with this 
                        sweater.  It’s nice.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I don’t wanna wear a stupid sweater.  I 
                        wanna dress cool

                                 GAIL
                        I think sweaters are very cool.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I hate sweaters!  I hate yellow!

           Gail puts the sweater back in the bag - holds the bag out 
           to Beverly.

                                 GAIL
                        Well, as long as you are living in my 
                        house and I’m paying for your clothes, 
                        you’ll wear yellow sweaters.  You look 
                        very pretty in it.

           Beverly takes the bag - still fuming--

                                 BEVERLY
                        GAWD!  It’s like living in a prison.

                                 GAIL
                        Tuna Helper or Sloppy Joes?

                                 BEVERLY
                        It’s not fair!

           Grandma heads toward the kitchen.
                                 GAIL
                        Tuna Helper it is.

           KITCHEN 

           Grandma dumps a small box of Tuna Helper mix into a pot.  
           Beverly bursts into the kitchen, still not ready to give 
           up--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Nicky’s parents let her wear anything she 
                        wants.  

                                 GAIL
                        Hand me the tuna.

           Beverly opens a cupboard - pulls out a can of tuna fish.

                                 BEVERLY
                        She said in 3rd grade her parents let her 
                        wear her vampire costume from Halloween 
                        everyday for a year.  

                                 GAIL
                        If you’d like to wear your Hermione 
                        costume from a few years ago you can go 
                        right ahead. All of those Harry Potter 
                        characters wear very nice sweaters.

                                 BEVERLY
                        It’s not funny grandma!

                                 GAIL
                        I’m sorry, Beverly, but I’m not letting 
                        my daughter dress like a vampire or a 
                        punk or a “gothic”.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I’m not your daughter.  

           For the first time Grandma looks up from her pot of tuna 
           helper.

                                 GAIL
                        What?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I’m not your daughter.  You called me 
                        your daughter.

           Grandma looks back down.  
                                 GAIL
                        Well, you’re acting just like her.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I wouldn’t know.  You threw away all her 
                        stuff and anytime I try to ask about her 
                        you run out the room and cry.

           Gail stops stirring - doesn’t move for a long painful 
           beat.  Beverly’s gone too far and she knows it. 

                                 BEVERLY
                        I’m sor--

                                 GAIL
                                 (quietly)
                        Set the table.  We’re almost ready to 
                        eat.

           DINNER TABLE - LATER

           Beverly sits at the table.  Grandma scoops out a pile of 
           tuna helper and drops it on her plate, then puts a scoop 
           on her own plate and sits down.

           Silence.  Grandma stares down at her plate.  Beverly 
           takes a little bite.

                                 BEVERLY
                        It’s good.

           Grandma stands up.

                                 GAIL
                        Clean up when you’re done.

           And she heads up the stairs, the tears already coming.  
           Beverly sits at the table looking miserable with her 
           steaming heap of tuna helper in front of her.

           INT. BEVERLY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Beverly sits wide-eyed in bed with the muted sounds of 
           Grandma sobbing in another room...

           ROOM - MORNING

           THUD!
           Beverly springs up from bed.  Gail stands in the middle 
           of her room with the box at her feet.

                                 GAIL
                        You want to know about your parents?  
                        Here you go.  Everything they left is in 
                        this little box.

           Gail goes to leave--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Grandma?

                                 GAIL
                        Hm?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I’m sorry.

           Gail closes the door without responding, leaving Beverly 
           with a treasure trove of clues.

           LATER

           Nicky draws a tattoo heart on Ellen’s arm.  Ellen pulls a 
           Nirvana shirt out of the box and Nicky grabs it from her.

                                 NICKY
                        Your parents were so fucking cool!  The 
                        only band T-shirt my dad has is Lynyrd 
                        Skynyrd

           Ellen pulls out some pictures--

                                 ELLEN
                        Your dad was so cute.  And your mom was 
                        so pretty.

           Beverly, wearing the infamous yellow sweater, flips 
           through a journal full of pictures cut out from 
           magazines, drawings, writings--

                                 BEVERLY
                        I know.  I don’t know what happened to 
                        me.

           Flips to a page with a pressed flower.  Another page with 
           a concert ticket.

           Ellen pulls out a can of creamed corn--
                                 ELLEN
                        Why would your parents have creamed corn?

           Beverly shrugs--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Creamed corn’s good.

           Ellen keeps digging through the box. Nicky keeps drawing 
           the tattoo and Beverly-- 

                                 BEVERLY
                        I found it!

                                 ELLEN
                        What?

                                 NICKY
                        Dude, you messed up my tattoo.

                                 BEVERLY
                        The song.  I know what the song is!

           Beverly pulls out her song list--

                                 BEVERLY
                                 (reading)
                        “The song that always reminds me of our 
                        first date at Riverfront Park”.  It’s in 
                        here!  “April 17th - first date with 
                        Zach. Smoked out and listened to Ichycoo 
                        Park.  We kissed and ran around like a 
                        couple of dorks.  I know it’s lame and I 
                        kind of hate myself for saying it, but I 
                        think I’m actually in love.”

                                 ELLEN
                        Itchycoo Park?  What kind of song is 
                        that?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Dunno.  We’ll find out when we listen to 
                        it.

                                 NICKY
                        We can do more than that.  You wanna know 
                        about your parents, right? 

           Nicky pulls a pair of hipster sunglasses out of the box--

                                 NICKY
                        You have to live like they lived.
                                 ELLEN
                        Eat the creamed corn?

                                 NICKY
                        Yeah, eat the creamed corn.  No, you 
                        guys!  We get this song.  We get some 
                        pot.  And we go to the park.  Just like 
                        Bev’s parents did.

           Beverly and Ellen look less than enthused--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Where would we get pot?

                                 NICKY
                        Easy.  I grow it in my closet.

                                 ELLEN
                        Are you serious?

                                 NICKY
                        No, I’m kidding.  
                                 (beat)
                        My brother grows it in his closet.  We 
                        just have to ask him.

           SMOKER’S CORNER

           Nicky, wearing Beverly’s mom’s Nirvana shirt, takes one 
           last puff and throws her cigarette to the ground.  Ellen 
           puts Beverly’s mom’s sunglasses on-- 

           Beverly walks up - a girl on a mission.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Ready?

                                 NICKY AND ELLEN
                        Ready.

           INT. PIZZA COURT - DAY

           The three girls walk in nervously.   It’s a generic take-
           out pizza place with one booth at the front. 

                                 ELLEN
                        It’s like 110 degrees in here.

           She wipes some sweat from her head--
                                 NICKY
                        You guys got your money?

           Ellen and Beverly hand over a wad of cash.

                                 NICKY
                        Okay, I’ll be right back.

           Nicky disappears into the kitchen leaving a nervous Ellen 
           and Beverly behind.

                                 ELLEN
                        I feel like we’re in a TV show.

           A beat.

                                 ELLEN
                        If this were Cops they’d be waiting just 
                        outside and then as soon as the money is 
                        exchanged they’d bust in ‘cause that’s 
                        when you’re officially guilty.  As soon 
                        as the money changes hands.

           A beat.  Ellen and Beverly look at each other.  Then they 
           both look out the window to see if anyone is standing 
           outside.

           Nobody.

                                 NICKY (O.S.)
                        Why do you always have to be such an 
                        asshole?  Screw you, Kyle!

           Nicky comes marching out of the kitchen--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Did you get it?

                                 NICKY
                        No.  He wants you to ask.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Me?

           Nicky hands her the money--

                                 NICKY
                        It’s fine.  Just make sure you say, “No 
                        stems, no seeds.”  

           She pushes Beverly towards the back room.  She looks back 
           at them like, “Please save me...”
                                 NICKY
                        No stems, no seeds.

           BACKROOM

           A GROUP OF SWEATY BOYS sit on buckets in their pizza 
           uniforms.  “Straight out of Compton” is blasting from a 
           stereo--  

           Beverly timidly steps into their midst--

                                 KYLE
                        You want something?

                                 BEVERLY
                                 (barely audible)
                        I want to buy some pot.

                                 KYLE
                        I’m sorry, I can’t hear you.  Can you 
                        speak up a little?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I’d like some pot please.

                                 KYLE
                        No problem.  Tim, get this girl some pot.

           Tim, a mohawked sycophant, grabs a pot out of the sink 
           and hands it to Beverly.  Everyone laughs like it’s the 
           funniest thing they’ve ever seen.

           Beverly stands there with the pot for a second--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Um...

                                 KYLE
                        You need something else?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Um, yeah.  I’d like to buy some, um, 
                        marijuana.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh!  That’s what you meant by pot!

           All the guys snicker at each other.

                                 KYLE
                        Well, what are you willing to give us for 
                        the marijuana?
           Beverly holds out the wad of cash.

                                 KYLE
                        I’m afraid that’s the man’s currency 
                        there.  You’re in Pizza Court land now - 
                        we don’t accept the man’s currency here.

           Beverly thinks about it--

                                 BEVERLY
                        What do you accept?

                                 KYLE
                        How about you tell us one of your 
                        fantasies.

           Beverly looks around at all the snickering faces-

                                 BEVERLY
                        My fantasy?

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, tell us something really filthy and 
                        I might let you have some pot.

           Beverly thinks, really thinks about it - and then she 
           remembers.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        Sometimes when I see a big bowl of 
                        pudding I wanna put my face in it.

                                 TIM
                        You too?!  Do you ever wanna just take 
                        off your pants and sit in a cake?  
                        Sometimes when I see a big cake with lots 
                        of frosting I just wanna sit in it.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yeah! Totally!  Once after Thanksgiving I 
                        took the old gravy out of the 
                        refrigerator and it was all jiggly and I 
                        wanted to put my feet in it so bad and I 
                        almost did, but then my Grandma came in 
                        and yelled at me and--

                                 KYLE
                        Okay!  Okay...what did I tell you Tim?

                                 TIM
                        What?
                                 KYLE
                        I told you can’t make friends with 
                        everyone, man.  These are the streets, 
                        dog.  Geeze.  

           Tim shrugs--

                                 KYLE
                        Where’s your money?

           Beverly holds up the wad of cash.  Kyle goes and grabs 
           the biggest bag of pot we’ve ever seen - a quarter of a 
           pound at least.  

                                 BEVERLY
                                 (barely audible)
                        No stems no seeds.

                                 KYLE
                        What?

                                 BEVERLY
                        No stems no seeds.

           Kyle rips the money out of her hand.

                                 KYLE
                        Just be happy I’m giving you anything.

           Kyle turns and gives Tim a dirty look.  

                                 TIM
                        What?  I’m sorry, man.  I couldn’t help 
                        it.  

           EXT. RIVERFRONT PARK - DAY

           At the edge of the park a large rusted sign that reads:

           “World Expo 1974: Spokane, Washington”

           Around the park are the rusted Expo leftovers.  An 
           ancient looking merry-go-round.  A huge pavilion.  
           Gondola’s gliding over the Spokane river.  Huge metal 
           sculpture butterflies.

           And another leftover--

           THE GIANT RED WAGON

           The handle is a slide.  Underneath are monkey bars.  In 
           the back is a ladder leading up into the wagon--
           INSIDE

           Ellen finishes rolling the biggest, messiest looking 
           joint we’ve ever seen.

                                 BEVERLY
                        How do you know how to do that?

                                 ELLEN
                        Wikipedia.

           She hands it out to Beverly--

                                 BEVERLY
                        You rolled it.  You should go first.

                                 NICKY
                        Yeah, but this is for your parents.  You 
                        should go first.

           Ellen nods.  Beverly takes the joint.

                                 BEVERLY
                        What do I do?

           Ellen takes out a paper from her backpack--

                                 ELLEN
                        I printed out directions.
                                 (reading)
                        “Light the joint.  Inhale and hold.  Then 
                        slowly exhale the marijuana smoke.”

           Beverly takes the joint and carefully obeys the 
           instructions.  She lights it.  She sucks on it.  She 
           holds the smoke in--

           Ellen and Nicky watch as Beverly holds it and holds it.  
           And then Beverly lets it out - coughing, hacking, and 
           gagging.

                                 NICKY
                        How was it?

           Still coughing - Beverly gives a “thumbs up.”

                                                                 CUT TO:

           LATER

           A finger presses play on the boom-box.  “Itchycoo Park” 
           starts to play. Beverly hands the joint to Nicky.  
           Nicky takes a drag and then passes it to Ellen.  Ellen 
           takes a drag--

                                 BEVERLY
                        I like this song.  It’s happy.

           The music carries over to--

           DOWN THE SLIDE

           Comes Beverly followed by Nicky and then Ellen.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           UNDERNEATH THE WAGON

           All three girls hang from the monkey bars upside down, 
           laughing and laughing and laughing--

           As the music carries over to--

           UPSIDE DOWN VIEW

           Of Beverly’s parents.  

           A blanket laid out.  A boom-box next to them.  The couple 
           plays hacky-sack.  Beverly’s Mom is awful.  Every time 
           the hacky-sack comes to her she flails her leg awkwardly.  
           She tries again, falls forward into Beverly’s dad.  He 
           catches her in his arms and they look at each other 
           shyly.  She pulls away, picks up the hacky-sack--

           BACK ON BEVERLY

           Smiling, still hanging upside down...

           INSIDE THE WAGON

           The girls lay on their backs looking up at the sky--

           BEVERLY’S POV: A cloud in the shape of a heart.  She 
           holds her parents picture up against the heart...

                                 BEVERLY 
                        Do you think my parents would have liked 
                        me?

                                 ELLEN
                        All parents like their kids.  They can’t 
                        help it. 
                                 NICKY
                        Not mine.

                                 BEVERLY
                        No.  I mean if I wasn’t their kid.  If 
                        they just met me.

           Nicky takes the picture and looks at it--

                                 NICKY
                        Probably not.  They look too cool for 
                        you.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Do you think they can see me?  I mean, 
                        from wherever they are?

                                 NICKY
                        I saw this show where this dude talks to 
                        people’s dead relatives.  But only if 
                        their name starts with the right letter.  
                        What were your parents names?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Zach and Erica.

                                 NICKY
                        Hmmm...he doesn’t usually do Z and E.  He 
                        does like M and A and stuff like that.

           Another beat while they stare at the sky.

                                 BEVERLY
                                 (rambling in a stoned way)
                        It’s weird because I never really knew 
                        them.  But I feel like I know them.  But 
                        not in any way I can explain, you know?

                                 NICKY
                        Um, what?

                                 BEVERLY
                        And then I feel so close to them.  But 
                        they’re not here.  I mean they’re dead.  
                        But maybe they’re looking down at me 
                        right now, right?  I mean, maybe they’re 
                        protecting me and watching me.  

                                 NICKY
                        Like ghosts?
                                 BEVERLY
                        No.  Like...like...guardian angels or 
                        something.

           Ellen’s been laying there silently with her eyes closed 
           the entire time.  Suddenly they fly open--

                                 ELLEN
                        The Fighting Mullets.

                                 NICKY
                        What?

                                 ELLEN
                        Our school mascot should be the Fighting 
                        Mullets.

           A beat.

                                 BEVERLY
                        That is freaking rad!

                                 NICKY
                        That is way more bad-ass than a stupid 
                        spotted owl or wildcat.

                                 ELLEN
                        We’ll make buttons and posters.

                                 NICKY
                        I could draw it.

                                 BEVERLY
                        How did you even think of that?

                                 ELLEN
                        I just closed my eyes and I pictured 
                        James Polk and his amazing Presidential 
                        mullet.

                                 BEVERLY
                        That is so rad.

           From below them--

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        This is the police!  Stay where you are!

           The three girls sit up--

           Then Kyle climbs up the slide and into the wagon--
                                 NICKY
                        Why do you have to be such a dick all the 
                        time?

                                 KYLE
                        Same reason you have to be ugly all the 
                        time - I was just born that way.

           His Pizza buddies follow him into the wagon--

                                 KYLE
                        So how was that weed we sold you guys?

                                 NICKY
                        Fine, I guess.  It was a little schwaggy 
                        though.

           Kyle and the pizza crew laugh.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh yeah?  You guys get pretty high?

                                 ELLEN
                                 (best stoner voice)
                        Yeah.  We got stoned out of our freakin’ 
                        minds.

           They all laugh again.

                                 KYLE
                        Really?  

           He snatches the bag of pot from them.  He opens it and 
           smells it--

                                 KYLE
                        That’s really weird ‘cause what I sold 
                        you wasn’t pot.  It was oregano.

           Now the pizza crew is really laughing.  

                                 PIZZA GUY
                        You guys should really be careful.  
                        Oregano is a gateway drug.  Next thing 
                        you know you’ll be free-basing nutmeg.

                                 NICKY
                        You’re such a dick, Kyle!

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, but not dick enough to sell pot to 
                        my little sister. 
           The crew starts sliding back down the slide--

                                 KYLE
                        Later, losers.

           And he slides down the slide too, leaving the girls alone 
           in the wagon.

           EXT. PARK - SUNSET

           The girls are walking out of the park as the sun goes 
           down--

                                 ELLEN
                        It really felt like we were high. Do you 
                        think you can get high from oregano?

                                 NICKY
                        I don’t think so.

                                 ELLEN
                        I was definitely high.

                                 NICKY
                        You’re always high.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I think we were just happy.

           The girls keep walking as the sun slips down the hills 
           behind them leaving an explosion of sunset colors...

           INT. BEVERLY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Beverly opens the journal with the list of things about 
           her parents - below “allergic to kittens” she writes--

           Pot in the park

           Then she thinks about it - scribbles it out and writes--

           Happy in the park

           INT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Empty. Silent.

           Gail folds laundry.
           THE STAIRS

           UP with a basket of laundry to

           BEVERLY’S ROOM

           All of Beverly’s parents’ things are laid out and 
           organized.  Clothes in one pile.  Band posters in 
           another.  Pictures in another pile.  There’s one pile 
           that’s just the empty pack of cigarettes and the can of 
           creamed corn.  

           Gail picks up a shirt.  A picture.  

           Then she sees the song list on Beverly’s dresser.  The 
           songs Beverly’s found are highlighted - well over half 
           the songs now.  

           Gail passes over the next song to be found...

           “Love is a Noose - Toboggan Accident”

           She frowns.  Then she notices the last song on the list.

                                 GAIL 
                        Parental unit’s happy song.

           DOWNSTAIRS

           The door opens - voices--

           Gail

           Sets the laundry basket down, puts the list back on the 
           dresser--

           DOWNSTAIRS

           Beverly, Nicky and Ellen - arms full of papers, boxes--

                                 GAIL
                        What’s all this?

           The three girls look up at Gail guiltily - they’re up to 
           something.

                                 BEVERLY
                        School project.
                                 GAIL
                        Oh.  Good.

                                 BEVERLY
                        We’re going to work on it in the 
                        basement.

                                 GAIL
                        I’ll make some snacks.

                                 BEVERLY
                        No thanks, Grandma.  We just ate at 
                        Ellen’s.

           The girls continue to the basement--

                                 GAIL
                        Oh.  Okay.

           BASEMENT

           Nicky puts the finishing touches on a poster - she holds 
           it up--

                                 NICKY
                        What do you guys think?

           A picture of a mullet - with two fists raised like a 
           boxer ready to spar with some invisible foe.

           Above the drawing she has written “James K. Polk Junior 
           High” and below “The Fighting Mullets.”

                                 BEVERLY
                        Rad.

                                 ELLEN
                        Totally rad.

           Ellen presses a button on a button maker.

                                 ELLEN
                        Do you think 100 buttons are enough?

           INT. JAMES K. POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAYS

           Close on a Fighting Mullets button--

           We PULL OUT--
           Just about every student in sight has one of the buttons 
           on--

           BEVERLY, ELLEN AND NICKY

           Walk down the hall - people say “Hi,” complimenting them 
           on the buttons--

                                 NICKY
                        I think we’re going to need more buttons.

           They finally walk by a “Fighting Mullets” poster on the 
           wall in between a “Spotted Owl” poster and a “Wildcat” 
           poster.

           INT. ELLEN’S ROOM - DAY

           Ellen at her computer.  Beverly sits behind her--

                                 ELLEN
                        Found it.  “Love is a Noose” by Toboggan 
                        Accident.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Sweet!

           She highlights the song on the song listing.

           ON THE COMPUTER

           A picture of the LEAD SINGER appears--

                                 BEVERLY
                        I’ve seen that guy!

           Beverly digs through her bag - pulls out her mom’s 
           journal.  Flips through it until she gets to a picture of 
           her mom and the Lead Singer.  She holds it up against the 
           computer.  He’s older, but it’s definitely him.

                                 ELLEN
                        He still has the same haircut.

                                 BEVERLY
                        What else does it say about the band?

           Ellen types--

                                 ELLEN
                        Ummm...they broke up.  It’s called “The 
                        Wes Kelly Band.”
           A beat.

                                 ELLEN
                        They’re actually playing in Olympia in 
                        like a week at some place called...The 
                        Voyeur.

                                 BEVERLY
                        We have to go.  I mean, he knew my mom.   
                        We have to go.  

                                 ELLEN
                        I don’t think our parents are going to 
                        drive all the way to Olympia so we can 
                        see a punk band at a bar called The 
                        Voyeur.

           INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

           The three girls walk in--

                                 ANTI
                        Wonderful.  It’s my best customer and 
                        she’s brought another stray with her.  

           Beverly just walks right past him and the other girls 
           follow--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Hi, Anti.

                                 ELLEN
                        Hi, Anti.

                                 NICKY
                        Hi.

                                 ANTI
                        Are you guys forming a street gang now?

           He gives them a quick once-over.

                                 ANTI
                        I suppose you’ve come with another 
                        esoteric music request that only I can 
                        fulfill.  Should I carve it into stone 
                        for you - or have you finally entered the 
                        20th century?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I wanted to ask you something.
                                 ANTI
                        Well, I’m your slave aren’t I?  Here to 
                        serve your every need.  So go ahead, 
                        please.  This should be great.

                                 BEVERLY 
                        Do you know the Wes Kelly Band?

                                 ANTI
                        Maybe.  Why?

                                 BEVERLY
                        We need a ride to their show in Olympia 
                        on Saturday.

                                 ANTI
                        Ha.

                                 ELLEN
                        Please.

                                 ANTI
                        Ha.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Is that a yes?

                                 ANTI
                        Ha.

                                 NICKY
                        I don’t think he’s going to do it.  

                                 ANTI
                        I like your friend.  She’s very smart.  
                        Very quick.

           The girls spread out.

                                 ANTI
                        What?  What are you doing?  This is 
                        supposed to be the part where you go 
                        outside and cry. 

           They start going through the records - each in a 
           different section.

                                 ANTI
                        What is this?  What are you doing?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Just looking.
                                 ANTI
                        Just looking?  That’s what we have 
                        windows for.  When you come inside, the 
                        object is to buy something.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Maybe I will.

           Anti eyes them suspiciously.

           A HIP CUSTOMER comes in.  Beverly turns and looks at 
           Anti.  Their eyes narrow like two boxers going head to 
           head...

           Then Beverly turns and nods to Nicky.  Nicky nods back--

                                 NICKY
                        Oh my god!  Here’s that Britney Spears 
                        album!  Oh my god!

           Ellen and Beverly run to her side screaming.  The Hip 
           Customer freezes - grimaces - and then heads for the 
           door.

           The three girls look innocently at Anti.

                                 ANTI
                        I don’t even carry Britney Spears in this 
                        store.

                                 NICKY
                        Oh, you’re right.  This is Slayer.  My 
                        bad.

                                 ANTI
                        You dare try to hustle me in my own 
                        store?

           The girls spread out again--

                                 BEVERLY
                        What do you mean?

                                 ANTI
                        Out.  All of you out before I call the 
                        police.

                                 BEVERLY
                        For looking for a Britney Spears album?

                                 NICKY
                        Gee, I wonder who’s side they’ll take 
                        when they get here?
           ANOTHER HIPSTER enters--

           The two gunfighters meet eyes - neither even blinks.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Have you found it yet, Ellen?

                                 ELLEN
                        Oh my god - here’s that Jessica Simpson 
                        album!!

           The three girls run over screaming--

                                 NICKY
                        Oh my god, Jessica Simpson!

           The HIPSTER just stares in shock--

                                 BEVERLY
                                 (to the Hipster)
                        We can’t help it.  We never got a chance 
                        to be exposed to any other kind of music.

           The guy walks out--

                                 ANTI
                        I thought teenage girls were supposed to 
                        be sweet.

           The girls just stare back - as sweet as they can.

                                 BEVERLY
                        It’s important, Anti.  Please?

           Defeated.

                        What time should I pick you ladies up?

           EXT. ELLEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A window opens.  A figure climbs out the window followed 
           by another and then another.  Three silhouettes run 
           across the yard and down the street...

           ANTI’S CAR

           Parked under a street lamp.  Anti leans against it in the 
           coolest pose he can muster--

           THE CAR
           Looks like it’s been pieced together from three other 
           slightly less crappy cars.  

                                 ANTI
                        All teeny-boppers in the backseat.

           INT. ANTI’S CAR - NIGHT

           While the outside looks like recycled garbage - the 
           inside, specifically the stereo, looks like something 
           from a sci-fi movie.  The stereo itself is probably worth 
           10 times the price of the car.  

                                 ELLEN
                        Are you aware that this middle seatbelt 
                        is broken?

           Anti turns up his stereo - lights flicker, speakers 
           pound.

                                 NICKY
                        Are you aware that your car smells like 
                        mushrooms?

           Anti turns up the stereo even more - drowning out the 
           girls...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           CAR - LATER

           The highway scenery zooms by.  An album ends.  Anti 
           starts looking for a new song on his stereo.  

                                 NICKY
                        How about one of Bev’s songs now?

                                 ANTI
                        Sorry, children.  This car does not come 
                        with a tape player.

                                 ELLEN
                        I have some of them on my ipod.  

           Begrudgingly--

                                 ANTI
                        Okay, what song?

                                 ELLEN
                        Just play the album marked Bev.
           A song begins: something melancholy and beautiful and 
           it’s like the entire world is moving to the beat of the 
           song--

           The street lights pass overhead to the beat of the drums--

           Nicky moving her hand out the window against the wind 
           seems to move to the sound of the guitars--

           A couple in a car passing by seem to be singing the 
           lyrics to one another--

           As the song reaches its climax, Ellen yawns widely along 
           with the roar of the song.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           LATER - STILL IN THE CAR

           Now it’s a fast paced song - something bursting with 
           energy.  Everyone sings along as loud and as happy as 
           they can - even Anti...

           And then Beverly IMAGINES:

           It’s her parents in the front seat singing along.  They 
           smile back at her.  Mom plays air guitar while her Dad 
           drums on the steering wheel.

           Beverly returns to REALITY:

           She’s beaming and Nicky is screaming the lyrics at the 
           top of her lungs, with Ellen convulsing with laughter and 
           Anti cranking up the volume...

           EXT. THE VOYEUR - NIGHT

           The roar of guitar feedback inside--

           The girls follow Anti through a smattering of hipsters 
           and rockers smoking and talking outside the club.

                                 BEVERLY
                                 (nervously, to Nicky)
                        Is this your first concert?

                                 NICKY
                        No.

                                 BEVERLY
                        It’s mine.
                                 NICKY
                        Yeah, I know.

           Anti walks up to the doorman--

                                 ANTI
                        Tommmy!

           TOMMY is an old-time rocker.  He hasn’t been sober since 
           the nineties and his appearance reflects it--

                                 TOMMY
                        Holy shit!  Anti?  I haven’t seen you in, 
                        like, five years.

                                 ANTI
                        Try fifteen.

                                 TOMMY
                        What the fuck, man?

                                 ANTI 
                        Yeah.  I’ve been out of the scene.  
                        Cleaned up, all that.

                                 TOMMMY
                        Geeze, man.  I’m sorry.  That’s too bad.
                                 (looking at the girls)
                        Are those yours, dude?

                                 ANTI
                        Yeah.  These are my triplets.  Keep an 
                        eye on them for me, will you?

                                 TOMMY
                        Yeah, of course.  Enjoy the show, man.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Anti!

                                 ANTI
                        Yes, dearest daughter.

                                 BEVERLY
                        You can’t just leave us here.

                                 ANTI
                        You wanted a ride.  So here you are.  Now 
                        I’m going to go enjoy myself.

           The first chords of some song begin and people start 
           filing inside.  
           Cigarettes are flung, conversations dropped in mid-
           sentence - and within a minute the girls are the only 
           ones still outside.  

           Tommy looks at the girls.  

                                 TOMMY
                        So you dudes are sisters?

                                 NICKY
                        Uh, yeah, genius, us dudes are sisters.

           LATER

           The music blasts from the building.  The walls thump, the 
           windows shake.  The three girls sit by the front door.

                                 ELLEN
                        If you put your face against the wall and 
                        put your palms out like this--
                                 (she demonstrates)
                        It’s almost like you’re inside.

           Nicky rolls her eyes--

                                 NICKY
                        Fuck this.
                                 (to Tommy)
                        Don’t be a drag, dude.  Just let us in.  

                                 TOMMY
                        I can’t...

                                 NICKY
                        Come on, just for a second.  We’ll just 
                        stand inside the door.

           He’s giving in--

                                 ALL THREE GIRLS
                        Pleeeeaaaaase?

                                 TOMMY
                        Alright, fine.  But just for a second.

           Tommy takes a quick look around - the coast is clear.  He 
           opens the door and ushers the girls inside, shutting the 
           door behind them.

           He counts to three in his head and opens the door again.

                                 TOMMY
                        Okay, second’s up--
           But the girls are no longer there.

           INT. CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           The girls navigate their way through the bodies to the 
           front of the stage.  The music blares on - a deafening 
           onslaught of white noise.  Finally they get close enough 
           so they can actually see the band.  

           The band hammers on their instruments indiscriminately.  
           The singer lurches across the stage, screaming into the 
           mic.  At one point it comes unplugged, but he just keeps 
           screaming.  He trips over a case of beer at the edge of 
           the stage. 

           The girls glance at each other - Is this music?

           Suddenly the band stops, but it’s unclear if it’s the end 
           of the song or a mistake.

                                 SINGER 
                                 (to audience)
                        Fuck you.  Fuck you very much.

           Then the noise starts up again.  Nicky turns to Beverly.

                                 NICKY
                        Is that the guy?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I hope not.

           EXT. PARKING LOT BEHIND CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           The area is deserted except for the band’s van.  The 
           girls stake out the back entrance, hoping to spot the 
           singer.

           The door opens revealing a couple of guys from the band 
           carry an amp.  Neither of them are the singer.  The three 
           girls approach them.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Hey, uh, hey...

           They start loading their stuff into the van - totally 
           unaware of Beverly-

                                 NICKY
                        Hey!
           The band members both look up at once.

                                 DRUMMER
                        Sorry girls.  You’re a little young for 
                        me.

                                 NICKY
                        Wow.  That was gross.  Actually we’re 
                        looking for the singer.

                                 BASSIST
                        Yeah, they usually are.  

           Pounds on the side of the van.  The Lead Singer’s angry 
           voice from inside--

                                 WES (O.S.)
                        What!?

                                 BASSIST
                        Some girls to see you.

           The side door to the van slides open.  Bassist motions 
           inside--

                                 BASSIST
                        Well, ladies - this is where the magic 
                        happens.

           The three girls look at the open door warily.

           INT. THE VAN - CONTINUOUS

           The girls peak in--

           One of those extra big vans with multiple rows of seats.  
           Wes is in the very back--

                                 WES
                        It’s okay.  Don’t be shy.  Party’s back 
                        here, ladies.  Come in, let me get a look 
                        at you.

           The girls climb in.

                                 WES
                        You. The Asian one.  Come here.

           Ellen looks at Nicky--

                                 ELLEN
                        Um...
                                 NICKY
                        Listen, dude.  We’re not here to bob your 
                        knob or anything.  My friend has a 
                        picture of you she wants you to look at.

           Beverly holds out the picture.  Wes climbs over the 
           middle seat, flips on the dome light and takes the 
           picture.

                                 BEVERLY
                        You were in that band, Toboggan Accident.  
                        I have one of your songs.  It’s really 
                        good.

           He takes a drink from his bottle--

           ON THE PICTURE

           He’s young, happy and he’s got a beautiful girl by his 
           side.  The sudden wave of fragmentary memories is like a 
           knife being driven into him--

           He tosses the picture back to her.

                                 WES
                        Great. You got a picture of me.  Whoop-di-
                        doo.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        The girl you’re with.  That’s my mom.

                                 WES
                        Whoa.  I’m not your dad, if that’s what 
                        you’re saying.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        No, I was just wondering if you could 
                        tell me about her.  She died.

                                 WES 
                        Whatever.  She was cool.  Blah. Blah 
                        Blah.

                                 BEVERLY
                        What was she like?

                                 WES
                        I said she was cool.  I don’t know.  She 
                        was probably fine.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        Were you friends with her?
           Wes just looks at her - all the bitterness suddenly 
           coming up--

                                 WES
                        You want the truth, kid?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Um...yeah.

                                 WES
                        I fucked her for a while.  But so did 
                        everyone else.  You even know who your 
                        dad is?  

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yes.  Zach Huff. 

           Wes laughs - a bitter, angry, asshole laugh--

                                 WES
                        Zach, fucking, Huff.  Fucking figures.  
                        Little worthless punk trying to pretend 
                        he was a guitarist and whore junky 
                        whatever her name is.  They were both 
                        losers so I guess they naturally ended up 
                        together.  I gotta tell you, that is 
                        quite a pedigree you got there kid.   

           Beverly has started to cry silently--

                                 WES
                        So you gonna buy our CD or what?

                                 NICKY
                        You’re a real butt-dick, you know that?

                                 WES
                        A butt dick?  Is that some new term, ‘cuz 
                        I don’t think I know that one.  

           OUTSIDE THE VAN--

           The girls are climbing out.  Wes calls after them--

                                 WES
                        Okay, have a nice life, kids.  You can 
                        thank me later.  Don’t forget to mention 
                        me in your blog.

                                 ELLEN
                                 (to band members)
                        Your band sucks.
                                 BASSIST
                        Yeah?  Well, so does yours.

           INT. CAR

           Anti sees them trudging toward the car - Beverly already 
           crying.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           THE GIRLS GET IN THE CAR

           Anti looks at them - Beverly is crying silently.  

                                 ANTI
                                 (to Ellen)
                        What’s wrong with her?

           Ellen starts to say something - then she starts crying 
           too--

                                 ANTI
                                 (to Nicky)
                        What are they crying about?

           Nicky starts to cry too--

                                 ANTI
                        Come on - it couldn’t be that bad.  I 
                        know rock stars can be dicks but--

                                 NICKY
                        He called Beverly’s mom a whore.

                                 ANTI
                        He what?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I just want to go home.

           Anti looks out the window where the band is packing up.

                                 ANTI
                        Yeah.  Of course.  But first, you three 
                        wait here for a minute.

           They watch as, out the window, Anti walks over to the 
           band.
           BACK DOOR

                                 WES
                        Best blow job I ever had was in Missoula.  
                        I don’t know what it is about that town.  
                        It’s like the women there don’t do 
                        anything except practice giving head.

           Anti walks up--

                                 WES
                        I told you we don’t want any tamales, 
                        man.  We don’t need anyone else in the 
                        band, we don’t wanna be on your label.

           IN THE CAR

           Nicky hears some commotion coming from the direction of 
           the van and turns to see Anti taking on the entire band 
           in a fist fight.  And he’s winning--

                                 NICKY
                        Holy shit!!

           Ellen and Beverly look over as Anti tosses one of the 
           guys to the ground.

           BACK DOOR

           The DRUMMER comes back out with some of his gear.  He 
           looks at his bandmates lying on the ground.  Then at Anti 
           who raises his fists.  

                                 ANTI
                        What’s it gonna be?

           The Drummer drops his stuff and runs back inside.

           AT THE CAR

           Anti knocks on the window.  Beverly rolls it down.

           Standing before her, in a headlock, is Wes.  Anti 
           tightens his hold-

                                 WES
                                 (in pain)
                        I just wanted to say I’m sorry for what I 
                        said.

           A beat.
           Anti squeezes again--

                                 WES
                                 (rehearsed)
                        I have issues with my own mother.  Who 
                        was a whore and also fat and ugly.  And I 
                        also hate myself and I’m bitter and it 
                        was wrong for me to take it out on you 
                        and I apologize for that.  I’m sorry.

           He looks up at Anti like, “Good enough?”  Anti drops him 
           to the ground.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Anti starts up the car.

                                 NICKY
                        Did you just beat up the entire band?

           Anti puts the car in gear and steps on the gas.  

                                 ANTI
                        Nah, the drummer got away.

           EXT. ELLEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The girls get out of Anti’s car--

                                 ANTI
                                 (to Beverly)
                        Hey, don’t worry about that guy tonight.  
                        The stuff he said-- I mean there’s 
                        nothing worse than an aging rockstar.  
                        They should all be put down at 27 or 
                        something - after that they’re just used 
                        up and angry.

           Beverly tries to smile--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Thanks, Anti.

           Beverly and Ellen walk toward the house, Nicky waits 
           behind--

           When Beverly and Ellen are out of hearing--

                                 NICKY
                        That was pretty cool what you did.
                                 ANTI
                        Well, tell that to my anger management 
                        class on Wednesday.

           Nicky laughs, shyly--

                                 NICKY
                        Alright, later.

                                 ANTI
                        Sweet dreams, cupcake.

           Nicky walks away and Anti, for the first time that night, 
           sincerely and happily smiles.

           ONE BY ONE

           The girls make their way across the yard and hop back 
           into Ellen’s window.

           INT. ELLEN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ellen snores quietly.  Nicky rolls over in her sleep.  
           Only Beverly is awake.  She pulls out the picture of her 
           parents - she can barely see it by the moonlight.  She 
           stares at it - looking for any sign of who they were.  
           Could they really be as awful as he said?

           And then--

           POP!

           Red light spills through the window--

           Beverly jumps up - looks out the window to see the 
           falling red sparks of a bottle rocket.  She opens the 
           window.  

           Nicky wakes up:

                                 NICKY
                        What’s going on?

           As if in answer--

           POP!

           Another shower of sparks float down to earth.

                                 BEVERLY
                        It’s a sign!
                                 NICKY
                        A what?

                                 BEVERLY
                        It’s a sign - I have to find out where 
                        it’s coming from!

           Beverly hops out the window.

           OUTSIDE

           Nicky hops down on the grass.  Ellen pokes her head out 
           the window.

                                 ELLEN
                        You guys - it’s like four o’clock.  We 
                        should be asleep.

                                 NICKY
                        Then go to sleep.

           Beverly and Nicky cross the yard to the street.  Ellen 
           struggles through the window - falling into the grass 
           with a thud.   

                                 ELLEN
                                 (whispering)
                        Hey guys - wait up!

           OVER A FENCE

           And into someone’s yard.  The three girls, in their 
           pajamas, scamper through a silent swing-set and some 
           toddler toys, over the next fence and into--

           THE NEXT YARD

           Like a garden of Eden - a koi pond at the center and 
           around it trees and shrubs beautifully manicured--

           ABOVE

           Another POP! and a burst of color rains down--

                                 NICKY
                        This way!

           The girls run through the topiary--

           ANOTHER YARD
           A cocker-spaniel takes off after them--

                                 ELLEN
                        Oh god, oh god...

           The girls sprint for the fence and just barely make it 
           over - leaving the dog barking wildly behind them--

           YARD WITH A CAR ON BLOCKS

           In the center.  We can hear voices coming from the next 
           yard over:

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        Ah, shut the hell up!

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        You wanna go to jail again?  ‘Cause 
                        that’s exactly what’s gonna happen.  They 
                        warned you once - they ain’t gonna warn 
                        you again.

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        I can do whatever the hell I want in my 
                        own goddamn backyard.

           The girls creep up and put their faces against the cracks 
           in the fence--

           GIRLS’ POV: A MAN in his boxers sets up another bottle 
           rocket with beer in hand.  A WOMAN stands in the doorway 
           in her nightgown smoking a cigarette.

           In Beverly’s eyes they become her parents:

                                 WOMAN
                        I ain’t taking care of your cat when you 
                        go to jail.

           The Man throws an empty beer can at the Woman.  

                                 WOMAN
                        Fuck you.

                                 MAN
                        Well, fuck you too.

           She slams the door closed.  The Man opens another beer 
           and lights a cigarette.  He touches the cigarette to the 
           bottle rocket fuse.

           BEVERLY
           Walks away from the fence...

                                 ELLEN
                        Beverly?  Are you okay?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I thought it was a sign.  

                                 NICKY
                        Maybe it is.

           Ellen shoots Nicky a “shut-up” look.  POP!  Another 
           shower of sparks--

                                 BEVERLY
                        There aren’t any signs.  My parents were 
                        druggies and now they’re dead.  That 
                        mixtape is stupid.  It’s just a bunch of 
                        stupid songs.

                                 ELLEN
                        But--

                                 BEVERLY
                        I’m going home.

           Beverly starts climbing the fence--

                                 NICKY
                        Beverly--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Just leave me alone.

           And she disappears over the fence while another bottle 
           rocket EXPLODES in the sky above.

           EXT. JAMES K. POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

           Rain coming down in buckets--

           INSIDE

           Beverly’s gloomy look perfectly mirrors the weather as 
           she trudges to class--

           DOWN THE HALL
           The PRINCIPAL has a STUDENT stopped.  He looks at the 
           student’s button - it’s one of the “Fighting Mullets” 
           buttons.  The Student turns and points at Beverly.  The 
           Principal looks at her with a disapproving glance.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Ms. Moody, can I speak to you?

                                 BEVERLY
                                 (under her breath)
                        Shitake.

           OUTSIDE THE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE

           Ellen sits nervously in between her Mom and Dad.  Nicky 
           sits alone, largely unconcerned.

           INSIDE THE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE

           Beverly faces the principal, trying her best to look 
           remorseful.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        It’s an insult to one of our finest 
                        former Presidents.  And it’s an insult to 
                        the members of our faculty - our gym 
                        teacher, for example, who wear their hair 
                        in the style of the--
                                 (airquotes)
                        --mullet  I’m sure you wouldn’t want 
                        people making fun of you for your hair 
                        style.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        We weren’t making fun of James K. Polk.  
                        We think he’s really rad.

                                 PRINCIPAL 
                        You know, Beverly, what saddens me most 
                        is you could be putting this energy to 
                        better use.  Towards a future.  Have you 
                        thought about what you want to do with 
                        your life?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I want to be an animal photographer.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Like National Geographic!  Well, that’s a 
                        worthy goal.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
                        But it requires a lot of work.  You need 
                        to know geography and camera techniques 
                        and--

                                 BEVERLY
                        Not like National Geographic.  Like the 
                        calendars where a little kitten gets 
                        dressed up in really cute pink dress and 
                        then a little puppy gets dressed up in a 
                        little tux and they go to baby animal 
                        prom together. And there’s like a baby 
                        chick dating a baby bunny wearing 
                        sunglasses and stuff like that.    

           The Principal looks at her - stumped.  Luckily he’s saved 
           by a knock on the door--

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Uh, come in.

           Gail opens the door slowly.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Oh, hello Mrs. Moody.  Have a seat.
                                 (to Beverly)
                        Would you mind waiting in the office 
                        while I have a talk with your 
                        grandmother?

           INT. GAIL’S CAR - DAY

           The silent drive home.  Finally Beverly can’t take it 
           anymore.

                                 BEVERLY
                        We weren’t making fun of James Polk’s 
                        mullet.  We thought it was awesome.

           Overly calm--

                                 GAIL
                        I don’t care, Beverly Jean Moody.  You 
                        are not seeing those girls anymore.  You 
                        were fine until you started hanging 
                        around those two.  And you’re going back 
                        to wearing sweaters too.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yeah, I was perfectly fine when I had no 
                        friends.  I was perfectly happy and fine!
                                 GAIL
                        I don’t want you going down the same path 
                        as your mother.  I lost her - but I’m not 
                        going to lose you!

                                 BEVERLY
                        What path is that?  Being a druggie and a 
                        whore!?

           Gail pulls the car over - stops.

                                 GAIL
                        What did you say?

           Beverly doesn’t answer.

                                 GAIL
                        Why would you say that?

           Nothing.

                                 GAIL
                        If I ever hear you say something like 
                        that about your mother again...

           Gail angrily puts the car in gear--

           INT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Bacon on the table.  The yellow sweater resting on the 
           back of the chair.  Beverly enters the kitchen--

                                 GAIL
                        Grab your bacon.  You can eat it in the 
                        car.

           INT. GAIL’S CAR - MORNING

           Beverly, in her yellow sweater, looks out the window as--

           ELLEN’S SUV passes by--

           Out the back window Ellen’s little brother waves sadly.  
           Beverly takes a bite of bacon and waves back--

           INT. JAMES K. POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

           Beverly walks down the main hall.  Above her is a sign 
           that says, “Congratulations, James K. Polk Wildcats!!”
           ENGLISH CLASS

           The Teacher reads some too-sad poem while the rain pours 
           down on the window.  Beverly looks back to the corner of 
           the room where Nicky used to sit - the seat is now empty.

           EXT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Garbage day tomorrow.  Beverly drags the garbage can to 
           the curb.

           Ellen rides up on her Huffy--

                                 ELLEN
                        Hey.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Hey.

                                 ELLEN
                        This is like the first time I’ve seen you 
                        out of the house in a while.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yeah.  My Grandma barely even lets me 
                        come to school.

                                 ELLEN
                        Yeah, my parents were mad too.  But then 
                        I triple dog dared my brother to pee in 
                        the sink.  It’s hard for them to focus on 
                        being mad at me when he’s around. 
                                 (beat)
                        Nicky called me.  She says being 
                        suspended is pretty sweet.  She watches 
                        People’s Court like three times a day.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Sounds pretty cool.

                                 ELLEN
                        You should call her.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yeah.

           A beat.  Then Ellen remembers - she pulls out a CD--

                                 ELLEN
                        I found the next song.  There’s only one 
                        left.
           Beverly doesn’t take it--

                                 BEVERLY
                        You should keep it.  I’m kind of done 
                        with that stuff.  

                                 ELLEN
                        But your parents...

           Beverly notices Gail looking out the front window--

                                 BEVERLY
                        I should go.  I’m not supposed to hang 
                        out with you anymore.  

                                 ELLEN
                        My parents said I wasn’t supposed to hang 
                        out with you either - but who cares?

           Beverly starts toward the house--

                                 BEVERLY
                        I should go...

           Ellen watches her go--

           INT. JAMES K. POLK JUNIOR HIGH - BEVERLY’S LOCKER

           Beverly digs through her locker.  Steven rolls up behind 
           her and rams into her with his wheelchair.  

                                 STEVEN
                        Oh, sorry.  Darn these breaks.  

           Steven and Donny keep going down the hall while Beverly 
           rubs her sore leg.  

           INT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Gail sits in front of the TV with a cup of tea.  

           Down below, in the basement, come the usual rumblings and 
           mumblings of Beverly.

           Gail gives a concerned sigh--

           KITCHEN - LATER

           Head down, shoulders hunched -  a sad little girl.
                                 GAIL
                        We’re having waffles for dinner.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I’m not hungry.

           Beverly opens the fridge - takes out some bologna.  She 
           stuffs one slice in her mouth and takes a few more in her 
           hand.

                                 GAIL
                        It’s supposed to clear up tomorrow.  I 
                        thought maybe we could go for a drive.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        I don’t really feel like it.

           She goes to the door, puts her raincoat on and goes 
           outside.  Gail watches

           OUT THE WINDOW

           As Beverly walks through the rain to the fence.  A DOG 
           sticks his nose through the fence and Beverly feeds him 
           the bologna as the rain comes pouring down...

           INT. BEVERLY’S ROOM - MORNING

           The rain has finally let up and the sun is peaking 
           through the curtains.

           Beverly is asleep in the bed.

                                 JUSTIN (O.S.)
                        Beverly!  Hey, Beverly!

           Beverly stirs - goes to the window--

           DOWN AT ELLEN’S

           Justin is on the roof.  Two speakers sit on the window 
           sill--

                                 JUSTIN
                        This is...

           He looks back at Ellen, who is standing at the window.  
           She mouths something--

                                 JUSTIN
                        Lookin’ for the magic.  Dwight Twilley.
           Ellen hits play...the music fills the morning air.  
           There’s something magical about the music filling the 
           morning air.  People come out of their houses to see what-
           the-hell’s going on and can’t help but smile... 

           Ellen smiles, waves at Beverly.  Beverly smiles and waves 
           back.

           CLOSE ON THE SONG LIST

           Beverly highlights the next song, leaving one more - the 
           one marked only as “The Parental Unit’s Song”.

           BEVERLY IN BED

           Headphones on while the mixtape plays.  She holds her 
           parents picture above her - looking for some clue, 
           something in the picture that will unravel the mystery of 
           who they are...

           Then she notices something she’s never noticed before.  A 
           blurry number on the house behind her parents.

           BEVERLY

           Breaks out her junior science kit.  Pulls out the 
           magnifying glass and studies the picture--

           The address is 1072. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           BEVERLY ON THE PHONE

                                 BEVERLY
                        Hey Ellen.  Do you think you could look 
                        up an address for me?

           LIVING ROOM

                                 BEVERLY
                        Hey, Grandma.  Do you think I could do 
                        your mail route with you today.

           Gail smiles - pleasantly surprised--

                                 GAIL
                        Of course. 
           INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY

           Song list in hand, Beverly squints to see the next 
           address.  Gail stops, fills a mailbox with mail.

           She moves up to the next house.  Beverly sees it - 1072.  
           The same house, but now painted a kind of brown.  She’s 
           probably drove by it hundreds of times without realizing.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        Stop!

           Gail pulls over--

           Beverly holds the picture up to the house for comparison.  
           It’s older and more run-down now, but it’s definitely the 
           same house.

           She looks at Gail.  Gail nods slightly, sadly - as if to 
           say, “Go on...”

           EXT. 1072 - DAY

           Ding-dong.

           Beverly waits nervously.  Looks back at Gail in the car.

           The door opens.

           An OLD MAN towing an oxygen tank.  It’s obviously not his 
           fault, but he’s very frightening looking.  Like death 
           itself.

                                 OLD MAN
                        What is it?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I...uh...

           All she can do is hold out the picture.  He takes it--

           Gail’S POV:

           Beverly follows the OLD MAN inside.

           INT. 1072 - DAY

           Crucifixes and religious knickknacks everywhere.  
           Beverly sits down on a couch covered in plastic.  The Old 
           Man sits in the lazy-boy.  He takes off his oxygen mask 
           and lights a cigarette.

           The Old Man sets the picture on the coffee table.

                                 OLD MAN
                        That’s my boy, there.

                                 BEVERLY
                        That’s my dad.

           The Old Man takes a deep drag.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Your grandmother put you up to this?

           Beverly shakes her head, “No.”

                                 OLD MAN
                        I told your father and mother, and I told 
                        your grandmother and now I’ll tell you - 
                        I want nothing to do with you. 

           He breaks into a violent coughing fit.  Beverly looks 
           afraid.

                                 OLD MAN
                        I don’t have any money, if that’s what 
                        you want.

                                 BEVERLY
                        No.  I just saw your house in the picture 
                        and I thought, maybe...does this mean 
                        anything to you?

           She hands him the song list.  He looks at it--

                                 BEVERLY
                        The one called “the Parental Unit’s Happy 
                        Song”?

                                 OLD MAN
                        Don’t mean a thing to me.  I’m sorry, I 
                        just want to be left alone.

           GAIL’S POV:

           Beverly walks quickly back to the car.
           INT. GAIL’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Beverly gets in - visibly shaken.  She stares straight 
           ahead.  Gail reaches out and puts a hand on her shoulder.  
           Beverly flinches slightly.

           Sadly, Gail starts up the car.

           EXT. JAMES K. POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - MORNING

           Beverly puts on her headphones.  Pushes play.  An angry 
           song starts its first beats - as the guitars slam in, the 
           sky unleashes a deluge on cue.

           INT. JAMES K. POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAYS

           The music blares in Beverly’s headphones--

           BEVERLY’S POV:

           Everyone looks pissed off - unhappy and unfriendly.

           LOCKERS

           Headphones off, Beverly walks up to her locker.  Steven 
           and Donny are waiting - but, mercifully, they’re already 
           busy harassing someone else.  

           Beverly digs through her locker when the unthinkable 
           happens.

           Beverly FARTS.  Not a quiet fluff - but a full-on locker-
           shaker of a fart.  Donny and Steven immediately look at 
           Beverly, as if these two needed ammunition to make her 
           life hell--

                                 STEVEN
                        Oh.  My God.

           Beverly’s eyes meet Steven’s.  In an instant she sees 
           what this means: years and years of teasing, never 
           hearing the end of this day.  Steven goes to say 
           something when--

           Bam!

           Beverly punches him in the face, knocking him out of his 
           wheelchair.
           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Beverly and Gail side by side in the Principal’s office 
           again.

           Principal clears his throat uncomfortably--

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        I want to say first, that passing gas is 
                        nothing to be embarrassed about.  
                        Everyone passes gas.  I pass gas.  Your 
                        grandmother passes gas.  Even former 
                        President of the United States, James K. 
                        Polk, passed gas.  
                                 (beat)
                        Having said that, it is unacceptable to 
                        punch someone in the face, regardless of 
                        how embarrassed you might feel about 
                        something you shouldn’t be embarrassed 
                        about.  And certainly not handicapped 
                        people.

           Beverly lets out a bitter little snort of dissent.  

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Is there something you’d like to say, 
                        Beverly?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I didn’t punch him because I farted.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        I don’t appreciate that language, but, 
                        okay.  Why did you hit him then?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I punched him because he’s a big dick who 
                        gets away with everything because he’s in 
                        a freakin’ wheelchair.

           EXT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE

           Principal opens the door and walks Gail and Beverly out--

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        I’m sorry Mrs. Moody.  But Beverly really 
                        left me no choice.  We’ll meet again 
                        after her suspension.

                                 GAIL
                        I understand.  Thank you.
           As Beverly walks out she notices Steven sitting with his 
           Mom and Dad - two perfect, beautiful parents hanging over 
           their dear delicate son.  They both turn and scowl at 
           Beverly...

           INT. GAIL’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           A silent ride home.  Beverly sneaks a look at Gail.  But 
           Gail keeps her eyes glued to the road.

           INT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Gail sets her purse on the couch and keeps walking into 
           the kitchen.  Beverly stands there - expecting, maybe 
           even hoping, for Gail to say something.

           KITCHEN

           Gail is busy cooking.  Beverly enters--

                                 BEVERLY
                        What are you doing?

                                 GAIL
                        Making dinner.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Aren’t you going to yell at me?

           Gail shrugs.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        It’s not fair.  He makes fun of me all 
                        year and nobody cares.  Now everybody 
                        feels bad for him.  And I’m the one that 
                        gets suspended.

           Gail keeps cutting vegetables.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Aren’t you going to say anything?

           Without looking up--

                                 GAIL
                        What do you want me to say?  The world 
                        isn’t fair, Beverly.
           A beat.  Beverly stares at her cutting vegetables calmly.  
           Going silently about her routine like she’s done for 
           years now--

                                 BEVERLY
                                 (screaming)
                        The world is a shitball!!

           Gail finally looks up. 

                                 GAIL
                        Excuse me?

                                 BEVERLY
                        The world is a ball of shit and it’s 
                        filled with crap and assholes and choad 
                        and mean grandpas and dicks in 
                        wheelchairs and stupid wildcat buttons 
                        and crappy bands with asshole singers and 
                        then more crap and...

           Tears pour down Beverly’s cheeks.  Gail takes Beverly 
           into her arms.

                                 GAIL
                        Okay...okay.

                                 BEVERLY
                                 (through sobs)
                        I thought they were trying to tell me 
                        something.  I thought they left the 
                        mixtape for me...

           Gail lifts Beverly’s face--

                                 GAIL
                        I think it’s time I showed you something.

           INT. GAIL’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Gail opens the bottom drawer in her dresser--

                                 GAIL
                        There’s a box underneath my bed.  I 
                        wanted to show you this earlier.  But 
                        it’s hard for me...your parents death...

           Underneath the underwear, Gail pulls out a record.  
           Beverly brings out the box.  Gail opens it and pulls out 
           a record player.

           Gail plugs the record player in--
                                 GAIL
                        This was your mom’s favorite song when 
                        she was just a little girl.  I would 
                        always play it for her and we’d dance.  
                        Later, when she thought she was too cool 
                        for it she just called it the “parental 
                        unit’s song”.

           Gail starts the record and sits down on the bed next to 
           Beverly.  The record cracks and pops and hisses and 
           finally the song starts--

           It’s “Happy Times are Here Again” performed by Guy 
           Lombardo. 

           Gail takes Beverly’s hand in hers as she begins crying.  
           And then they hug each other and begin sobbing as the 
           singer sings--

           “Happy times are here again...”

           EXT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - BACK STEPS - NIGHT

           Gail and Beverly watch the rain come down in the back 
           yard and sip on mugs of hot chocolate.

                                 GAIL
                        Your mother came home one day and told 
                        me, “Mom, I’m in love.”  I thought it was 
                        one of those things, you know.  And then 
                        when I met your father, I could have 
                        died.  He had piercings and tattoos and 
                        purple hair.  I thought he looked like a 
                        Star Wars character.  

           Gail laughs at the thought of it--

                                 GAIL
                        But he was good to your mother and they 
                        were in love.  And then when they found 
                        out they were having you - well, 
                        everyone, including me, thought they were 
                        too young.  But they wouldn’t hear it.  
                        They were so excited.  I remember your 
                        father somehow found a bunch of fireworks 
                        and he and your mother sat out here and 
                        let off fireworks and listened to music 
                        all night to celebrate.  I thought they 
                        were crazy.  
           Gail stares off into the rain and smiles - as if she can 
           actually see the fireworks arching off into the darkness, 
           lighting up the sky...

                                 GAIL
                        They wanted to be good parents to you. 
                        They loved you more than anything in the 
                        world.  You were everything to them.

           Gail puts her arm around Beverly.  Beverly puts her head 
           on her grandmother’s shoulder, both of them thinking 
           about two people they love very much.

           We follow their gaze, up to--

           THE SKY

           Where the rain has stopped and the clouds have started to 
           part, revealing the bright, perfect stars glimmering from 
           the other side of the too-huge universe.

           EXT. JAMES K. POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - MORNING

           The sun is out.  One of those beautiful days where 
           everything’s sparkling and green from the night’s rain.

           Gail’s postal van pulls up to the curb.  Gail gets out, 
           circles to the back of the van and slides the door open--

                                 GAIL
                        Special del--
                                 (stops herself)
                        We’re here.

           Beverly hops out, followed by Ellen.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        Thanks Grandma.

                                 ELLEN
                        Thanks Mrs. Moody.

           Ellen puts her hand up for a high-five.  Gail looks 
           confused.  Then figures out what Ellen is doing and puts 
           her hand up.  Ellen gives her an enthusiastic high-five.

                                 GAIL
                        Have a good day girls.

           Gail goes back to the driver’s side - but stops and 
           watches as--
           THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL

           Beverly and Ellen meet up with Nicky - and then the three 
           of them meet up with THREE BOYS who look just as much 
           like misfits as the girls.

           A CHUBBY BOY and Beverly look at each other shyly.  He 
           gives Beverly a note as Nicky gives one of the other boys 
           a piggy-back and they all go inside the school.

           ON GAIL

           Let’s out a big sigh - knowing very well all the changes 
           and challenges coming in the next few years.  A look of 
           worry and weariness on her face as she climbs--

           INSIDE THE VAN

           --and finds something waiting on her seat.  A MIX CD.

           The cover has a collage of pictures of Gail and Beverly 
           along with the mix name - “Grandma’s Mix”. On the floor 
           next to her seat is a little CD player boombox.  

           Gail puts the CD in.  The disc spins as Gail starts the 
           car and pulls away from the school.  And then the song 
           starts - the first chords of Cheap Trick’s “Surrender”.

           Gail listens as the singer belts out the first lyrics.  
           And then slowly, almost against her will, one of her 
           fingers starts tapping.

           If we didn’t know better we might think she actually 
           likes this song...

           LATER

           Gail’s stopped at a red light.  The climax of “Surrender” 
           blasts out of the little boombox.  She taps the beat on 
           the steering wheel, bobs her head back and forth to the 
           roar of the guitar.  She’s starting to get into this 
           song.  And then... 

           ...she starts to SING ALONG to the chorus.  Quietly at 
           first - not even audible above the boombox.  Then LOUDER 
           and LOUDER as the song starts to pick up steam. And 
           before long she’s SHOUTING along to the chorus - letting 
           everything she’s been holding inside get out, truly 
           feeling each word--
                                 GAIL
                        Surrender!  Surrender! But don’t give 
                        yourself awaaaaaaaaaay!   Awaaaaaay!

           She looks over to the car next to her.  A MAN and his 
           WIFE stare at her like she’s crazy.  

           Gail let’s out a LAUGH - a real from the belly laugh - 
           for the first time in a long, long time.  And we know 
           right at that moment that no matter what happens, Gail 
           and Beverly are going to be just fine.  

           The light turns green.  Gail waves to the couple and 
           drives away as the next song roars to life...

           INT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Hands over Beverly’s eyes--

           Gail brings out a birthday cake with 13 candles lit.  
           Nicky uncovers Beverly’s eyes--

           EVERYONE is there.  Anti, Ellen, Nicky, both of their 
           parents and siblings.  The guy from Wal-Mart, Les and Ray 
           and their dog in the sweater, Mr. and Mrs. Asian--

           They all sing “Happy Birthday” and Beverly blows out the 
           candles.

           EXT. BACKYARD - LATER

           A beautiful day.

           Beverly, Ellen and Nicky set up their instruments while 
           the audience, seated in lawn chairs, looks on.

           Beverly tunes her guitar.  Ellen taps on her drums.  
           Nicky steps up to the mike.

                                 NICKY
                        Thank you all for coming to Beverly’s 
                        birthday party and the first gig for our 
                        band, “Us Dudes Are Sisters”

                                 KYLE
                        Booooooooooooo!

                                 NICKY
                        Shut up, Kyle.

           She looks back at her band - they all nod at each other.
                                 NICKY
                        One...two...three!

           The band starts.  They’re awful but enthusiastic, and 
           everybody is having a great time--

           BACKYARD - NIGHT

           A perfect clear night.  

           The parents are relaxing and talking from their lawn 
           chairs.  All the kids are gathered around Anti who is 
           standing over a giant stash of fireworks.

                                 ELLEN
                        Come on, Anti.  Let us fire off some.

                                 ANTI
                        Um, excuse me, but did you ever assist 
                        Bon Jovi’s pyrotechnic team in setting up 
                        the fireworks for their Steel Horse tour?

                                 ELLEN
                        No.

                                 ANTI
                        Exactly.  And that’s why Mrs. Moody 
                        requested that I be in charge of the 
                        birthday fireworks.  Now if you’ll all 
                        give me some room, I can make the magic 
                        happen.

           Beverly sits down next to Gail.  

           The first firework takes to the sky - a red streak rising 
           up into the darkness and then--

           POP!

           EXT. PARK - FLASHBACK

           Close-up on Beverly as a baby followed by the sizzle and 
           pop of fireworks.

           Music plays in the background.

           Beverly’s Dad bends over to light another bottle rocket.  
           Mom stands at a distance, holding infant Beverly.

                                 MOM
                        I think she likes the fireworks.
                                 DAD
                        How do you know?  Babies can’t smile.

                                 MOM
                        I just have the feeling she does.  And 
                        she’s not crying.

           More fireworks are set off.  Beverly almost seems to be 
           following the fireworks with her eyes.

           Dad pulls two cans from a case of Rainier and hands one 
           to Mom.

                                 DAD
                        Let’s make a toast.

                                 MOM
                        To what?

                                 DAD
                                 (looking at Beverly)
                        To new beginnings.

           They toast with their cans.  And as another firework 
           bursts in mid-air--

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT

           The sky is lit up by a colorful series of explosions.  
           Everyone “Ooohs” and “Aaaahs” as the sparks float back 
           down to earth.

           Gail puts her arm around Beverly.

                                 GAIL
                        Happy birthday, Beverly.

           Beverly puts her arm around Gail.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Thank you, Grandma.

           As another bottle rocket explodes in the sky...
