           EXT. MEDICAL CENTER PARKING LOT - TRUMBULL, CT - DAY

           A Volvo wagon rolls into a space. GREG WEINSTOCK, 25, a 
           hangdog mensch in a navy suit, steps out and opens the rear 
           hatch revealing: 

           Boxes of DRUG SAMPLES: PREXIOL, STARICLOR, ZONATREX, and 
           PERCALIM. He’s a drug rep. Greg grabs a tray of breakfast 
           pastries, a smaller tray of coffee drinks and heads towards 
           the office building. 

           INT. DOCTOR GARDNER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Your standard pediatrician’s waiting room. Sick kids, sneezes 
           and dilapidated toys abound. A girl with a ponytail taps on a 
           fish tank. Balancing the trays of coffee and pastries, Greg 
           nearly trips over a plastic firetruck. He recovers, and 
           approaches MIKA, the office manager, at the reception desk.

                                 GREG
                        Morning, Mika. 

           Excited by the pastries, she announces to the office staff--

                                 MIKA
                        Greg brought breakfast!  
                             (to Greg)
                        Greg, are you ever gonna tell us 
                        where you get these?

                                 GREG
                        If you ever found out, I’d probably 
                        find myself out of a job.  

           Greg grins. Mika laughs and takes the trays.  

                                 MIKA
                        He’s with a patient. Have a seat, 
                        sweetie and I’ll see what I can do.

           Greg sits down next to BOOGER BOY, 4, who’s picking his nose.   

                                 GREG
                        You find anything good up there?

           BOOGER BOY shows Greg his booger-tipped index finger.

                                 GREG
                        Crackerjack work, professor.  

           Greg sees another rep staring him down with disdain.  
                                 GREG
                        Hi, Greg Weinstock, Burlington 
                        Labs.

           Greg extends his hand. Jeff doesn’t shake it.

                                 JEFF
                        I know who you are, Weinstock.  
                        Your f’ing doilies make the rest of 
                        us look like chumps.  

                                 MIKA
                        Greg. He’ll see you now.   

                                 JEFF
                        Whoa, wait. I was here first.

                                 GREG
                        Oh, I’m sorry. He can go.

                                 MIKA
                        No no no. He can sit tight. Come on 
                        back, sweetie.  

                                 GREG
                        Thanks Mika.
                             (mumbles to Jeff)
                        Sorry.  

           INT. DOCTOR GARDNER’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Dr. Gardner sits at his desk, rubbing his temples.

                                 GREG
                        This is the latest article showing 
                        Prexiol works wonders with kids. In 
                        eighty-five percent--

                                 DR. GARDNER
                        Just leave it. I’ll get to it.

                                 GREG
                        Sure. Uh, can I just get a John 
                        Hancock for some samples?  

           Dr. Gardner sighs. He signs Greg’s sig sheet.

                                 GREG
                        Thanks Doc. Oh, here’s something to 
                        bulldoze that headache.    

           Greg hands Dr. Gardner a sample box of Zonatrex he’s pulled 
           from his suit pocket.  
           INT. GREG’S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - DUSK

           Greg sets down his briefcase and takes off his shoes, which 
           he places next to the other pairs of shoes. He goes through 
           the mail set out on the credenza. There’s a credit card bill, 
           which he opens. A sizable charge catches his attention.  

                                 GREG
                        Tiff?

           INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - DUSK

           TIFFANY “TIFF” MARINO, 28, Greg’s bubbly whirlwind of a 
           girlfriend, is seated at her vanity, applying eyeliner. Greg 
           walks in, credit card bill in hand. 

                                 GREG
                        Tiff? I was wondering--

                                 TIFF
                        Is that what you’re wearing 
                        tonight?

                                 GREG
                        Uh. What’s tonight?

                                 TIFF
                        We’re going to Onyx. It’s on the 
                        calendar.

                                 GREG
                        Okay. Babe, do you remember buying 
                        anything at Nieman Marcus? Like in 
                        the last three weeks or so?  

                                 TIFF
                        Yeah, I got that new handbag, 
                        remember? The maroon one?  

                                 GREG
                        Actually no, I don’t. But you spent 
                        six hundred and seventy five 
                        dollars on my credit card? On a 
                        purse? This is like our car 
                        payments for a month combined. 

                                 TIFF
                        Yeah, well, mine was all maxed out.  

           Tiff begins to bat her eyes. It’s worked her entire life.

                                 TIFF
                        You’re upset. I can tell.
                                 GREG
                        Well, we’ve been over this. This 
                        isn’t news to you. The Mastercard 
                        is supposed to be for emergencies.    

                                 TIFF
                        This was an emergency. It was on 
                        sale.
                             (beat)
                        Why can’t you ever check the 
                        calendar for once? How hard is 
                        that? Jesus.  

                                 GREG
                        What does the calendar have to do 
                        with anything?  

                                 TIFF
                        Greg, stop trying to pick a fight. 
                        I don’t need you ruining my night 
                        over a purse. You’re so petty, it’s 
                        laughable. Go change your shirt.    

           INT. ONYX NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Tiff’s friends, JUSTINE, BARRY, and two other couples, are 
           lounging about. A bottle of tequila and shot glasses rest on 
           the table. Drunk, Tiff is showing off the aforementioned 675 
           dollar purse. Greg is talking to Barry and the other guys. 

                                 GREG
                        Being a drug rep is a stepping 
                        stone. The eventual goal is one day 
                        forming my own boutique marketing 
                        and consulting firm.  

                                 TIFF
                        Greg, no one wants to hear about 
                        your dreams. You’re twenty-five.  
                        You’re doing what you’re gonna be 
                        doing for the rest of your life.  

                                 GREG
                        Well, in that case, excuse me then. 
                        I’m gonna go find a pawnshop and 
                        see how much I can get for my hopes 
                        and aspirations.

           Greg stands.  

                                 TIFF
                        Greg, grow some balls. Sit back 
                        down. Take a shot. 
                                 GREG
                        Okay, just one. L’Chaim.  

           Greg downs a shot. Justine places another in front of him.

                                 GREG
                        Thanks, I can’t. Guys, it’s always 
                        a pleasure, but it’s getting late. 
                        Tiff, hon, we should probably call 
                        it a night.

                                 TIFF
                        Come on Greg. Can you not be such a 
                        pussy tonight?
                             (to her friends)
                        He’s just grumpy ‘cause I’m not 
                        having sex with him tonight. 
                        Because I’M ON MY CYCLE!

           Tiff’s friends erupt with giggles. Tiff pulls some tampons 
           from her purse and begins chucking them at Greg.

                                 GREG
                        Can you stop throwing tampons?  

                                 TIFF
                        Oh poor little pussy. Poor you.  
                        What about me? You think you’re the 
                        only one with feelings? People like 
                        my purse. So you’re wrong.

                                 GREG
                        Tiff, why don’t you turn it down a 
                        couple notches? You keep going like 
                        this, you’re gonna get sick.

                                 TIFF
                        No I’m not. I have amazing throw up 
                        control.  
                             (throws back a shot)
                        We went out for drinks after work 
                        last Tuesday, and I got hella 
                        sauced. Absolutely shiffaced. And I 
                        didn’t vomit once, dude. Not once.  
                        So there. Oh, and I totally ended 
                        up giving Clyde a lapdance in a 
                        photo booth. ‘Twas hi-larious. 

                                 GREG
                        You gave your boss a lapdance?

                                 TIFF
                        It’s not like I blew the guy. It 
                        was just a lapdance. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TIFF (CONT'D)
                        Not a big deal. Don’t get jealous, 
                        Greg, not over Clyde. He’s gross. 
                        Totally unfuckable. You’ve seen his 
                        paunch, right, Justine?

                                 JUSTINE
                        Uh-huh. His gut’s like third 
                        trimester huge. Bleh.

                                 TIFF
                        Are you upset, baby? Oh, that’s so 
                        cute. Let’s go dance.   

           Greg reluctantly takes Tiff’s hand and she pulls him out onto 
           the dance floor. Tiff stumbles in her heels. She and Greg 
           begin dancing. Greg’s moves are ridiculous, an amalgamation 
           of white-guy moves learned through high-school dances, 
           weddings, and bar mitzvahs. Tiff breaks off from him.

                                 TIFF
                        What are you doing?

                                 GREG
                        I’m blowing up the dance floor.

                                 TIFF
                        No you’re not. You look like an 
                        idiot. You’re embarrassing me.

                                 GREG
                        I’m embarrassing you? Well--

           Greg comes to a stop, and yanks the purse away from Tiff.

                                 GREG
                        This embarrasses me. My job isn’t 
                        about slaving away sixty hours a 
                        week so you can blow my paycheck on 
                        garbage like this. Check me out. A 
                        breathing walking vision of fiscal 
                        conservatism. Pardon me, anyone in 
                        need of a lapdance? Or a tampon? 

                                 TIFF
                        Put my purse down. Put it down, 
                        dude. You’re being a total jerk.

                                 GREG
                        I’m not being a jerk. I’m doing us 
                        both a favor here. Six hundred and 
                        seventy five dollars. This is like 
                        one percent of my annual salary, 
                        post tax. Fuck this purse.
           Greg throws the purse to the floor and stomps on it. BIG GUY, 
           a wall of a man, forces Greg into a half-nelson. He winces.

                                 BIG GUY
                        You gonna be cool, man?

                                 GREG
                        Yeah, I’ll be cool.

                                 BIG GUY
                        Damn yes you will. Now pick up the 
                        lady’s handbag before I get 
                        brusque. 

           Greg hands Tiff her purse.

                             (to Big Guy)
                        You’re a gentleman.

                                 BIG GUY
                        Wasn’t a thing.  

           Big Guy pulls Tiff close. Greg watches from the sidelines, as 
           they begin grinding, oblivious to Greg’s discomfort.

           EXT. GREG’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           Greg rubs Tiff’s back as she vomits into a potted plant. With 
           his free hand, he holds her shoes and the purse. She stands. 

                                 GREG
                        Do you feel better now?

                                 TIFF
                             (points at the puke)
                        That’s your fault.

           She wipes her mouth with her forearm, and glares at him.

                                 GREG
                        I was upset. I was saying things I 
                        didn’t mean. Tiff, can we please 
                        talk about this like adults?

                                 TIFF
                        I don’t want you sleeping here.

                                 GREG
                        Oh c’mon. Really? It’s midnight, 
                        Tiff. Where am I supposed to go?
                                 TIFF
                        I don’t know, Greg. All I know is I 
                        don't need you giving me agita for 
                        every little thing I do wrong. All 
                        I know is I don’t want you here 
                        when I wake up in the morning. I’m 
                        tired. Tired of this whole thing. I 
                        guess I never saw myself ending up 
                        with a stagnant wimp who can’t even 
                        send food back at restaurants.   

                                 GREG
                        Look, I really am sorry for 
                        embarrassing you in front of your 
                        friends. I’m sorry about nagging 
                        you about the purse. I’m sorry if 
                        I’m wound too tight. But we’re good 
                        together, you and me. 

                                 TIFF
                        Good together? Greg, give me a 
                        break. We’re in couples therapy and 
                        we haven’t even lived together for 
                        a year yet. Don’t you think that’s 
                        some kind of sign?  

                                 GREG
                        I’ll call you in the morning, okay?  

           Greg goes to kiss her, and she pulls away. She turns, walks 
           into the house, and slams the door. The deadbolt clicks.

           INT. OFFICE RECEPTION - MORNING

           Seated at a desk beneath the Burlington Labs’s Logo is DARBY 
           OPPENHEIM, a timid receptionist with bangs. She’s on a call. 
           Greg gives Darby a lackluster wave as he passes by in his 
           wrinkled shirt. Darby places her hand over the handset.

                                 DARBY
                        Greg, um, Ressler wants to see you.

                                 GREG
                        In his office? Oh boy. Today of all 
                        days. Well it’s been nice knowing 
                        you. J.K. I’m sure it’s all good.  

           Greg sighs, and turns to go.

                                 DARBY
                        Hey wait. I made Snickerdoodles 
                        again. They came out pretty well 
                        this time. If you want one...
           Darby holds out a plate and Greg takes a cookie.

                                 GREG
                        Thanks. Okay. I’ve gotta go have my 
                        panic attack about impending 
                        unemployment. I’ll see ya, Darby.

           INT. STORAGE CLOSET - DAY

           Greg closes the door, and paces amongst the cleaning 
           supplies. He leans his forehead against the back wall.

                                 GREG
                        You’re not getting fired. You’re 
                        not getting fired. Breathe. You’ve 
                        gotta breathe, brother. Christ. I’m 
                        totally getting fired.  

           FOOTSTEPS approach. Greg quickly crouches down behind some 
           shelves. The door opens. A MAN and WOMAN enter, giggling. We 
           can only see their shoes. Greg closes his eyes.  

                                 KEVIN (O.S.)
                        I’ll be straight with you, Ruth. 
                        I’m not the janitor.  

                                 RUTH (O.S.)
                        Are you saying you brought me here 
                        under false pretense?

                                 KEVIN (O.S.)
                        Why don’t I show you something? Did 
                        I ever tell you I read braille?

                                 RUTH (O.S.)
                        Oooh, Kevin Russell. That tickles.  
                        What does that say? How about that?

           KISSING and UNZIPPING. Clothes drop to the floor. A purple 
           bra hits Greg in the face. He tosses it back towards the 
           shoes, and attempts to ignore the frenzied cadence. He takes 
           a bite of his cookie while waiting for the storm to pass.

                                 RUTH (O.S.)
                        Oh god! Oh my god! Is that your 
                        pinky? Yes, Kevin Russell! Yeah!  

           INT. RESSLER’S OFFICE - DAY

           TED RESSLER, 47, District Manager, is engrossed in a 
           televised golf tournament when Greg nervously tiptoes in.  
           Ressler is a barrel-chested, overbearing boss.
                                 GREG
                        Hi Ted. I was told you wanted to 
                        see me. If this is about last 
                        month’s expense report, I 
                        apologize. The wine ordering at 
                        that dinner got way out of control. 
                        My fault. I’ll pay it back, if 
                        necessary. Whatever it takes.  

                                 RESSLER
                        Expense report? Weinstock, if you 
                        get eighty-sixed, HR reaches out. 
                        Not me. So you can simmer down and  
                        plant your cheeks.

           Greg sits down in an armchair. Ted looks him in the eye. 

                                 RESSLER
                        You know Kevin Russell? He’s our 
                        ace rep in Westchester.

           Greg recognizes the name from earlier in the closet.

                                 GREG
                        Uh, not personally, but yeah, I 
                        know the name. Why?  

           A knock on the door. KEVIN RUSSELL, 33, a wasp-y rooster who 
           knows how good looking he is, strolls in, a potent 
           combination of swagger and solipsism. He’s his own hero.

                                 KEVIN
                        Sorry I’m late. Caught in traffic.
                             (to Greg)
                        What’s going on? Kevin Russell.

           Kevin extends his hand. Kinda grossed out, Greg considers 
           Kevin’s hand for a moment before shaking it.

                                 GREG
                        Hi. Greg Weinstock.

                                 KEVIN
                        Ressler, how goes it on the eastern 
                        front, amigo? How’re the kids?

                                 RESSLER
                        Fuck if I know. Linda got custody. 
                        Not sure if you crossed paths with 
                        them, but do either of you remember 
                        Sheera Reubens and Mandy Jones?

           This has hit Kevin like a brick. He sighs.
                                 KEVIN 
                        Yeah. I know them.  

                                 GREG
                        I don’t. Were they on this floor?

                                 RESSLER
                        Sheera and Mandy were our 
                        institutional sales team. Last 
                        week, they resigned suddenly. And 
                        with the USHC Convention next week, 
                        we’re in a hell of a bind. Now 
                        we've got no choice but to send a 
                        couple of local reps in their place 
                        for TWR’s Prexiol contract. Turns 
                        out, averaged out for the last five 
                        quarters, you’re our top two PPI 
                        reps in the country. Sheera and 
                        Mandy would steal a baby from its 
                        crib and eat it if it meant closing 
                        a sale. So what I’m saying is, are 
                        you hungry for Milwaukee?

                                 KEVIN
                        You bet we are. Gluttons.

                                 GREG
                        I’m sorry. We’re not cut out for 
                        this. At least, I’m not. I’m sure 
                        there’s a million other guys better 
                        suited than me. Thanks.  
                             (to Kevin)
                        Nice to have met you.

           Greg stands and heads out into the hallway. Kevin smiles 
           towards Ressler.

                                 RESSLER
                        I don’t know what you’re smiling 
                        about. I’m not sending you to 
                        Milwaukee without a babysitter. 
                        You’re a liability and he’s the 
                        insurance. He’s out, you’re out. 
                        Sorry, amigo.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Excuse me a sec.

           Kevin scampers after Greg.
           INT. OFFICE HALLWAY - OUTSIDE RESSLER’S OFFICE - DAY

                                 KEVIN
                        Hold up. Why are you walking away? 
                        We just got called up to the big 
                        leagues. We can do this, no prob. 

                                 GREG
                        It’s a huge prob- problem. The U.S. 
                        Hospitals Conference. We’re gonna 
                        crash and burn out there.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Hey, I don’t know you, Greg. But 
                        I’m pretty certain being a rep 
                        isn’t the bright light on your 
                        horizon. There’s something else out 
                        there, right? This sale is our 
                        ticket up and out of here, to 
                        management. Look, you bring the 
                        technical know-how, I bring the 
                        sexy. And we come home heroes.  
                        You’ll be a wanted man. Don't you 
                        want to be wanted?  

                                 GREG
                        Hey, thanks for the hard sell, but 
                        I’m comfortable where I am.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Comfortable, really? Alright. But 
                        um, doesn’t the bonus intrigue you 
                        at all?

                                 GREG
                        What bonus?  

           Kevin lights up. Greg’s taken the bait.

                                 KEVIN
                        Thirty five thousand. Each. Greg, I 
                        was around ten years ago, and the 
                        regulation and rules that came 
                        along to shit all over what made 
                        being a drug rep joyous is non-
                        existent in institutional sales. 
                        The late nineties’s were the high 
                        waters of a golden age, because we 
                        did whatever it took to get scripts 
                        written. You young dudes have all 
                        been neutered, but my balls are 
                        intact as hell. Whether it’s you or 
                        some other greenhorn riding shotgun 
                        on this doesn’t matter.

                        I’m going back into Ressler’s 
                        office, and I’m saying yes, because 
                        anything else would be the wrong 
                        answer. You don’t want to copilot 
                        this voyage, fine by me. 

                                 GREG
                        Okay. I’m gonna go wash the mitts.

           Greg strolls away, leaving Kevin thrown off by the rejection.   

           INT. OFFICE BATHROOM - DAY

           Greg steps up to a urinal. Ressler pops in to chat.   

                                 RESSLER
                        Weinstock, you busy?

                                 GREG
                        No but, just, you know, numero uno.

           Greg is unable to pee while being talked to.  

                                 RESSLER
                        Uh-huh. Script tracking doesn't 
                        lie. You and Kevin are the crème de 
                        la crème of Prexiol reps. I’d like 
                        you to reconsider Milwaukee. 

                                 GREG
                        Ted, I don’t mean to sound 
                        ungrateful. But I’m just a detail 
                        rep. Negotiating bulk pricing 
                        contracts just isn’t my wheelhouse.  

                                 RESSLER
                        This thing’s a walk in the park. 
                        You’re selling against Zyklar for 
                        chrissakes. Connor and Todd, the 
                        Zyklar Reps? Just a couple of lazy 
                        schmucks. Thirty five k for flexing 
                        your corporate card. That’s pretty 
                        easy money in my book.  

                                 GREG
                        Ted, why’s it so important I go to 
                        this convention? There’s certainly 
                        a bunch of other reps just as 
                        qualified as I am.  
                                 RESSLER
                        None that I trust as much. As for 
                        Kevin, I’m not gonna say the guy’s 
                        not a lunatic, but that bastard can 
                        work a room. Why don’t you spend 
                        the afternoon with him, see how 
                        that plays out?  

                                 GREG
                        I’ve got a couple visits today.

                                 RESSLER
                        I’m not asking.

                                 GREG
                             (flustered)
                        I’ll rearrange my schedule.

                                 RESSLER
                        Perfect. You having some prostate 
                        trouble there, buddy? 

                                 GREG
                        Nope. All is hunky-dory. Thanks.

           A toilet flushes. ZIGGY, the IT guy, steps out of a stall.

                        You should try clenching then 
                        unclenching. See if that helps.

                                 GREG
                        Okay. Will do. Thanks everyone. 
                        Always love a good urinal pow-wow.

           INT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY

           Greg finds Kevin on a couch, pecking away on his Blackberry.  

                                 KEVIN
                             (without looking up)
                        You change your mind yet? 

                                 GREG
                        On a scale from one to ten, no. 
                        Definitely not. Ressler insisted I 
                        spend my afternoon with you.

                                 KEVIN
                        Glad it all worked out. I’m getting 
                        two hundy under the table for 
                        speaking at a college career fair. 
                        Undergrads. I’ll drive.
           EXT. COUNTRY BACK ROADS - DAY

           Kevin’s maroon 1969 Maserati Ghibli carves along the winding 
           roads at a dangerous clip, screams up a hill and at the apex, 
           briefly achieves liftoff and disappears from view.

           INT. KEVIN’S CAR - DAY - MOVING

           Kevin sips coffee as he steers.  

                                 KEVIN
                        People in the hallway look at me 
                        like I’m a goddamn dinosaur. Look 
                        around. There aren’t other thirty-
                        three year old drug reps. Jesus 
                        died at thirty-three, know what I 
                        mean? I’m squarely on the verge of 
                        being put out to pasture. 

                                 GREG
                        Um, when Ressler mentioned Sheera 
                        and Mandy to us, it looked like he 
                        slugged you in the face. Wanna fill 
                        me in?

                                 KEVIN
                        I barely remember her--
                             (quickly catches himself)
                        Them.  Shift up.  

           Greg shifts the transmission into 3rd. 

                                 KEVIN
                        You know what? We should go into 
                        New York this weekend. We can talk 
                        brew city strategy, take in some 
                        mayhem. Shift down, down.  

                                 GREG
                        Oh, thank you for the offer, I uh, 
                        I can’t. Not this weekend. Sorry.

                                 KEVIN
                        Your wheel, captain. Shift up.

           Greg, moderately panicked, takes the wheel, and steers from 
           the passenger seat.  

                                 KEVIN
                             (gesticulating)
                        There’s this burlesque club just 
                        outside of Montreal. They’ve got a 
                        woman there.

                        She comes out on stage, chonch full 
                        bald eagle, so you know she has no 
                        tricks up her sleeve, so to speak. 
                        She squats down and without using 
                        her hands, picks up a match, 
                        strikes it, then pushes her pelvis 
                        forward, and lights your cigarette.

                                 GREG
                        But I don’t smoke.

                                 KEVIN
                        That’s beside the point. Shift up.

                                 GREG
                        Why can’t she just use her hands to 
                        light the cigarette?

                                 KEVIN
                        Because, well, why would someone 
                        walk on the moon? Why Everest? Why 
                        anything? Because it hasn’t been 
                        done before. Shift up. For the 
                        splendor, for the glory, for that 
                        moment of wonder where you see 
                        something you’d never thought 
                        possible. It’s revelatory. Makes 
                        you question why God even gave us 
                        hands. Henrietta Hamentashen.  

           Kevin sets his coffee down and takes back the wheel.

                        On Saturday, she’s in the city,

                        But if you can’t go, you can’t go. 
                        What’s keeping you so busy?

                        My girlfriend and I are going 
                        through a patch, of sorts. I’m 
                        presently living out of a suitcase 
                        at Motel Hi-Ho. And I think I’d 
                        rather just sit, sulk, and lay 
                        fallow in my heartache this 
                        weekend. I’m sorry.  

                                 KEVIN
                        No worries. But, if you can finagle 
                        shore leave from your despair,

                        I’m not checking anything out. I 
                        have a girl in this world who I’m 
                        still very much in love with.

           INT. WESTERN CONNECTICUT STATE UNIVERSITY AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Kevin stands at a lectern onstage. A banner hanging over the 
           stage reads: “WCSU Career Fair!”. The audience of students is 
           chattering away. Kevin pulls a whistle from his pocket, and 
           blows it loud. All conversations immediately cease.  

                                 KEVIN
                        My grandfather sold bibles door to 
                        door. My dad sold Winnebagos. And 
                        me, I sell drugs. Point blank, I 
                        get paid to party. If you want to 
                        bat seven fifty or higher in 
                        anything, school, work, under the 
                        covers, you have to wow people. 
                        You’ve gotta blow minds. 

           Kevin takes the microphone off the podium.

                                 KEVIN
                        People occasionally look at me with 
                        disgust when I tell them I 
                        frequently expense condoms as a 
                        business expense. Whorish? 
                        Ethically inappropriate? Sure, I 
                        may be a scumbag, but in the end, I 
                        take no prisoners, show no weakness 
                        and I move product, by any means 
                        necessary. I’m also living the 
                        dream. Living the f’ing dream.  

           Kevin holds his index finger high. Significant applause.  
           Greg looks around, impressed by the response. Despite what he 
           knows in his gut to probably be true, Greg sees a strength 
           and confidence in Kevin he knows he’s lacking in himself.  
           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Basking in the collateral afterglow of Kevin’s speech, Greg 
           fields questions from eager undergrads. An ambitious finance 
           major in a short skirt enthusiastically listens to Kevin.

                                 KEVIN
                        Our R&D budget is bigger than the 
                        GDP of most developed countries. It 
                        takes a lot of science to save the 
                        world. Can’t just do it on hopes 
                        and wishes. Personally, I think 
                        it’s worth it.

                                 FINANCE MAJOR
                        Totally. Wow, your speech was awe-
                        some. I so wish I could crawl 
                        inside your brain and see how it 
                        works.

                                 KEVIN
                        What a coincidence, I’d love to 
                        crawl inside your--

           Greg comes over to Kevin, interrupting him.    

                                 GREG
                        Kevin, I’ve been thinking--

                                 KEVIN
                        Uh-huh.  

                                 GREG
                        You know, Milwaukee, we could do 
                        this thing.

           Kevin immediately loses interest in the Finance Major. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Really? You’re onboard?

                                 GREG
                        I could win Tiff back, prove to her 
                        I’m more than just a drug rep. And 
                        with the bonus, launch my marketing 
                        firm. So, yeah. But we’re doing it 
                        correctly. Taking the high road.  
                        Nothing sleazy, alright? 

                                 KEVIN
                        Oh, this is fucking great! We’re 
                        gonna decimate this shit, partner.
                        Milwaukee, man! Milwaukee!
           Kevin embraces Greg.

                                 GREG
                        Ahhh. Easy on the ribcage.  

           INT. OFFICE RECEPTION - DAY

           Kevin and Greg are passing Darby’s desk.

                                 GREG
                        Morning. 

                                 DARBY
                        Morning, Greg. Hi. Ressler’s 
                        looking for you two.

                                 GREG
                        Thanks Darby. Appreciate it. 

           Kevin and Greg make their way down the hall.

                                 KEVIN
                        When are you gonna bring a 
                        flamethrower to that lumberyard?  

                                 GREG
                        What lumberyard?
                             (realizes and cringes)
                        Oh. I’m only trying to be friendly, 
                        cordial. I remind myself Darby’s a 
                        work buddy first, and a gorgeous 
                        woman second. She just happens to 
                        be the nicest person here. That’s 
                        all. Work buds. We’re work buds.

                                 KEVIN
                        Uh-huh. You should ask her out.   

                                 GREG
                        I’m not asking anyone out.  

                                 KEVIN
                        The thing is, she doesn’t even know 
                        she’s a looker. Growing up, guys 
                        were probably intimidated by her 
                        looks and didn’t even ask her to 
                        prom. I bet there’s still a wild 
                        untamed bush under those undies. 
                        But once she trims the hedges, it’s 
                        all over, ‘cause by then she’s 
                        learned she’s a lush piece of 
                        mattress candy. And it’ll be some 
                        other guy who’s won her topiary.

                        You’ll be sitting in your office, 
                        scratching your balls, having 
                        missed your chance to lay 
                        greatness.  

           INT. RESSLER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Ressler sits at his desk across from Kevin and Greg.

                                 RESSLER
                        TWR is the largest managed care 
                        consortium of hospitals and medical 
                        groups in the Midwest. Our contract 
                        with them represents twelve percent 
                        of Prexiol’s annual North American 
                        sales. We move two billion a year 
                        in Prexiol. I wasn’t a math major 
                        but TWR means a fuckin’ substantial 
                        line item for our E.O.F.Y.  

           Ressler pushes a large sealed envelope across the desk.

                                 RESSLER
                        This, this is your sword. These are 
                        the prices you’re gonna offer TWR.  
                        We know what everyone else is 
                        offering this year, and we’re 
                        undercutting all of them.  

           Kevin goes to open the envelope.

                                 RESSLER
                        Don’t fucking open that. Not in 
                        here. Come hell or high water, you 
                        protect those fucking numbers with 
                        your life. They’re our insurance 
                        against TWR jumping into bed with 
                        the enemy. Got me?

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah. We gotcha.  

                                 RESSLER
                        Tomorrow you're on the ground in 
                        Milwaukee. Everything you do this 
                        week is leading up to that moment 
                        on Friday where you seal the deal 
                        and make the sale. Nothing else 
                        matters. Any logistical headaches, 
                        call me, ASAP. Deborah Crohl heads 
                        up TWR’s P&T committee. Manzur 
                        Azman is her right hand. You keep 
                        Manzur happy, Debbie’s a peach.

                        The rest of the dominos will fall 
                        in line. Oh, one other thing. You 
                        watch out for Derek Poon.

                                 KEVIN
                        Derek Poon?

                                 RESSLER
                        Yeah. Poon. As in poon. Derek’s a 
                        wildcard renegade, used to be our 
                        go-to guy in the midwest. He shows 
                        up, stay the fuck away. He’s the 
                        headache who single-handedly sunk 
                        our ship in ninety-eight.  

                                 GREG
                        So he ruined a big sale?

                                 RESSLER
                        No, he literally ignited so many 
                        fireworks at once that he blew a 
                        hole in the hull of an SVP’s 
                        catamaran. I've never met the 
                        shithead and never want to. No 
                        matter what he says, Derek Poon 
                        doesn't work for us or represent 
                        our interests. He’s the weasel who 
                        shows up at the conference every 
                        year and nibbles at our crumbs.  

                                 KEVIN
                        How will he contact us? Phone?

                                 RESSLER
                        How the fuck would I know? You 
                        cross paths with Poon, wipe your 
                        hands clean of him, and get on with 
                        what you’re there for.  

           EXT. WISCONSIN HIGHWAY - DAY

           A motorcyclist scuds along at 115 miles per hour. A POLICE 
           CAR pulls the bike over. DEREK POON, a wild-eyed smiling 
           madman takes off his helmet. He’s notably sniffling, which 
           may have something to do with his cocaine residue mustache.

                                 HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        You have any idea how fast you were 
                        going there?

                                 DEREK
                        I’d say between a buck ten and a 
                        buck twenty. What’d you clock?
                                 HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        Step off the bike, please.

                                 DEREK
                        For what it’s worth, I’m an organ 
                        donor. I just, ha. I’m so... 
                        Ninja’s got a mind of its own. 

                                 HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        Step off the bike.

                                 DEREK
                        Yessir.

           Derek steps off the bike. He gets spun around and handcuffed 
           by the patrolman, who in turn hurls Derek against the patrol 
           car’s hood and removes Derek’s wallet from his back pocket.  

                                 HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        This your license, Mr. Poon?

                                 DEREK
                        Shit’s legit. Kosher as 
                        Maneschewitz. Hey, can you loosen 
                        these cuffs a little? Or not.  

           While the patrolman copies down info, Derek stands up and 
           bolts, leaping over a guardrail, his hands cuffed behind his 
           back. The patrolman can’t believe what he’s seeing.

                                 HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        Hey there! Where you think you’re 
                        going, guy? I’m talking to ya’!  
                             (sighs)
                        Dang it. This freakin’ lunatic. 

           The patrolman takes off after Derek.

                                 HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        Hey buddy! Stop or I’ll... Stop. 
                        Just stop!

           Derek doesn’t heed the instructions. He’s a one man stampede.  
           When Derek reaches the banks of a small river, he dives in, 
           and disappears. The patrolman gets to the banks, winded.  
           There’s nothing he can do. Poon is gone.   

                                 HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                             (into walkie talkie)
                        Cindy, APB. We’ve got a runner, 
                        ugh, correction, a swimmer. 
           INT. GREG’S OFFICE - DAY

           Greg lifts a posterboard wallpapered with photos and names, 
           and sets it on an easel. MANZUR AZMAN and DEBORAH CROHL 
           represent the two largest photos on the chart of TWR’s 
           PHARMACY and THERAPEUTICS (P&T) Committee.   

                                 KEVIN
                        Wow, that’s quite the family tree.

                                 GREG
                        Here’s where we’re at with TWR’s 
                        P&T Committee. You’ll notice in 
                        your packet, I’ve got bios. Likes, 
                        dislikes, favorite drinks.  

           Greg sets a blow-up of their itinerary on a second easel.

                                 GREG
                        Wednesday is our banquet dinner at 
                        Steer House with the P&T’ers. 
                        Thursday morning, we bring them to 
                        a jazz brunch at The Reindeer Room, 
                        and then by our presentation on 
                        Friday, they’re fish in a barrel.

                                 KEVIN
                        Are we doing a sales pitch or 
                        putting them to sleep? This kite 
                        won’t fly for shit, man.

                                 GREG
                        This is a tried and true strategy. 
                        Sidney Nussbaum’s The Craft of The 
                        Close is our blueprint for victory. 
                        Trust the process. I’ll see you in 
                        the morning. I’m gonna go home and 
                        review the notecards.

                                 KEVIN
                        The notecards will still be there 
                        mañana. Save ‘em for the plane. 
                        McIlroy’s. One drink. On me.  

                                 GREG
                        No. No drinks. Six A.M. comes 
                        plenty early without whiskey 
                        getting in the way. Rest up, okay? 

           TITLE OVER BLACK: TUESDAY 
           EXT. KEVIN’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAWN

           Greg sits in his car, engine idling. The clock reads: 6:46. 
           He’s been waiting for awhile. He throws on the hazard lights, 
           steps out of the car, and jogs over to the entrance.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAWN

           Greg knocks on Kevin’s door. There is no answer. He tries the 
           knob... It turns. He cautiously enters the apartment.  

           INT. KEVIN’S APARTMENT - DAWN

           Daggers of sunlight peek through the blinds, revealing the 
           disarray: A potted plant knocked over, two empty bottles of 
           champagne, the bookshelf laying on its side, books scattered 
           across the floor. Greg tiptoes through the destruction into: 

           KEVIN’S BEDROOM

           Kevin, in boxers, is passed out on the bare mattress. The 
           pillows, sheets and comforter lay on the floor. There’s a 
           topless woman wearing a Mexican wrestling mask and shiny gold 
           underpants asleep next to him. Greg gathers his courage, 
           kneels down to Kevin’s side, and shakes his shoulder gently 
           to rouse him. Kevin groans. Greg jumps. He leans in.

                                 GREG
                        Hey, big guy. We’ve gotta get this 
                        show on the road.  

                                 KEVIN
                        I can’t go man. I’m annihilated. Go 
                        on. I’ll grab another flight. 

                                 GREG
                        I don’t know, Kevin. Um, come on. 
                        We can do this. Here.

           Greg pulls Kevin out of bed by his arm, and wraps it over his  
           shoulder. He walks Kevin towards the bathroom.

           KEVIN’S BATHROOM

           Greg helps Kevin into the shower. Kevin sways slightly.

                                 GREG
                        Steady there. Steady.  

           KEVIN’S BEDROOM

           Greg sits down on the bed, and sighs.
                                 LULU (O.S.)
                        How you doing, playboy?

           Greg, startled, stands up quickly, turns around, and realizes 
           LULU, 22, the mexican-wrestling-mask lady is speaking to him.  

                                 GREG
                        Uh... Hi. Hello.

                                 LULU
                        What’s your vice, sweetness? Are 
                        you a bad boy?  

                                 GREG
                        Me? No. Sorry. I’m a regular boring 
                        guy. Sorry.

                                 LULU
                        Mmmmmmm. Vanilla. That’s a flavor. 
                        So, you wanna eat me out or 
                        something? Taste my flavor?

           Lulu crawls across the bed towards him. Uneasy, Greg retreats 
           backwards towards the wall as she advances.  

                                 GREG
                        That’s very generous and all but... 
                        I’m sorry, I have a girlfriend, and 
                        she’s really into fidelity. Kevin!

                                 LULU
                        Well, what are you into? Don’t be 
                        shy. Tell me you’re a bad boy.  
                        Someone needs to be punished.

           Lulu leans in, takes his hand, and pulls it to her butt. He 
           quickly yanks his hand free. Without averting his gaze from 
           Lulu, Greg bangs his hand against the bathroom door.  

                                 GREG
                        Rapido amigo! We’re gonna miss our 
                        flight. I’ll be in the car! Hurry 
                        up, okay?!  
                             (to Lulu)
                        Nice to have met you.  

           Greg shakes Lulu’s hand, dashes out the door, slamming it 
           behind him, and heads downstairs at thunderbolt speed.

           INT. GREG’S CAR - DAWN

           Kevin tosses his luggage in the trunk and gets in. 
                                 GREG
                        Kevin, not to intrude, who’s the 
                        feral psychotic in the Mexican 
                        wrestling mask?

                                 KEVIN
                        She told me her name’s Lulu. I’m 
                        guessing that’s a stage name. 
                        Redheads. Always a hint of crazy, 
                        but every blue moon, you hit the 
                        jackpot. Batshit. 

                                 GREG
                        How’d you know she was a redhead?  
                        She’s wearing a mask.  

           Kevin shoots Greg a look of disbelief.

                                 GREG
                        Gotcha.

           Greg shifts into gear. Kevin pulls a joint out of his coat 
           pocket, and presses in the cigarette lighter.

                                 KEVIN
                        Mind if I burn? Calms the pre-
                        flight nerves.

           Greg doesn’t voice his the objection evident on his face. 
           Kevin lights the joint and takes a drag. He offers it to 
           Greg, before leaning his seat way back.

                                 GREG
                        Thanks. I’m all set. Kevin, can you 
                        at least crack your window? 

                                 KEVIN
                        Wild stuff last night. You ever, 
                        you know, put a nine volt down 
                        underneath your balls?

                                 GREG
                        A nine volt battery?

                                 KEVIN
                        A few months ago Lindsay came over. 
                        She’s a middle reliever I keep in 
                        the bullpen for weeknights. Anyway, 
                        we’re changing the batteries in the 
                        smoke detectors. One thing leads to 
                        another. You lick a nine volt 
                        battery and put it against your 
                        chode during sex. Turns out, when 
                        you climax, fireworks. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KEVIN (CONT'D)

                        into gold. You can literally singe 
                        the minge. It’s a K Russell Orig. 
                        But yours if you need it. Point is, 
                        Lulu dug the spark. Lucha libre. 

           Greg stops the car, leans over and lowers Kevin’s window.

                                 GREG
                        One day, you’re gonna end up 
                        convicted.

                                 KEVIN
                        Or recipient of a MacArthur 
                        Fellowship. Yours if you need it.  

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Greg sips coffee while making revisions to notecards. Stoned, 
           Kevin fumbles around in the seat pocket, pulls out the air 
           sickness bag, sniffs it, and then puts his hand in it and 
           begins puppeteering, playfully improvising a song.

                                 KEVIN
                        Vomitsaurus on the prowl. Who am I 
                        gonna eat now? Gregory, bite.  
                        Gregory, bite. Gregory, Gregory. 
                        Chew, chew, chew. 

           Greg pulls the puppet/puke bag off Kevin’s arm. Kevin 
           chuckles. Greg turns back to his notecards.   

           EXT. CAR RENTAL PARKING LOT - DAY

           Kevin, clearly disappointed, stands in front of an emerald 
           Pontiac Grand Prix with chrome-look wheels. Greg is leaving a 
           voicemail for Tiff. Kevin loads the luggage into the trunk.

                                 GREG
                        Hey babe. Just wanted to let you 
                        know we landed safely. We’re 
                        getting the car now. I’ll call you 
                        tonight from the hotel. Much love.
                             (his phone beeps)
                        Tiff?  

                                 DARBY
                        Greg, it’s Darby. I wanted to check 
                        in and see how your flight was?

                                 GREG
                        Oh hey! It was fine, thanks. Short.
                                 DARBY
                        Before I forget, good luck this 
                        week. Knock their socks off, okay?

                                 GREG
                        I’ll leave ‘em barefoot. I gotta 
                        run, Darby. Have a good one.
                             (hangs up, notices Kevin)
                        What? I got us the upgrade. Grand 
                        Prix’s the Cadillac of Pontiacs.  

                                 KEVIN
                        You know Greg, with a solid tail 
                        wind and the grace of God, I think 
                        we might actually be able to get 
                        this panty dropper going fast 
                        enough to get a speeding ticket.  

           We notice there’s a RENTAL GUY with a clipboard standing to 
           the side of them.

                                 RENTAL GUY
                        You sure you don’t want collision 
                        coverage, or loss damage waiver, or 
                        anything on this?

                                 KEVIN
                        Insurance on a rental car? Are you 
                        kidding me, you little rascal? Run 
                        your scam on the next guy.     

           Kevin grabs the keys from Rental Guy, and gets in the car.

           INT. HOTEL RECEPTION AREA - DAY

           People in retro-futuristic garb dot the lobby, socializing.  
           Kevin and Greg are checking in with RONNIE, desk clerk.  

                                 RONNIE
                        We have you gentlemen down in the 
                        system for a business suite.  

                                 GREG
                        I don’t understand. It should be 
                        for two rooms. I confirmed two. 

                                 KEVIN
                        I’ve been waiting years to frolic 
                        in the pastures of Wisco’s cornfed 
                        goddesses. Having a roommate kinda 
                        puts a damper on that, chief. 
                             (to Greg)
                        Not a judgement on you.
           Greg shakes his head to show he isn’t offended.

                                 RONNIE
                        Oooph. I’m very sorry. Right now 
                        there’s nothing I can do. What the 
                        computer says is gospel. We’re 
                        booked solid with both of the 
                        conventions going on.  

                                 KEVIN
                        There’s more than one convention?

                                 RONNIE
                        It’s Steampunk Midwest this week. 

           He points to a group of women in Steampunk attire crossing 
           the lobby. One of them, LAUREL NESMITH, 20’s, appears to 
           Kevin like a vision. He’s struck with a thunderbolt.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Whoa. Whoazie whoa. What is her 
                        story? I would rochambeau that in a 
                        heartbeat.  
                             (to Steampunks)
                        Hello! Hi!  

           The Steampunk women eye Kevin and keep walking. 

                                 RONNIE
                        Here are your keys. If there’s 
                        anything we can do to make your 
                        stay more enjoyable, please let us 
                        know.  

           INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - COCKTAIL PARTY - NIGHT

           Everyone is dressed formally. Except for Kevin and Greg in 
           their polo shirts and khakis, who survey the crowd. Kevin 
           blocks the path of a waiter carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres 
           and grabs a couple satay skewers.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Sorry chief. Starving over here. 

           RACHEL, a rep in business attire, descends on Kevin.

                                 KEVIN
                        Rachel from Wilmington. You are 
                        still a jawdropper.

           Rachel punches him in the jaw, sending him to the floor.
                                 RACHEL
                        How’s that for a dropped jaw? Huh, 
                        joker? Can’t duck that call!

           Rachel storms off. Greg helps Kevin up.

                                 GREG
                        What happened there?

                                 KEVIN
                        I don’t know. Honestly it could’ve 
                        been a million things. Whatever it 
                        was, I’m sure I deserved it. I 
                        realize I can be a terrible person 
                        sometimes but don’t go thinking 
                        she’s some saint either. ‘Cause 
                        saints have a gag reflex. 

           Greg recognizes the P&T Committee from TWR across the room.

                                 GREG
                        Hey, there they are. Our P&T’ers.

                                 KEVIN
                        Good spot. Raise your sails. We’re 
                        going to sea.  

           Kevin and Greg, in full-sale mode, swoop in, on fire, each 
           targeting a grouping of P&T’ers.

                                 GREG
                        Dr. Levinson, Dr. Martinez. Greg 
                        Weinstock, Burlington Labs.

                                 DR. LEVINSON
                        So Greg Weinstock, are you the new 
                        Sheera or the new Mandy?

           Greg considers for a moment whether to go for a joke.

                                 GREG
                        I guess whichever one had balls.

           An uncomfortable beat. DR. LEVINSON and DR. MARTINEZ chuckle.  
           Greg beams. Kevin is hitting it off with MANZUR.

                                 KEVIN
                        Fly fishing? Get outta town. My old 
                        man used to drag me outta the house 
                        at dawn to go nymphing for browns 
                        and brookies  What are you all up 
                        to tomorrow? I say we go wade a 
                        river. It’d be a blast.   
                                 MANZUR
                        It would, but Dr. Chrohl keeps the 
                        schedule. She just tells us where 
                        to show up and you know...

                                 KEVIN
                        Gotcha. I’ll check with her, see 
                        what we can do to make this happen. 

           Greg’s already mid-conversation with DR. DEBORAH CROHL, chair 
           of the P&T committee, when Kevin interrupts.

                                 GREG
                        We all know oral delivery will 
                        always be flawed for certain 
                        patients. But a transdermal patch 
                        still isn’t the holy grail of 
                        dosage forms, at least not--

                                 KEVIN
                        Doctor Crohl. Nice to finally meet 
                        you. Kevin Russell, Burlington 
                        Labs. Greg and I would love to get 
                        some extra facetime with the 
                        committee just ‘cause you don’t 
                        know us yet.

                                 DEBORAH
                        We’re already having our dinner 
                        with you tomorrow night. And also, 
                        a breakfast. I don’t think--

                                 KEVIN
                        And we’re very amped for those. But 
                        how well are you gonna get to know 
                        us over a dinner, really?   

                                 DEBORAH
                        Kevin, we’ve got a heavy schedule 
                        this week. How much time are we 
                        talking about, here?  

                                 KEVIN
                        Minimal. Maybe a spa day for the 
                        gals, and fly fishing for the boys.  
                        Spa day. You can’t say no to a spa 
                        day. It’s a stressful week. Why not 
                        take a couple of hours for you? 
                        Manzur’s onboard.  

           Dr. Crohl checks the calendar on her blackberry.
                                 DEBORAH
                        We might be able to make something 
                        work tomorrow. Tentatively.

                                 KEVIN
                        Tentatively. That’ll work. Thank 
                        you, Doctor Crohl.  

                                 DEBORAH
                        Note for the file. I prefer Debbie.

                                 KEVIN
                        Debbie.  

           Deborah walks away. Kevin and Greg are hitting their groove.  
           It seems like smooth sailing. Kevin smiles. Distant laughter.  
           Kevin looks over to the P&T’ers, and his smile is suddenly 
           extinguished, as he’s struck with worry.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Either Connor and Todd underwent 
                        gender reassignment surgery or 
                        we’re waist deep in catastrophe.  

                                 GREG
                        What? What just happened? 

                                 KEVIN
                        Sheera and Mandy just happened.

           Greg turns and sees SHEERA REUBENS, 30, and MANDY JONES, 24, 
           both sexy cut-throat reps, surrounded by the P&T’ers. Sheera 
           is an elegant beauty, who’s used her looks all her life to 
           get her way. Mandy is her promiscuous protégé.

                                 GREG
                        What are they doing talking to the 
                        P&T’ers? Kevin, if we’re selling 
                        against Sheera and Mandy, how effed 
                        are we?

                                 KEVIN
                        At this point, man, practically 
                        pregnant. If S and M have flipped 
                        to Floretech, we’re trespassing on 
                        their turf. We’re gonna have to 
                        switch things up, play dirty, or 
                        else we’re lambs for the slaughter.

                                 GREG
                        No, Uh uh. The plan is good. We’re 
                        sticking with the plan. What we 
                        should do is go call Ressler.
                                 KEVIN
                        No. That’s exactly what we should 
                        not do. We’re baby birds dropped 
                        from the nest and this is when we 
                        spread our wings and kick ass. I’m 
                        grabbing myself a cocktail. 

           Kevin heads to the bar. 

           The warmth the P&T'ers showed to Kevin and Greg proves to be 
           nothing compared to the reception they give Sheera & Mandy.  

                                 SHEERA
                        My fellas!

           Sheera kisses Manzur and Beev on the cheek.

                                 MANZUR
                        Hey sweetness.

                                 BEEV
                        Sheera, I think you actually got 
                        prettier this year.  

                                 SHEERA
                        Well, cheers to that.   

           Greg walks closer and discreetly observes as Mandy interacts 
           with MARISSA and DR. DEMPSEY. They’re looking at photographs.

                                 MANDY
                        You’re kidding me! That’s Ethan?  
                        Oh my lord. He’s getting so tall. 
                        How old is he now?  

                                 DR. DEMPSEY
                        Seven. He just turned.

                                 MANDY
                        Oh. He is precious. What a 
                        beautiful family you’ve got there. 
                        You’re just a bunch of buttons.  

                                 DR. DEMPSEY
                        That’s so sweet. How about you? No 
                        boy’s got you on lockdown, yet?

                                 MANDY
                        No, thank goodness. Too much fun 
                        playing the field, I guess.

           Mandy places her arm on Marissa’s shoulder as all three break 
           into a giggle. Greg grimaces.  
           Standing at the bar, Kevin looks to his right. Sheera is 
           holding court with some of the P&T’ers. Sheera flashes a 
           smile and begins her approach towards Kevin. She’s the one 
           woman in the world who MAKES HIM LOSE HIS MIND.  

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        Oh no. Be strong. Stay strong. Stay 
                        on path. Jesus. Someone tie me to 
                        the mast.

                                 SHEERA
                        Hiya, stranger.

           Kevin can’t look her in the eye. He focuses on his drink.

                                 KEVIN
                        I can’t talk to you.

                                 SHEERA
                        Why not? Just talking won’t hurt 
                        anybody, will it?  

           Kevin can’t help himself. He looks up at her.

                                 KEVIN
                        How are you doing, Sheera?  

                                 SHEERA
                        Really great, thanks. Floretech has 
                        been a blast. Sefamben finally 
                        completed FDA trials so we’re just 
                        gearing up for that launch.

                                 KEVIN
                        Sefamben?  

                                 SHEERA
                        It's a topical sedative anesthetic 
                        hybrid, delivered as cherry 
                        flavored mouthwash that makes your 
                        whole mouth go numb like that. And 
                        then, lights out. Instant. Oral 
                        surgeons are bonkers for it. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Nice. Well, I’m just gonna throw it 
                        out there. How about we go 
                        upstairs, turn the lights out and I 
                        make you go numb?

                                 SHEERA
                        You’re not supposed to be talking 
                        to me, I thought. I’m dangerous.  
                                 KEVIN
                        Be as it may, it’s worth the risk. 
                        I miss your body. Your everything.  

                                 SHEERA
                        It’s past my bedtime. How about a 
                        rain check? 

                                 KEVIN
                        Sheera, don’t do this to me.  

                                 SHEERA
                        Goodnight, Kev.

           She kisses him on the cheek and struts off to rejoin Mandy.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Eighteen year single malt. Neat.

                                 BARTENDER JOHNNY
                        Tough night?

                                 KEVIN
                        None of your business, Calhoun. So, 
                        if you could pour me this much,
                        we’ll be all set.

           Bartender Johnny pours until the glass is full. Greg taps 
           Kevin on the shoulder.  

                                 GREG
                        What were you doing with Sheera?

                                 KEVIN
                        Just now? Nothing. Just trash 
                        talking the competition. 

                                 GREG
                        You seemed awfully cozy. Don’t yank 
                        me around, Kevin. What kind of 
                        history do you have with her? 

                                 KEVIN
                        The kind where she broke my heart 
                        and moved out. For the record, I 
                        was just being cordial. She’s an 
                        ex. What happened between me and 
                        her is past tense, and this week, 
                        this sale, is the present.  

                                 GREG
                        Good. I appreciate that.   
                                 KEVIN
                        But first things first, are you... 

           CARMEN, a leggy goddess in a slim-fitting BLUE cocktail dress 
           and knee-high boots across the bar catches Kevin’s eye. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Are you seeing what I’m seeing?

                                 GREG
                        I think so. You like her boots?

                                 KEVIN
                        I like where they lead. Mission 
                        Control, cross your fingers for me.  

                                 GREG
                        No. Uh-uh. We can’t just go off 
                        course every time you see a pretty 
                        girl. What about Sheera and Mandy?  

                                 KEVIN
                        What about them? Greg, a man, a 
                        plan, a canal. Poontang.

           Kevin stands and strides towards Carmen.

                                 CARMEN
                        Big drink.

                                 KEVIN
                        Big boy.

                                 CARMEN
                        Big Boy drinking by himself?  

                                 KEVIN
                        Only a lonesome traveler in a 
                        strange town, drowning his sorrows.   
                        You here for the convention?

                                 CARMEN
                        No. You like video games?

                                 KEVIN
                        Not really my speed. 

                                 CARMEN
                        Is this your speed?

           She holds up a baggie of cocaine from her purse. She leans 
           in, her mouth a couple of inches from his ear.
                                 CARMEN
                        Olly olly oxen free.

           Sheera and Mandy approach Greg alone at the table. He’s 
           sipping a gin and tonic and eating spanakopita.

                                 MANDY
                        You’re Kevin’s sidekick, right?  

                                 SHEERA
                        Must feel pretty exciting for you, 
                        Weinstock. First time in the 
                        majors, no DM watching over your 
                        shoulder. You’ve sure got your work 
                        cut out for you this week. Back at 
                        Burlington, they called me Medusa. 
                        Know why? ‘Cause I turn boys to 
                        stone. Just can’t help myself.  

                                 GREG
                        Hound us all you want, Sheera. 
                        We’ve got Prexiol, and you’re stuck 
                        with Zyklar, so you’re the ones 
                        playing catch up.  

                                 SHEERA
                        You two are gonna sink like a 
                        cinder block. But enjoy this 
                        vacation. Maybe the week off will 
                        help you get over your girlfriend 
                        breaking your heart and kicking you 
                        out of your own house. See you 
                        around, kiddo.

           Ouch. Salt on the wound. She’s done her research. Sheera 
           sports a smirk as she and Mandy stride away. Greg stands and 
           slowly trudges towards the exit, melancholy in every step.

           INT. HOTEL GAME ROOM - NIGHT

           Kevin and Carmen snort coke off a pinball machine.

                                 KEVIN
                        Nice. That is nice, Carmen. 

                                 CARMEN
                        You did too much coke.

                                 KEVIN
                        No no no. You did too much coke.

           Carmen playfully slaps him on the arm. He pulls her close.
                                 KEVIN
                        So, you still want to learn that 
                        secret handshake?

           Kevin takes Carmen’s hand and puts it against his groin.  
           They passionately grope, kiss and fondle while pressed up 
           against the air hockey table. Their drug-fueled fling 
           progresses into the sitdown POLE POSITION game console. 

                                 KEVIN
                        You might wanna buckle your 
                        seatbelt. 

           The image fades to black until we hear only their breathing.   

           INT. SHARED HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Sheera’s attack has sent Greg spiraling. The carpet is 
           littered with empty minibar bottles. Greg is staring down the 
           telephone. He picks up and dials. It rings. Voicemail.

                                 TIFF (O.S.)
                        Hey, it’s Tiff. I’m not here. And I 
                        guess you are. Joke’s on you. 
                             (beep)

                                 GREG
                        Hi. It’s me again. I don’t know if 
                        you’re avoiding my calls or what. 
                        My heart’s not a faucet. I can’t 
                        just stop having feelings for you, 
                        you know? Shit. I miss you, Tiff.  

           He hangs up. Beat. He lifts the receiver and dials again.  
           And once again, reaches her voicemail.

                                 TIFF (O.S.)
                        Hey, it’s Tiff. I’m not here. And I 
                        guess you are. Joke’s on you.  
                             (beep)

                                 GREG
                        I might be drunk right now. But 
                        that doesn’t mean what I’m saying 
                        isn’t true. I know I fucked up. I’m 
                        sorry about the budget meetings and 
                        anything else I ever did wrong. 
                        Tiff, can you call me? Just call me 
                        back. That’s all I’m asking. Okay.

           Greg hangs up and lies down on the bed. He turns on the 
           television, and flips through channels. He comes to a stop.  
           ON GREG’S TV:

           SUZIE LU, the informercial host babe dressed in spandex, is 
           standing beside, AMBER, a model lying down beneath THE 
           ABLIMINATOR. Amber is holding onto the handles and thrusting 
           in the air. Suzie stands to the side.

                                 SUZIE
                        See how easy it is. Just thrust the 
                        fat away! Breathe and thrust. See 
                        the range of motion. Relax. Now 
                        rise up. And one, two, three, four, 
                        five, six, seven, and eight. 
                        Awesome work, Amber. Okay, relax.

           Greg’s eyes widen. A hazardous endeavor comes to mind. The 
           alarm clock beckons. Greg pulls out the 9-volt battery, and 
           considers the possibilities. Unable to resist his urges, Greg 
           runs to the door and hangs the “Do Not Disturb” sign.

           ON GREG’S TV:

           Suzie straddles Amber. 

                                 SUZIE
                        Come on, Amber. Show them how you 
                        work it. And thrust. And thrust. 
                        You see how strong she is? Buckin’ 
                        bronco. Recognize the power. 

           ON GREG

           We’re tight on Greg’s face as he’s masturbating; quick 
           shallow breaths; his heart racing. He’s getting closer and 
           closer. He lifts the 9-Volt battery to his tongue:

           A SIZZLE as they meet. He drops the battery down between his 
           legs, and there’s a BUZZ. Greg moans as he climaxes.  

                                 GREG
                        Eureka.

           The SPERM launches across the room and lands right against an 
           electrical outlet. A spark SIZZLES in the puddle.

                                 GREG
                        Uh oh.  

           INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           Kevin stands in the elevator in his briefs, clothes tucked 
           under his arms, his nostrils white and powdery. OLD TIMER, a 
           formally dressed Steampunk, stares him down, disapprovingly.  
                                 KEVIN
                        There was a car accident. Horrific.  
                        Everyone’s okay, thank God. But my 
                        clothes got ripped off in the 
                        impact.

                                 OLD TIMER
                        Bullshit. You a gigolo or a sex 
                        offender?

                                 KEVIN
                        Depends on the girl, old timer.  

           The elevator comes to a stop. Kevin pats Old Timer on the 
           shoulder, and steps off.  

           INT. KEVIN’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           The lights and television go out. The emergency FLOODLIGHTS 
           turn on. SPARKS start shooting out of the outlet as though 
           Greg’s hit Robert Redford’s home run in “The Natural”.

                                 GREG
                        Oh boy.    

           The in-room sprinklers rain down, while sparks continue to 
           rocket forth. Greg is frantic, unsure how to stop this.

                                 GREG
                        No no no no! This isn’t happening. 
                        This is not happening. Oh god. 
                        Someone please make this stop.  

           There’s a KNOCK. Greg looks over to the door.

                                 GREG
                        Wha- Yeah? Hello? Uh, everything’s 
                        fine in here! 

                                 KEVIN (O.S.)
                        Hey man. As it’s raining in the 
                        hotel, maybe we can go grab a 
                        drink?

                                 GREG
                        Um, sure. Can you give me like ten 
                        minutes?   

                                 KEVIN (O.S.)
                        No. I’m not waiting out here in the 
                        monsoon while you can switch out of 
                        your goddamn pajamas. I’ll see you 
                        downstairs.
           Sparks slowly die down and the sprinklers stop. The 
           infomercial continues to play. 

           EXT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Kevin looks down and notices the Do Not Disturb sign on the 
           door. Kevin shakes his head as he walks away, drenched from 
           the sprinklers. He crosses paths with a group of firemen.

           INT. WOLSKI’S TAVERN - NIGHT

           A small contingent of USHC attendees in suits hold down a 
           corner of the bar, sipping martinis. The rest of the room is 
           dominated by Steampunks. Soaking wet, Kevin and Greg share a 
           booth, enjoying their growlers of beer. Kevin’s now dressed. 
           He’s also barefoot.  

                                 KEVIN
                        We hit it off, and you know, one 
                        line of coke led to another, and 
                        soon enough, Pole Position. I 
                        would’ve gone for the treasure but 
                        alas, quelled by coke dick.  

                                 GREG
                        Good. Sounds good, man.

                                 KEVIN
                        Who was the girl in the room?

                                 GREG
                        What room? Our room? There wasn’t a 
                        girl in there.  
                             (realizes)
                        Oh yeah... The girl, in our room.

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah. The girl. Do Not Disturb? You 
                        seem weird.  

                                 GREG
                        What? Weird? Me? How?

                                 KEVIN
                        Distracted. Unsettled. Is 
                        everything alright?  

                                 GREG
                        Um...
                             (confesses)
                        I took the power out.
                                 KEVIN
                        What?

                                 GREG
                        I took the power out. It was me. 
                        You neglected to mention a nine 
                        volt battery would turn my penis 
                        into a weapon. I could’ve hurt 
                        someone, man. I’m feeling pretty 
                        horrible about myself right now.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Horrible? Nine volts to the gooch!  
                        And you sir, are a degenerate. 
                        Welcome aboard.  

                                 GREG
                        Ugh. I’m going to church in the 
                        morning. First thing.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Church? What, why? Are you going to 
                        confession? Oh, come on, you think 
                        God cares? You didn’t hurt anyone. 
                        Except maybe a thimbleful of 
                        tadpoles. Can’t you just tell this 
                        shit to your rabbi?

                                 GREG
                        No, my rabbi knows me. But with 
                        church, I’m under the radar. Also, 
                        some of this stuff just can’t wait 
                        ‘til Yom Kippur. I’m just trying to 
                        get rid of the guilt and get some 
                        self-control in my life, y’know?  

                                 KEVIN
                        Self control? What are you talking 
                        about, self control? Rubbing one 
                        out isn’t a crime. It’s a God given 
                        right. We’re men. If we want to 
                        scratch our balls, we scratch them. 
                        Freedom. If I want to warm up a 
                        twinkie in the microwave, and then 
                        put my penis in it, in the comfort 
                        of my own home, even if it’s a 
                        dream destined to fail, I do, 
                        unfettered by guilt or common 
                        sense. You can’t relinquish your 
                        manhood, so fuck self control. 
                        Well, no use crying over spilled 
                        paisley. This calls for revelry.
           Kevin stands and heads towards the bar. He runs into Laurel, 
           the Steampunk girl from the lobby.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Sorry, I don’t mean to intrude on 
                        your evening, but I would take a 
                        kick to the groin for your number.

                                 LAUREL
                        That’s oddly sexual.

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m oddly sexual, so maybe that 
                        fits. Remind me your name again.

                                 LAUREL
                        I never told you.

           She joins her friends as they make their way out. Kevin’s 
           fascinated by her. He remembers Greg in the booth.    

                                 KEVIN
                             (to entire room)
                        My boy just discovered electricity! 
                        A round for everyone!  

           The Steampunks cheer. Kevin and Greg toast strangers to 
           inventors and machines, i.e. Nikola Tesla, Ben Franklin, 
           Toaster Ovens, The Van Der Graaf Generator, Lightbulbs, etc.

                                 GREG
                        Thunderstorms in Alsace Lorraine 
                        tonight, baby!

                                 KEVIN
                        Thunderstorms? What?

                                 GREG
                        Alsace Lorraine. You know, caught 
                        between my France and my Germany.

           Kevin howls and reaches over the bar for a bottle of bourbon.  

                                 KEVIN
                             (hoarse)
                        Gimme the bottle, gimme the bottle!  
                        Here’s to deviant sex acts!  

           He holds the bottle high, brings it to his mouth, and chugs.  

           INT. TAXI - NIGHT

           Greg’s head is against the window. This cab ride is torture.
                                 KEVIN
                             (singing obstreperously)
                        I had some dreams, they were clouds 
                        in my coffee, clouds in my coffee! 
                        And you’re so vain! You probably 
                        think this song is about you.  
                        You’re so vain! You’re so vain!  I 
                        bet you think this song is about 
                        you. Don’t you? Don’t you? Don’t 
                        you? Don’t you? Don’t you?

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Greg steers a very drunk and barefoot Kevin down the hallway.

                                 KEVIN
                        I cannot drive a car. I should not 
                        drive a car. Yes sir.

           Kevin, an “I Closed Wolski’s” bumper sticker on his back, a 
           beer bottle sticking out from his shirt pocket, stops at a 
           room service table and begins polishing off cold, leftover 
           french fries. Greg pulls Kevin away, and they continue on 
           down the hall. Kevin drops the round metal lid.

                                 KEVIN
                        Goodnight hallway. Goodnight 
                        landscape painting. Goodnight 
                        little ketchup bottle. The floor is 
                        soaking. Where are my shoes?

            A GROUP OF FEMALE REPS are coming from the other direction.  

                                 JANE
                        Kevin? Kevin Russell?

                                 KEVIN
                        Hey you. Wait...  
                             (remembers)
                        I fucked you once!  

                                 GREG
                        Sorry. He was thirsty.

           Greg helps a chuckling Kevin along.  

                                 GREG
                        And this is us. 

           Greg opens the door to their room. Kevin grabs Greg by both 
           shoulders and roars in his face.
                                 KEVIN
                        Let’s not make the laws. Let’s 
                        break the laws, brother. Huzzah!

           Kevin kisses Greg on top of the head, and proceeds to put him 
           in a headlock.

                                 KEVIN
                        Who’s my partner in crime? Who is 
                        it? I can’t hear you, little guy.  

                                 GREG
                        I can’t breathe.  

           INT. KEVIN’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Kevin and Greg are lying side-by-side under the covers. 

                                 GREG
                        You have to sleep naked?

                                 KEVIN
                        It’s a biological fact: balls need 
                        to breathe. 

           Kevin burps. Greg reaches over and turns off the lamp.

           TITLE CARD: WEDNESDAY

           INT. KEVIN’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           The phone rings. Kevin, facedown on the floor, groans. He 
           crawls over, climbs up onto the bed, and lifts the handset.

                                 KEVIN
                        Hello?

                                 CHEERY PHONE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Good morning! This is your wake up 
                        call!

                                 KEVIN
                        You fucking bitchass! I feel like 
                        shit. I feel like Jesus on the 
                        motherfucking cross! You call me 
                        again, I swear to God, I will 
                        skullfuck you blind, and salvo my 
                        seed upon your smug face.  

           He slams the phone down, turns onto his side, and curls up.  
           Greg, wearing a bathrobe, rushes out from the bathroom.  
                                 GREG
                        You alright? I heard yelling.

           Kevin groans and pulls the pillow over his head. Greg sits on 
           the edge of the bed, picks up the receiver and dials.

                                 GREG
                        Yes, just some breakfast. I’ll have 
                        the lumberjack. Scrambled, please.  
                        Bacon. That’s fine. Uh, grapefruit?  
                        Super. One sec.  
                             (covers mouthpiece)
                        Kevin? Hey, Kevin.

                                 KEVIN
                        Whaaaat? What the fuck, man?

                                 GREG
                        You want oatmeal or something?

                                 KEVIN
                        If they have a saline IV... 
                        Otherwise, just a loaded gun, so I 
                        can shoot myself in the fuckin’ 
                        head and die in peace. Oh my 
                        Christ! What did I drink?

                                 GREG
                        Aspirin and a bottle of sparkling 
                        water. That should do it. Thanks.
                             (to Kevin)
                        You’re doing good, buddy.  

           Greg hangs up, and pats Kevin’s shoulder. Without looking up, 
           Kevin lifts his hand and flips the bird. There’s a knock on 
           the door. The maid enters. It’s CARMEN from the night before.

                                 CARMEN
                        Housecleaning. 

                                 GREG
                        Oh. Hi. I think we’re good. Can 
                        you, uh, come back later?  

                                 CARMEN
                        Yes sir.

                                 GREG
                        Perfect. Thanks.

           Kevin sees Carmen, makes eye contact, and mouths a hello.  
           She leaves. Greg flips through Milwaukee Magazine.
                                 KEVIN
                        Greg, The maid, um...

                                 GREG
                        Don’t worry. She’ll come back. 
                        You’ll get your fresh towels.

                                 KEVIN
                        That’s wonderful about fresh towels 
                        but, Greg, I think I fingerblasted 
                        the maid.

                                 GREG
                        What do you mean, you think?

                                 KEVIN
                        I mean... I did. Last night.

                                 GREG
                        The housecleaning lady is the woman 
                        in the blue dress? Holy whoa. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Well... I didn’t know she was a 
                        maid, let alone our maid.  

                                 GREG
                        Awesome. We’re here for less than 
                        twenty-four hours and you’ve 
                        already given the hotel maid the 
                        scout salute.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Yes, it’s all true. I third based 
                        the help. I’m going back to sleep.  
                        Wake me up when I’m not hungover.

                                 GREG
                        I picked up our badges. Here.

           Greg throws Kevin his badge.

                                 GREG
                        I’m moving down the hall.

                                 KEVIN
                        Was it the gas parade?

                                 GREG
                        That, and you sleep nuzzle.

                                 KEVIN
                        A warm body is a warm body, man.
                                 GREG
                        Not when there’s morning wood 
                        poking me in the shoulder.

                                 KEVIN
                        Roosters crow at dawn. Don’t put 
                        the blame on me. I thought they 
                        were booked solid this week.

                                 GREG
                        I greased some palms and they set 
                        me up in a spare room, of sorts.

                                 KEVIN
                        How much it cost you?

                                 GREG
                        Gratis, aside from a couple boxes 
                        of muscle relaxant samples I 
                        grabbed from the booth.   

                                 KEVIN
                        You know, you’re not half bad at 
                        this game. Nicely navigated, kid.

                                 GREG
                        Your van leaves at eleven. Are you 
                        still up for the fishing trip?  

                                 KEVIN
                        Of course. Just gotta rouse the 
                        bones. A little hair of the dog.

           Kevin reaches for an open bottle of beer on the nightstand, 
           and takes a sip. His stomach turns. A wave of nausea.

                                 KEVIN
                        Or not. Get me a bucket. A bucket. 
                        Now. I, I gotta yuke.

                                 GREG
                        Is that beer from last night?

                                 KEVIN
                        Bucket!

           EXT. SCENIC GENTLE RIVERBANK - DAY

           On the banks, clothed in full Orvis attire, Kevin sips a 
           bloody mary. He’s speaking with Manzur, who’s in the water, 
           fly-fishing with the other guys from the P&T committee. 
                                 KEVIN
                        Prexiol. Zyklar. Both pills that do 
                        the same exact thing, right? Wrong. 
                        That’s like saying every snowflake 
                        is the same. Or every blowjob.  
                        ‘Cause they’re not.  

                                 MANZUR
                        Kev, could you grab me a cold one?

           Kevin grabs a beer from the cooler. He wades into the river 
           and hands the can to Manzur.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Here you are, Manzur. Breakfast of 
                        champions.

           Kevin ambles back onto the shore. He picks up his glass and 
           takes a sip. Dr. Martinez throws back to cast, and the HOOK 
           FLIES BACK, right into Kevin’s CROTCH. Predictably, Kevin 
           SHRIEKS. The bloody mary falls to the ground.

                                 KEVIN
                        Balls balls balls! Don’t cast!

           Dr. Martinez turns his head in Kevin’s direction.

                                 DR. MARTINEZ
                        Whoops. You okay there, Kev?

                                 KEVIN
                        I feel like a million bucks. A 
                        million bucks drenched in gasoline, 
                        set aflame. Fuck! My balls.

                                 MANZUR
                        Haha! Look at the size of this son 
                        of a beeyotch!  

           Everyone looks to Manzur, who’s hooked an impressive trout.

           INT. DAYSPA - MANI/PEDI ROOM - DAY

           Greg, in a bathrobe, gets his feet worked on as he speaks 
           with Deborah. The other gal P&T’ers are listening. 

                                 GREG
                        Debbie, I'm not saying that 
                        financial considerations shouldn't 
                        play a role in your formulary.

                        But if I was receiving inpatient 
                        care at a TWR facility, I’d 
                        certainly hope I was undergoing the 
                        most effective treatment available.  

                                 DEBORAH
                        Greg, you honestly feel which PPI 
                        we use has any relation to the 
                        quality of care we offer?

           SPA LADY leans her head in.

                                 SPA LADY
                        Mister Weinstock, telephone call. 

                                 GREG
                        Excuse me, Debbie. Sorry.  

           Greg steps out to the hallway and lifts a wall mounted phone.

                                 GREG
                        This is Greg. Hello?

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

           Kevin, wearing a hospital gown, sits in a wheelchair.

                                 KEVIN
                        Why’s your cellphone off?

           INTERCUT

                                 GREG
                        Spa rules. I can’t talk now. We’re 
                        getting mani-pedi’s.

                                 KEVIN
                        Sounds like a hoot. Dr. Martinez 
                        miscast, and now I’ve got a fish 
                        hook through my nutsack.  

                                 GREG
                        Ugh. What’s the prognosis?  

                                 KEVIN
                        The prognosis?  The prognosis is 
                        Karma just raped me in the face. 
                        I’m in the E.R. about to get my 
                        prune satchel stitched up by a 
                        wonky eyed intern, and you’re off 
                        playing beauty school. Are you 
                        getting a massage over there today?
                                 GREG
                        Yeah, in fact, we all are.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Ask for a happy ending. Do it for 
                        me, in my honor.  

                                 GREG
                        What’s the matter with you? No way 
                        in hell! I’ve got a girlfriend.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Girlfriend? Tiff broke up with you, 
                        champ. Thusly, you've got free rein 
                        to ask for hanj-es. I’d take 
                        advantage of your newfound freedom.  

                                 GREG
                        No. I’m getting back together with 
                        Tiff. That’s why I’m here. To win 
                        her back. And I’m not gonna 
                        jeopardize that with a handjob.

                                 KEVIN
                        Relax, Greg. A handjob isn’t 
                        cheating. It doesn’t count if it 
                        doesn’t go in any holes.

                                 GREG
                        That’s not true. I’m hanging up, 
                        Kevin. I’m not asking for one.

                                 KEVIN
                        You should. ‘Cause they all do it. 
                        Masseuses are like minor league 
                        prostitutes. It’s part of the gig.  
                        An unspoken understanding. 

                                 GREG
                        Right, of course. That makes a lot 
                        of sense. Stop trying to talk me 
                        into filth. I’m not doing it, okay?  
                        Last night with the battery was 
                        more than enough iniquity for one 
                        week. Good luck with the scrote 
                        repair. 

           INT. DAYSPA - MASSAGE ROOM - DAY

           Greg is getting a deep tissue massage from SANDY, 22, a 
           sultry hipster masseuse with black bangs and copious ink.
                                 SANDY
                        You sure were tight, fella. Lots of 
                        knots. Do you feel unstressed, 
                        serene, all that good stuff?

                                 GREG
                        Yeah I do. But you know what would 
                        feel even better?  
                             (beat)
                        A happy ending.

           Sandy presses a red button on the telephone and exits.

                                 GREG
                        Wai-Wai-Wait... I was kidding. Big 
                        joke. My bad. Haha, I got you. 

           Wrapped in a towel, Greg kicks his legs off the table, and 
           goes for the door. He jiggles the handle. It’s locked. 

                                 GREG
                        This is gonna be humiliating.   

           EXT. DAYSPA - DAY

           Greg, ashamed, tries to hold onto his towel as he’s ushered 
           out the entrance by two security guards. The Dayspa workers 
           stare from the window. The guards hand Greg his clothes.

           INT. VAN - DAY

           Greg glances out the window. There’s a DONKEY standing there, 
           staring back at him. A silent moment passes between them.  
           The peace is broken when the P&T Gals start piling in.  

                                 GREG
                        I came out to the van, caught up on 
                        some calls.

           The P&T Gals can’t keep a straight face, and break into 
           uncontrollable giggling. Greg blushes.

                                 GREG
                        Thank you. Not embarrassed at all. 
                        Alright, Spa Day. Good times.  

           INT. STEER HOUSE RESTAURANT - BAR - NIGHT

           Kevin is at the bar, nursing a beer. Greg approaches him.  
                                 GREG
                        How are the balls?

                                 KEVIN
                        Still intact. Five stitches. I’ll 
                        live. At least I’ve got meds to 
                        show for it.

           He pulls pill vials from his coat and shows them to Greg.

                                 GREG
                        Excellent. Now we can sedate an 
                        entire sorority if need be.

                                 KEVIN
                        One can only hope an opportunity 
                        such as that presents itself. How’d 
                        you fare with the happy ending?   

                                 GREG
                        She called Security. FYI Professor: 
                        Not all masseuses do it.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Every masseuse I know does.

                                 GREG
                        That’s ‘cause all your masseuses 
                        are South Asian hookers. I’m now 
                        blacklisted from every dayspa in 
                        the state of Wisconsin. 

                                 KEVIN
                        There’s always Minnesota. Let it 
                        slide man. Not worth getting upset 
                        about. Look, you’re not the one who 
                        almost got his crotch ripped out 
                        with a fishhook.  

           The P&T’ers walk in, with Sheera and Mandy in tow. Kevin 
           flags down the bartender. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Savalas, this is our crew. Whatever 
                        they want, my tab.

                                 SHEERA
                        Debbie invited us along. I hope you 
                        don’t mind us crashing?

                                 KEVIN
                        No! Of course not. The more the 
                        merrier. Boy, that is some dress, 
                        Sheera.
                                 SHEERA
                        Thanks! I actually bought it today.

                                 KEVIN
                        No kidding. Well, it fits. 

                                 GREG
                        Kevin.

                                 KEVIN
                        What’s up?  

           Greg makes a face using his eyebrows as to say “in private”.

                                 KEVIN
                        What? What does that mean?
                             (to Sheera)
                        One sec.

           Kevin walks with Greg away from the group.

                                 GREG
                        Sheera’s against us. You have to 
                        stop rolling out the red carpet for 
                        her every time she shows up.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Red carpet? What? That’s 
                        ridiculous. I’m just playing her 
                        for information. Covert ops.

                                 SHEERA
                        Boys. Sorry to interrupt. 

           They turn. Mandy is holding a tray of amber cocktails.

                                 SHEERA
                        A round on us.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Cool. What a nice gesture.  

                                 SHEERA
                        We just appreciate you guys being 
                        so cool with us this week. I know 
                        it’s an awkward situation. Anyway, 
                        it felt we got off on the wrong 
                        foot last night, so, cheers!

           Greg’s surprised by their kindness and takes a drink.  

                                 GREG
                        Cheers. Wow. This is delicious. 
                        Kinda sour. Cherry?  
           INT. STEER HOUSE RESTAURANT - PRIVATE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           P&T’ers are seated around a banquet table. Greg, stands at a 
           lectern and tries to deliver a speech about Prexiol, but his 
           speech is increasingly slurred.  

                                 GREG
                        We have a common enemy. Gastric 
                        Acid. Prexiol is the premiere PPI, 
                             (clears throat)
                        Sorry. My tongue is a little numb.

                                 MANDY
                        Someone tell the bartender to cut 
                        this guy off.  

           The P&T’ers, Sheera and Mandy are laughing.

                                 GREG
                        Haha. Good one. Anyway, enjoy 
                        dinner. Hope nobody’s a vegan.   

           Greg climbs down off the stage and joins Kevin at the table. 
           Sheera and Mandy are holding court with the P&T’ers. Kevin’s 
           mouth begins to go numb as he speaks to Greg. Greg yawns.

                                 GREG
                             (mumbling)
                        Which cut are you getting. Waygu?

                                 KEVIN
                        I can’t even understand you.  

                                 GREG
                        That’s ‘cause my mouth feels like 
                        novocaine. What time is it?  

           Greg nods his head, conks out, and falls face-first into his 
           salad. Sheera and Mandy raise their glasses towards Kevin.

                                 KEVIN
                        Sefamben! Oh shitballs. Greg, stay 
                        put. I’ll be right back.  

           Kevin jogs up to the stage, and tries to speak at the podium, 
           but is rapidly falling asleep.

                                 KEVIN
                        Just quickly, thanks all for 
                        coming. We’ve got a wonderful 
                        breakfast planned for tomorrow at 
                        the Reindeer Room.

                        Legendary waffle bar, eggs benedict 
                        up the wazoo, bloody mary's, you 
                        name it. So, I’ll see you all 
                        there? 

           Kevin’s eyes drop and he slowly collapses to the floor.  
           Sheera sneaks up to the podium, steps over Kevin, and pulls 
           the microphone towards her.  

                                 SHEERA
                        Yikes. I didn’t realize it was 
                        Spring Break this week. Don’t 
                        panic. I’m not gonna chew your ear 
                        off about Zyklar tonight. That 
                        said, any questions you may have, 
                        holler our way. If everyone could 
                        make their way outside, we’ve got 
                        the party bus ready to roar. Hope 
                        you brought your dancing shoes.

           INT. PARTY BUS - NIGHT

           Kevin wakes up and finds himself on the nearly empty party 
           bus. Greg is passed out next to him. Kevin jostles him awake.

                                 KEVIN
                        Greg.

                                 GREG
                        Ugh.  
                             (yawns)
                        How long was I out?  

                                 KEVIN
                        Greg, they flat out juiced us.  

           Kevin helps Greg up, and they walk towards the exit.

           EXT. INFERNO NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           There’s a line of people waiting to get into the club. 
           PROMETHEUS, a steroid-laden bouncer with an earpiece, lifts 
           the velvet rope for Sheera and Mandy and the P&T’ers. 

                                 PROMETHEUS
                        My ladies. Welcome back. We’ve got 
                        tables waiting for you. 

                                 MANDY
                        Thanks Prometheus.  
           Mandy kisses Prometheus on the cheek, and follows Sheera and 
           the P&T’ers in. Prometheus pulls the rope up, blocking Kevin 
           and Greg from entrance into the club.

                                 PROMETHEUS
                        Hold up. There’s the line, guys.

                                 KEVIN
                        What about them? We’re with them.

                                 PROMETHEUS
                        Those are VIP’s. You’re P’s. So you 
                        can wait with the other P’s.  

           Kevin and Greg slink to the back of the line.

           INT. INFERNO NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Kevin and Greg make their way into the packed dimly lit club. 
           The P&T’ers might be healthcare professionals, but this is a 
           Bachinallian shitshow. Body shots. Champagne popping. Marissa 
           dances lasciviously with Mandy. Sheera is cutting a rug with 
           Dr. Levinson.  

           Kevin moves in on the P&T’ers’ tables. He has to speak loudly 
           to be heard over the pulsing music. Drunk, Manzur grabs him. 

                                 MANZUR
                        What up, Dawg! We’re gonna tear the 
                        roof off this mother! C’mon!

           Manzur dances away. Kevin doesn’t follow him. He taps Sheera 
           on the shoulder. She’s surprised to see him.

                                 SHEERA
                        Look who woke up. Hey buttercup!  

           Kevin glares at her and walks towards Deborah.

                                 SHEERA
                        Gotta keep your guard up, if you 
                        wanna make it ten rounds, rookie. 
                        Fact is, you’re lucky you still 
                        have your kidneys. 

                                 KEVIN
                        We’ll see you all at breakfast. 
                        Have a good night, Debbie.

                                 DEBORAH
                        You too, Kevin! Kamikaze!
           Deborah toasts Grace and Evelyn, and then they each slam back 
           a shot. Kevin sees Greg approaching with drinks.

                                 GREG
                        This place isn’t too lame, right?  

           Manzur dances his way past them.  

                                 MANZUR
                        Lightning in my shoes, thunder in 
                        my wake! Too funky, y’all! 

                                 KEVIN
                             (to Greg)
                        Down your drink. We should cut our 
                        losses and leave.    

                                 GREG
                        Why don’t we try and make the most 
                        of this? Lemonade, Kevin. Lemonade.

                                 KEVIN
                        Greg, your heart’s in the right 
                        place, but we’re in the wrong one. 
                        Look, I’ve had a hard day. I just 
                        want to go back to the hotel, soak 
                        my feet, ice my balls, and lay low 
                        ‘til breakfast.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Kevin and Greg are walking to their rooms. Laughter, muffled 
           conversations and the faint sound of a baroque melody from a 
           harpsichord wafts from a suite. The door is slightly ajar.

                                 KEVIN
                        You hear that? There’s revelry in 
                        there. We’re going in. 

                                 GREG
                        What about taking it easy, icing 
                        your balls?  

                                 KEVIN
                             (gesticulates a scale)
                        Icing balls. The unknown. 

           INT. BRADEN’S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

           Kevin and Greg enter a room full of Steampunks. An intricate 
           brass phonograph with running gears emits Gypsy music.  
                                 GREG
                        I’m gonna grab a drink.  

                                 KEVIN
                        I’ll be right behind you.

           Greg approaches the absinthe bar. Kevin makes a beeline for a 
           pretty girl in goggles, tight-laced dress and brass-accented 
           Oxford brogues, who’s working on an intricate Heath Robinson 
           brass machine, which belches steam as it runs.

                                 KEVIN
                        Building a better mousetrap?

           Laurel, the Steampunk girl from the night before, stands.  
           She lifts her goggles so they rest on her forehead.  

                                 LAUREL
                        Something like that. Oh, you again.  
                        Why the formal getup, guy? You a 
                        weatherman?

                                 KEVIN
                        No, I’m a drug rep. I do everything 
                        I can to get doctors to write 
                        prescriptions for my company’s 
                        meds. And I’ve gotta look good 
                        doing it.  

                                 LAUREL
                        So, Mister Windsor Knot, what’s the 
                        most severe deed you’ve ever done 
                        to secure a sale?  

                                 KEVIN
                        Ever? Well, we can’t out and out 
                        bribe them, so you gotta get 
                        creative. One time, I shit you not, 
                        I gave a doctor a handjob. But it 
                        didn’t mean anything, ‘cause I 
                        didn’t look. And if you don’t look, 
                        it doesn’t count.

                                 LAUREL
                        Did it go to completion?

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah.

                                 LAUREL
                        Then I’d say it counts. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Would you like to make it count?
                                 LAUREL
                        You’re gonna have to try a little 
                        harder than that, guy. I’m just not 
                        that kind of girl.

                                 KEVIN
                        Well, what kind of girl are you?

                                 LAUREL
                        The hard to catch kind. All you’re 
                        getting from me tonight is a maybe.  

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m a glass half-full kinda guy. A 
                        maybe’s all I need. 

           CY, 40’s, an eyepatched Steampunk in naval attire, tends bar.  
           Cy pours homebrew absinthe into a plastic cup, and hands it 
           to Greg. Cy raises his own ornate goblet in a toast.

                                 CY
                        Craic.

                                 GREG
                        Craic.  

           Greg sips and forces a smile. DOUG, a shirtless mountain man 
           in a vest, pin-stripe pants and bowler hat closes in on Greg.

                                 DOUG
                        Your colleague may want to consider 
                        harboring his attentions towards 
                        that specimen. Ill-advised advances 
                        towards Steampunk dames by norms 
                        may raise ire.

                                 GREG
                        Start wearing a shirt, and people 
                        your own age might start taking you 
                        seriously. Excuse me, your honor.
                             (taps his cup)
                        Refill.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - ICE MACHINE NOOK

           Laurel and Kevin are kissing by the soda machine.  

                                 LAUREL
                        I think I’m gonna take off.

                                 KEVIN
                        I was sort of hoping you’d be 
                        taking off your clothes. 
           Kevin imitates a cymbal crash for his joke.  

                                 LAUREL
                        Sorry to disappoint. If it’s meant 
                        to be, we’ll get there. Alright?

           Kevin does a horrible job of hiding his disappointment.

                                 KEVIN
                        Of course. It’s not like I’m some 
                        restless sex fiend who constantly 
                        needs to get laid for his self-
                        esteem. This is lovely, just us 
                        talking, our getting to know each 
                        other time.  

                                 LAUREL
                        I gotta run. See you around, guy.

           Laurel plants a quick peck on his cheek and leaves. 
           Frustrated, Kevin pounds the button on the ice machine, and 
           cubes spill out across the floor. He’s not used to rejection.

           INT. GREG’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Greg’s room is actually a conference room, dominated by a 
           large oval table. Greg feverishly scribbles away on a dry-
           erase board. He’s written “Prexiol” on the left, “Zyklar” on 
           the right. Beneath each name is a column of “benefits”. Greg 
           either circles or crosses out each item as he works his way 
           through the list. He pauses and takes a sip of his absinthe. 

                                 GREG
                        Prexiol and Zyklar. Cost? 
                        Negligible. Efficacy? That’s where 
                        we come ahead. In adults, Prexiol 
                        is shown in studies time and again 
                        not only to be faster-acting...

           A pounding from the hall. Greg looks through the peephole, 
           unlocks the door, and Kevin barrels in. Kevin spots Greg’s 
           scribbles on the dry-erase board.

                                 KEVIN
                        This is how you unwind, man? I 
                        can’t let you waste a good evening 
                        on this bullshit drudgery. This, 
                        can all wait, ‘til tomorrow.

           Kevin begins wiping away Greg’s work with his sleeve. Greg 
           goes to stop him.  
                                 KEVIN
                        Hands off. It’s gonna be okay. 

           Kevin spins around to face Greg.

                                 KEVIN
                        Even though her friends look like a 
                        Jules Verne orgy run amok, and I 
                        kinda want out ASAP, there’s 
                        something about this girl that’s 
                        driving my freak flag up. And it’s 
                        not just the corset and goggles. Or 
                        the ebb and flow of her hips when 
                        she walks. She doesn’t want to put 
                        out at a pin drop, and, not sure 
                        why, I actually kinda go for that.  

                                 GREG
                        Kevin, you just met this girl. Why 
                        don’t you worry about something 
                        important? Like our sales pitch?  
                        Eyes on the prize. I don’t need you 
                        getting distracted from the task at 
                        hand by some whatchamacall.   

                                 KEVIN
                        Steampunk. She’s a Steampunk. It’s 
                        her culture, and I respect that.  
                        Fuck. Can I just sit down for a 
                        second? Clear my head.  

           Kevin lies down on Greg’s cot--

                                 KEVIN
                        Ouch.

           and holds up a string of beads he’s found under his back.

                                 KEVIN
                        You dirty dog.

                                 GREG
                        Those are rosary beads.  

           Kevin chortles as he lies back and drifts off to sleep. Greg 
           goes back to the board, and begins recreating his work.  

           TITLE CARD: THURSDAY

           INT. KEVIN’S HOTEL ROOM - DAWN

           The phone rings but Kevin’s not there for his wake up call.
           INT. GREG’S HOTEL ROOM - DAWN

           Greg wakes up on the conference table, his jacket serving as 
           a blanket. Kevin is passed out on the bed.  

           INT. THE REINDEER ROOM - DAY

           Kevin and Greg sit at a table set for eight people.  

                                 GREG
                        I don’t know. They RSVP’d.  

           Greg’s cell phone rings.  

                                 GREG
                        Oh jeez! It’s Ressler.

                                 KEVIN
                        Ignore it. Don’t pick up.

                                 GREG
                        We can’t evade him. He’d find us.
                             (answers)
                        Hello. This is Greg.

                                 RESSLER (O.S.)
                        Put me on the fucking speakerphone!

                                 GREG
                        Okay. You’re on.

                                 RESSLER (O.S.)
                        You clods both there?

                                 GREG
                        Yeah. We’re here.

                                 RESSLER (O.S.)
                        Just got off the phone with my boy 
                        at TWR. You're losing the sale!  

                                 GREG
                        Ted, I assure you we’re doing our 
                        best.

                                 RESSLER (O.S.)
                        If this is your best, your best is 
                        a joke. This sale is now an elusive 
                        sonofabitch. Doctor Martinez and I 
                        might roll in the same men’s group 
                        but it doesn’t mean diddly if 
                        you’re going around, asking for 
                        handjobs or crying over a fishhook.

                                 RESSLER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Oh, when were you two knuckle-
                        draggers gonna tell me about Sheera 
                        & Mandy dry-gulching you? Those 
                        venomous whores get poached by 
                        Floretech and now they’re gonna 
                        have your ballsacks for lunch. You 
                        realize that, right?

                                 KEVIN
                        Well, we didn’t want you to panic.

                                 RESSLER (O.S.)
                        How considerate. Where are the 
                        P&T'ers right now?

                                 KEVIN
                        Right now? Thing is, they’re 
                        supposed to be at our breakfast. 

                                 RESSLER (O.S.)
                        Supposed to be. That means no, you 
                        don’t know where they are. You're 
                        treading water in the deep end of a 
                        barracuda tank, with my sale? Fuck 
                        no! You want me to come out there 
                        and babysit you, wipe your asses 
                        for you? ‘Cause goddamn, I'll do 
                        it, if that's what need's be done. 

                                 GREG
                        Ted, we’re very sorry if you’re 
                        upset. We’re gonna handle--

                                 RESSLER (O.S.)
                        You’re sorry? I don't want some 
                        slipshod apology. I want a time 
                        machine so I can go back to nine 
                        months before you were born and 
                        stop your father from jizzing in 
                        your moms. You’re in no fucking 
                        position to tell me you’re sorry. 
                        Tell me you’ll fix it.  

                                 GREG
                        We’ll fix it.

                                 RESSLER (O.S.)
                        Fuck yes you will. Tomorrow is the 
                        sale, and thank Christ you have 
                        those numbers to fall back on. 
                        Their Hancocks. Our contract.  
                        Fucking got me?!?

           Ressler hangs up. Greg looks to Kevin.
                                 GREG
                        It’s moments like those that make 
                        this job worth it, you know?

                                 KEVIN
                        For the record, I didn’t cry. 
                             (to waiter)
                        Lenny, can we settle up?  

           INT. GOLF CLUB POOL - DAY

           Kevin and Greg, sporting linen suits, witness the P&T’ers 
           enjoying a raucous pool party, hosted by Sheera and Mandy. 
           All of the other guests in attendance seem to be models in 
           bikinis and espadrilles.   

                                 KEVIN
                        I knew it. They’re T&A’ing the 
                        sale. Hired guns. Margarita 
                        machine. Ice sculptures. Lezzie 
                        snogging. Your packet failed to 
                        mention that Marissa chomps canoe.  

           Mandy is brazenly making out with Marissa. Kevin sees Deborah 
           texting on her Blackberry right by them. He approaches her. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Debbie Crohl, always a pleasure. 
                        You have a sec?

                                 DEBORAH
                        Hey boys. Coming for a swim?

                                 KEVIN
                        No actually. We’re not. Our 
                        invitation neglected to mention 
                        swimsuits. 

                                 DEBORAH
                        Sorry about missing our breakfast. 
                        You know how guys can get when 
                        models are part of the equation.

                                 GREG
                        Yeah, I'm sure kicking it with 
                        spray-tanned babes in bikinis is 
                        more important to your patients 
                        than a breakfast lecture. How’s 
                        your schedge looking today?

                                 DEBORAH
                        Our dance card’s pretty full up. 
                                 GREG
                        Uh-huh. Here’s the thing. Ted 
                        Ressler, our boss is coming down 
                        hard on us. As well he should. But 
                        how about a mulligan? I mean, if 
                        your crew can forgive one lame 
                        dinner, Kevin can forgive his 
                        fishhook piercing. We just wanna 
                        get through the preliminary song 
                        and dance so come tomorrow, we can 
                        breeze through the pitch and get 
                        out of your hair. 

                                 DEBORAH
                        We have the Floretech luncheon.  I 
                        can’t cancel on Sheera and Mandy.  

                                 GREG
                        Oh no, of course not. We wouldn’t 
                        dream of intruding on that. I’ll 
                        beg, I’ll grovel. Just anything but 
                        no. Any restaurant or concert you 
                        want, name it. And it’s yours.

           Sheera spots Greg and Kevin speaking with Dr. Crohl. She 
           politely finishes her conversation, steers Mandy away from 
           Marissa, and they climb out of the pool, and stride over to 
           Kevin and Greg.

                                 DEBORAH
                        We’d have to cancel our reservation 
                        for the murder mystery dinner 
                        cruise but could possibly make a 
                        dinner work. Eight is do-able.

                                 GREG
                        Great. Then let’s make that happen. 
                        Looking forward. See you tonight.

                                 DEBORAH
                        See you tonight, Greg.

           Dr. Crohl walks away. Kevin’s impressed by Greg not taking no 
           for an answer. Sheera and Mandy approach them.

                                 SHEERA
                        Guys, you look like a couple 
                        Caribbean pimps. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Sheera. God Bless. You fill that 
                        two piece nicely. Mmmmph.  
                                 SHEERA
                        You palookas try and spy on our 
                        shit again, we’ll stuff urinal 
                        cakes down your throat ‘till you 
                        choke. You follow?

                                 GREG
                        Loud and clear.  

           Greg starts walking away but Kevin is lost in Sheera’s eyes.   

                                 GREG
                        Kevin. We’re going. Come on.  

           INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

           Greg is at the wheel.  

                                 GREG
                        Kevin, every time you’re around 
                        Sheera, you’re putty. So, can you 
                        holster your lust and stay the hell 
                        away from her, please?  

                                 KEVIN
                        Dude, I promise, PROMISE, that I 
                        will not so much as look at Sheera 
                        again until we’ve got that deal 
                        signed sealed delivered. She’s an 
                        Ex. Nothing to worry about. I’ve 
                        learned the Sheera lesson all too 
                        well many times over. 

                                 GREG
                        Good. Glad we’re on the same page. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Pull over here. We’ve gotta equip.

           INT. HOTEL RECEPTION - DAY

           Kevin and Greg rush to the desk, holding an unwieldy package 
           and a couple of shopping bags. Ronnie flashes a smile.

                                 RONNIE
                        Good morning!

                                 KEVIN
                        Hi. We’re running five ten behind. 
                        We have an eleven with Floretech in 
                        their sales suite. Eight, uh?
                                 RONNIE
                        Gimme a sec. There they are. 806.  

                                 KEVIN
                        806. That’s right. That’s what 
                        they’d said. Thanks hugely. 

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

           Kevin and Greg, wearing utility worksuits and fake mustaches, 
           bargain with Carmen at her rolling cart.

                                 CARMEN
                        What do I get? What you got for me?

                                 KEVIN
                        You have a price in mind?

                                 CARMEN
                        Vikes. Percs. Oxies. Make that 
                        happen, I make this happen. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Easy enough. Just a telephone call.  

                                 CARMEN
                        Okay. Come.

           Kevin and Greg follow Carmen down the hall to Room 806.

                                 GREG
                        I don’t want to be a part of this.

                                 KEVIN
                        Greg, Sheera and Mandy brought this 
                        upon themselves. Newton’s Third. 
                        Way of the world. They have a 
                        luncheon. We have a clear shot. 

           INT. HOTEL SUITE 806 - DAY

           A Zyklar mounted poster rests on an easel. A large brass 
           machine topped with a silver statue of a bird, dominates the 
           credenza. Kevin begins making himself a cappuccino. 

                                 KEVIN
                        At first I thought medicated powder 
                        in the underpants, gluing their 
                        laptops to the wall, but this isn’t 
                        sleepaway camp, y’know. I didn’t 
                        come all the way here for bush 
                        league pranks. You see the nutmeg?
                                 GREG
                        Kevin, we’re breaking and entering. 
                        You wanna hurry it up with the 
                        coffee?

                                 KEVIN
                        Just, one, sec. Done.

           Kevin finishes pouring his cappuccino, and walks to the 
           bedroom in the back. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Bring the toolboxes. And the 
                        snakefeed. It’s Hammurabi time.

           BEDROOM

           Kevin peeks in the closet and looks at Sheera and Mandy’s 
           hanging clothes. Greg walks in, carrying two toolboxes, and a 
           cardboard box with holes punches into it.  

                                 KEVIN
                        You work your magic out here. I’ll 
                        raise hell in the bathroom.

           BATHROOM

           Kevin goes through toiletries laid out on the counter. He 
           pours out blue pills from a pillbox, replacing them with 
           other blue pills he pulls from a sample box. He pours a small 
           bottle of green liquid into a bottle of mouthwash. 

           BEDROOM

           Greg is screwing the cover back onto the air vent. Kevin 
           emerges from the bathroom. Greg nods. Kevin closes the closet 
           door so it looks like they were never there.

                                 KEVIN
                        We’re all set.

           A key slides into a lock. The door to the other room opens.  

                                 SHEERA (O.S.)
                        Mandy, quick like a rabbit. The 
                        lunch started ten minutes ago. 

                                 MANDY (O.S.)
                        I know I know I know.  

           Panicked, Greg looks to Kevin. Kevin points to the window. 
           Greg mouths “No.” Kevin nods. Greg mouths “Fuck me.”
           EXT. HOTEL LEDGE - MOMENTS LATER

           While Greg is fearfully clinging to the masonry, Kevin is 
           momentarily of single purpose and doesn’t seem to mind their 
           distance from the ground. He peels off his mustache.

                                 KEVIN
                        We have to think, if I were an exec 
                        from TWR, stuck hearing sales 
                        pitches all week and whatnot, what 
                        would I want? What would sway me?   
                        I think I know the answer. My room 
                        in an hour. Bring your laptop.  
                        We’re going to the mattresses. 

           Kevin opens a window to the room adjacent to 806. He climbs 
           in, offers his hand, and helps Greg off the ledge.

           INT. KEVIN’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Greg opens the door. Derek Poon, sporting a bolo tie, sitting 
           on a motorized scooter, sips amaretto straight from a bottle.  
           Derek and Kevin are toiling away on legal pads.  

                                 KEVIN
                        We’re going to need some 
                        entertainment for tonight.  

                                 DEREK
                        Strippers? Local talent’s probably 
                        tied up with the conventions on. 
                        We’ll bring in Elsa and her crew 
                        from Madison. Done.  

           Derek sees Greg and leaps up out of his scooter.

                                 DEREK
                        Yo. What it do, what it do.  

           Derek hands Greg his business card which reads: “The Best”.

                                 DEREK
                        Periscope this. It says “The Best” 
                        because I’m the horse who gets it 
                        for you. Cuban cigars, fireworks, 
                        backstage passes. Real pro-level 
                        shit. Three day coke binge landed 
                        me in handcuffs. They bagged my 
                        license, impounded my Ninja, but 
                        I’m a penguin, and a penguin’s 
                        gotta fly, know what I’m sayin’? 
                        Abracadab, here I am. All good with 
                        you, slim? What’s cracking?
                                 GREG
                        Not much cracking, actually.  
                             (to Kevin)
                        You’re hiring strippers? What about 
                        dinner?  

                                 KEVIN
                        No. We’re done with dinners. I’ve 
                        got the guys coming here tonight. 
                        And you’re taking the gals minus 
                        Marissa to see a show. My thought 
                        was, since you already have good 
                        rapport with the ladies, you’d be 
                        game for chaperoning said voyage to 
                        a club called The Cage. Dudes 
                        dancin’ and danglin’ and whatnot.  

                                 GREG
                        I’ll take them. That’s fine. But 
                        Kevin, sidebar.  

           Kevin and Greg step into the bathroom.  

                                 GREG
                        I thought we were gonna talk about 
                        the updated strategy together. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Greg, we’ve got one last chance 
                        with the P&T’ers. But we’re on the 
                        defensive so now’s when we switch 
                        our approach and rise to the 
                        occasion. You have a better idea 
                        than wowing them with billowing 
                        flesh, I’m all ears. No offense to 
                        whatever dinner you’d planned for 
                        tonight, but sex sells. Mandy and 
                        Sheera live by that precept. And 
                        we’re gonna follow suit. I’m making 
                        the right call here.  

                                 GREG
                        I know you are. I just wish there 
                        was another way to go about this 
                        other than aping Sheera and Mandy.

                                 KEVIN
                        I wish a lot of things, Greg. I 
                        wish there was peace on Earth. I 
                        wish they could invent kevlar 
                        condoms. I wish there were no dumpy 
                        asses. But this is the now, and we 
                        have to adapt to the battle in 
                        which we find ourselves.  
                                 GREG
                        Okay. That’s all fine. But Derek 
                        Poon of all people? The guy’s a 
                        mess. Ressler warned us. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Greg, Ressler hates him because 
                        Ressler’s afraid of what isn't 
                        safe, but safe hasn’t worked for 
                        us. Which is why, we’re going 
                        dangerous. Look, Poon will handle 
                        the stripper logistics then we can 
                        focus on going balls deep with the 
                        pitch. Let’s play it by ear, give 
                        the guy a chance. If he turns out 
                        to be a hindrance, we show him the 
                        door. Simple as that. Okay? 

           INT. KEVIN’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Derek is speaking German on the room phone. He holds up his 
           finger to Kevin and Greg, as if to say, “one sec.”

                                 DEREK
                        Danke schön, Elsa. Stay sexy.
                             (hangs up)
                        I gotcha on the talent front. You 
                        all wanna do that presentation for 
                        me? I can give you feedback, help 
                        you murder that thing. I know the 
                        difference between garbage and 
                        gold. Take a breath. I’ll get the 
                        projector warmed up.  

                                 GREG
                        Derek, this isn’t a judgement on 
                        you, but we really can’t show you  
                        our slides. I’m nervous about 
                        protecting our pricing matrix.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Greg, don’t worry about Derek. He’s 
                        on our side. Gotta trust me on 
                        this. Derek, you can keep what you 
                        see here confidential?

                                 DEREK
                        Most definitely. I put the pro in 
                        professional. Ready when you are.

           Greg sighs and walks to the laptop and fires up the 
           presentation. Derek observes from aboard his scooter.
                                 GREG
                        Derek, Prexiol is a proton pump 
                        inhibitor. It restricts gastric 
                        acid production in the stomach.

                                 DEREK
                        No need to talk down, horse. I know 
                        PPI’s. Shit crutched me through my 
                        ulcer days. Preach on. 

                                 GREG
                        Okay. Over the next few years, 
                        we’re going to encounter even more 
                        drug resistant viruses. Looking 
                        towards end results, what’s 
                        demonstrable? Achievable? PPI’s are 
                        analogous in numerous respects but 
                        solely Prexiol is proven as a viral 
                        inhibitor.  

                                 DEREK
                        Hold-up. Falling asleep over here, 
                        horse. I hear it but I don’t feel 
                        it. Too wordy. You’re gonna choke 
                        on the verbiage. You gotta 
                        simplify, quit messing around with 
                        thesaurus words.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Derek’s on the nose. Nice and easy 
                        swing and we’ll catapult it out of 
                        the park. I’ll be back in a few.

                                 GREG
                        Wait! Where are you going?

                                 KEVIN
                        Presentation’s looking strong.  
                        Stay the course, captain. 

           Kevin races out, leaving Greg alone with Derek.

                                 GREG
                        What’d Kevin offer you to help us?

                                 DEREK
                        He promised me a pallet of flu 
                        shots. Those shits are gold after 
                        Columbus Day, always, y'know?  

           Greg’s cell phone rings. He answers.

                                 GREG
                        Hello, this is Greg.
                                 DARBY (O.S.)
                        Greg, it’s Darby, I've been trying 
                        to reach you but it keeps going to 
                        voicemail. 

                                 GREG
                        Oh, hey Darby. Jeez it’s nice to 
                        hear your voice. Milwaukee’s going 
                        pretty well. Nearly swimmingly. 

           There’s a knock on the door.

                                 DARBY (O.S.)
                        Uh, that’s good. Mayday. Ressler’s 
                        on a flight to Milwaukee. I just 
                        found out. He’s fuming.  

           Derek opens the door. Ressler is standing there.

                                 DEREK
                        What up, horse?  

           Ressler steps in. Greg sees him and waves.  

                                 GREG
                        No kidding. Well, thanks for the 
                        heads up, Darby. I gotta run.   
                             (hangs up)
                        Hi Ted. How was your flight?

                                 RESSLER
                        Where’s Kevin?  

                                 GREG
                        He’s meeting with the caterers. 
                        Ted, this is... Salvatore Brancusi.

                                 RESSLER
                        I don’t fucking care who this is. 
                        Is that the shitter?

                                 GREG
                        That is the shitter, yes.

           Ressler goes into the bathroom. Greg runs to the mini-fridge, 
           and pulls out a mini-bottle of vodka, which he downs. 

                                 DEREK
                        That macaroni your boss?

                                 GREG
                        Fuck fuck fuck. Derek, we’ve gotta 
                        keep him occupied, distracted. Um.
                                 DEREK
                        Not a problem. You tell him I work 
                        with the people you’re all selling 
                        to. I’ll call Charles. You have him 
                        in the back parking lot in twenty, 
                        and I’ll take it from there. Cool?  

                                 GREG
                        Derek, you’re Salvatore Brancusi as 
                        long as you deal with him, alright? 

                                 DEREK
                        In the bag, handsome. In the bag.   

           Derek tears out of the room. A flush. Ressler comes out.

                                 RESSLER
                        Where’d the thug go?

                                 GREG
                        Uh, that thug is TWR’s new number 
                        cruncher. I just spent five minutes 
                        apologizing for you.

                                 RESSLER
                        Oh shit. Why didn’t you say 
                        something?

                                 GREG
                        Uh, I tried to. But you...

                                 RESSLER
                        Fuck me. How pissed is he?

                                 GREG
                        Ted, it’s alright. He’s cool. Sal’s 
                        our big advocate on the committee. 
                        He’s in our pocket and has Crohl’s 
                        ear. As long as we keep him happy, 
                        everything else falls into place. 
                        We’re meeting him downstairs and 
                        grabbing lunch.  

                                 RESSLER
                        So, Sal’s their quant now. Any clue 
                        what happened to Manzur?

                                 GREG
                        Not sure exactly, but it isn’t 
                        good. Heard be fumbled a 
                        negotiation last week and is on 
                        Crohl’s shit list. Which means 
                        Sal’s the new number two.  
                                 RESSLER
                        You gotta order nice wine with 
                        these people, tonight. None of that 
                        cheap ass shiraz. Big bodied reds. 
                        Cabs. Barolos. Wines like this.

           Ressler flexes his arm and kisses his bicep.

                                 GREG
                        Yep. Thanks Ted.  

           INT. STEAMPUNK CONVENTION FLOOR - DAY

           Kevin searches the aisles, which eerily mirror the drug 
           convention. Various vendors peddle all sorts of Steampunk 
           gear: corsets, rayguns, goggles, comic books, jetpacks, etc.  
           Laurel, dressed in a leather apron, sells oil lamps at her 
           booth. Kevin gives a lamp the once-over.

                                 KEVIN
                        Beg your pardon, ma’am. How many of 
                        these lamps would I have to buy to 
                        get a second date?

                                 LAUREL
                        None.

                                 KEVIN
                        That’s a fair figure. Wanna get out 
                        of here, go on a walk, I don’t 
                        know, have a life threatening jaunt 
                        into the wilds of Milwaukee?  

                                 LAUREL
                        Life threatening, huh? I get a 
                        break in twenty.  

                                 KEVIN
                        I’ll hover over there.  

                                 LAUREL
                        See you in twenty, hummingbird. 

           INT. BACK LOT - DAY

           A door next to a dumpster opens. Greg and Ressler emerge. A 
           stretched Excalibur limousine is idling. Derek is holding the 
           car door open for them.

                                 DEREK
                        Horses, ready to gallop?
                                 GREG
                        You guys go on ahead. I’m gonna 
                        hang back for Kevin. We’ll be right 
                        behind you.

           Greg retreats back into the hotel, letting the door close.

                                 RESSLER
                        Sal, I feel awful about before.

                                 DEREK
                        No ill will. You’re tired from your 
                        flight. We’re cool, horse.

           INT. TEMPORARY HANGAR IN HOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY

           Kevin stands in front of an airship. Laurel is up on a 
           platform, running yellow rope around the airship’s rigging.  

                                 LAUREL
                        I used to be insane for Civil War 
                        R.E.A.’s but the stitch counter 
                        fascists killed any joy in that. 
                        But Steampunk, it’s all-inclusive.  
                        No rulebook jerks telling you what 
                        you need to be. You make your own 
                        path, be what you want, D-I-Y, and 
                        I love it for that. What do you 
                        love?

           She secures a rope and climbs down from the platform.

                                 KEVIN
                        My job, I guess. But I don’t know.   
                        It’s not like I’d keep doing it if 
                        I struck it rich. Maybe I’m still 
                        searching for my Steampunk.

           DIMITRI, 30’s, Ukrainian Steampunk in a tweed suit, thick 
           mustache and aviator sunglasses strolls into the hangar.

                                 DIMITRI
                        Who is this mizootch?  

                                 LAUREL
                        Oh, hi Dimitri. I was just double-
                        checking the rigging.  

                                 DIMITRI
                        You brought an outsider here? He 
                        doesn’t even have goggles!
                                 LAUREL
                        Dimitri, you’re being rude. 

                                 DIMITRI
                        Well, there’s a case of the bitch 
                        calling the kettle black.

                                 KEVIN
                        Whoa, man. Ease off.   

                                 DIMITRI
                        Don’t ‘man’ me.  
                             (points to the door)
                        Make your way. Laurel, we should 
                        talk things over.

                                 LAUREL
                        You’re an ass.  

           Laurel takes Kevin’s hand and they exit.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - OUTSIDE HANGAR - DUSK

           Kevin and Laurel are walking out of the hangar.

                                 KEVIN
                        Didn’t mean to get you in trouble 
                        with your buddies.

                                 LAUREL
                        You didn’t. Dimitri and I dated for 
                        three years. We used to copilot the 
                        same Airship on weekends. He’s 
                        still kinda clingy, but he gets it, 
                        that we’re over. Sorry he took the 
                        jealousy out on you.   

                                 KEVIN
                        I get it.  

                                 LAUREL
                        What?

                                 KEVIN
                        Why he’s clingy.  

           Kevin takes her by the hand and pulls her close.

                                 LAUREL
                        I’ve gotta get back to the booth, 
                        at least to close up. I’m around 
                        tonight if you wanna swing by.
                                 KEVIN
                        Consider this my RSVP.   

           He kisses her intensely. She giggles. 

           INT. LIMO - DUSK

           Derek and Ressler are seated across from each other.

                                 RESSLER
                        The balls on this Derek Poon guy. 
                        This fuckhole has the audacity to 
                        fax us a invoice, for entertainment 
                        services rendered, after he crashed 
                        our party at last year’s 
                        convention. This prick had sex with 
                        a married woman on the dance floor. 

                                 DEREK
                        Sounds like a real pain in the ass. 

                                 RESSLER
                        He fucking is. I’m telling you, 
                        Sal. My bane is shits like him.

           Derek pulls a small silver plate from behind the limo’s 
           stemware and lays out some cocaine-like substance on it.

                                 DEREK
                        You can’t live your life so angry, 
                        horse. Why don’t you bump some of 
                        this quality?

                                 RESSLER
                        Are you fucking kidding me? I’m 
                        here on a business trip. 

           Derek snorts some powder. He lets out a joyous yelp.

                                 DEREK
                        Whoo-whoo! 

                                 RESSLER
                             (reconsidering)
                        Maybe just one.  

           Ressler leans in and snorts a line off the plate. He quivers.

                                 RESSLER
                        Heh-heh. Am I crosseyed? Sal, was 
                        this cocaine or, what was this?
                                 DEREK
                        Nah. This is Albino Dynamite. It’s 
                        the new jam. Scientists invented 
                        it, so you know it’s correct.

                                 RESSLER
                        This makes coke feel like training 
                        wheels. Damn. Um yes, operator, 
                        there’s a blizzard in my nostrils.  
                        Send help. Saint Bernard...

           INT. KEVIN’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Kevin opens the door for Greg. There’s a sizable spread of 
           catered food and beverages on a large table. 

                                 KEVIN
                        You hungry? Turkey club?   

                                 GREG
                        Ressler showed up this afternoon.

                                 KEVIN
                        Where? In Milwaukee? No.
                             (beat)
                        Where is he now?

                                 GREG
                        Kevin, what is your deal? You don’t 
                        abandon your wing man. 

                                 KEVIN
                        I guess I got held up. Laurel had 
                        the afternoon free, which turned 
                        into a quick jaunt to a hangar so 
                        she could show me her blimp.  

                                 GREG
                        Oh, really? How fun. What about 
                        rehearsing the slidedeck until it’s 
                        clockwork? We didn’t come all the 
                        way to Milwaukee for you to 
                        disseminate your DNA and go 
                        joyriding in zeppelins! Don’t you 
                        care about tomorrow in the least?  

                                 KEVIN
                        Don’t for a minute think I’m not 
                        taking this shit seriously, man. 
                        But ultimately what gets us an 
                        executed contract tomorrow isn’t 
                        the slidedeck spiel.

                        The sale's not even really about 
                        the product or the price. They 
                        already know Prexiol forwards and 
                        back. But what they don't know 
                        about is us. We're the sale. Not 
                        the facts and figures and bullet 
                        points. You and me. So, I’m sorry 
                        if I hurt your feelings by ditching 
                        today, but I need you smiling like 
                        a Poligrip commercial from now 
                        until you get back from the 
                        dongathon. Okay? 

                                 GREG
                        Yeah. It’s just, huge day tomorrow.

                                 KEVIN
                        For you and me both, Greg. Listen.  
                        Every sale, every sale, is a con. 
                        Whether you’re hustling a doctor 
                        into writing a prescription or a 
                        girlfriend into letting her film 
                        the hijinks, every sale’s a con. 
                        We're gonna bed that sale tomorrow. 
                        Not a doubt in my bones. It’s all 
                        about knocking their socks off 
                        tonight. Show me your Abraham.

           Kevin holds up his palm. Greg high fives him.

                                 KEVIN
                        Give my regards to the bowties and 
                        banana slings. Here. You should 
                        have this, just in case.

           Kevin gives Greg his whistle. Greg reluctantly pockets it.

           INT. GREG’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Greg picks up the room phone and dials.

                                 TIFF
                        Hello?

                                 GREG
                        Tiff? It’s Greg. I’m glad you 
                        picked up. Uh, did you get my 
                        messages? The messages I left?

                                 TIFF
                        Yeah. You’ve gotta stop leaving 
                        those, Greg. They make you sound 
                        desperate.
                                 GREG
                        Wait. I’m not desperate. I’m 
                        hopeful. There’s a difference. 

                                 TIFF
                        Why are you calling me all the 
                        time? We broke things off, 
                        remember?  

                                 GREG
                        Yeah, but I came to Milwaukee to 
                        fix all that. Because I’ll get a 
                        bonus and can finally launch my 
                        marketing firm. First stop when I 
                        get home is Nieman Marcus for a new 
                        purse. Any damn purse you want. 

                                 TIFF
                        I never asked you for any of that.

                                 GREG
                        I know, but, maybe if you just open 
                        your heart or whatever, we can 
                        maybe work things out? We can be 
                        good again. I believe that.

                                 TIFF
                        Greg, there’s nothing to work out. 
                        ‘Cause I don’t love you anymore, 
                        dude. 

                                 GREG
                        I... I have to go.  

           The receiver drops gently from Greg’s hand. He’s crushed.

           INT. THE CAGE - NIGHT

           THE CAGE is packed to the gills with well-oiled male dancers, 
           and a completely female audience. The P&T gals are led 
           through the club by a bowtied shirtless waiter. Sheera stops 
           Greg before he reaches the P&T Gals at their table.  

                                 SHEERA
                        Hey Greg. Is Kev here? Or just you 
                        and the ladies tonight?

                                 GREG
                        He’s babysitting the guys.  

                                 SHEERA
                        His loss, huh?
           HOMELY LADY whistles at Greg.

                                 HOMELY LADY
                        Shake it!

                                 GREG
                        No, I’m sorry, ma’am. I don’t work 
                        here.

           She reaches over and tucks a twenty into Greg’s waistband.

                                 GREG
                        Hey! Stop! That’s not a tip jar!

                                 HOMELY LADY
                        If you can put money in it, it’s a 
                        tip jar.  

           Sheera and Mandy chortle at Greg’s agitation. Greg quickly 
           joins the P&T Gals and throws back a shot. He’s forlorn but 
           doing his best to appear in high spirits.  

                                 DR. DEMPSEY 
                        You doing okay over there, Greg?

                                 GREG
                        Oh yeah, definitely. Whenever I’m 
                        in Milwaukee, ‘Taxi! Take me to the 
                        Cage!’ By the way, this is why I 
                        don’t shower at the gym.

           INT. KEVIN’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           The P&T Guys and Marissa are seated in a 3/4 circle, drinking 
           cocktails.  Kevin pours Manzur a martini. There’s a knock.  
           Kevin opens the door. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Welcome, ladies. Welcome.  

           The strippers stroll in, towing rolling luggage behind them.  
           They’re accompanied by two enormous bodyguards. ELSA, 30’s, 
           the ringleader, cracks a bullwhip to get the guys’ attention.

                                 ELSA
                        Is this the big dick club? ‘Cause 
                        we’re about to blow your minds.

                                 MANZUR
                        Girl, you can blow whatever you 
                        want.  
                                 ELSA
                        We might need to punish this one.

                                 MANZUR
                        Careful you don’t hurt yourself, 
                        Fräulein. Now back that thing up so 
                        I can hear it beep!  

           Kevin passes out thick stacks of singles to the P&T’ers. The 
           girls open their suitcases and begin pulling out props.  
           Greta straps a dildo to Dr. Martinez’s forehead.  

                                 GRETA
                        Are you ready to play unicorn?

                                 DR. MARTINEZ
                        I was born ready.   

           Music thunders from a boombox. Elsa crawls over to Marissa, 
           climbs up her legs, and gives her a lapdance. Christina, 
           wearing a sleazy Halloween nurse’s uniform, straddles a 
           nervous Dr. Levinson’s lap, facing him.  

                                 CHRISTINA
                        You’re a real doctor? 

                                 DR. LEVINSON
                        Yep. Full-on M.D. So says the latin  
                        hanging in my office.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        I like doctors. So smart. Have you 
                        ever made love to a stripper?

                                 DR. LEVINSON
                        I’m sorry. I, I’ve got a wife.

           Christina leans in close, her lips inches away from his.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Not in ‘Sconsin you don’t. Full on.  

           She whips her hair into his face and then pulls his head into 
           her cleavage. Claudia leads Wilhemina on a leash into the 
           center of the room. Kevin leans in to speak with Elsa.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Elsa, sorry to interrupt, I had 
                        heard part of the show was... a 
                        banana?

                                 ELSA
                        No. Not a banana. Plantain. Give me 
                        five minutes. 
           Elsa coasts into the bathroom, closing the door behind her.

           INT. THE CAGE - NIGHT

           Greg is seated at the table, still aching from Tiff’s call. 
           Sheera has snuck up. She gives a wave to the P&T gals.

                                 SHEERA
                        What’s wrong, Greg? You don’t like 
                        this evening’s show?

                                 GREG
                        Sheera, I don’t know what you’re 
                        doing here, but you had ‘em all 
                        day, so you and your luetic 
                        sidekick can back off tonight. You 
                        know what? I’ve got a show.  
                             (to P&T’ers)
                        Who’d like to see my show?

           Greg sprints up to the stage. He gives a nod to the guy 
           currently dancing, who waves back. The P&T’ers are cheering. 
           Greg pulls Kevin’s whistle from his pocket and blows it.  

                                 DJ
                        We’ve got a new thoroughbred coming 
                        to the stage. What’s your handle, 
                        stallion?

                                 GREG
                        Weinstock! Gregory Weinstock!

                                 DJ
                        Ladies, I present, on the main 
                        stage for your erotic 
                        entertainment, the one, the only, 
                        the incomparable, Weinstock. 

           Music begins to play. Greg finds himself alone onstage.

                                 GREG
                        This is a mistake. Shit.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Shake that tambourine, Greg!

           Greg, hesitantly begins dancing, does some shoulder slides 
           back and forth, lassos himself around in a circle, and with 
           both hands, gestures a come-hither beckoning, his lips 
           pursed. He loosens his tie. WHISTLES! CATCALLS! He takes off 
           his jacket, swings it around, and slings it into the crowd.  
           Greg’s having fun with this. He’s finally FREE! A MOB OF 
           WOMEN rush the stage and rip his shirt to shreds.  
           When he steps down from the stage to enthusiastic applause, 
           in only boxers, socks and the whistle, Sheera confronts him.  

                                 SHEERA
                        Taking your clothes off? That’s how 
                        you’re gonna land the sale?

                                 GREG
                             (sniffs in the air)
                        Hmmm. What is that lingering odor? 
                        Is that desperation? Or fear?

                                 SHEERA
                        Greg, I hope when we take you guys 
                        down tomorrow, you go down hard.  

                                 GREG
                        If anyone’s going down, I hope it’s 
                        you going down, going down on us. 
                        Yes, Alex, hilarious for one 
                        thousand. Ding ding ding! Who is 
                        Greg Weinstock? Thank you. I’ll be 
                        here all week. Excuse me. Sweet 
                        dreams.

           Sheera is stunned, as Greg blows right past her. 

           INT. PARTY BUS - NIGHT

           The Gal P&T’ers are already seated when Greg climbs aboard, 
           in his ripped shirt, smiling. They cheer for him. He bows.

           INT. KEVIN’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Elsa lies on the floor in a short skirt, knees bent.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Miracles don’t happen everyday. 
                        Tonight, you will all bear witness 
                        to something truly phenomenal.  
                        Let’s help out with a spirited 
                        countdown. From three. And...

                                 EVERYONE
                        Three! Two! One! Blast-off!

           The plantain hits the window. AWESTRUCK SILENCE. Jaws are 
           dropped. And then... APPLAUSE!

                                 DR. LEVINSON
                        God Bless America!
                                 MANZUR
                        That trumped Halley’s Comet, easy.   

           INT. HOTEL SUITE 806 - NIGHT

           Sheera and Mandy get back. Mandy heads to the bathroom. 
           There’s a quiet recurring sound, reminiscent of summer in the 
           suburbs. Sheera starts undressing, getting ready for bed.  

                                 SHEERA
                        We’ve got this in the bag, Mandy. 
                        Tonight’s our beauty rest. Tomorrow 
                        sister, we shine.

           BATHROOM

           Mandy pours out two of the blue pills into her hand and 
           washes them down. She then rinses her mouth out with the 
           green mouthwash.

           MAIN ROOM

           Sheera senses something is off. 

                                 SHEERA
                        Someone was in here.

           Sheera looks around the room, sees Kevin’s empty cappuccino 
           cup on the desk. She picks it up to take a closer look.

           BATHROOM

           Mandy is brushing her teeth.

                                 MANDY
                        What?

           MAIN ROOM

                                 SHEERA
                        Someone was in here.

           Mandy comes out. She’s amped up, euphoric from the opioid in 
           the blue pills Kevin switched into her prescription. 

                                 MANDY
                        Who was in here? The maid? Who?

                                 SHEERA
                        Why are your teeth green?

                                 MANDY
                        My teeth?
           Mandy looks to a mirror and smiles. Her teeth are bright 
           green.

                                 MANDY
                        Hmmm. Maybe a little. I was gonna 
                        go to sleep. But I’m not tired 
                        anymore. I think I might hit up a 
                        dancefloor, press up on some 
                        gentlemen, let ‘em know my body. 
                        Haha.

                                 SHEERA
                        Mandy, shut up. Stop talking for 
                        one second. Something’s going on.  

           Sheera finally notices the chirping sound of crickets coming 
           from the ventilation panel.

                                 SHEERA
                        Crickets. Fuck these guys. Mandy, 
                        I’ll go deal with them. You stay 
                        back and hold the fort.

           INT. KEVIN’S HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           The P&T committee members have left. Kevin high-fives the 
           strippers at the door to the hallway as they exit.

                                 KEVIN
                        Good game. Good game. Good game.

                                 ELSA
                        I put the eight thousand on your 
                        credit card. It’ll be listed as 
                        Geronimo’s Steakhouse.

                                 KEVIN
                        Elsa, they’re right about you. You 
                        are a professional.

                                 ELSA
                        Goodnight, Mr. Russell. 

           Greg, in ripped clothes, comes in just as Elsa’s walking out.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Hey stranger, you survived! Ready 
                        for tomorrow?

                                 GREG
                        Ready as I’ll ever be.    
                             (hands Kevin his whistle)
                        Thank you for this. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GREG (CONT'D)
                        I don’t know what came over me. I 
                        held it in for so long, and then 
                        tonight, I finally burst. They 
                        tried to tear me apart but you 
                        can’t break this horse. No sir. You 
                        get a chance to review your 
                        notecards?

                                 KEVIN
                        Front and back. I’ll see you in the 
                        morning. I’ve gotta run. Forgot 
                        something in the lobby. Breakfast 
                        on me, alright? 

           Kevin jogs off.  

           INT. LAUREL’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Laurel, wearing a suit that seems like a Steampunk rendition 
           of Annie Hall, plays an autoharp. A knock on the door.  

                                 LAUREL
                        Hello?

                                 KEVIN (O.S.)
                        I came to see about that drink.

           She opens the door. Kevin has brought a bottle of champagne.

                                 KEVIN
                        I didn’t bring any glasses. Sorry.

           Kevin closes the door behind him, pulls Laurel close, and 
           kisses her passionately. They rattle around the room, 
           laughing and smooching, knocking over furniture in the path 
           of their lovers’ waltz. She pulls away from him.

                                 LAUREL
                        Wait a sec. I, I don’t want to rush 
                        things.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Don’t kid me. I’ve got a boner so 
                        hard for you right now.  

                                 LAUREL
                        Don’t talk like that. I really 
                        don’t think I’m ready for intimacy 
                        with you, or with anyone right now. 
                        Maybe when I visit you in White 
                        Plains, we can see how things go, 
                        and work our way from there.
                                 KEVIN
                        Why would I have you visit me in 
                        White Plains? We spent two hours 
                        talking today, and you don’t know 
                        me yet? You know what, this playing 
                        hard to get shit, go pull it with 
                        some other guy. Or whoever you’re 
                        looking to bang, ‘cause clearly 
                        it’s not me.

                                 LAUREL
                        Is sex all there is to you?

                                 KEVIN
                        No. But why else would I be making 
                        out with you? Or even having a 
                        conversation in the first place? 

                                 LAUREL
                        That’s the door, dickwad. 
                        Goodnight. Can you leave? Can you  
                        get the hell out of here? Now. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Aw, come on. Really?  

                                 LAUREL
                        I don’t need a sex-crazed 
                        degenerate for a boyfriend. Been 
                        there, done that. It sucked.

                                 KEVIN
                        Look, I'm sorry. I know I'm not 
                        always the most tactful person but 
                        can you really be pissed at me for 
                        wanting you so bad?  
                             (beat)
                        I’ll go. I’m gone.

           INT. HOTEL SUITE 806 - NIGHT

           Mandy’s in the bathroom, in a dress, aggressively slathering 
           on make-up. She’s blown out her hair into a wild coif.

                                 MANDY
                        Stay? Stay? I’m not a dog. You’re 
                        not my boss. You don’t tell me what 
                        to do. I wanna fiesta, I fiesta. 
                        Goddamn I’m a sexy bitch.
                             (to her boobs)
                        Okay, girls. It’s time to make the 
                        boys go schizo. 
           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Kevin closes the door as he leaves Laurel’s room. MONOCLE, 
           60’s, Steampunk with a monocle and top hat glances at him.

                                 KEVIN
                        What are you looking at, Mister 
                        Peanut? Keep walking, asshole.  

           Monocle mumbles an apology and scurries away.  

           INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

           Bartender Johnny listens to Kevin drunkenly ruminate.

                                 KEVIN
                        Boss, love is a fool’s errand. Why 
                        bother, y’know? 

                                 BARTENDER JOHNNY
                        Uh-huh. I’m closing up. Last call.

           Kevin slides his glass down. It sails right off the bar. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Tan sedan. Bourbon and ginger. 

           Bartender Johnny pours the drink into a fresh glass and 
           serves Kevin who quickly downs it and then chews on the ice.

                                 SHEERA (O.S.)
                        Calming your nerves? 

           Kevin spins around on his stool to face Sheera.

                                 KEVIN
                        Something like that. 

                                 SHEERA
                        I just happened to see your 
                        colleague strip down to his briefs.

                                 KEVIN
                        Really? No shit. Good for him. 
                        Whaddya want, Sheera? 

                                 SHEERA
                        Crickets? Really?

           Kevin shrugs. A slight smile.
                                 SHEERA
                        Brass tacks. How are you gonna 
                        wrangle the sale, aside from 
                        strippers and spa treatments?

                                 KEVIN
                        I dunno. Make our case with the 
                        slideshow and just hope our price 
                        is right. I know. Predictable. 
                        Boring. 

                                 SHEERA
                        Not boring at all, Kev. I love a 
                        good slideshow. It gets me hot.

                                 KEVIN
                        Uh... Really?

                                 SHEERA
                        Really really. You going upstairs?

                                 KEVIN
                        Uh huh.

                                 SHEERA
                        Can I ride with? Maybe we can catch 
                        up, have a minibar nightcap? Don’t 
                        worry. I don’t kiss and tell. I 
                        fuck and yell. Ball’s in your 
                        court.

                                 KEVIN
                        Hopefully they’ll end up in yours.  

           INT. KEVIN’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Kevin and Sheera are in their underpants, making out on the 
           bed. Sheera looks up between kisses to catch a glimpse of the 
           projected presentation. Kevin fondles her over her bra. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Your breasts are awesome.  

                                 SHEERA
                        Next slide.

           Kevin aims the remote at the laptop, and the presentation 
           progresses to the next screen. The door opens. Laurel is 
           standing there, holding the bottle of Champagne.

                                 LAUREL
                        Kevin?
           Kevin looks over to her. He’s caught in the headlights like 
           imminent roadkill, powerless to avoid the inevitable.

                                 LAUREL
                        The door was open. You forgot your 
                        champagne. I raise a toast.

           Laurel hurls the champagne bottle past Kevin and Sheera. It 
           shatters against the wall. Kevin pushes Sheera off him.  

                                 KEVIN
                        This isn’t what it looks like.

                                 LAUREL
                        Then what is it?

                                 KEVIN
                        It is what it looks like.

                                 LAUREL
                        I thought you were a good guy.

           Laurel slams the door as she exits.

                                 KEVIN
                        I am a good guy! Shit!

           Kevin hurries into the hall in boxers and socks.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Laurel is waiting for the elevator. Kevin runs up to her.

                                 KEVIN
                        I feel terrible. Can we talk?  

                                 LAUREL
                        You made your bed. Now go have sex 
                        with it.  

           Laurel gets into the elevator. Kevin holds the doors.

                                 KEVIN
                        Things aren’t as clear cut as they 
                        might look right now.  

                                 LAUREL
                        Let me go.

           Kevin lets the elevator doors close. He dents the wall with a 
           punch. Sheera emerges into the hall, wrapped in a sheet.
                                 SHEERA
                        I still think you’re a good guy. 
                        Come back to bed, baby.

                                 KEVIN
                        You know what? Go find your own 
                        bed. ‘Cause I’m not sleeping with 
                        you ever again. The bank’s closed.   

           Kevin treads past her into his room, and slams the door,    
           leaving Sheera stuck out in the hall, wearing only a sheet.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Laurel, teary-eyed, is opening the door to her room. Dimitri 
           shows up. He’s quite drunk.

                                 DIMITRI
                        Baby.

                                 LAUREL
                        Hi Dimitri.

                                 DIMITRI
                        You’re crying your eyes out.

                                 LAUREL
                        I’m not crying.

                                 DIMITRI
                        I tried to call you. But nothing.

                                 LAUREL
                        Dimitri, we’re still part of the 
                        same crew. Can you please not make 
                        tonight awkward? 

                                 DIMITRI
                        Baby, this isn’t awkward. We both 
                        still have feelings for each other. 
                        We should act on them. Maybe you 
                        and I get naked, drink whiskey, and 
                        bring on the salami luge, yeah? 

           Dimitri grabs her wrist, but she pulls away.

                                 LAUREL
                        No, Dimitri, we’re done. And you’re 
                        plastered.

                                 DIMITRI
                        Come on, don’t do me like that. 
                        I’ve got a stiffy. All systems go.
           Laurel walks into her room and slams the door.

                                 DIMITRI
                        Baby, at least do the decent thing 
                        and give me some hand relief. 

                                 LAUREL (O.S.)
                        Dimitri, I don’t need your sleaze 
                        tonight. Go away, or I’m having 
                        Braden take you off the roster.

                                 DIMITRI
                        Chill out, Laurel. You made your 
                        point. Ciao, whiny mouth.

           Dimitri staggers down the hall, angrily muttering to himself.

           TITLE CARD: FRIDAY

           INT. KEVIN’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           The ringing phone wakes Kevin. He picks up.

                                 KEVIN
                        What?!? A wake up call?!? Why don’t 
                        I call you in the middle of the 
                        night and see how you like it? How 
                        about I dangle my balls in your 
                        mother’s mouth while she’s asleep? 
                        I’ll teabag your whole damn family 
                        at 4 A.M. And they’ll wake up 
                        Christmas morning with mouthfuls of 
                        curlies and chronic TMJ. How’s that 
                        for coal in your stocking? I hope 
                        you get finagled into some buttplug 
                        pony play internet porn and the 
                        shit goes viral! 

           Kevin slams the phone down. 

           INT. HOTEL CAFE - DAY

           Steampunks take up most of the tables. Kevin and Greg are 
           having breakfast. Kevin shakes out a couple pills.

                                 GREG
                        What are you taking?

                                 KEVIN
                        This? Pezerin. Twenty milligrams.
                                 GREG
                        Really? You have a prescription for 
                        Pezerin?  

                                 KEVIN
                        Prescription? Greg, it's FDA 
                        approved. Which means it's safe.  I 
                        kinda need it after last night’s 
                        antics, you know?

                                 GREG
                        What was last night?

                                 KEVIN
                        Unexpected, Sheera and I had a 
                        slight make-out session. 

                                 GREG
                        You promised to stay away from her!

                                 KEVIN
                        Greg, relax. It was just good old 
                        fashioned smooching and fondling. 
                        Harmless. What’s done is done. No 
                        harm, no foul. The important thing 
                        is, I didn’t give her the f-bomb.

                                 GREG
                        Ugh. And so what happened with 
                        little miss Chitty Chitty Bang 
                        Bang? Over and done with?

                                 KEVIN
                        Well, the whole Sheera make-out 
                        debacle throws a wrench in 
                        everything, but uh, Laurel’s at the 
                        airship launch today, and I 
                        thought, we’re free ‘til one so, 
                        what if we headed over there and 
                        fixed what’s broken? 

                                 GREG
                        Your plan is to run into a field of 
                        grown ups playing make believe and 
                        impress a pseudo-Victorian girl who 
                        thinks you’re sleaze?

                                 KEVIN
                        It’s all I’ve got. I’m a fool in 
                        love. And you’re my wingman.   

                                 GREG
                        Kevin, no way. We can’t. We’re not.  
                        We’ve got the pitch.  
                                 KEVIN
                        I know. Presentation’s important to 
                        me too. We’ll be back in time. 
                        Nothing can go wrong. I promise.  

           Derek stumbles in, wearing an open bathrobe, purple briefs, 
           and sunglasses. He’s splattered with bright paint, as though 
           he was attacked by Jackson Pollock.  

                                 DEREK
                        Morning sirs.  

           Derek takes their coffee pot and pours himself a cup.

                                 GREG
                        Derek, where’s Ressler?

                                 DEREK
                        Horse went AWOL. I’m telling you, 
                        slim. Nothing good ever comes out 
                        of a group of dudes playing truth 
                        or dare. Nothing.

           INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY

           Kevin and Greg are wearing tweed suits. CHUY, sales clerk, 
           assists them with lackluster zeal.

                                 KEVIN
                        We have to appear part man, part 
                        machine. Welding goggles. Gears, 
                        gauges, brass doodads. Maybe some 
                        like, metal looking gloves? 

                                 GREG
                        We really need all this stuff?

                                 KEVIN
                        I don’t think your heart’s in this.

                                 GREG
                        It’s just, we have to nail our 
                        presentation, lasso the sale, get 
                        the contract signed and executed.  
                        I don’t know if it’s the best day 
                        to be storming the castle.

                                 KEVIN
                        We’ll be in and out.  

                                 CHUY
                        What are you guys doing exactly?
                                 GREG
                        We’re intercepting a balloon launch 
                        because my colleague’s fallen in 
                        love with a Steampunk. Afterwards, 
                        we’re giving a sales pitch to a 
                        hospital chain, TWR.  

                                 KEVIN
                        It’s not a balloon per se. It’s an 
                        airship. Minor distinction.

                                 CHUY
                        Are you dudes on drugs?

                                 GREG
                        No, but we are drug reps. 
                        Incidentally, we’re gonna need a 
                        receipt. Business expense.

           EXT. ROADS - DAY

           The Pontiac zigzags through traffic at 70mph or so.

           INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

                                 GREG
                        You’re gonna get us killed! 

                                 KEVIN
                        You handle the map! I’ll handle the 
                        wheel, okay? Good.

           EXT. BENDER PARK - PARKING LOT - DAY

           The car off-balance haphazardly turns onto a road leading 
           into Bender Park. The Pontiac barrels across a parking lot, 
           and drifts sideways into a wall. Kevin and Greg SCREAM.

           INT. RENTAL CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Greg and Kevin sit in the totaled Pontiac, unhurt.   

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m guessing it’s too late to 
                        change my mind about the insurance 
                        coverage.  

           Greg tries his door but it won’t budge.
                                 GREG
                        Yep. I’m going to have to get out 
                        on your side.

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           Steam-powered vehicles roam the bustling grounds. Kevin and 
           Greg, clothed in their ramshackle approximation of Steampunk 
           attire, scamper across the field. Greg spots Laurel atop a 
           three story tower, to which an airship is docked. He points 
           her out to Kevin. Kevin rushes over and races up the stairs 
           that wrap around the tower.  

           ON TOWER

           Laurel is helping guests onto the airship. Once atop the 
           tower, Kevin blows his whistle to get her attention. The 
           GUARD takes a close look at Kevin. 

                                 GUARD
                        Do you possess a ticket, sir?

                                 KEVIN
                        I’ve got business with her. 

                                 GUARD
                        Then you have business with me, 
                        Farb.

                                 LAUREL
                        It’s okay, Isaac. I can manage.

           ON TREE

           From afar, Dimitri, standing alone beneath a tree, watches.

           ON TOWER

                                 LAUREL
                        What are you doing here?

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m here to win you back.

                                 LAUREL
                        You never had me to lose. How am I 
                        supposed to ever trust someone like 
                        you? You play sincere, but you’re 
                        full of shit.  

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m not. Not about this. Hear me 
                        out, Laurel. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KEVIN (CONT'D)
                        What happened last night was a 
                        colossal fuckup and you have every 
                        reason to throw me off the side of 
                        this tower.  

                                 LAUREL
                        That was a real dick move, bringing 
                        some other girl back to your room, 
                        just ‘cause I’m not willing to put 
                        out on the second date.  

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m here because I want it all out 
                        there. No secrets. No deceit. When 
                        you walked in on me last night and 
                        I saw your face, it felt like 
                        someone hit me in the neck with a 
                        hammer. In that moment, I realized 
                        something. There’s more to life 
                        than single malt scotch, the bone-
                        in ribeye and casual sex with 
                        beautiful women. Because all of 
                        those are fleeting. For whatever 
                        reason, when I meet someone, I try 
                        so hard not to fall for them. Just 
                        because I got hurt once. We’ve only 
                        known each other for a couple days, 
                        and long term who knows? But if 
                        you’ll give me the chance to try 
                        this thing, to see how it goes, 
                        just one chance, I’m all in. 
                        Whaddya think?

           ON TREE

           Kevin takes her hand. Dimitri pulls his crossbow’s trigger.

                                 DIMITRI
                        Not on my watch.

           Kevin is hit with the arrow, and falls to the floor.

                                 DIMITRI
                        Jenga, cocksucker!

           ON TOWER

                                 GUARD #1
                        Suspend the revelry! Man down!

           Kevin lies there, lifeless, the arrow sticking out above his 
           collarbone. Laurel kneels down beside him.   
                                 LAUREL
                        Oh my gosh! Are you okay?

                                 KEVIN
                        Never been better. Oh man, right in 
                        the trapezius. Wow that stings.  

           FROM KEVIN’S DELIRIOUS POV - Sounds of the actual world fade 
           into silence as Laurel sings EVERYTHING’S ALRIGHT from Jesus 
           Christ Superstar to Kevin. Cartoon animals gather to listen.

           ON TREE

           Doug, the ever-shirtless Steampunk, reaches into a bush and 
           yanks out a hiding Dimitri.

                                 DIMITRI
                        Lemme go! I’m about to concuss your 
                        ass, brah.  

           Doug slaps Dimitri across the face. Dimitri begins to weep.

           EXT. FIELD - TOWER BASE - LATER

           An ambulance with spinning sirens is parked next to the 
           tower. Laid out on a stretcher, Kevin whistles Greg over.

                                 GREG
                        Don’t talk. Save your strength.

                                 KEVIN
                        No. This is important. I have vials 
                        of sperm in my freezer. If I die, 
                        make sure those sperms become 
                        babies. And I want my children to 
                        know how incredible I was. Tell 
                        them I could slam dunk. 

           Kevin pulls the whistle off from around his neck.

                                 KEVIN
                        Here. I want you to have this.  
                        Just take it.

           Greg solemnly accepts the whistle.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Who shot me?

                                 GREG
                        Laurel’s ex boyfriend. He said you 
                        had it coming for making her cry.
                                 KEVIN
                        He’s probably right. Hey. Pull out 
                        the arrow. On three.

                                 GREG
                        No. That’s a terrible idea. We’re 
                        pushing the pitch back a day. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Fuck that. We’re doing this thing.  
                        Today.

           Kevin breaks off the arrow, winces and groans.

                                 KEVIN
                        Easy street now, brother. Fuck, 
                        that smarts. 

           EXT. BENDER PARK - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Kevin, wearing a sling, Greg and Laurel march across the lot 
           to a parked Toyota Previa, which Derek Poon is leaning 
           against. His t-shirt reads “Fly Me To The Poon.” 

                                 DEREK
                        Previa. Spanish for player.

                                 GREG
                        Derek, are you legally allowed to 
                        drive?

                                 DEREK
                        Allowed?

           Derek chuckles. He pulls open the sliding door for them.  
           Greg gets in. Laurel throws her arms around Kevin.

                                 LAUREL
                        Godspeed, Apollo.

           She kisses Kevin, helps him into the Previa, and slides the 
           door closed. 

           INT. TOYOTA PREVIA - DAY

           Derek’s driving. Kevin’s in the backseat, eating powdered 
           donuts with his good arm. Greg, riding shotgun, is in the 
           midst of a heated cell phone conversation. Ressler is passed 
           out, buckled in, wearing a hospital gown and ID bracelet.
                                 GREG
                        This can’t happen, Manzur. We 
                        haven’t even presented yet. I don’t 
                        care. We’re already en route! 
                        You’re giving us five minutes. 
                        Yeah, you are. 
                             (hangs up)
                        They went ahead and signed with 
                        Sheera and Mandy.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Promise not to get upset.

                                 GREG
                        Upset about what? I don’t know what 
                        you’re gonna say.

                                 KEVIN
                        When Sheera and I got together, we 
                        um, talked a little.

                                 GREG
                        About what? What’d you tell her?

                                 KEVIN
                        Nothing really... Nothing of 
                        substance... More or less...
                             (beat)
                        Sheera saw our slideshow.

                                 GREG
                        How would she happen to see the 
                        sideshow? That doesn’t happen by 
                        accident.

                                 KEVIN
                        I know it sounds ridiculous now, 
                        but I’m weak, man. I’m like a moth 
                        to a flame with Sheera. But the 
                        important part is I didn’t have sex 
                        with her. Which should be worth 
                        something.  

                                 GREG
                        Pull the car over, Derek. Pull it 
                        over!

           Derek pulls over. Greg leaps from the van.  

           EXT. QUIET ROAD - DAY

           Greg yells, and throws punches in the air.   
                                 KEVIN
                        Don’t have a freak out! This is a 
                        hiccup, not a nail in the coffin.

                                 GREG
                        Hiccup? History Lesson for you, 
                        buddy. Umberto Tozzi wrote and 
                        performed Gloria, the 1979 Italian 
                        dance smash. Then 1982, Laura 
                        Branigan comes walking along, sings 
                        the fuckin’ song in English, and 
                        bam, Flashdance. That’s what just 
                        happened to us. We wrote Gloria and 
                        got steamrolled by a couple of 
                        Laura Branigans. Everything we 
                        planned is out the window because 
                        you couldn’t keep your Judas Dick 
                        away from Sheera for one week. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Why are you raising your voice at 
                        me? I'm not the enemy. 

                                 GREG
                        Yes you are! If Mandy and Sheera 
                        saw our bulk rate, they can 
                        undercut it, and surprise, they 
                        did. The wind in our sails is dead 
                        as virginity on prom night. Game 
                        over. Because you couldn’t keep 
                        your mouth or zipper shut. 

                                 KEVIN 
                        Calm down, shake it off, get 
                        hungry. We’ll go to wherever 
                        they’re at, and convince them to 
                        hear us out, and ten minutes later, 
                        we’ll bring in the sale. Let’s go 
                        take down that white whale and 
                        finish this. Are you with me?

                                 GREG
                        Am I with you? Are you out of your 
                        fucking mind? You don’t get it, do 
                        you? You see yourself one way but 
                        everyone else knows better, except 
                        me. I carried the load. I busted my 
                        ass for this sale because I wanted 
                        a chance at greatness, but you 
                        rolled the dice and lo and behold, 
                        we came up assfucked. So no, I’m 
                        not with you, you perfidious son of 
                        a bitch.
           Greg kicks the van. It hurts him more than it hurts the van.

                                 GREG
                        Ow! Come out here! Come out here 
                        right now! I’m gonna bash your face 
                        in!  

           Kevin steps out of the van.

                                 KEVIN 
                        Yeah? Is that what you’d like? 
                        Punch a guy in a sling?

                                 GREG
                        If it’s you, yeah. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Why are you such a pessimist all 
                        the time? When things go sour, you 
                        just wanna panic and admit defeat. 
                        ‘Cause it’s easier to lose than to 
                        keep fighting. Isn’t that how it’s 
                        worked out with your girlfriend? 

           This sets Greg off. He lunges at Kevin, tackling him to the 
           pavement, and punches him in the side, repeatedly.  

                                 GREG
                        Fight back, you piece of crap. You 
                        big pile of nothing, you shit! 

           GUNSHOT! Greg and Kevin look over. Derek has fired a flare 
           gun into the air.  

                                 DEREK
                        Hey Seals & Crofts! Ixnay on the 
                        fisticuffs. You’re far from 
                        shipwrecked. 

           Derek pulls a manila envelope from his jacket. Greg stands.

                                 GREG
                        You snagged their presentation?

                                 KEVIN
                        Derek, did you split the uprights 
                        with Mandy?

                                 DEREK
                        Sometimes no one’s willing to jump 
                        on a grenade; so sometimes, they 
                        have to call in the bomb squad.

                        I detonate panties. Without 
                        breaking a sweat. Q.E.D.  

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Derek shares a jacuzzi with Mandy. He is massaging her foot, 
           which at one point, he proceeds to lick. She giggles, 
           revealing the green-toothed smile. Ressler, nude save for ski 
           goggles, sits in a plastic chair in the corner, and puffs 
           away at the hookah lodged between his legs.

                                 DEREK
                        You got nice feet, girl. Mmmm. Your 
                        feet taste like kiwi. Stand up, let 
                        me see you. Girl, you look good 
                        enough to freak.  

           BACK TO PRESENT

                                 DEREK
                        I violated my parole all over that 
                        girl. Then I pilfered this nugget.  

           Derek hands Greg the envelope. Kevin manages to stand.

                                 KEVIN
                        Kiwi?

                                 DEREK
                        What? You can’t tell a girl her 
                        feet taste like feet. That just 
                        won’t work if you wanna drop dimes 
                        in the jukebox. Girl went straight 
                        Rosh Hashanah on my shofar.  

           Greg opens the envelope. His face lights up. Eureka.

                                 GREG
                        Holy Fuck!  

                                 KEVIN
                        That good? You ready to harpoon 
                        that white whale?

                                 GREG
                        Just call me Ishmael, motherfucker. 
           EXT. GIANNO’S ITALIAN RISTORANTE - DAY

           The Previa comes to a stop. Kevin and Greg jump out. Greg 
           looks back, before closing the sliding door.

                                 GREG
                        You did good, Derek.   

                                 DEREK
                        You know how I do. The condom did 
                        it’s job, and I did mine. You 
                        horses need backup in there, throw 
                        me the signal, alright?

           Greg nods. He and Kevin walk towards the entrance.

                                 GREG
                        I’m sorry about the outburst back 
                        there. It was uncalled for.    

                                 KEVIN
                        Don’t apologize. Not for that. I 
                        regret the mess I made. Just know, 
                        I did the best I could. 

                                 GREG
                        I know you did, brother. Hey, no 
                        matter what happens in there, 
                        nobody else plays the game like us.   
                        Nobody. This is our moment. Let’s 
                        go in there and knock their socks 
                        off, leave ‘em barefoot.  

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m with you, man. This one’s for 
                        Umberto Tozzi. Bring it in.

           They huddle, head against head.

                                 KEVIN
                        Bring in the noise.  

                                 GREG
                        Bring in the Garfunkel.  

           Kevin and Greg break and sprint for the entrance.

           INT. GIANNO’S ITALIAN RISTORANTE - CONTINUOUS

           Kevin and Greg soar through the doors, hauling serious ass 
           through a crowded restaurant. Out of breath, they reach the 
           table where the P&T Committee is eating a celebratory lunch 
           hosted by Sheera & Mandy. Greg blows the whistle. 
                                 GREG
                        Sorry to interrupt the merriment 
                        and bucatini, but we have a sales 
                        presentation to deliver.

                                 SHEERA
                        What? The fuck? Mandy, put down 
                        your fork.

           Sheera and Mandy walk up to Kevin and Greg.   

                                 SHEERA
                        Too late, Kev. We have a signed 
                        contract. Notarized. Burn.

                                 KEVIN
                        Well, that’s fine. ‘Cause Greg and 
                        I have Mendelsohn.  

           Kevin holds up the manila envelope. Sheera looks furious.

                                 SHEERA
                             (to Mandy)
                        How the f does he have that? 
                             (to Kevin)
                        Yeah, go ahead and stab me in the 
                        back. See if I care. 

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m stabbing you in the back? 
                        Honestly, Sheera, who spitroasted 
                        who? Sleep on that.  

                                 BEEV
                        Sorry to interrupt. We signed for 
                        Zyklar. Deal’s done, guys.

                                 KEVIN
                        This isn’t only a real F.U. to me 
                        and Greg, but also to your 
                        patients. I’m standing here with a 
                        fractured clavicle, recovering from 
                        a crossbow attack, and you want to 
                        lay that bullshit on us? You’re 
                        weak sauce. All of you.

                                 DEBORAH
                        We were appalled by your behavior 
                        this week. You aren’t salesmen.  
                        You’re clowns. An embarrassment 
                        across the board. 
                                 GREG
                        Seriously, who are you to pass 
                        judgement on us? Yeah, we did some 
                        dumb things this week, made some 
                        poor decisions. But so did everyone 
                        else in this room. It’s called 
                        being human. Yeah, I asked a 
                        masseuse for a happy ending. Yeah, 
                        I almost defibrillated my genitals. 
                        But over the last week, everything 
                        we’ve done has been for you, for 
                        this moment. You want to make this 
                        decision by who’s got the better or 
                        more professional sales team, your 
                        priorities are fucked, for lack of 
                        a better word. This is about your 
                        patients. This is about Prexiol and 
                        Zyklar. In price and efficacy, 
                        we’re neck and neck, right? Why 
                        choose one drug over the other for 
                        your formulary? I’m not a chemist.

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m clearly not a chemist.

                                 GREG
                        But some of you are. And you know 
                        that what differentiates meds isn’t 
                        that simple. You’ve kicked the 
                        tires, done your research. You know 
                        all this baloney from stem to 
                        stern. But really, if you know it, 
                        the choice is clear. Prexiol--

                                 MARISSA
                        We already chose.

                                 GREG
                        I’m not finished, Marissa. Just 
                        ‘cause Mandy spelled the alphabet 
                        on you, doesn’t mean you have to 
                        spell things out for us. In 
                        September 2008, at Mendelsohn

                        which in fact, you run, Dr. Jeremy

                        data all you want, but your own 
                        study says we have the better drug, 
                        even before the advantages when it 
                        comes to side effects.

                        And Burlington Labs can match 
                        Floretech’s price, even if they 
                        undercut our original quote.

                                 DEBORAH
                        Sorry guys. Too little, too late.  
                        The penalty for breaking the 
                        contract is one point eight mill.

                                 KEVIN
                        We’re authorized by corporate to 
                        cover any penalty outlays.

           Kevin opens his briefcase, and holds up a document.

                                 KEVIN
                        This is the contract. You might not 
                        like me, you might not like Greg, 
                        but we are not the product we sell.  
                        The product we sell is the better 
                        choice, and you all know it in your 
                        gut. I know you know.  

           The P&T’ers are silent. Deborah looks to Manzur.

           EXT. GIANNO’S ITALIAN RISTORANTE - CONTINUOUS

           Kevin and Greg step out into the parking lot. Greg is happier 
           and less stressed than we’ve ever seen him.  

           Sheera and Mandy come chasing after them. Mandy grabs Greg by 
           the arm and stops him.  

                                 MANDY
                        This isn’t fair. I blew each of 
                        those guys.  

                                 GREG
                        You blew all four of them? Jesus 
                        Christ! How many mouths do you 
                        have?  

                                 SHEERA
                        For the record, Russell, I fuck 
                        circles around you.

                                 KEVIN
                        And look how far that’s gotten you.     

           Kevin and Greg walk away with triumph in their step. They 
           break out into laughter. 

           INT. JAPANESE UNDERGROUND JAZZ CAVE - NIGHT
           Sushi artfully covers a naked woman lying in the center of a 
           table. Kevin, Greg, and assorted folk from their adventure 
           are seated around her. Greg holds up his glass for a toast.

                                 GREG
                        Next year in Jerusalem!

                                 ALL
                        Next year in Jerusalem!

           Rejoicing! Sake bombs and shouts of ‘Kanpai’ all around!  
           Doug, the Steampunk, snorts wasabi. 

                                 RESSLER
                        Sal, you wanna go to a range, fire 
                        off some Uzi’s or something?  

                                 DEREK
                        I’ll one up that. Let’s gobble 
                        shrooms and break into the zoo.  

                                 RESSLER
                        Boomers? Fuck yeah. Let’s 
                        cannonball.   

           EXT. ZOO - NIGHT

           Derek and Ressler are riding camels whilst tripping balls.

                                 RESSLER
                        Haha. Yes! Giddy-up. Woooo!  

                                 DEREK
                        Flap those wings, Pegasus! Flap 
                        those wings! Show me your magic!  

           We hear the approaching sirens.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Derek and Ressler are getting handcuffed.

                                 ZOO COP
                        Derek Poon, you’re racking up quite 
                        the rap sheet this month.  

                                 RESSLER
                        Wait. You’re Derek Poon? 

           Derek nods. Ressler sighs, trying to get a handle on this.
                                 RESSLER
                        If you’re Derek Poon, who’s 
                        Salvatore Brancusi? Fuck me. Is 
                        there even a Salvatore Brancusi?

                                 DEREK
                        Hey, don’t take it too hard, T-
                        Bone. We’ll always have underpants 
                        paintball.

           INT. KEVIN’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           The phone rings. We pan over. Kevin’s bed is still made.  

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAWN

           Greg is passed out next to Kevin on the front lawn. They’ve 
           been out all night, celebrating their victory. A newspaper 
           lays next to them. Neither Kevin nor Greg is startled when 
           the sprinklers start up. Kevin stretches and groans.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Bacon egg and cheese. Kaiser Roll.  
                        I’d pay ransom money for one of 
                        those fuckers right now.

                                 GREG
                        I could lay waste to some pancakes.  

           We pull back to the house, from which steps SUBURBAN DAD.

                                 SUBURBAN DAD
                        Hiya there. I don’t mind you bucks 
                        being unconscious on my lawn, but 
                        can one of you get my paper?

                                 GREG
                        Be right there, sir. 

           INT. CONVENTION HALL - DAY

           The booths are being dismantled. Forklifts carry pallets of 
           equipment. Orange ladders. The carpet is littered with 
           crushed posterboard, discarded badges and brochures. The 
           registration booths (On-Site Registration / International / 
           Pre-Registered + No Badge) stand dormant, their signs unlit.  
           EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY

           Kevin and Greg stand with their luggage.  

                                 GREG
                        You realize that in Moby Dick, the 
                        whale wins?

                                 KEVIN
                        No it doesn’t. Really?  

                                 GREG
                        Yeah. I’m pretty sure.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Well this time... it didn’t.

           Greg nods in solemn agreement. Laurel rides into the lot in a 
           steam-powered jalopy which burps up white plumes as it pulls 
           up in front of them.

                                 KEVIN
                        So long, Greg. Don’t do anything 
                        I’d do.  

           Kevin hugs Greg and then gets into the open cockpit, tossing 
           his suitcase in the backseat. Laurel kisses him. They motor 
           away into the sunset. Greg considers the shiny whistle 
           hanging from his neck and smiles. He’s earned it.  

           INT. GREG’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Greg, exhausted, wheels his luggage into the foyer. He 
           doesn’t bother to take off his shoes. Tiff is on the couch, 
           watching t.v. Greg gives a wave. 

                                 GREG
                        Hey there.  

                                 TIFF
                        What are you doing here? Wait! 
                        Whoa! White carpet. White carpet!  
                        No shoes, Greg! Come on. Rules.

                                 GREG
                        I’m not taking them off. Tiff, it 
                        took me a long time to wake up and 
                        realize, I am no longer your whack 
                        a mole. And you are no longer a 
                        barnacle on my heart.  

           Greg sprints upstairs.
           INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Tiff walks in on Greg pulling drawers from the dresser and 
           dumping out the clothes into suitcases on the bed. 

                                 TIFF
                        What are you doing? Stop it!

                                 GREG
                        I asked you to move in because I 
                        was afraid I couldn’t do any 
                        better. I got worried, like, what’s 
                        gonna happen if Tiff doesn’t take 
                        me back? Will I go through my 
                        thirties alone? But then it hit me.  
                        None of that matters. You don’t 
                        love me. 

                                 TIFF
                        But you love me. I know you do.  
                             (beat)
                        I think I might still love you, 
                        Greggy.  

                                 GREG
                        Enough. Shut it down. Listen to 
                        what you’re saying! You don’t love 
                        me, because you don’t throw tampons 
                        at the people you love!  

                                 TIFF
                        I’m keeping the jewelry.

                                 GREG
                        Keep whatever you want. ‘Cause I’m 
                        coming out of this ahead. I’ll even 
                        pay for the movers when they take 
                        your stuff out of my house.  

           Greg leaves the bedroom, darts down the stairs, and heads 
           outside into the yard and casts Tiff’s suitcases out into the 
           darkness. He blows his whistle and throws punches in the air. 

                                 GREG
                        Who drives the bus? Greg drives the 
                        bus! GREG DRIVES THE BUS! 

           INT. OFFICE RECEPTION - DAY

           Shirt untucked, Greg strides straight up to Darby’s desk.
                                 GREG
                        This may be coming out of the blue, 
                        but I’ve waited long enough. Darby 
                        Oppenheim, I’ve been smitten with 
                        you since that Wednesday you 
                        started temping here two years ago. 
                        I don’t know if you’re single or 
                        even interested in a knucklehead 
                        like me, but maybe, if you are, we 
                        could go out sometime? 

                                 DARBY
                        I’d like that.  

                                 GREG
                        I was hoping you’d say that. Cool.  
                        Beyond cool. C’est supercool.  

                                 DARBY
                        Greg, you didn’t know that I’ve 
                        always had a thing for you?

                                 GREG
                        No, but I kinda wish I had. Wow.

           Greg mimics his head exploding. They laugh. Greg sighs.

                                 DARBY
                        Is something wrong?

                                 GREG
                        Not a thing in the world.  

           INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Flickering candles. Darby and Greg stand face to face. They 
           each hold a 9-Volt battery to their tongues, before lowering 
           the batteries out of frame towards each other’s respective 
           areas. BUZZ!

           Their eyes light up because: THIS IS WHAT LOVE FEELS LIKE.  

                                                              FADE OUT.

           1979 Footage of Umberto Tozzi performing GLORIA on an Italian 
           television program plays as the end crawl rolls past.
