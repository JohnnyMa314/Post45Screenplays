           IN DARKNESS--

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        It was Jimmy who taught me how to 
                        clean a fish.

           A KNIFE--

           glinting red from nearby firelight SLICES into the underbelly 
           of a dead salmon.  Bloody brackish water POURING out.

           A GLASSY DEAD EYE--

           reflects the scythe-like blade as it SWINGS DOWN, beheading 
           the catch.

           GLOWING RED EMBERS--

           float skyward from a pit-fire covered by a metal grate.  The 
           scaley flesh of the salmon SLAPPED across the grill...

           EXT.  CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

           Dark waves gently lap at the shore of Bainbridge Island near 
           Seattle.  YOUNG JACK (9, wiry and inquisitive) watches JIMMY 
           (44, stocky, imposing yet avuncular) turn his catch over the 
           coals.  Jack’s arm is in a cast. 

           TITLE: PUGET SOUND, 1985.

           MINUTES LATER

           A picnic table near the shore.  A paper plate of Jimmy’s 
           entirely unappetizing entrée slammed down.  Seated around the 
           table: Jimmy, Jack, MILTON (30, trim, businesslike and Jack’s 
           father) and YOUNG TODD (11, a portly bully, Jimmy’s son).  

                                 JIMMY
                        Let’s give thanks.

           Jimmy and Todd bow their heads, close their eyes.  Jack looks 
           nervously to Milton who nods.  As Jack begins to lower his 
           own head, Jimmy suddenly SLAMS HIS FIST on the table.

                                 JIMMY
                        Alright.  Time to fucking eat.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        We spent a lot of time at the beach 
                        house that summer.

           REVEAL THE STATELY HOME up a hill from the table.  Cedar 
           shingles, an expansive wrap-around porch.  Warm tungsten 
           light spills from great bay windows onto the immaculate lawn.

           High atop a cupola on the roof, a WROUGHT IRON WEATHERVANE 
           begins to spin wildly in the evening breeze.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        The summer my mom passed.
           The weathervane suddenly stops, pointing due south.

           INT.  JACKIE’S CAR (MOVING) - AFTERNOON

           Beaded raindrops cling to the passenger window of a mid-80s 
           Mercedes sedan.  Jack stares out at the lush Pacific 
           Northwest forest as it rolls by.  Driving the car is JACKIE 
           (29, brunette beauty). 

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        I was with her when it happened.

                                 YOUNG JACK
                        How much longer?

                                 JACKIE
                        Hard to say with the rain.  Why 
                        don’t you take a nap?

           IN BLACK.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        So I did.

           Hold in darkness for a moment.  The sound of RAIN on a CAR’S 
           ROOFTOP.  WIND DRIFTING BY.  An eerie stillness.  And then--

           CRASH.  THE CACOPHONY OF BUCKLING METAL, SHATTERING GLASS.

           INT.  JACKIE’S CAR (MOVING) - EARLY EVENING

           Inside the cabin of the car as it SLAMS THROUGH A GUARD RAIL 
           and begins SOMERSAULTING DOWN A WOODED INCLINE.  Jack 
           awakens.  Jackie SCREAMS.  And the world spins around them, 
           end over end.  

           Jack’s eyes widen as he sees it coming-- a huge REDWOOD TREE 
           TRUNK closing in fast on his mother’s side.  He braces...

                                 YOUNG JACK
                        MOM!!!

           She turns to look as THE CAR COLLIDES WITH THE TREE.  Her 
           neck SNAPS as her body WHIPS BACK, HEAD FLYING DOWN DOWN DOWN 
           into the HARD POLISHED WOOD of the steering wheel.  HER NOSE 
           HITS SQUARE, BUCKLES.

           A spray of BLOOD.  The sound cuts out.  SILENCE.

           Jack SCREAMS in anguish --- UNHEARD.

           EXT.  FOREST - TWILIGHT

           Red and blue emergency lights echo off the great branches of 
           pine.  Two EMTs attend to Jack, removed from the car wreckage 
           and staring curiously silent at a compound fracture jutting 
           sanguine from his wrist.

           Fifteen feet away, two more EMTs load Jackie’s body onto a 
           waiting stretcher.  And the rain continues to fall.
                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        A week after the funeral, we cashed 
                        out.

           INSURANCE DOCUMENTS--

           A rapid-fire medley of typewritten legalese: “indemnity... 
           claimant... beneficiary... to pay not more than... liability 
           after death...”  A blank line appears: “Signature.”  A GOLD 
           TIPPED PEN SWOOPS in and SIGNS in meticulous script: 

                                     “Milton Grant” 

           A MONEY COUNTER--

           whips through a stack of $100s.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Dad said cash was king.

           EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - MORNING

           A gorgeous early spring day.  The beach house picturesque in 
           the sunlight as a REALTOR leads Milton and Jack to the front 
           door, opening it and ushering them inside.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        It was the first place the agent 
                        showed us.  The beach house...

           INSIDE THE HOUSE--

           A dizzyingly fast MONTAGE, images spinning past blurry and 
           half-seen:

           - A cathedral-ceiling'd LIVING ROOM
           - A yawning immense FIREPLACE
           - A gleaming stainless steel SHOWER HEAD
           - Brushed metal in the MODERN KITCHEN
           - The view of the sound from a BEDROOM WINDOW

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        So we took it.  Our new beginning.

           EXT.  PUGET SOUND - NIGHT

           The rippling glow of a FULL MOON reflected on the water.

           INT.  BEACH HOUSE - JACK’S ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Jack sits on his bed staring out at the sound.  Milton 
           appears in the doorway, briefcase in hand.

                                 MILTON (O.C.)
                        We got a meeting.  Come on.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        With Mom gone, Dad started taking 
                        me everywhere he went.  His new 
                        partner, he called me.
           ALFA ROMEO MONTAGE

           - CAR KEYS snatched off an end table.
           - THE IGNITION as the key is inserted.  An ENGINE ROARS.
           - AN ‘84 SPYDER behind a rising garage door.  HEADLIGHTS UP.  

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        He was a lawyer.  That much I knew.

           INT.  MILTON’S CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

           The Alfa Romeo speeds down a deserted street.  Jack, in his 
           cast, attempts to play a mercury maze game as Milton drives.

                                 YOUNG JACK
                        Why are all your meetings at night?

                                 MILTON
                        People pay a premium to reach me 
                        whenever they have a problem.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        “People” might’ve been an 
                        overstatement.

           I/E.  MILTON’S CAR / ALLEYWAY - THAT MOMENT

           The Alfa Romeo pulls into a trash-filled alley.  Stops.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Dad only ever had one client.

                                 MILTON
                        You wait here a minute.  I’ll be 
                        right back.

                                 YOUNG JACK
                        I don’t feel safe.

                                 MILTON
                        I’ll just be a minute.  You’re 
                        safer here than home alone, OK?

                                 YOUNG JACK
                        Why am I safer here?

                                 MILTON
                        Just wait in the car, Jack.

           And with that, Milton’s gone.  Jack watches as he walks 
           through the alley to an unmarked door.  Milton KNOCKS on the 
           door.  It swings open and Milton passes inside but before the 
           door shuts, Jack spies--

           A TOPLESS WOMAN smoking a worn-down cigarette in need of 
           ashing staring out into the alley.  She makes eye contact 
           with Jack who stares back wide-eyed.

           Suddenly, JIMMY appears next to the woman, pushes her out of 
           view, smiling menacingly at Jack before slamming the door.
                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Jimmy Shay.  “Uncle Jimmy” he said 
                        I should call him.  We saw a lot of 
                        Uncle Jimmy that summer at the 
                        beach house.  Dad said it was 
                        because they had work to do.  
                        Jimmy’s son Todd had his own 
                        explanation.

           TIGHT ON TODD--

           by the shore of the beach house staring DIRECT TO CAMERA:

                                 YOUNG TODD
                        Mom caught him fucking some whore 
                        so now we’ve got nowhere else to 
                        go.

           INT.  JIMMY’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON (A FEW DAYS EARLIER)

           Creeping down a hallway comes CHRISTINE (30s, dragon lady in 
           a pantsuit).  She hears:

                                 MISTRESS (O.S.)
                        Oh yeah.  That’s right.  Uh-huh.  
                        Give it to me, Jimmy...

           Christine reaches the bedroom door.  Pushes it open.  Inside 
           stands Jimmy screwing his MISTRESS from behind.  They freeze.

                                 JIMMY
                        You can have the house and the car, 
                        but I’m keeping Todd.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I want both cars.  And the vacation 
                        condo.

           EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - SHORELINE - DAY

           Todd, as above, with Jack by the beach house.  

                                 YOUNG TODD
                        She sold me for a timeshare in 
                        Miami.

           Jack doesn’t know what to say.  He turns to look away up the 
           shore where Jimmy and Milton sit drinking beers.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        I started to wonder if Dad bought 
                        the house for us or for Jimmy...

           FATHERS & SONS MONTAGE

           - SWIMMING in the sound, Jack sits dockside with his arm  
             in a cast.  Jimmy leans on the dock talking with him.
           - FISHING as Jimmy shows Jack how to use a reel.
           - A PICKUP GAME of baseball in the backyard, Jimmy teaching   
             Jack to pitch with his good arm.
                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Everything we did that summer was 
                        at Jimmy’s urging.  Whatever Todd 
                        said, Jimmy seemed happy to be 
                        there.  And I was happy to have 
                        him.  Happy to learn how to clean a 
                        fish.

           THAT KNIFE--

           slicing through the salmon, bloody water spilling out.

           INT.  BEACH HOUSE - JACK’S ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Jack lies awake in his bed.  Todd on the floor in a sleeping 
           bag.  The sound of a MOTORBOAT approaching fills the room.  
           Suddenly, a BRIGHT SPOTLIGHT cuts through the windows.  Then 
           darkness.  Jack sits up.

                                 YOUNG JACK
                        You hear that?

                                 YOUNG TODD
                        You think I’m deaf?

           Getting out of bed, Jack goes to his window followed by Todd.  
           They watch as a motorboat pulls up to the dock, TWO MEN 
           inside.  Jimmy and Milton walk down the dock toward the boat.  

           DOCK

           WIDE from JACK’S POV--  The two BOAT MEN climb up to the 
           dock.  One of them carrying a BRIEFCASE.   

           JACK’S ROOM

                                 YOUNG JACK
                        You know those guys?

                                 YOUNG TODD
                        Shhh.

           DOCK

           The first man gives the briefcase to Jimmy.  Jimmy sets it by 
           his side.  Extends his right arm to shake hands.  The man 
           from the boat reciprocates.  Then, a flurry of motion:

           - With his right hand, Jimmy PULLS THE FIRST MAN CLOSE.
           - With his left, Jimmy draws a PISTOL from his belt.
           - Jimmy PRESSES THE GUN TO THE MAN’S HEAD and FIRES.
           - A SPRAY OF GORE floats into the night air.
           - The man COLLAPSES to the dock.
           - The second man TURNS TO RUN.
           - Jimmy spins and SHOOTS THE SECOND MAN IN THE BACK.

           JACK’S ROOM

           Jack and Todd watch in horror.
           DOCK

           UP CLOSE & PART OF THE ACTION.  The second man lies face down 
           on the dock, bleeding from his mouth, GASPING FOR BREATH.

                                 JIMMY
                        You think you can skim from me?  Is 
                        that what you thought?

                                 DYING MAN
                        Jimmy...  please...

           Jimmy leans in close, presses the pistol to the man’s temple.  

                                 JIMMY
                        Please what, you stupid fuck?

           Milton stands back, tense, sweating.

                                 DYING MAN
                        ...don’t...do it...

           A long beat.

                                 JIMMY
                        Fine.

           Jimmy pulls the pistol away.  The dying man exhales.  Slowly, 
           he turns to face Jimmy.

                                 DYING MAN
                        Thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you...

           And now all at once, Jimmy SWINGS THE GUN BACK AROUND and 
           FIRES INTO THE MAN’S FACE.  

           JACK’S ROOM

           Jack and Todd frozen with panic.  From the dock, a blood-
           stained Jimmy turns toward the house.  LOOKS RIGHT AT THEM.  

           DOCK

           Milton also looks up at the house.  The silhouettes of the 
           boys vanishing from the window.

                                 JIMMY
                        Let’s clean this up.

           INT.  BEACH HOUSE - BATHROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Daylight through the bathroom window.  Milton alone.  Stares 
           into the mirror.  He’s covered in DRIED BLOOD and CAKED IN 
           DIRT.  His hand shaking, he reaches down to TURN ON THE TAP.

           The water begins to FLOW, running across his hands and 
           sinking STAINED AND DARK INTO THE DRAIN.

           Slowly, the BATHROOM DOOR SWINGS OPEN.  Jack stands there 
           staring at his father.  They take each other in for a moment.
                                 YOUNG JACK
                        Dad.  What happened?  

                                 MILTON
                        Go to your room, Jack.

                                 YOUNG JACK
                        What happened last night?

                                 MILTON
                        Go to your room.

           And he SLAMS THE DOOR in his son’s face.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        And that’s how you clean a fish.

           MAIN TITLES.

                            WHATEVER GETS YOU THROUGH THE NIGHT

           EXT.  BERING SEA - DUSK

           A BUOY dances in choppy, frigid ocean waters.  Ominous grey 
           clouds overhead.  The low rumble of a BOAT ENGINE becomes 
           audible as the prow of the 150-foot Delano thrusts her way 
           forward, long STALKS OF ICE hanging from her rails.

           DELANO DECK

           Clad in orange all-weather suits, the crew of FOUR DECKHANDS 
           guide the movement of THE BLOCK-- a hydraulic crane swinging 
           out over the edge of the ship.  

           TITLE: BERING SEA, 2008.

           HUGE SPRAYS OF WATER crash across the deck as the crew works 
           together wordlessly, their boots crunching through thick 
           masses of ice, the Delano pitching wildly.

           Closest to the starboard rail: JACK GRANT (here 32, wiry and 
           hardened, knowing eyes) and ARMAND POWERS (49, stocky, 
           bearded).  Jack SWINGS A GRAPPLING HOOK out toward the buoy, 
           trying to snag the line for the block.

                                 ARMAND
                        You got it.  You got it.

           Jack PULLS his line taut as the block winch veers down, the 
           hook inching slowly toward the buoy, closer, closer, swaying 
           in the chop.  Finally, it CATCHES.  Armand turns to face the 
           block operator: A THUMBS UP GESTURE.

           All at once, his face goes pale.  He freezes...

           THE WAVE--

           Twenty feet high, cresting just off the port side, a wall of 
           white foam.  Just enough time to SCREAM--
                                 ARMAND
                        PORT!

           Jack turns as the WAVE HITS, THE DELANO ROLLING.  And then

           INSIDE THE SURGE--

           A disorienting roar of water as Jack FLIES BACK, CRACKING 
           into the RAIL, FALLING, SLIDING ACROSS THE ICE FLOWS, his 
           hand GRASPING FOR ANYTHING, finally clasping firm to a ledge, 
           spitting water, opening his eyes to see

           ARMAND--

           An orange blur, twisting, trying to right himself and then 
           SLAMMING waist-high into the RAIL as another SURGE washes 
           OVER HIM, his body LOST IN THE DARK RUSH OF WATER.  The 
           moment passes.  The water clears.

           The deck rail is empty.  

           Jack spins, looks out toward the buoy off the starboard side.  
           There, bobbing up and then disappearing below the surface 
           drifts ARMAND, a BLOODY GASH visible across his forehead.  

                                 JACK
                        MAN OVER!

           He races across the deck, the ship still ROLLING in the 
           waves, grabbing another LINE attached to a FLOAT and HEAVING 
           IT OUT INTO THE SEA.

           IT SPLASHES DOWN near Armand.  He chokes, struggling to keep 
           his eyes open, watching it warily.  Shakily reaching out, he 
           pulls his body toward the float.  Gets pushed back by a wave.

                                 JACK
                        GRAB THE LINE, POWERS!

           Armand reaches out once more, eyes heavy as his body seems to 
           SHUT OFF, his arms limp, beginning to sink.

           Jack watches stonefaced.  And then--  HE HURRIEDLY TIES OFF 
           the float line to the DECK RAIL.  THE KNOT GOES TIGHT.

           IN THE BLOCK, the crane OPERATOR sees what’s happening...

                                 BLOCK OPERATOR
                        JACK!  STOP!

           Jack turns to the operator then back to the roiling sea.  And 
           now he hoists himself up onto the rail and JUMPS OVERBOARD.

           A long arcing plummet DOWN DOWN DOWN--

           UNDERWATER--

           In a storm of froth, Jack’s body SLICES into the water, the 
           FLOAT and ARMAND bobbing about above him.  HIS EYES GO WIDE, 
           THE SHOCK OF THE COLD, and then he begins to RISE...
           BERING SEA--

           Bursting through a CRESTING WAVE, Jack grabs Armand’s 
           lifeless body, bringing his head up above the water, pushing 
           off, trying to make his way to the float--

                                 JACK
                        Come on, Powers.

           Jack grasps for it once, twice, the tide each time pushing 
           the float just out of reach.  Breathing heavy, straining, he 
           sinks lower in the water, fighting to stay above the surface.

           Another WAVE CRESTS, the float drifting into his hands.  JACK 
           GRABS ON TIGHTLY, Armand limp in his arms.  And the BLOCK ARM 
           swings in overhead, the hook LOWERING DOWN...

           INT.  DELANO - DECKHANDS QUARTERS - NIGHT

           Armand lies in a bunk, face bandaged, skin faintly blue.  He 
           breathes shallowly, thin, ASLEEP.  Jack’s next to him, 
           sipping a cup of steaming coffee.  The ship’s CAPTAIN (50s, 
           balding & sternfaced) stands nearby.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        How ‘bout a drink then?

           A DIRTY GLASS--

           golden whiskey poured in, not sitting level but tipping to-
           and-fro with the boat’s rock.

           EXT.  STONE HARBOR - THE NEXT DAY

           ICE MELTS ON THE RAILS as the Delano sails into port.  The 
           sun bright behind thin high stratus clouds.  GULLS CALL.  

           A mid-sized industrial fishing town.  Docks and warehouses 
           line the waterfront.  Rolling green hills.  A church steeple.  

           EXT.  PIER SEVEN - MOMENTS LATER

           The crew of the Delano disembark, walking tired along a 
           wooden pier toward the street above.  Jack ambles head down, 
           a backpack slung over his shoulder wearing torn blue jeans 
           and a corduroy construction worker’s jacket.

           He looks up.  MOLLY (27, dark-haired with a trace of Inuit 
           blood) leans against a rusted blue 80s Ford pickup.  She 
           smiles at him wanly, raises a hand.  Jack waves back.

           INT.  MOLLY’S TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY

           Molly drives.  Jack in the passenger seat.

                                 JACK
                        You didn’t have to come down.

                                 MOLLY
                        I know.
                                 JACK
                        How’d you even--?

                                 MOLLY
                        I called Harlan and told him to let 
                        me know when you were headed back.

                                 JACK
                        You miss me that much?  

           Beat.

                                 MOLLY
                        Jack.  Someone called yesterday.  
                        Looking for you.  Said you guys 
                        grew up together.  Said his name 
                        was Todd Shay.

           Jack’s suddenly silent.  Serious.

                                 JACK
                        What’d he want?

                                 MOLLY
                        You know him?

                                 JACK
                        Knew him.  What’d he want, Molly?

           Molly presses the brake.  Stops.  A long beat.

                                 MOLLY
                        He said he didn’t think anyone else 
                        would call you.  So he wanted to 
                        call because...  I--
                             (beat)
                        Your father, Jack.  Your father had 
                        a heart attack.  He’s dead.

           COUNTRY ROAD - THAT MOMENT

           Dwarfed by the immense wild landscape, the pickup idles.  
           From the opposite direction, a SEMI-TRUCK lumbers past.

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           EXT.  DIG SITE - DAY (2007)

           CLOSE ON a mound of MOTTLED WET DIRT, clumps breaking apart, 
           drifting away as though in a strong wind.  A CHALKY WHITE 
           OBJECT slowly becomes visible underneath, still not quite 
           discernible.  

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        I’d known it was coming a year ago.  
                        When they found the first body.  

           More dirt separates and now it’s apparent: A DECAYING SKULL 
           caked in mud, eye sockets hollow, mouth agape.  Wisps of 
           strawlike hair still there on the scalp.  A FLASH OF LIGHT.
           WIDE-- a team of COPS cases a marshy field.  A PHOTOGRAPHER 
           leans over the pit taking photos.  A yellow backhoe nearby.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        I saw it in the papers over 
                        breakfast...

           INT.  ALASKAN DINER - MORNING (2007)

           In a booth, Jack scans the paper while Molly talks happily 
           (unheard).  He focuses on a headline on the inside page:

                        “POLICE DIG FOR GANGLAND SLAYING VICTIMS:
                          PROBE TIED TO SEATTLE BOSS JAMES SHAY”

           Jack puzzles over the article as a waitress arrives.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Twenty years they’d been trying.  
                        Cops, FBI.  Twenty years with 
                        nothing.  And now there was a body 
                        a week.

           INT.  BOOKING ROOM - DAY (2007)

           FLUORESCENT LIGHTS beat down as Jimmy (here 66) poses for 
           mugshots.  QUICK CUTS: dead-on and profile.  

           INT.  STRIP JOINT - NIGHT (1970)

           BACK TO THE 70s-- all orange & pastel.  Jimmy (here 29) 
           watches while a STRIPPER in pasties takes the stage.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Things had started for Jimmy in the 
                        skin business.  At first, he ran 
                        the girls himself.  Small time 
                        shit.

           EXT.  SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - AFTERNOON (1971)

           A showy El Dorado parked on a street corner.  Jimmy and the 
           stripper inside.  He points at a house across the way...

           INT.  JOHN’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON (1971)

           The stripper in front of her JOHN in his brown-and-gold 
           bedroom.  He hands her a wad of cash.  Kisses her neck.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        From there it was onto bookmaking.  
                        Loansharking.  Narcotics...

           HOSTILE TAKEOVER MONTAGE (1972-1974)

           QUICK CUTS as Jimmy and TWO THUGS bust in on:

           - A WOODPANNELED OFFICE: A nervous BOOKIE looks on.
           - A SEEDY BASEMENT: A LOANSHARK counting bills.
           - A WAREHOUSE: An Asian DRUG LORD overseeing his operation.
           EXT.  SEATTLE DOCKS - NIGHT (1974)

           A rundown pier.  FISHING BOATS line the wharf as a TEAM OF 
           MEN load unmarked cargo vans with cardboard boxes.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        As a teenager, Jimmy had worked 
                        hard labor.  A longshoreman on the 
                        docks.  After the consolidation, he 
                        made the waterfront his base of 
                        operations.

           INT.  FISHING BOAT HOLD - NIGHT (1974)

           HUNDREDS OF POUNDS OF FISH ON ICE in a ship’s hold hoisted up 
           to reveal bricks of cocaine underneath.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Before Jimmy, there’d been no 
                        organization.  He brought it all 
                        together.  One roof, he liked to 
                        say.  Truth was, it was the only 
                        roof.

           KILLING MONTAGE (1974)

           - THE BOOKIE shot in the head.
           - THE LOANSHARK’s neck slit.
           - THE DRUG LORD held underwater, drowning.

           INT.  MILTON’S CAR (MOVING) - DAY (1986)

           Milton drives the Romeo with Jack in the passenger seat.  

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        It was Dad’s job to make sure 
                        nothing stuck.  And nothing did.

           INT.  ALASKAN DINER - MORNING (2007)

           Molly and Jack eat their breakfast, Jack still staring at the 
           newspaper.  Molly places her hand on top of Jack’s, drawing 
           him out of his daze.  He looks up, feigning a smile.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        But now it was different.  Someone 
                        was talking.

           NEWSPAPER ARTICLE

           TIGHT FLASHES of TEXT-- “Missing persons... two decades... 
           excavation revealed... stemming from an anonymous tip...”

           INT.  PRECINCT - NIGHT (2007)

           A sleepy Seattle police station.  A SERGEANT plays solitaire.  
           The DESK PHONE RINGS...
                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        They said the calls always came in 
                        at night.  Each time to a different 
                        precinct, direct.  No time for a 
                        trace.  No recordings.

           DARK, DANK, MUSTY.  A BARE OVERHEAD BULB hangs from the 
           ceiling as a crew EXCAVATES A DIRT BASEMENT FLOOR, A SKELETAL 
           HAND reaching up frozen from the depths.

                                 ANONYMOUS (V.O.)
                        The industrial park north of 
                        Garfield by the piers...

           EXT.  INDUSTRIAL PARK - AFTERNOON (2007)

           ANOTHER SKELETON loaded into a body bag ZIPPED SHUT.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        So they had the bodies.  Not enough 
                        to press charges, mind you.  
                        Because who’s going to come into 
                        court and say Jimmy Shay had done 
                        this.  Jimmy Shay had killed these 
                        men.

           INT.  GAMBLING PARLOR - NIGHT (2007)

           A BACKROOM OPERATION.  SHADY CHARACTERS smoking, drinking 
           whiskey.  Card tables.  Craps.  And ROULETTE-- the white ball 
           bouncing through the wheel as it spins, slowing down, slowing 
           down, coming to a stop.  BLACK 22.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        But then something else happened.  
                        The town got scared.

           Suddenly, a TEAM OF COPS BUSTS INTO THE JOINT, GUNS DRAWN.  
                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        No one was going to cop to murder.  
                        Sure.  But someone was talking and 
                        everyone else was on edge.  Waiting 
                        for the crackdown.  

           ARRESTS MONTAGE (2007)

           - THE ROULETTE CROUPIER anxiously talking to police.
           - A PARKED CAR, a hooker services her John as cops swarm in.
           - THE PROSTITUE in the interrogation room.
           - A DRUG WAREHOUSE raided by a SWAT team.
           - THE NARCOTICS BOSS being questioned.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        So I guess you’d say the bodies had 
                        served their purpose.  The caller 
                        had done his civic goddamned duty.

           INT.  BOOKING ROOM - DAY (2007)

           REPLAY Jimmy’s mugshots from above, QUICK CUTS, now including 
           his FINGERPRINTS BEING INKED.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Racketeering.  Loansharking.  
                        Prostitution.  Intent to 
                        distribute.  Sure, they didn’t have 
                        the murders, but maybe this was 
                        better.  The indictment was ninety-
                        seven counts long.  And I knew 
                        then.  I knew it was ending.  
                        Because how much can one man take?

           EXT.  COURTHOUSE STEPS - DAY (2008)

           Milton (here 53) and Jimmy push their way through a throng of 
           reporters, trying to make their way into an imposing 
           courthouse.  FLASHBULBS BURSTING.  

           INT.  COURTROOM - DAY (2008)

           PUSHING IN FAST to Jimmy and Milton at the defense table as 
           Milton rises and says--

                                 MILTON
                        Not guilty, your honor.

           Now CLOSE ON A JUDGE (60s, white-haired patriarch).

                                 JUDGE
                        Bail is set at one million dollars.

           Jimmy SMIRKS.  Hold on Milton’s conflicted, pained face.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        I read it in the paper.  And I knew 
                        one way or another.
           INT.  BEACH HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT (2008)

           TIGHT ON A CRYSTAL TUMBLER as it CRASHES TO THE FLOOR, ice 
           cubes and bourbon spilling out in a glorious SLOW-MO FLOOD.

           Milton lies collapsed on the floor, panting for breath, right 
           arm grasping his left, eyes wide as THE LIFE LEAVES HIM.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        I knew it was over.

                                                       BACK TO PRESENT:

           EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - DAY (2008)

           The blue pickup idling motionless.

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        Jack.  Please say something.

           MOLLY’S TRUCK (PARKED) - THAT MOMENT

           Jack silent.  Molly concerned.  Then, eerily calm:  

                                 JACK
                        When we get home I need you to pack 
                        a bag.  Anything you don’t want to 
                        leave behind, you pack it and we’ll 
                        head east, maybe Canada for a 
                        while...

                                 MOLLY
                        Anything I don’t want to leave--?

                                 JACK
                        If he’s called, he knows where we 
                        are.  So we need to go.  Tonight.

                                 MOLLY
                        Your father died.  And you--

                                 JACK
                        I haven’t talked to him since I was 
                        seventeen.  You understand?  This 
                        man that called--  These aren’t 
                        good people.  And if they’ve found 
                        me...  They’ve found you, Mol.  
                        Looking to collect on an old debt I 
                        can’t repay.  So we go, together, 
                        maybe just a few months--

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m telling you you just lost your 
                        father and you’ve got us vanishing 
                        in the night?  No.  I’m not 
                        leaving, Jack.  Not like that. 

           Jack’s quiet.  Molly looks off out the window.
                                 MOLLY
                        You remember where you were a year 
                        ago?  I’d heard there’s a new 
                        greenhorn working the Strait, best 
                        fisherman anyone’d seen in ages.  
                        Not scared of anything, they said.  
                        Except he didn’t talk much.  No one 
                        even knew where he lived.  But one 
                        night he shows up in the Black 
                        Horse and the room dies like they 
                        can’t believe this guy is out in 
                        public.  Turns out he’s picking up 
                        food to go.  Takeout from a rundown 
                        bar.  So I’m not one for bullshit.  
                        I say hello and he’s shy, 
                        surprised, like he’s being put on.  
                        And I tell him, we got empty tables 
                        here, why don’t you eat your meal 
                        while it’s still hot?  We sit down 
                        and whaddya know, he’s this total 
                        gentleman, funny and charming and 
                        warm.  So I’m thinking everyone’s 
                        wrong, some recluse story got spun 
                        and grew on its own.  But then I 
                        ask him where he’s from and that’s 
                        the first time I see it.  He goes 
                        cold, doesn’t wanna answer.  And I 
                        decided, OK.  That’s the trade-off.  
                        You can’t win ‘em all.
                             (beat)
                        No questions asked.  That was our 
                        deal.  And I said yes, because--  
                        Maybe I like to mend things.  Or 
                        maybe it just seemed dangerous when 
                        nothing else did.  So no questions.  
                        You can’t change the rules in the 
                        middle of the game.  But I’m not 
                        leaving.  Not without being told 
                        why. 

                                 JACK
                        This isn’t some stoic bullshit.  
                        The things you don’t know--  I want 
                        to tell you.  I think about it 
                        every day, I rehearse it, how I’m 
                        gonna say it so you’ll know.  Just 
                        you.  And for what?  So I’ll feel 
                        better?  And you’ll feel worse.  
                             (beat)
                        This is the first time I’ve kept at 
                        a job more than a year.  First time 
                        I’ve stayed.  Because I need to 
                        know you’re safe, Mol.  That I’ve 
                        kept you safe.

                                 MOLLY
                        Then make things safe for us here.  
                        In our home.  
                             (beat)
                        What’s gonna happen?  If you go 
                        down there.
                                 JACK
                        I don’t know.  These people aren’t 
                        the kind that forget things.

                                 MOLLY
                        Then I’ll come with you.  To 
                        Seattle.  We’ll go down and we’ll 
                        talk to this Todd Shay or--

                                 JACK
                        I don’t want you near them.  They 
                        touch you, they don’t let go. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Jack.  Whatever this is--  If the 
                        only thing that’s gonna make you 
                        safe is to run, to disappear, then 
                        that’s what you have to do.  And I 
                        won’t like it, but--  I told you.  
                        I went off as a kid, I saw the 
                        world and I came right back here.  
                        And it’s where I want us to be.  If 
                        that sea hasn’t gotten you yet-- 

                                 JACK
                        Let’s go home, Mol.

           Molly puts the truck in gear.  It kicks up a small cloud of 
           dust in its wake, the lone vehicle travelling the worn road 
           to the horizon.

           The OPENING STRAINS of the Allman Bros. “ONE WAY OUT” play...

           INT.  THE POST - AFTERNOON

           A hole-in-the-wall bar in Seattle.  Allmans on the JUKE.  An 
           assorted crowd of mean-looking MOTHERFUCKERS.  The kind of 
           place you don’t go into uninvited.  

           Behind the bar, a middle-aged BARTENDER washes glasses.  An 
           old-school wall-mounted ROTARY PHONE begins to RING.  For the 
           longest time the bartender ignores it, the BELL rattling away 
           until a BIKER at the pool table SCREAMS--

                                 BIKER
                        Christ’s Cunt, Lester!  You gonna 
                        answer that or am I gonna listen to 
                        it all goddamned afternoon?

                                 BARTENDER
                        I was just getting to it, princess.  
                        Now you’ve interrupted my 
                        concentration.

                                 BIKER
                        Eat shit and die, will you?

                                 BARTENDER
                        I would, but then who’d fuck your 
                        mother?
                                 BIKER
                        She’s dead, you stupid prick.

           The bartender finally turns and picks up the phone.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Post, this is Ed.
                             (beat)
                        Yeah, hold on a second.

           Setting the phone down, he BANGS ON THE WALL behind the bar 
           and then returns to washing glasses.  An instant passes 
           before TODD SHAY (now 34, trimmer and a decidedly cocksure 
           S.O.B.) appears from the back wearing a track suit. 

           The bartender points to the phone.  Todd answers.

                                 TODD
                        Hello?

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Todd.

                                 TODD
                        Who’s this?

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT.  JACK & MOLLY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           A little one-bedroom on the outskirts of town.  Sparse.  Jack 
           stuffs clothes into a duffel bag on the bed.  He waits, 
           considers his answer to the question--

                                 JACK
                        The recently bereaved.

                                 TODD (V.O.)
                        Jackie?  You got my message.  Who’s 
                        the broad answering your phone?  
                        She sounded like a hot piece of 
                        ass.  I can tell, you know, just 
                        from the voice, the in-fleck-shuns.  
                        By the by, how’d you know I’d be 
                        here?

                                 JACK
                        It was my second guess after the 
                        state pen.  

                                 TODD (V.O.)
                        Still a smartass, huh?

                                 JACK
                        You know, I actually wanted to ask 
                        you the same question--

                                 TODD (V.O.)
                        If I’m a smartass?
                                 JACK
                        How you found me, Todd.

                                 TODD (V.O.)
                        Some secrets I gotta keep to 
                        myself, you know?

           Jack shifts.

                                 JACK
                        He’s dead.

                                 TODD (V.O.)
                        Yeah.

                                 JACK
                        I want to hear it from you.

                                 TODD (V.O.)
                        You just did. 

                                 JACK
                        Straight from you, Todd.

                                 TODD (V.O.)
                        Hey, man, what is this?

                                 JACK
                        Don’t screw with me--

                                 TODD (V.O.)
                        Jesus Christ, Jackie Boy.  What do 
                        you think this is?  You think--  
                        Now, look.  We’ve had our 
                        differences but you listen to me, 
                        this thing happened, right?  This 
                        thing happened not three days ago.  
                        The man was alone in his kitchen 
                        and no one was there with him and  
                        his heart stopped and he dropped 
                        dead, all alone in that big house.  
                        Found him the next morning when he 
                        didn’t show for court, right?  You 
                        can read it in the papers if you 
                        don’t believe me.  The obits and 
                        the news.  Cause the big trial’s a 
                        fucking mess now.  You know about 
                        the trial, don’t you?  --Of course 
                        you do.  So.  Sure, things aren’t 
                        maybe going as well as we’d like 
                        down here, alright, but the old man 
                        drops dead and I figure you oughta 
                        know.  No matter what’s happened in 
                        the past, you oughta know because 
                        you’re his son and I’d want you to 
                        do the same for me.  You’d do the 
                        same for me, wouldn’t you, Jack?

                                 JACK
                        Yeah.  Sure, Todd.
                                 TODD (V.O.)
                        The funeral’s tomorrow if you’re 
                        coming.  We took care of the 
                        arrangements.

                                 JACK
                        And if I do come--

                                 TODD (V.O.)
                        Is that what this is?  You think 
                        something’s gonna happen to you?  
                        Jesus, Jack.  How many years?  
                        Thirteen?

                                 JACK
                        Fourteen.

                                 TODD (V.O.)
                        Fourteen years and your father’s 
                        passed and you think we’re gonna 
                        throw you in the sound?  It’s a 
                        funeral for god’s sake.  You come, 
                        you pay your respects.  You need 
                        money for a ticket?  I’ll buy you a 
                        fucking ticket.

                                 JACK
                        I don’t need money for a ticket.

                                 TODD (V.O.)
                        Fine.  Saint James.  Three o’clock 
                        tomorrow. 

           Jack looks up to see Molly standing in the doorway.

                                 JACK
                        I come there, I want to talk to 
                        you.  To Jimmy.  Settle things.

                                 TODD (V.O.)
                        Things are settled, Jack.  But if 
                        it’s gonna make you feel better, 
                        we’ll have a regular old sitdown, 
                        just the three of us.  How’s that? 

                                 JACK
                        Alright.  I’ll see you tomorrow.  

           INT.  THE POST - THAT MOMENT

           Todd on the phone, eating olives straight from a jar.

                                 TODD
                        Good.  He was your goddamn father.

           And the line CLICKS OFF.  Todd scoops another handful of 
           olives from the jar, tossing them into his mouth.
           INT.  JACK & MOLLY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Jack on the edge of the bed.  Molly crosses into the room.  
           She walks to the dresser, picks up an antique music box, 
           winding it.  It begins to play GOLDBERG VARIATION No. 25, 
           melancholy chimes, a minor key.

                                 JACK
                        I gotta--  You’re right.  I’ll work 
                        this out.  One way or another.  And 
                        then I’ll be home and it’ll be like 
                        it was.  

                                 MOLLY
                        You leave to do this, I need to 
                        know you’re coming back to me.

                                 JACK
                        I’m coming back to you.

                                 MOLLY
                        I meant it when I said I’d go with 
                        you.

                                 JACK
                        I know you did.

           EXT.  JACK & MOLLY'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

           The sun sinking low behind the horizon of the white stucco 
           building, the light burning yellow in Jack’s bedroom.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        I found out when I was seventeen.  
                        I found out because Todd told me...

           A GULL perched on Jack’s roof alights into the reddening 
           afternoon sky as--

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           EXT.  DOVER PREP - MORNING (1994)

           A CRISP BACKLIT AMERICAN FLAG flapping in the breeze.

           REVEAL-- The flag sits atop a pole in front of a brick-and-
           ivy private school.  RICH KIDS in uniforms strolling casually 
           across the front lawn, perfect Aryan faces.  A BELL RINGS.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Dover was the sort of place that 
                        claimed it was all about rigorous 
                        academics when it was really all 
                        about rigorous breeding.  Everyone 
                        there knew what Todd’s father did.  
                        It gave him a sort of dangerous 
                        credibility.
           INT.  DOVER PREP - HALLWAY - DAY (1994)

           TEENAGE TODD (19) parades down a sunstreaked hall with a 
           small cadre of LAUGHING GIRLS and other hangers-on.  He’s the 
           only one whose uniform isn’t quite perfect-- the shirt’s 
           untucked, there’s a RAMONES PATCH on his sleeve.  He wears 
           SUNGLASSES INDOORS.

           WHIPPING TO THE RIGHT-- TEENAGE JACK (17) pushes books into 
           his locker, eyeing Todd with disdain.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        As for myself, I just wanted to get 
                        out.  Out of Dover, out of Seattle.  
                        Out of the goddamn racket.

           Jack’s locker SLAMS SHUT as Todd passes on by.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Of course, all the money Jimmy had 
                        wasn’t enough to keep Todd from 
                        becoming a second-year senior. 

           TODD’S REPORT CARD

           SCANNING QUICKLY through text, a rapid-fire series of course 
           names (”Geometry II, Intro to Psych, Biology, U.S. History”) 
           and their respective grades (”F, C-, D, F, F”).

           INT.  JIMMY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT (1993)

           Jimmy (here 52) stares at the above REPORT CARD while Todd 
           lurks nearby, head-down.  The cocksure bullshit gone.  He’s 
           messed up, he knows it and he’s WORRIED.

           Jimmy looks up from the report card.  His eyes meet his 
           son’s.  A beat and then JIMMY EXPLODES, pushing the contents 
           of an entire countertop to the floor: plates, silverware, 
           glasses, a potted vase of flowers.

           HOLD ON Todd’s blank face as Jimmy rages off-camera, seen 
           only as a reflection in Todd’s sunglasses.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        I guess that’s when Jimmy asked 
                        him...

           TIGHT ON TODD (1993)

           finishing Jack’s thought, staring direct-to-camera.

                                 TEENAGE TODD
                        “Why can’t you be more like Jack?” 
                        That’s what he says to me.  Fucking 
                        cocksucking motherfucker.
                             (beat)
                        What the fuck’s so great about you 
                        anyway?
           INT.  DOVER PREP - GYMNASIUM - DAY (1994)

           A stream of manicured girls SHOOTS BASKETS in P.E.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Of course, Todd finally found a way 
                        to come up with his own answer to 
                        that question.  To make the old man 
                        shut up.  Because what if I wasn’t 
                        the dutiful son after all?  What 
                        then?

           A BASKETBALL sinks perfectly through the net.

           INT.  DOVER PREP - BOYS’ LOCKER ROOM - DAY (1994)

           Rows of lockers as a crowd of boys change for class.  Jack 
           pulls off his shirt.  Todd appears from around the corner.

                                 TEENAGE TODD
                        Hey.  Jackie Boy.  Check this shit 
                        out.  Pretty killer, right?

           Jack looks up as Todd pulls up his own shirt, revealing a 
           HUGE GASH across his abdomen, dozens of black sutures.

                                 TEENAGE JACK
                        How’d you manage that?

                                 TEENAGE TODD
                        “How’d I manage that?”  Ain’t no 
                        managing, Jackie Boy.  I earned it.  
                        Running a little errand for the old 
                        man, right?  Showing me the ropes.  
                        Going to collect up from some 
                        fucking junkie, he don’t wanna pay, 
                        things got ugly and he tries to 
                        shiv me.  

                                 TEENAGE JACK
                        Looks like he succeeded.

                                 TEENAGE TODD
                        I know, right?  But I made him pay 
                        up.  He ain’t gonna try this shit 
                        again ‘cause he’s not around no 
                        more, you get what I’m saying?

           And Todd does a ridiculous KARATE MOVE.

                                 TEENAGE JACK
                        That’s great, Todd.  I’m real happy 
                        for you.

           Jack’s shirt is on.  He shuts his locker.  Turns to go.

                                 TEENAGE TODD
                        So I guess you’re not the only one 
                        that took one for the team, huh?
           Jack’s eyes narrow.  He turns around.

                                 TEENAGE TODD
                        I’m just saying.  You’re not the 
                        only one that put his life on the 
                        line for old Jimmy Shay and lived 
                        to tell the tale. 

                                 TEENAGE JACK
                        What the hell are you talking 
                        about?

                                 TEENAGE TODD
                        “What the hell am I talking about?”  
                        Oh.  Oh.  You’re serious.  You’re 
                        fucking serious.  You don’t know.

                                 TEENAGE JACK
                        Know what?

                                 TEENAGE TODD
                             (laughing)
                        No.  I thought you knew.  Forget 
                        about it.

           Jack begins to TURN.  A contained RAGE.

                                 TEENAGE JACK
                        Knew what?

           Todd stops laughing.  Looks deadly serious.

                                 TEENAGE TODD
                        The accident, Jackie Boy.

           And now Jack KNOWS even if he doesn’t want to.

                                 TEENAGE JACK
                        The accident--

                                 TEENAGE TODD
                        The car accident, dummy.  No, no, I 
                        gotta--  Forget about it, OK?

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT.  JACKIE’S CAR (MOVING) - AFTERNOON (1985)

           A NEAR-SUBLIMINAL FLASH-CUT.  INSIDE THE CAR-- tumbling 
           toward that REDWOOD.  Just before IMPACT.

                                                               BACK TO:

           THE LOCKER ROOM (1994)

           JACK SNAPS.  GRABS TODD-- SLAMS HIM INTO A LOCKER.

                                 TEENAGE TODD
                        Woah, woah!  HEY, MAN.
                                 TEENAGE JACK
                        The car accident. 

           Jack TWISTS TODD’S ARM BACK.  HARD.

                                 TEENAGE TODD
                        Christ, Jackie.  Ease up.

           A beat.  Jack puts MORE PRESSURE on the arm.  A crowd of 
           other Dover boys gathers in the distance.

                                 TEENAGE JACK
                        What about the car accident, Todd?

                                 TEENAGE TODD
                        Listen, man, if you don’t know...

           A whole new level of RAGE.  Jack opens a LOCKER DOOR, PUSHES 
           TODD’S HAND INSIDE and SLAMS THE LOCKER SHUT.  A BONE SNAPS.  
           TODD SCREAMS, FALLS TO THE FLOOR AND JACK’S ON TOP OF HIM--

                                 TEENAGE JACK
                        KNOW WHAT?!

           Todd WAILS over his hand as Jack PUNCHES HIM SQUARE IN THE 
           FACE, BREAKING HIS NOSE.

                                 TEENAGE TODD
                        OH CHRIST.

           As the BLOOD BUBBLES OUT:

                                 TEENAGE TODD
                        Jesus--  It was the brakes.  The 
                        brakes were cut.  Some fucking 
                        Vietnamese heavies that Dad used 
                        your old man to muscle out of the 
                        city, right?  Took away their 
                        action.  So they wanted to send a 
                        message only they got the wrong 
                        car.  They did hers instead of his.  
                        It was supposed to be your dad’s.  
                        That stupid fucking Romeo.  It was 
                        an accident, Jack, that’s all.  A 
                        fucking slip-up, man.  FUCK.

           Todd spits blood from his mouth, wipes it away.  Jack tries 
           to breathe, covered himself in blood, sweat.  

                                 TEENAGE JACK
                        “A fucking accident.”

                                 TEENAGE TODD
                        Yeah, man.

           And Jack GRABS TODD’S HEAD by the EARS and SLAMS IT INTO THE 
           CONCRETE ONE LAST TIME.  A SICK CRUNCH.
           INT.  BEACH HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT (1994)

           TIGHT ON MILTON-- eating dinner in silence.  The clink of 
           silverware against plates.

           REVEAL JACK-- the other end of the table, staring silent, 
           accusatory, still wearing his BLOOD-STAINED DOVER GYM SHIRT.

           They hold.  They hold.  They hold.  Taciturn.

           INT.  BEACH HOUSE - JACK’S ROOM - NIGHT (1994)

           Jack lies awake in bed, staring at the ceiling.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        It was a Monday.  First Monday of 
                        the month.  If it hadn’t been--  
                        Funny how things can turn on a 
                        little detail like that.  Maybe I’d 
                        have calmed down.  Maybe I’d have 
                        stayed.  
                             (beat)
                        Dad had a schedule.  Set.  Certain 
                        things happened on certain days.  
                        And the first Tuesday of every 
                        month, Dad put the fix in with the 
                        local cops for Jimmy--  Keeping 
                        them on the payroll too.  Cash 
                        money, every week, crisp white 
                        envelopes.  To look the other way.    
                        To shut up.  To take it.  Like we 
                        all took it.

           INT.  COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - MORNING (1994)

           BRILLIANT GLOWING MARBLE.  A WHITE ENVELOPE PASSING from one 
           hand to another, SURREPTITIOUS.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Tuesday, he put in the fix.  So 
                        Monday, Jimmy drew the money and 
                        gave it to Dad for the night.  

           INT.  BEACH HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT (1994)

           Milton’s home office.  Darkness.  Still.  And then Jack 
           appears in the doorway, hesitating.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Monday night there was fifty 
                        thousand dollars in my house.  
                        Fifty grand, sitting in a cheap 
                        satchel.  A goddamned bookbag.

           A WALL SAFE--  The dial turns.  The safe door opens. 

           THE SATCHEL--  Unzipped.  Loaded with currency, ominous.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        So it was a Monday.  And I took it.
           EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - NIGHT (1994)

           Jack stares at the forboding structure.  His own home.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        I took what was mine.  And nothing 
                        else.

           EXT.  ISLAND ROAD - NIGHT (1994)

           A tree-lined road.  Jack ambles down the moonlit path.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        That’s what I told myself anyhow.

           INT.  KING STREET STATION - NIGHT (1994)

           A TICKER BOARD SHUFFLES, updating a list of DEPARTURES.

           A stack of bills pushed under the window at a ticket booth.  
           The TICKET TAKER, an old man, stares back sadly at Jack.  

           INT.  TRAIN (MOVING) - DAWN (1994)

           Faint hints of pink in the sky outside the train.  Jack rests 
           his head against the window, clutching the black bag with the 
           take to his chest.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        What was mine.  And nothing else.

           INT.  AIRPLANE (FLYING) - DAWN (2008)

           PRESENT DAY.  Exactly as above, Jack alone in a seat, now on 
           an aircraft and fourteen years older.  He stares out the 
           window bleary-eyed.  

           The HUM of the PLANE’S DRONE broken by a TOLLING BELL...

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        The prodigal son.

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           INT.  SAINT JAMES CATHEDRAL - AFTERNOON (1984)

           JESUS ON THE CROSS in wooden relief, BLOOD-RED OIL PAINT 
           glistening, seemingly wet, garish.  The CROWN OF THORNS, THE 
           RUDDY NAILS.  His eyes, tortured, rolling up to Heaven.  

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        That old Sunday School story.  

           Young Jack’s First Communion.  He stands shakily holding a 
           CANDLE, the flame flickering, surrounded by a group of a 
           dozen other SEVEN- and EIGHT-YEAR-OLDS, girls in white 
           dresses, boys in suits.  PUSHING IN SLOWLY TO YOUNG JACK--
                                 YOUNG JACK
                        “What man of you, having a hundred 
                        sheep, if he lose one of them, doth 
                        not leave the ninety and nine in 
                        the wilderness and go after that 
                        which is lost until he find it?”

                                                            FORWARD TO:

           EXT.  CEMETERY - AFTERNOON (2008)

           A GLOOMY CEMETERY.  Gray clouds overhead.  A CHAPEL in the 
           distance-- the source of the TOLLING BELL.  A small crowd of 
           MOURNERS surround an open grave.  Young Jack continues the 
           Parable of the Lost Sheep:

                                 YOUNG JACK (V.O.)
                        “And when he hath found the sheep, 
                        he layeth it on his shoulders, 
                        rejoicing.”

           A group of six PALLBEARERS brings Milton’s casket toward the 
           grave, led by JIMMY and TODD.

                                 YOUNG JACK (V.O.)
                        “And when he cometh home, he 
                        calleth together his friends and 
                        neighbors, saying unto them, 
                        Rejoice with me...”

           Jack watches the procession, conspicuously separated from the 
           rest of the small crowd.   

                                 YOUNG JACK (V.O.)
                        “...for I have found my sheep which 
                        was lost.”

           The casket reaches the grave.  Jimmy and Todd produce THE 
           PALL.  Jimmy stops, STARING HARD at JACK.  Jack stares back, 
           cold, uncertain.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        So, Jimmy.  Are we going to kill 
                        the fatted calf?

           The PRIEST (50s) stands before the gathering.  A beat.

                                 PRIEST
                        Milton Edward Grant.  Called to God 
                        aged fifty-three.  Let us pray.

           And the crowd of mourners bow their heads.  Save Jack.

           INT.  SAINT JAMES CATHEDRAL - DAY (1984)

           First Communion, continued.  CLOSE ON AN ELDERLY PRIEST (late 
           70s), staring down, direct-to-camera, Young Jack’s POV:

                                 ELDERLY PRIEST
                        The body of Christ.
           The WAFER placed on Jack’s tongue.  And then, otherworldly, 
           HIS CANDLE BLOWS OUT.  An eerie DARKNESS.

           EXT.  CEMETERY - AFTERNOON (2008)

           A black CROWN VIC parked a hundred feet away from the grave 
           as the funeral service ends.  TWO PLAIN-CLOTHES COPS (40s, 
           buzz-cuts, big sunglasses) in the car eyeing Jimmy and Todd. 

           Jimmy talks with an ELDERLY MOURNER, gesturing at the cops.

                                 JIMMY
                        Can you believe this bullshit?  I’m 
                        burying a friend of mine.  A close 
                        personal fucking friend and these 
                        two boy scouts sitting over there 
                        like I’m gonna hop a goddamned 
                        plane to Argentina.

                                 ELDERLY MOURNER
                        It was a lovely service, Jimmy.

                                 JIMMY
                        Thanks, Frank.
                             (beat, looking back to the 
                              Crown Vic)
                        Those motherfucking cunts.  

                                 ELDERLY MOURNER
                        What’s that?

                                 JIMMY
                        Nothing.  Not you.  Thanks for 
                        coming.

           Nearby, Jack half-watches while standing at Jackie’s grave--

                  JACQUELINE MAY GRANT - BELOVED WIFE & MOTHER - 1956-1985

           Jimmy approaches him.  Stops about ten feet off.

                                 JIMMY
                        I hear you’re a fisherman now--  At 
                        least I taught you how to do 
                        something right.  
                             (gestures to the grave)
                        It’s not done, but I ordered his to 
                        match.  “Husband and father,” I 
                        told them.  And the dates.

                                 JACK
                        I’m sure he’d’ve loved it.

                                 JIMMY
                        I kinda figured all this time, how 
                        many years, the kid wouldn’t show.  
                        But here he is.  A man, some big 
                        man or whatever the fuck.  Look. I 
                        can’t speak to your reasons.  Who 
                        the hell can?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)
                        Whatever’s happened, it’s a long 
                        time gone and the past is a book 
                        they sent to print.  What do they 
                        say?  It’s what we do with the time 
                        we got left or some such bullshit.  
                        So you’re late, so what?  It was 
                        the right thing to do.  So.  Look, 
                        we’re having a thing at the house, 
                        a wake or whatever the fuck they 
                        call it-- fucking drinks and finger 
                        sandwiches.  We’re just having some 
                        people over that knew your dad and 
                        I’d like it if you’d come back this 
                        afternoon.  So that’s it.  I’ve 
                        said my peace.

                                 JACK
                        You wanna know why I came?  After 
                        all this time?  To bury him?  I 
                        wake up every morning and the first 
                        thing I think is, “Is this the day 
                        it catches up with me?”  And I 
                        won’t do it anymore.  I get a phone 
                        call from Todd saying he’s dead and 
                        I don’t give a shit about him or 
                        you or the goddamned trial but I am 
                        not gonna sit up there and wait for 
                        you to come find me knowing that 
                        you know whatever it is you know.  
                        I’m not gonna pack it up again.  I 
                        need this to be over.  So whatever 
                        we have to do.  One way or another.

                                 JIMMY
                        It’s been over since the morning 
                        you left.

                                 JACK
                        Bullshit.

           He waits.  Jimmy doesn’t reply.

                                 JACK
                        Indiana.  
                             (beat)
                        Did he know about Indiana?

                                 JIMMY
                        Did he know--?

                                 JACK
                        Don’t play stupid with me, Jimmy.  
                        The doddering old shit that wants 
                        me to come by for a drink--  I’m 
                        not buying what you’re selling and 
                        I’m standing here and I’m asking 
                        you did he know about Indiana?

                                 JIMMY
                        No.
                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Indiana.  I was five years gone.

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           EXT.  WHEAT FIELD - SUNSET (1999)

           THE FLATTEST SWATH OF LAND you’ve ever seen, a strong WIND 
           rolling through a section of wheat running clear to the 
           horizon as the sun sets crimson in the distance.  

           The serenity broken by a RUMBLING ENGINE-- a COMBINE cutting 
           into frame, pushing through the field.  Suddenly, a flock of 
           HUNDREDS OF SPARROWS takes off, previously hidden by the 
           crop, now a seething blast of movement heading skyward.  And 
           the combine pushes on.  Driven by JACK (here 22).

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        At first I’d gone east.  A laborer.  
                        Working mining, logging, farms.  
                        Seasonal jobs where no one asked 
                        about your resumé.  I wanted to be 
                        tired, exhausted.  Because then I 
                        didn’t have to think.  I’d just 
                        work till there was no more work 
                        and then I’d move on.  And I was 
                        starting to wonder if maybe this 
                        was it.  This was OK.  

           EXT.  RUNDOWN MOTEL - EVENING (1999)

           A one-story motor court that hasn’t seen much business since 
           the interstate moved away.  And the neon sign flashes “WEEKLY 
           RATES.”  A beaten 80s Oldsmobile pulls into the lot.  Jack 
           gets out, crosses to his door.  Inserts a key in the lock.

           INT.  RUNDOWN MOTEL - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER (1999)

           Jack showers enveloped in steam.  From outside, he hears a 
           NOISE-- a THUD, indistinct but there and then it’s gone.  He 
           shuts off the shower, standing naked, the water dripping.  
           Holding.  Holding.  Grabs a towel, walking out into his

           MOTEL ROOM (1999)

           There, seated in the room’s one careworn chair is THE GUNMAN 
           (40s, ex-military type), a pistol trained on Jack who stands 
           frozen, wrapped in his towel.  

                                 THE GUNMAN
                        Get dressed.  Unless the money’s 
                        here and then you can just give it 
                        to me.  But you’re too smart for 
                        that, aren’t you?

                                 JACK
                        The money’s not here.

                                 THE GUNMAN
                        So get dressed.  
           Jack moves slowly to his dresser, pulling out a t-shirt, 
           boxers.  He PAUSES.  There, sitting in the dresser bottom--

           A BOWIE KNIFE.  EIGHT-INCH BLADE IN A SHEATH.  

           Jack holds.  Scoops up the bowie knife inside the boxer 
           shorts, turns for the bathroom--

                                 THE GUNMAN
                        Hey.  Where are you going?  Get 
                        dressed here.  

           A heated beat.  What can he do?  Jack lets the towel fall, 
           standing naked, shaking.  He drops the t-shirt to the floor, 
           eyeing the gunman and shifting the knife to the rear of his 
           boxers, trying to figure out some maneuver that’ll work...

                                 THE GUNMAN
                        Do I look like a queer?  A fucking 
                        fag?  You think I enjoy staring at 
                        you?  GET.  FUCKING.  DRESSED.  

           Quickly, Jack hooks the BELT CLIP of the SHEATH over the edge 
           of the boxer’s elastic, pulling the underwear up, the knife 
           inside pressed against his ass, clipped on precariously.

           He reaches for his t-shirt.  Pulls it on.  And grabs a pair 
           of jeans that had been slung on the bed.  

                                 THE GUNMAN
                        Alright.  You’re driving.

           INT.  BEATER OLDSMOBILE (PARKED/MOVING) - NIGHT (1999)

           Jack’s in the driver’s seat.  The gunman sits directly behind 
           him.  They both go for their seatbelts.  

                                 THE GUNMAN
                        No.  You don’t wear a seatbelt.  I 
                        wear a seatbelt and you wear 
                        jackshit.

           Jack lets go of his seatbelt.  The gunman pushes the pistol 
           into the back of Jack’s seat.

                                 THE GUNMAN 
                        OK.  Where is it?

                                 JACK
                        The bus terminal in Ossian.

           EXT.  BUS TERMINAL - LATER THAT NIGHT (1999)

           A little depot.  Wrecked cars parked behind it.  Old, busted-
           up soda machines out front.  A man in a Stetson sits waiting 
           on a bench as the Oldsmobile pulls in.  Jack and the gunman 
           get out of the car, walking toward the entrance, the gunman’s 
           pistol in his jacket pocket now--
                                 THE GUNMAN
                        You just go real slow and 
                        everything’s gonna be fine.  I’m 
                        right behind you.

                                 JACK
                        That’s reassuring.

           INT.  BUS TERMINAL - CONTINUOUS (1999)

           Jack and the gunman enter the terminal.  An OVERWEIGHT WOMAN 
           with a bouffant reads PEOPLE behind the counter.  A TV is 
           tuned to RICKI LAKE.  Peeling vinyl seats.  Trash on the 
           floor.  No other customers.

           And a row of lockers at the back.

                                 THE GUNMAN
                        How much is left?

                                 JACK
                        A little over forty.

           Jack’s got his keys in his hands.  Goes to the locker.  Opens 
           it.  That black satchel inside.  He hands it to the gunman.

                                 THE GUNMAN
                        I’m gonna look.

           The gunman looks.  And in the instant his head is down, Jack 
           FINGERS THE BOWIE KNIFE.  Sweating, but--

           The gunman’s head is back up.  Staring at Jack.  Eyes narrow.

           INT.  BEATER OLDSMOBILE (MOVING) - NIGHT (1999)

           Back in the car.  Jack drives.

                                 THE GUNMAN
                        Just head north.

                                 JACK
                        Where we going?

                                 THE GUNMAN
                        To drop you off.

           EXT.  DIRT FRONTAGE ROAD - NIGHT (1999)

           The Oldsmobile’s headlights cut bright down a dirt road.  
           Cornfields on either side.  CRICKETS CHIRPING.  A DOG BARKS 
           IN THE DISTANCE.  The car comes to a stop.

                                 THE GUNMAN (O.C.)
                        Get out.

           Jack does as he’s told.  The gunman gets out behind him.

                                 THE GUNMAN
                        Over to the shoulder.
           Again, Jack complies.  The gunman still standing by the Olds.

                                 THE GUNMAN
                        Kneel down.

                                 JACK
                        You said you were gonna drop me 
                        off.

           And the gun is raised.

                                 THE GUNMAN
                        KNEEL DOWN.

           Jack finally does.  The gunman walks up to him.  Pistol to 
           Jack’s forehead.  Inches away.  Staring at one another.  

           This is an execution in progress.

                                 THE GUNMAN
                        You got anything you want me to 
                        tell them?

                                 JACK
                        Who?

                                 THE GUNMAN
                        Who do you think?

                                 JACK
                        Yeah, actually--
                             (re: the gun)
                        Is the safety on?

           And it only takes that HALF INSTANT.  His eyes off Jack for a 
           flicker, checking the pistol as Jack DRAWS THE KNIFE, 
           SWINGING, LUNGING, WRAPPING HIS ARMS AROUND THE GUNMAN’S 
           KNEES.  THE GUN FIRES into the air and now--

           Jack SWINGS the blade--  The back of THE GUNMAN’S LEGS.  
           SLICING.  SLICING.

           His ACLs both SNAP.  BLOOD SPRAYS.  The muscle ROLLING UP 
           like a window shade pulled too hard.  

           The gunman GOES DOWN WRITHING, tries to STEADY THE PISTOL--

           He FIRES at JACK.  MISSES.  JACK MOVES.  ON TOP OF HIM.  
           Holding his gun arm down.  STRUGGLING.

           And here comes THE BLADE.  ARCING.  Into THE BASE OF THE 
           GUNMAN’S CHIN, straight up through THE ROOF OF HIS MOUTH.  
           CRACKING.  The point stopping somewhere behind his nose, 
           unseen.  BLOOD SEEPS out of the ENTRANCE WOUND.  

           Jack TWISTS THE KNIFE HANDLE a quarter-turn.

           Everything is still.  And then.  The gunman begins 
           CONVULSING.  BLOOD POURING FROM HIS MOUTH.  HIS NOSE.  His 
           eyes twitching.  
           Jack rolls off of him, removing the blade.  Shaking.  Drops 
           the bloody knife.  Panting for breath.  Holding.  ALONE.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Indiana.  All that I’d tried to 
                        leave behind had found me anyhow.  
                        And I’d killed a man and I felt 
                        glad.  That it was him and not me.  
                        Dead in some forsaken cornfield.

           Jack picks up the satchel.  The knife.  Walking, limping back 
           to the car.  Gets inside.  The RUMBLE of the ENGINE as the 
           car heads off, vanishing into the gloaming.

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT.  CEMETERY - AFTERNOON (2008)

           A mound of dirt near the casket, floral arrangements already 
           seeming discarded.  Adrift.  Drops of rain begin to fall.  
           Nearby, Jimmy and Jack facing each other, silent.  Jimmy 
           looks up to the sky as the rain moves in, rueful.

                                 JIMMY
                        What’d I tell you, Jack?  Things we 
                        did are done.  We can’t take them 
                        back.
                             (beat)
                        Fucking rain.  Each day I get 
                        older, I wonder why I stayed in 
                        this city so long.  A cold front 
                        moves in off the sound and my 
                        joints feel like I took a beating, 
                        you know that?

                                 JACK
                        What’s it going to take to close 
                        this book, Jimmy?

                                 JIMMY
                        Come over.  Have a drink.

                                 JACK
                        How much is it going to take to 
                        forget about me?

                                 JIMMY
                        I won’t ever forget about you, 
                        Jackie Boy.  I gotta get outta this 
                        rain.  Come to the house.  You see 
                        these guys...
                             (he gestures to the cops)
                        They’ll make sure nothing happens 
                        to you, alright?  Alright.  I’ll 
                        see you at the house and we’ll 
                        talk.  Catch up.  Wouldn’t you like 
                        to catch up?

           He doesn’t wait for an answer, shuffling away to a waiting 
           Town Car.  Jack stands alone in the rain watching him go.
           MINUTES LATER

           IT’S BECOME A DOWNPOUR.  Rain pounds on everything in sight: 
           the tops of gravestones, veritable streams running down the 
           cemetery pathways.  And now, a cascade on top of a large 
           black umbrella.  

           The umbrella in question is being held by DAVID BANNION (40s, 
           clean-cut in a dark suit and overcoat).  He leans against a 
           Chrysler Sebring parked near the cemetery entrance watching 
           bemused as Jack treks toward him through the storm.

                                 BANNION
                        Some weather, huh?

           Jack looks up: is this guy talking to him? 

                                 JACK
                        Who are you?

           Jack pulls out a KEY FOB.  The Sebring’s doors unlock: Jack’s 
           rental.  Bannion blocks Jack’s path to the driver’s door.

                                 BANNION
                        Should’ve packed an umbrella, Jack.  
                        Jack Grant, am I right?  I’m 
                        working off an old yearbook photo 
                        because let me tell you, there’s 
                        not a lot to go by when it comes to 
                        you, friend.

           Jack’s getting soaked.  And pissed.

                                 JACK
                        Let me rephrase my question.  Who 
                        the fuck are you?  Friend.

                                 BANNION
                        You’ll have to excuse my manners.  
                        David Bannion.  

           Bannion quickly FLASHES A BADGE--

                                 JACK
                        I don’t talk to cops.

                                 BANNION
                        I wouldn’t either.  I’m with the 
                        FBI.  You come with me now, this 
                        stays off the record.  If not, I 
                        got no problem bringing you in so 
                        the whole city hears about it--  
                        Have you eaten?

           INT.  SEATTLE DINER - DUSK

           A GREASY SPOON somewhere downtown, traffic roaring by in the 
           background.  Bannion and Jack seated together in a booth, 
           Jack toweling his hair dry with a hand cloth.  He hands the 
           towel back to the WAITER (50s, portly, disagreeable). 
                                 BANNION
                        I’m telling you, you should’ve 
                        ordered the onion rings.  Best 
                        goddamned onion rings I’ve ever 
                        had.

                                 JACK
                        I stay away from fried foods.

                                 BANNION
                        My cardiologist would love you.

                                 JACK
                        You tell him I said hello next time 
                        you’re in for a bypass.

           And the waiter’s back, SLAMMING DOWN TWO CUPS OF COFFEE, both 
           of which SPILL SLIGHTLY, a mess on the linoleum tabletop.

                                 JACK
                        Terrific service, by the way.

                                 BANNION
                        When the onion rings come, you 
                        taste one.  Just a bite.  Then you 
                        complain about the service.  Deal?

                                 JACK
                        Sure.

           Bannion stirs sugar into his coffee.  SLURPS off the spoon.

                                 BANNION
                        I’m sorry about your father.

                                 JACK
                        I bet you’re heart broken.

                                 BANNION
                        Let me ask you something.  You find 
                        you have difficulty making friends?

                                 JACK
                        When you’re not trying, nothing’s 
                        difficult.  

                                 BANNION
                        I had a brother like you.  Mad at 
                        the world, never a straight answer.  
                        So he packs up shop, heads off into 
                        the wild, we didn’t hear from him 
                        for two years.  Some hunters found 
                        him.  You’re not gonna believe this 
                        but it’s the truth.  Motherfucker 
                        got eaten by a bear.  No shit.  
                        Eaten by a goddamned bear.   

                                 JACK
                        I’ll remember to stay out of the 
                        forest.
                                 BANNION
                        Let’s cut the bullshit, Jack.  You 
                        left home at seventeen and you come 
                        back now.  Why?

                                 JACK
                        My father died.  We covered that.

                                 BANNION
                        Right.  But what I hear is you 
                        don’t talk to the old man for the 
                        past fourteen years.  You up and 
                        leave and then it’s goddamned radio 
                        silence, so why bother--

                                 JACK
                        Are you telling me I didn’t love my 
                        father?  Because you don’t know 
                        shit about me or my family--

                                 BANNION
                        I know your mom died when you were 
                        a kid.  Brakes failed on a turn.  I 
                        know you stole fifty thousand 
                        dollars from Jimmy Shay.

                                 JACK
                        What the hell is this?
                             (Bannion’s quiet)
                        No.  I want an answer from you.  I 
                        never seen you before in my life 
                        and I come home and I bury my 
                        father and you show up and you ask 
                        me these questions and you play 
                        your game of chess pushing me into 
                        mate and for what?  For what, 
                        Special Agent David Bannion?  So 
                        now I’m asking you.  WHAT IS THIS?

           The whole diner quiet.  Staring at Jack and Bannion.  The 
           waiter appears with the onion rings.  Sets them down.  
           Awkward.  Bannion picks one up.  Starts chewing away happily.

                                 BANNION
                        You promised me you’d have a bite.

           Jack can’t believe this is where the conversation has turned.  
           Pauses.  Picks up an onion ring.  Is about to bite into it--

                                 BANNION
                        And have some of the dressing.  The 
                        ranch.  They make it here.

           Jack’s FURIOUS.  He slams the onion ring into the plate of 
           ranch, scooping some up, the dressing dribbling across the 
           table.  Bites down.  Chews.  A beat.  And the corners of his 
           lips turn into a smile against his better judgment.  

                                 BANNION
                        I fucking told you.  Right?
                                 JACK
                        It’s a good onion ring.

                                 BANNION
                        Good.  Good onion ring.  The best 
                        onion ring you’ve ever had.

                                 JACK
                        I’m having another one.

                                 BANNION
                        Thought you didn’t eat fried foods, 
                        cowboy.

           Jack ignores him, eating another onion ring.  Smirking now.

                                 BANNION
                        You want me to lay my hand on the 
                        table?  Here it is.  We’ve been 
                        casing Shay since before you were 
                        weaned.  Trying to build something 
                        against him.  Going on twenty-five 
                        years of goddamned nothing.  
                        Because no one would talk.  No one.  
                        I mean, we had ideas.  We knew that 
                        some rival strip club operators 
                        from the Viaduct go missing, 
                        they’re probably not on a vacation.  
                        But this is a guy that just did not 
                        make mistakes.  

                                 JACK
                        A veritable machine.

                                 BANNION
                        A year-and-a-half ago, these calls 
                        come in.  Directing us to these 
                        bodies.  Shit going back fifteen, 
                        twenty years.  The town gets 
                        nervous and some of the middle-
                        management start to crack and here 
                        we are.  Jimmy’s in court, your dad 
                        has a coronary and I’m treating you 
                        to the best goddamned onion rings 
                        in America.

                                 JACK
                        You know all this.  I know all 
                        this.  What’s the angle?

                                 BANNION
                        1994, you take fifty thousand 
                        dollars of Shay’s money.  You don’t 
                        even finish high school.  But 
                        there’s how many years prior to 
                        that you’re living in that beach 
                        house with the venerable Milton 
                        Shay.  Your own personal high life.  
                        So I’m asking you.  Is there shit 
                        you saw that maybe I’d like to know 
                        about?  
                                 JACK
                        “Shit I saw”?

                                 BANNION
                        Since those calls came in this 
                        town’s been drawing sides.  With 
                        Shay or against him.  And you’re 
                        back now so you’re gonna have to 
                        pick one.  You can’t run down the 
                        middle no more because he won’t let 
                        you.  This isn’t Alaska and it sure 
                        as hell ain’t Switzerland.  So you 
                        need to decide.  Are you with him 
                        or are you with me?  Those are your 
                        choices.  The inevitable can be 
                        delayed but there’s no stopping it, 
                        Jack.  I’m telling you things are 
                        gonna be a lot easier down the road 
                        if you make the right choice right 
                        now.  You go state’s.

                                 JACK
                        I might not be a friend of Jimmy 
                        Shay’s.  But I told you at the 
                        cemetery.  I don’t talk to cops.  
                        And that goes for special agents 
                        too.  How’s that work for you, 
                        detective? 

           And Jack stands to go.  Bannion GRABS HIS WRIST.

                                 BANNION
                        Hey.  If you change your mind--

           And he extends a business card.  Jack stares at it.  An 
           unspoken beat between the two men.  Jack finally takes the 
           card.  And he walks out of the restaurant.

                                 BANNION
                        Can I get another order of onion 
                        rings over here?

           INT.  JACK’S RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

           THE RED GLOW OF A TRAFFIC LIGHT refracted a hundred-fold in 
           rain drops against the windshield.  A wiper blade slices into 
           frame.  The light turns green.

           Jack accelerates, staring forward blankfaced, anxious.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        They were the old guard.  Guys who 
                        had come to the house two, three, 
                        four at a time when I was a kid.  
                        “Business meetings,” they said.

           EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT (1986)

           SLO-MO-- A WISPING CURL OF SMOKE rises in front of an outdoor 
           lamp on the porch at night.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        They wore too much Aqua Velva and 
                        Brut and smoked Cohibas Jimmy had 
                        lifted from some other wiseguy with 
                        Cuban connections.

           Jimmy, Milton and FOUR TOUGH GUYS are seated around a card 
           table playing poker.  

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Muscle types with gold chains and 
                        stolen Rolexes.  Satisfied to be 
                        the big fish in their own little 
                        pond.  And I thought this was what 
                        it meant to be a man.

           THE RED TIP OF A CIGAR snuffed out in an ashtray.

           EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - DAY (1986)

           ANOTHER DAY.  A MEETING of THUGS visible through the window 
           in the living room talking to JIMMY and MILTON.

           Leaning against the wall outside, two more toughs, FISHER 
           (30s, slick-haired, hulking) and LARRY (20s, jumpy greaser) 
           are on a smoke break.  

           Fisher pulls cigarettes and a Zippo from his pocket, lighting 
           up.  He looks over to see Young Jack watching him, sitting on 
           the porch with a pile of action figures.

                                 LARRY
                             (to Fisher)
                        Looks like you got an admirer.

                                 FISHER
                             (to Jack re: the Zippo)
                        Pretty badass, right?

           Fisher clicks it open, lights it and shuts it again in one 
           smooth motion.  Jack’s silent.  Fisher tosses him the Zippo.  

                                 FISHER
                        Fucking keep it.  I got too many of 
                        ‘em anyhow.  Just don’t burn 
                        anything down, alright?

           INT.  BEACH HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT (1986)

           Young Jack lies awake in bed lighting and extinguishing the 
           Zippo over and over.  Finally, he shuts it for good.  BLACK.
                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        The old guard.  That’s what I 
                        wanted to be.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT.  JACK’S RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT (2008)

           TIGHT ON THE ORANGE FLASH of a turn signal blinking.  Jack 
           heads down a driveway, the rain slowing to a mist.  

           EXT.  JIMMY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The rental car pulls up the drive to a Tudor-style brick 
           house.  Cars abound outside.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Even now, it wasn’t them that was 
                        talking-- they were busy circling 
                        the wagons.  No, it was the new 
                        kids, guys who’d been in the 
                        operation five, ten years.  Punks 
                        who didn’t understand the code.  
                        Kids who grew up in those 
                        shimmering Regan years.  Always 
                        looking out for themselves first.

           Jack parks his car.  Gets out.  Stares at the house.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        You ask the old guard, they 
                        might’ve said kids like me.  

           Reaching into his pocket, Jack pulls out the Zippo Fisher 
           gave so long ago, lighting it and flicking it closed.  

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Funny the shit you take with you.

           INT.  JIMMY’S HOUSE - FOYER/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           A LODGE FEEL to the place: animal heads on the walls, a huge 
           fireplace, high ceilings supported by dark crossbeams.  A 
           hushed gathering of MIDDLE-AGED MEN in dark suits fills the 
           space drinking, reminiscing.  Jack walks tentatively through 
           the door eyeing the crowd warily.  

           Finally, one of the men turns to look.  Says nothing.  
           Watching Jack.  The conversation in the room slowly grinds to 
           a halt until everyone is silent and staring at him.  One of 
           the OLDER GUYS, stocky, bald--

                                 OLD MAN
                        Sorry for your loss, Jack.

           Again, stony silence.  Then, from somewhere behind Jack--

                                 TODD (O.C.)
                        Jackie Boy, you made it.  Let’s go.  
                        Dad wants to talk.
           STUDY - MOMENTS LATER

           EVEN DARKER HERE.  Jimmy sits behind an oak desk rifling 
           through a pack of playing cards.  EARL HOWSER (47, pencil-
           necked, wearing wire-rim glasses) stands behind him.

                                 TODD
                        Look who I found.

                                 JIMMY
                        You’re late.

                                 JACK
                        I got lost.

                                 JIMMY
                        I’ll bet.  Sit down.  You want a 
                        drink?

                                 JACK
                        No.

           Jack sits in a chair opposite Jimmy’s desk.  Todd collapses 
           onto a leather sofa at the back of the room.

                                 JACK
                             (re: Earl)
                        Who’s the auditor?

                                 JIMMY
                        Funny.  Earl Howser.  He worked 
                        with your father.

           Earl doesn’t say anything.  Jack staring at him.  Tension.

                                 JACK
                        He know how to talk?

                                 JIMMY
                        Why don’t you ask him?

                                 JACK
                        I’m asking you.

                                 JIMMY
                        The older I get, the less I want to 
                        deal with business.  Don’t have the 
                        taste for it anymore, Jack.  

                                 JACK
                        That’s a shame.

                                 JIMMY
                        So fuck it.  You don’t wanna chat, 
                        let’s get to it.  Earl’s got 
                        something for you.  Earl?

           Earl reaches into his coat pocket.  Pulls out a white 
           envelope.  Hands it to Jack.
                                 JACK
                        What’s this?

                                 JIMMY
                        Fucking open it.

                                 TODD
                        Yeah, fucking open it, Jackie Boy.

                                 JIMMY
                             (to Todd)
                        Shut the fuck up, Todd.
                             (to Jack)
                        Fucking open it.

           Jack rifles the envelope open.  Pulls out a document.  Stares 
           at it.  Eyes back up to Jimmy.

                                 JIMMY
                        His will.  If he’d asked me, I 
                        woulda told him not to do it, but 
                        he didn’t ask me, did he, Jack?  
                        It’s all yours.  Every fucking 
                        thing.  So.  Congratulations.  You 
                        found another way to take my money.

                                 JACK
                             (simmering)
                        I didn’t come here looking to 
                        collect, Jimmy.

                                 JIMMY
                        No.  Because you already beat the 
                        goddamn house.

                                 JACK
                        Are we through?

                                 JIMMY
                        What do you think, Jack?  You asked 
                        me yourself.  Didn’t you?  You want 
                        to make things right.  Settle the 
                        books.  So.  You’re going to do 
                        some things for us and we’ll close 
                        the fucking ledger.  How’s that 
                        sound?  

                                 JACK
                        How much do you want, Jimmy?

                                 JIMMY
                        How much do you think I want?  

                                 JACK
                        Fifty grand at twenty percent over 
                        fourteen years.  Six hundred fifty 
                        thousand.  

                                 JIMMY
                        You been working on that number?
                                 JACK
                        Take it out of his estate.  

                                 JIMMY
                        Is this what you think?  You think 
                        what I want, all this time later, 
                        you think what’s going to make this 
                        right is money?

                                 TODD
                        He doesn’t want fucking money, 
                        Jackie Boy.

           Jimmy suddenly ERUPTS--

                                 JIMMY
                        SHUT.  THE FUCK.  UP.  You stupid 
                        fucking cunt.  I’m having a 
                        conversation here.  Can you not see 
                        that?  FUCK.

           Jimmy turns back to Jack.

                                 JIMMY
                        You follow the news, Jack?  Because 
                        I follow the news and what I heard 
                        is that some shit-faced rat sent 
                        this town into a goddamned frenzy 
                        uncovering the graves of a few long-
                        forgotten fucks that ain’t no one 
                        grieving over anymore.  And I gotta 
                        wonder.  Is this the reason I don’t 
                        take no pleasure in doing business 
                        anymore?  I provide services people 
                        pay for.  Reputable fucking 
                        services.  I stand behind my 
                        products.  How many businesses you 
                        know that stand behind their 
                        products?  Really stand.  No one’s 
                        got a gun to anyone’s head.  These 
                        people come to me because they want 
                        a service that I provide better 
                        than anyone in this fucking town, 
                        alright, and no one, NO ONE misses 
                        these dead fucks they’re dredging 
                        up like my dirty fucking laundry.  
                        The cost of doing business, right, 
                        Jack?

                                 JACK
                        Helluva cost.

                                 JIMMY
                        “Helluva cost,” he says to me.  
                        Jesus Fucking Christ, Jack.  If you 
                        hadn’t left--  No.  You left, but 
                        if you hadn’t--  Man, you got brass 
                        fucking balls on you, kid.  Brass 
                        fucking balls.  I coulda taught a 
                        kid like you to run this town.  
                        Discipline.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)
                        No one’s got any discipline, Jack.  
                        So here I am prattling on and 
                        you’re wondering, “So.  What’s the 
                        point?”  OK.  OK.  I’ll tell you 
                        the fucking point, Jack. 
                             (beat)
                        Todd and me here, we can’t leave 
                        the house without a goddamn tail, 
                        twenty-four fucking seven.  How am 
                        I supposed to get work done-- How 
                        am I supposed to run an operation 
                        with these guys breathing down my 
                        goddamn neck?  I can’t even jerk 
                        off without some G-man writing down 
                        whether I used my fucking left or 
                        my right.  But I need to know.  Who 
                        the fuck’s been talking?  And who 
                        can I get to find out?  Take old 
                        Earl here.  Say I tell Earl, “Earl, 
                        you find out who’s been squealing.”  
                        Well maybe Earl’s been fucking 
                        squealing, Jack.  You ever think of 
                        that?  But you--  You can provide 
                        me with a real service I can’t get 
                        nowhere else.  Cause you been gone 
                        a long time.  People know what you 
                        done to me.  Right?  The original 
                        fucking insurgent.
                             (beat)
                        You’re gonna find the rat for me, 
                        Jack.  That’s what you’re gonna do. 
                        Then we’re square.  So how’s that?

                                 JACK
                        I don’t think so, Jimmy.

                                 JIMMY
                        You don’t think so?  BRASS FUCKING 
                        BALLS, AM I RIGHT?  YOU CAME TO ME.  
                        YOU REMEMBER THIS?  YOU FUCKING 
                        CAME TO ME AND YOU SAID, “WHAT DO I 
                        DO TO MAKE THIS RIGHT?”

                                 JACK
                        I won’t do this, Jimmy.  I can’t.

                                 JIMMY
                        You can’t.  Yes, you fucking can.  
                        Cause I know something else, Jack.  
                        Ask me what else I know.  
                             (silence)
                        C’mon.  Ask me.  FUCKING ASK ME!!!

           Jack looks away.

                                 JIMMY
                        I’ll tell you what else I know, you 
                        ungrateful cocksucking leech.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JIMMY (CONT'D)
                        I know a man’s been gone as long as 
                        you comes back and suddenly says to 
                        me that he wants the cloud over his 
                        head blown out to sea, I know a guy 
                        says that to me, something’s 
                        changed.  Am I right, Jack?  What’s 
                        got you so tired now?  Indiana?  
                        That was nine years ago.  

                                 JACK
                        I’m offering you his estate, Jimmy.  
                        Every goddamned cent.  

                                 JIMMY
                        AND I’M TELLING YOU I DON’T WANT 
                        IT.  You wanna know what’s changed, 
                        Jack?   You think you can sit there 
                        and play it cool and I can’t look 
                        at you, I can’t just look into the 
                        black fucking pits of your eyes and 
                        not see it?  Because I can see it, 
                        Jack, I can see right through you, 
                        back to front, you get me?  

           While Jimmy sputters on he rifles through his top desk 
           drawer.  As he finishes the speech, he SLAMS SOMETHING DOWN 
           ON HIS DESK.  Leans back.  Triumphant.  

           Jack looks down.  It’s an 8x10 BLACK & WHITE TELEPHOTO GLOSSY 
           OF MOLLY CROSSING A STREET.

                                 JIMMY
                        You wanna know when that was taken?  
                        I’ll tell you, I can tell from the 
                        outfit she’s wearing that was 
                        today.  Because yesterday, the day 
                        you left, then she was wearing 
                        those blue jeans with the rip above 
                        the knee and that tight little 
                        black number that makes her tits 
                        look oh so good.  You think I 
                        didn’t know, Jack?  This is what 
                        you’re gonna do for me.  You’re 
                        gonna go home to the beach house 
                        and you’re gonna get some sleep 
                        because tomorrow we got work to do.

           Jack still looking at the photo.

                                 JIMMY
                        No smartass retort now, huh, Jack?  
                        Let me tell you something else.  
                        You call her and you tell her you 
                        got some business with Dear Old 
                        Dad’s estate that’s gonna take a 
                        few days.  Because my man up there 
                        sees anything unusual, sees her 
                        maybe heading outta town to parts 
                        unknown, I’ll have him slit her 
                        fucking throat.  So.  We understand 
                        each other?
                                 JACK
                        Yeah.

                                 JIMMY
                        Meet Todd at the Post, two 
                        tomorrow.  I’m sure you boys’ll 
                        make a great team.

                                 JACK
                        I’m looking forward to it.

                                 JIMMY
                        Good.  Oh.  You’ll probably want 
                        the key to the house.  

           He reaches into the desk drawer and tosses a key to Jack.

                                 JIMMY
                        The alarm code’s zero-six-one-
                        eight.  Have a pleasant evening, 
                        Jack.  I’ll be in touch.

           INT.  JACK & MOLLY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           OUT OF THE PAST runs on a tiny TV perched on a dresser.  
           Idyllic B&W as JEFF BAILEY (Robert Mitchum) sits next to 
           pretty blonde ANN MILLER (Virginia Huston) packing up his fly-
           fishing gear.

                                 ANN MILLER (V.O.)
                        They say the day you die, your name 
                        is written on a cloud.

                                 JEFF BAILEY (V.O.)
                        Who says?

                                 ANN MILLER (V.O.)
                        They.

                                 JEFF BAILEY (V.O.)
                        Never heard of ‘em.  Nothing in 
                        that one but rain.  Think we oughta 
                        go home?

           Molly watches the movie bundled up in a sweatshirt and eating 
           popcorn out of a bowl.   The PHONE on the bedside table 
           RINGS.  Molly answers it--

                                 MOLLY
                        Hello?

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Hey.  It’s me.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT.  JACK’S RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - THAT MOMENT

           Jack drives, talking on his cell.
                                 MOLLY (V.O.)
                        Jesus Jack, I hadn’t heard from you 
                        and I--

                                 JACK
                        I’m fine.  Everything’s fine.  I’m 
                        sorry it’s so late.  But listen--  
                        Something’s come up.  A lawyer came 
                        to see me after the funeral. 
                             (beat)
                        He kept me in his will, Mol.  The 
                        old man.  You won’t believe it.  
                        Left me the whole goddamn estate.  

                                 MOLLY (V.O.)
                        Jack.

                                 JACK
                        This could be good for us.  Get 
                        some money.  Some security.

                                 MOLLY (V.O.)
                        That’s not what I’m worried about.  
                        Just tell me you’re alright.

                                 JACK
                        I’m alright.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT.  JACK & MOLLY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Molly on the phone.

                                 MOLLY
                        You say the words, I’ll believe 
                        you.  

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        I said the words, Molly.  I’m 
                        alright.  I just gotta deal with 
                        all these lawyers and...  I’m 
                        coming home.  Soon as I can.

           As Jack speaks THE SHOT TRACKS BACK through the bedroom, 
           WIDER AND WIDER until IT PASSES CLEAN THROUGH THE WINDOW...

           EXT.  JACK & MOLLY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           ...OUTSIDE LOOKING IN NOW, still MOVING BACK, STILL GROWING 
           WIDER and SWOOPING DOWN, Molly becoming a speck in the 
           bedroom, the flickering light of the television an eerie 
           blue...

                                 MOLLY (O.C.)
                        And what about Todd Shay?  

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        I’m working on it.  We’re working 
                        things out.
           ...DROPPING DOWN TO STREET LEVEL, passing over the BLACK HOOD 
           OF A 1969 PONTIAC GTO near the base of a STREET LAMP...

                                 MOLLY (O.C.)
                        You call me again tomorrow, OK?  I 
                        love you.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Love you too...

           ...REVEAL A FIGURE standing by the GTO, his back to camera, 
           taking a drag on a cigarette, its end GLOWING RED...

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        And, Molly?  You be safe up there.

           ...and the man DROPS THE CIGARETTE into a THIN PUDDLE OF 
           WATER ON THE PAVEMENT, his BOOT ENTERING FRAME, stamping it 
           out...

                                 MOLLY (O.C.)
                        I will, Jack.  I promise.

           And the line CLICKS OFF.

           EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

           A VAST PANORAMA of the shoreline.  The lights from Jack’s 
           rental play through spindly tree branches.  The beach house 
           looms in shadow, seen in fragments, unlit.  

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        They say when you revisit the 
                        places from your childhood, they’re 
                        bound to seem smaller.  Less, 
                        somehow, than you remembered.  

           The rental comes to a stop.  Jack steps out, looking up at 
           the beach house, the key clutched in his hand.  His breath 
           hangs thick on the air.  Waves lapping against the shoreline.

           Jack’s on the porch.  Inserting the key in the lock, the door 
           CREAKING OPEN.  The warning tone of the ALARM SOUNDS.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        I wish I could say they were right.

           INT.  BEACH HOUSE - FOYER - THAT MOMENT

           THE ALARM PANEL backlit as Jack punches in the code.  The 
           tone goes silent.

           WIDE NOW as the overhead track lights strike up.  An uncanny 
           quiet.  Jack stands alone in this enormous space before him.  
           Stark.  Cavernous.  Staring up past the second floor balcony, 
           into the reaches of the cathedral ceiling.  Holding.
                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        That I’d lived in a place like 
                        this...  But not a place like this.  
                        This place.  

           Jack finally takes a tentative step forward.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        It didn’t seem real.  And now, for 
                        the first time I knew it.  

           KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Evidence of a life interrupted: dirty dishes piled near the 
           sink.  A newspaper neatly folded in quarters left on the 
           counter.  A half-filled water glass. 

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        He was gone.  

           Jack picks up the dirty plates, scraping the now-rank food 
           into the trash.  

           BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Darkness ended as an overhead light turns on.  Jack pours 
           over years of discarded detritus.  A bicycle from his 
           childhood leaning rusted near a workbench.

           OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Milton’s home office.  Enormous piles of paperwork.  French 
           doors open onto a balcony with another expansive view of the 
           water.  Fingerlike tree limbs tapping uneasily at the glass. 

           Jack sits down in the chair behind the desk.  Leaning back.  
           Staring around the room.  His eyes stop.  On the opposite 
           wall stands a cherry & glass gun cabinet filled with mostly 
           antique firearms.  

           Jack crosses to the cabinet.  Opens it.  Selects a SHOTGUN, 
           pulling it out, holding the stock in his hands as if weighing 
           it.  Moving quickly now he kneels down, checking the bottom 
           cabinets for AMMO.  Spots a RED BOX OF SHELLS.

           He snaps the shotgun open.  Loads both barrels.  Tips the box 
           of shells out into his cupped hands, stuffing his pockets.  

           Kneeling alone for a beat.  Staring at the gun.

           FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           TIGHT ON THE ALARM PANEL-- Jack punches the code in again.  
           Presses ARM.  The panel BEEPS.  

           WIDE as Jack surveys his territory, the shotgun cradled in 
           his arms.  He reaches for the light switches by his side, 
           turning off the overhead track lights one by one until he’s 
           standing bathed only in the cold winter’s moonlight.
           JACK’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Finally visiting his own bedroom.  The door swinging open 
           slowly, revealing that it might as well be 1994-- 

           Posters for NICK CAVE and PRIMAL SCREAM on the walls.  
           BASEBALL TROPHIES on the desk.  A dried BOUTONNIERE pinned to 
           a corkboard.  A model of a BATTLESHIP on the dresser.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        The bastard hadn’t touched a thing.  
                        Not a goddamn thing.  

           HOURS LATER

           Jack lies in bed on top of the comforter staring up at the 
           ceiling.  The shotgun resting on his chest, his hands curled 
           tight around the stock.  

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Had he been waiting for me?

           INT.  BEACH HOUSE - JACK’S ROOM - MORNING

           Somewhere, a PHONE RINGING.  Loud, insistent.

           Jack’s asleep still fully dressed, the shotgun at his side.  
           White sunlight streaming through the windows.  The PHONE 
           KEEPS RINGING.  Jack opens his eyes, tired.

           OFFICE - SECONDS LATER

           The phone on Milton’s desk the source of the incessant noise.  
           Jack crosses to the handset.  Looks down at the backlit LED: 
           “UNKNOWN CALLER.”  Answers.

                                 JACK
                        Hello?

           A long pause.  Some NOISE on the other end of the line.

                                 JACK
                        Hello--

           It’s THAT VOICE.  Altered, deep, inhuman.

                                 ANONYMOUS (V.O.)
                        Jack Grant.

                                 JACK
                        Who’s this?

                                 ANONYMOUS (V.O.)
                        Check the top drawer on your left.  

           Jack turns to the windows, peering out at the sound...

                                 ANONYMOUS (V.O.)
                        You won’t see me.  Open the drawer, 
                        Jack. 
           Spinning around slowly, uneasy.  Sliding the drawer open.

                                 ANONYMOUS (V.O.)
                        There’s a wallet of keys inside.  

           There is.  A buttoned leather pouch.

                                 ANONYMOUS (V.O.)
                        You’ll find a small key etched with 
                        the numbers oh-five-three-oh-nine-
                        six.  

           Jack rifles through the keys, sees the one in question.

                                 ANONYMOUS (V.O.)
                        It’ll open a safe deposit box of 
                        the same number.  Washington Mutual 
                        at Fifth and Union.  Your name is 
                        on the account.

                                 JACK
                        And if I don’t--

           CLICK.  The line goes dead.  Jack lets the receiver drop to 
           his side, stepping toward the glass, looking out at the 
           sound, the wilderness.  And then he looks to the key, small 
           and silver, turning it over and over in his hands.

           EXT.  BAINBRIDGE ISLAND FERRY (MOVING) - DAY

           Railside on the enormous vessel.  The choppy wake of the 
           water passing by below.  Jack watches as the Seattle skyline 
           becomes faintly visible through the fog.  Seagulls fly 
           alongside the boat.

           EXT.  WASHINGTON MUTUAL - LATER THAT DAY

           ESTABLISHING.  A big branch downtown.  Skyscrapers.

           INT.  WASHINGTON MUTUAL - LOBBY - THAT MOMENT

           The beaming face of a too-cheerful TELLER (20s).  

                                 TELLER
                        How can I help you today, sir?

           Jack lays the key down on a counter.

           SAFE DEPOSIT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A tan cinder-block room with a long wooden table straight out 
           of 1974.  Jack sits at the table fidgeting anxiously.  A 
           SECURITY GUARD appears carrying a safe deposit box into the 
           room.  He sets it down on the table.  Exits.

           Jack sits alone.  Holding.  Waiting.  Looks up at the 
           security camera perched in the corner.  And then he opens the 
           box.  Stares inside for a long beat.

           The box is empty save for one item: A GLISTENING BLACK iPOD.
           LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Back at the teller window.

                                 TELLER
                        Did you find everything alright?

                                 JACK
                        Yeah, I was wondering--  If I 
                        wanted to add another name to my 
                        account--

                                 TELLER
                        You’ll just need to fill out some 
                        paperwork...
                             (looks at her computer)
                        And since this is a joint account, 
                        you and...
                             (reading from the monitor)
                        Milton will both need to sign off 
                        on the change.

                                 JACK
                        Milton.

           EXT.  WASHINGTON MUTUAL - SECONDS LATER

           Jack exits the bank head down, lost in thought.  Then, from 
           somewhere off-screen...

                                 BANNION (O.S.)
                        Deposit or withdrawal?

           Jack looks up to see Bannion leaning against a Crown Vic 
           outside the bank.

                                 JACK
                        You tailing me, Special Agent?

                                 BANNION
                        I was in the neighborhood.

                                 JACK
                        I’ll bet.

                                 BANNION
                        So, deposit or withdrawal?

                                 JACK
                        I’m late for a meeting.

                                 BANNION
                        I wasn’t kidding, Jack.  You’re 
                        gonna have to pick a side in this 
                        one.

                                 JACK
                        Yeah, well.  I’m still considering 
                        all my offers.
           INT.  JACK’S RENTAL CAR (PARKED) - MOMENTS LATER

           Jack sits alone in the midst of the cavernous parking garage.  
           The iPod in hand.  He presses the MENU button.  Selects 
           MUSIC.  Scrolls down to ARTISTS.  Hits select again.  

           On the ARTISTS screen, he sees a list of names, not musicians 
           but names he knows, among them: EARL HOWSER, JAMES SHAY and 
           TODD SHAY.  

           Jack looks down at the car stereo.  An 1/8” cable dangling 
           off the dash.  He hooks it into the iPod.  Turns on engine.  
           Sets the stereo to AUX.  Now back to the iPod menus.

           Scrolls to JAMES SHAY.  Presses select.  He’s presented with 
           a long list of dates beginning “2005-02-12.”  He presses 
           select again.  

           A momentary CRACKLE from the stereo followed by the sound of 
           A PHONE RINGING OVER A LINE.  Then JIMMY’S VOICE, tinny:

                                 JIMMY (V.O.)
                        Hello?

           And now, Milton’s voice, clear, as if he’s in the car:

                                 MILTON (V.O.)
                        Jimmy.  Milton.

                                 JIMMY (V.O.)
                        Fuck man.  I’ve been trying to get 
                        a hold of you.  We need to talk  
                        about Bianco.  I’m hearing he’s 
                        causing problems on the supply 
                        side.  

                                 MILTON (V.O.)
                        Since when?

                                 JIMMY (V.O.)
                        What does it matter?  Low tide’s at 
                        nine tonight.  I want him taken off 
                        the operation.

                                 MILTON (V.O.)
                        Low tide?

                                 JIMMY (V.O.)
                        Don’t get smart with me.  We both 
                        know this is overdue--

           Jack leans in, listening when suddenly his CELL PHONE RINGS, 
           piercing the cabin.  He jumps, hits PAUSE on the iPod.  Takes 
           his phone from his pocket.  

           The screen reads “UNKNOWN CALLER.”  He flips open the phone.  
           Raises it to his ear without saying a word.  And then--

                                 ANONYMOUS (V.O.)
                        You’ve been to the bank.
                                 JACK
                        I’ve been to the bank.

                                 ANONYMOUS (V.O.)
                        You wanna make Jimmy Shay go away, 
                        you take that to someone who cares.

                                 JACK
                        I’d like to talk to you--

                                 ANONYMOUS (V.O.)
                        You just did.

           CLICK.  The line’s dead.  Jack looks at his watch.  12:47pm.  

           EXT.  KING STRET STATION - DAY

           AN ORNATE, ROMAN-NUMERAL CLOCK FACE high atop a brick tower, 
           clouds passing by overhead.  The time now-- 1:03.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        What’s that saying about old 
                        habits?

           INT.  KING STREET STATION - THAT MOMENT

           A TRAIN HORN SOUNDS.  BRONZE DOORS and MARBLE WAINSCOTTING.  
           A long ARCHED CORRIDOR with YAWNING GLASS SKYLIGHTS.  Jack 
           makes his way through the heavy crowds, heading toward a row 
           of storage lockers.

           JUMP CUTS:

           - QUARTERS inserted into the locker.
           - THE DOOR swinging open.
           - THE KEY snatched up by Jack.
           - THE iPOD placed inside.
           - THE DOOR swings shut.

           INT.  JACK’S RENTAL CAR (PARKED) - MOMENTS LATER

           Jack in the Sebring outside the train station.  The keys to 
           the storage locker and safe deposit box in his hand.  He 
           palms them, thinking.  Then he opens the glove box, puts both 
           keys inside.  

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        And if my anonymous patron decided 
                        to call again while I was with the 
                        Shays--

           Jack takes out his cell phone.  Sets it to SILENT.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Better to not hand over ammunition 
                        when you’re going in unarmed.

           The SYNTH-HEAVY opening of The Who’s “WON’T GET FOOLED AGAIN” 
           begins to play...
           INT.  THE POST - AFTERNOON

           THAT DIVE BAR.  A frothy beer poured out from the tap.  Jack 
           walks in, standing in the doorway.  All eyes on him.

                                 JACK
                        Looking for Todd.

           The bartender SMACKS THE WALL.  Todd enters from the back.

                                 TODD
                        Jackie Boy.  You made it.  Fucking-
                        a, right?  You want something to 
                        drink?  
                             (without waiting for Jack)
                        Fuck that.  Two Bushmills on the 
                        rocks, Ed.
                             (back to Jack)
                        We’re back in business, Jackie.  
                        Gotta have a drink.  Gotta have a 
                        fucking drink.  Let’s sit down.

           Todd leads Jack to a booth.  They slide in.  Ed’s at the bar 
           pouring the second drink--

                                 TODD
                        How ‘bout some fucking service 
                        around here, Ed?  TWO FUCKING 
                        BUSHMILLS.  

           Ed looks up, finishing the drinks, anger contained.  He 
           carries them to the table.  SLAMS THEM DOWN, whiskey spilling 
           over the edges.  Turns to go.  Todd GRABS HIS WRIST.

                                 TODD
                        Hey.  Hey, you stupid fuck.  You 
                        know who this is?  You know who 
                        you’re serving here?  This is Jack 
                        Grant, Ed.  Jack Fucking Grant.  
                        Show some respect, alright?  King 
                        of Bainbridge right here in our 
                        goddamn little dive.  

           Ed stares at them for a moment, disgusted.  He leaves.

                                 TODD
                        How you like that, Jackie Boy?  
                        Can’t get any good service anymore, 
                        huh?  Fuck, man.  Well.  Slainte.

           He raises his glass.  Jack hesitates.  Raises his.  They 
           toast.  Todd proceeds to CHUG about half his whiskey.  Wipes 
           his mouth.  Pounds the table.  

                                 TODD
                        FUCK.  Good shit.  Good shit.  So.  
                        How’ve you been?  How’s your day?  
                        See any old friends?

           Jack holds, trying to parse Todd’s question.
                                 JACK
                        Just you. 

                                 TODD
                        You excited to do this shit?

                                 JACK
                        I haven’t heard what it is we’re 
                        doing.

           Todd reaches for a basket of silverware on the table.  Pulls 
           out a STEAK KNIFE, running it across his fingertips...

                                 TODD
                        Well I’m gonna tell you, Jackie.  
                        You gotta pay attention here.  You 
                        gotta keep up with me because I’m 
                        gonna tell you and then you’ll 
                        know, right, man?  What we’re gonna 
                        do, what we’re gonna do is we are 
                        gonna find the fucking rat.  

           He stops.  Eyes up at Jack.  Locked in.  Threatening.  

                                 TODD
                        Like so.

           Suddenly SPINNING, he turns and TOSSES THE STEAK KNIFE at a 
           DART BOARD CLEAR ACROSS THE BAR, the knife BUZZING BY some 
           lowlifes playing a game, landing not far off the BULL'S-EYE.

                                 DARTS PLAYER
                        What the Christ, Todd?

                                 TODD
                        YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP.  I’m having a 
                        fucking meeting.    

           Todd reaches for his whiskey, downs the rest of the 
           Bushmills.  CHEWING ON AN ICE CUBE.  Glaring at the entire 
           bar.  And then he TOSSES his empty drink toward the dart 
           board, the GLASS SHATTERING on the wall.  Silence.

                                 TODD
                        This is my place.  MY FUCKING 
                        PLACE.  You get me?  Fucking 
                        animals.  All of you.  

           Ed shakes his head from behind the bar, comes out with a dust 
           tray and small broom.  

                                 TODD
                        That’s right.  Clean it up.  Clean 
                        it up, you stupid shit.

                                 JACK
                        What’re we doing, Todd?  

                                 TODD
                        I’m getting to it.
                                 JACK
                        No.  You’re dragging your dick 
                        across the table so everyone in 
                        here knows what you’re packing.  
                        You’re wasting my time and you’re 
                        embarrassing yourself.  So I’m 
                        asking you.  What are we doing, 
                        Todd?

                                 TODD
                        You’re lucky.  Lucky I threw that 
                        fucking knife already.  Lucky the 
                        old man wants you in on this.  

                                 JACK
                        I thank Christ each morning I live 
                        to see.

                                 TODD
                        A blessing, right, Jackie?  You 
                        wanna know what we’re doing.  I’ll 
                        tell you what we’re doing.  Cause I 
                        know, man.  I know, because I’ve 
                        got the goddamn plan.
                             (beat)
                        Aldrich.  You remember him?   

           Yeah.  Jack remembers...

           Jimmy, Milton and the wiseguys playing poker on the front 
           porch as before.  

           TRACKING IN FAST TOWARD ONE TOUGH: this is ALDRICH (here 
           30s), block-headed, hulking.  He looks up from his poker hand 
           DIRECT TO CAMERA, smiling, REVEALING ONE GOLD TOOTH...

           INT.  THE POST - AFTERNOON (2008)

           Jack and Todd in their booth.

                                 JACK
                        Used to come around in the summers.  
                        With the tooth.

                                 TODD
                        That’s him, Jackie.  Mind like 
                        that, man, you shoulda been a cop.  

                                 JACK
                        Missed my calling.

                                 TODD
                        So here’s the thing.  And I’m 
                        telling you this, right, but this 
                        goes no further.

                                 JACK
                        Who am I gonna tell, Todd?
                                 TODD
                        I’m just saying.  I’m expressing 
                        this in confidence.  In confidence, 
                        Jackie.  
                             (beat)
                        The bodies.  The bodies they dug 
                        up.  All of ‘em were put to rest by 
                        our man with the gold crown...

           QUICK FLASH CUTS of Aldrich ALL AT NIGHT:

           - OPENING A CAR TRUNK to reveal two bodies.
           - DIGGING IN THE SOFT EARTH down in a dank basement.
           - POURING LIMESTONE at a construction site.
           - THE HAUNTING FACE OF A CORPSE covered in that limestone...

           Todd leans in, beaming, conspiratorial.

                                 JACK
                        A dozen guys knew about those 
                        bodies, Todd.

                                 TODD
                        Right.  Right.  But here’s the 
                        other thing.  Aldrich don’t work 
                        for us anymore.  About three years 
                        ago, he injured himself on the 
                        job...

           EXT.  WAREHOUSE - NIGHT (2005)

           Aldrich (here 50s) LIFTS another corpse up over his shoulder.  
           He grimaces.  Then, a horrible CRACK.  He drops to his knees.

                                 ALDRICH
                        My fucking back!

           Todd continues.

                                 TODD
                        Now look.  We don’t got no 
                        workman’s comp, Jackie Boy.  That’s 
                        just the nature of the business.  
                        Motherfucker’s laid up in a 
                        hospital for a week...

           INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY (2005)

           Aldrich’s in bed drinking APPLE JUICE through a straw and 
           watching JERRY SPRINGER.

                                 TODD (V.O.)
                        Even when he got out, fucker 
                        couldn’t lift a goddamned thing.

                        So what’re we supposed to do?  We 
                        didn’t use the son of a bitch for 
                        his brains, right?

           EXT.  ALDRICH HOME - AFTERNOON (2005)

           A TAXI pulls up in front a dilapidated two-story house.  
           Aldrich gets out on crutches.  An 81-year-old woman, 
           ALDRICH’S MOTHER, watches from the porch.

                                 TODD (V.O.)
                        Poor bastard had to move back in 
                        with his mother.  You believe that?  

           INT.  THE POST - AFTERNOON (2008)

           Jack shakes his head.

                                 JACK
                        You’re telling me some guy throws 
                        his back out and decides, “I’m 
                        turning state’s.”

                                 TODD
                        We haven’t gotten to the best part, 
                        Jackie.  You ready?

           So here it is--

           INT.  ALDRICH HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (2006)

           Aldrich and his mother eat TV dinners watching WHEEL OF 
           FORTUNE.

                                 ALDRICH’S MOTHER
                        An “M,” Pat!

                                 TODD (V.O.)
                        Six months later, Aldrich’s home 
                        enjoying a meal with Mom when he 
                        hears something outside...

           And on cue, TIRES SQUEALING.  

                                 ALDRICH’S MOTHER
                        It’s those joy riders again!  I’m 
                        calling the police.

           She reaches for her BIG BUTTON TRIMLINE PHONE.  Aldrich rises 
           from his chair, hobbles over to the window.  Drawing the 
           curtain back, he looks out into the DARKNESS--

           A BLACK SEDAN SCREECHES to a stop in front of Aldrich’s.  The 
           window rolling down.  And then, THE FIRST MUZZLE FLASH.

           It’s a DRIVE BY.

           ALDRICH’S SHOULDER is HIT.  He FALLS to the floor, the GLASS 
           SHATTERING around him.  DOZENS OF SHOTS, POTTERY and DRYWALL 
           bursting, THE TV EXPLODING in a RAIN OF SPARKS.
           Aldrich lifts his head.  Looks to the recliner.  HIS MOTHER 
           SITS HEAD DOWN, EYES CLOSED, BLOOD SEEPING FROM HER ABDOMEN.  
           The big button phone dangling near the floor bouncing up and 
           down, up and down, up and down.

                                 911 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                             (faintly from handset)
                        911 Emergency.  Hello?  911 
                        Emergency...

           INT.  THE POST - AFTERNOON (2008)

           Todd leans back triumphant.

                                 TODD
                        Shot the old broad clean through 
                        the spine.  She’s in a wheelchair 
                        now.  Has to shit into a plastic 
                        bag.

                                 JACK
                        Who ordered the guns?

                                 TODD
                        Fuck if I know.  You got any idea 
                        how many people that old son of a 
                        bitch buried?  I mean fucking 
                        buried.  How many hoods with a 
                        grudge without the muscle to go 
                        after Dad?  Aldrich was the next 
                        best thing.  And this is where you 
                        come in, Jackie--  You’re gonna get 
                        him to talk.  You’re gonna hear his 
                        motherfucking confession.

                                 JACK
                        We gotta get something straight 
                        right now.  I do this for you, 
                        we’re done. 

                                 TODD
                        We call off our man.  You go back 
                        to fucking the Girl from the North 
                        Country.

                                 JACK
                        Not a hair on her goddamn head.

                                 TODD
                        Scout’s honor, Jackie.  

                                 JACK
                        And Aldrich--  if he sings.  
                        Whatever happens.  You don’t touch 
                        him until I’m gone.

                                 TODD
                        A hard fucking bargain, Jack Grant.  
                        You got a car?
           EXT.  THE POST - BACK ALLEY - AFTERNOON

           Dark and trash filled.  Jack pulls his rental up to a door by 
           a dumpster.  The door opens.  Todd comes out...

           INT.  JACK’S RENTAL CAR (PARKED/MOVING) - THAT MOMENT

           Todd get in, LIES DOWN in the back, out of sight.

                                 JACK
                        You taking a nap?

                                 TODD
                        Drive around the front again.  
                        Slowly.  But not so it looks like 
                        you’re casing the place or nothing.

           Jack puts the car in gear.  Pulls away.  Turns right.

                                 TODD
                        Check out the plain wrapper.

           EXT.  THE POST - FRONT ENTRANCE - THAT MOMENT

           Jack cruises the strip in front of the bar.  An UNMARKED CAR 
           with the TWO COPS from the funeral parked across the street.  
           Jack’s heading straight toward them--

           INT.  JACK’S RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - THAT MOMENT

           Jack WATCHES the COPS out of the corner of his eye.

                        They make you?

           EXT.  THE POST - FRONT ENTRANCE - THAT MOMENT

           ACHING SLO-MO as JACK PASSES the cop car, side-by-side.  The 
           cops looking away at the bar, oblivious.

           INT.  JACK’S RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - THAT MOMENT

           Jack looks over his shoulder to Todd.

                                 JACK
                        No.

                                 TODD
                        I gotta keep you around.  I don’t 
                        remember the last time I was out 
                        without a fucking tail.
                             (creeping up, looking at 
                              the cops)
                        Alright.  Fucking hit it, man.

           And just then, it STARTS TO RAIN.  A fine mist.

                                 TODD
                        Tut tut.  It looks like rain.
           Meanwhile in the driver’s cupholder, JACK’S PHONE LIGHTS UP, 
           UNSEEN AND STILL ON SILENT.  The caller is MOLLY.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        If I’d seen the call, would I have 
                        answered it? 

           INT.  JACK & MOLLY’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           MOLLY PACES THE BEDROOM FRANTIC holding a portable phone as 
           it RINGS over the line.

                                 MOLLY
                        Come on, come on...

           She moves hurriedly to the closet.  Opens it.  Pulls down a 
           couple of old hatboxes from the top shelf.  Stops as the 
           PHONE CLICKS--

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                             (over phone-- voicemail)
                        Hey, it’s Jack.  Leave a message.

           BEEP.  She holds in silence.  Hangs up.  FREEZE FRAME.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        And I wonder.  Even now.  If I had.  
                        Would I have been able to help?  
                        Would I have been able to change 
                        things?  
                             (beat)
                        She’d been to the grocery store.  
                        Because when they finally checked 
                        the apartment, they found all the 
                        bags.  Laid out on the table.  
                        Never put away.

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           EXT.  GROCERY STORE - DUSK - EARLIER THAT DAY

           The unnatural GREENISH GLOW of fluorescents spills onto the 
           pavement at this well-worn grocery store in Alaska.  Seagulls 
           roost on the power lines.  

           Molly exits the store pushing a cart toward her pickup.  As 
           she moves through the parking lot, she looks cautiously over 
           her right shoulder, sees it there: that ‘69 GTO, parked under 
           a burnt-out streetlight.  She watches it warily.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        So she’d seen him.  She must’ve 
                        seen him.  

           INT.  MOLLY’S TRUCK (MOVING) - MOMENTS LATER

           A deserted rural road, the suspension CREAKING and MOANING 
           uneasily with each bump she hits.  Molly looks up into her 
           rearview mirror.  The GTO is there, hanging back, its 
           headlights fixed behind her.
           EXT.  JACK & MOLLY’S APARTMENT - MINUTES LATER

           Molly’s pickup pulls up outside the apartment.  She waits for 
           a beat as the muscle car appears at the end of the street, 
           rumbling in closer, closer.  Finally, it PASSES BY and drives 
           off toward the other end of the street, its taillights 
           glowing red and then vanishing around a bend.

           INT.  JACK & MOLLY’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Molly moves quickly through the apartment carrying a grocery 
           bag, turning on the lights as she goes, entering the

           KITCHEN

           Setting the bag on the table and crossing to a tiny window 
           above the sink.  Pulling the curtains back gingerly.  Looking 
           outside at the pickup parked by the curb, alone for the 
           moment.

           And then that RUMBLING ENGINE audible in the distance.  
           Moving in, closer, closer...

           HEADLIGHTS APPEAR from around the bend.  The GTO returns, 
           idling slowly down the street, stopping about a block and 
           half away.  The headlights cut.  The red ember of a cigarette 
           GLOWING behind the windshield, foreboding.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        But I missed the call.

           BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER

           Molly on the phone, replayed exactly as above.

                                 MOLLY
                        Come on, come on...

           Going to the closet.  Taking down those hatboxes.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                             (over phone-- voicemail)
                        Hey, it’s Jack.  Leave a message.

           BEEP.  She hangs up.

           And now she reaches back onto the top shelf, the closet light 
           bulb swinging precariously, shadows crossing back and forth, 
           back and forth.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Groceries on the table and the case 
                        for my 941 open on the bed.  Empty.

           She pulls down a small black Pelican case.  Brings it over to 
           the bed.  Opens it.  Inside--  

           The gleaming nickel of a Jericho 941 9mm automatic pistol, 
           laid carefully into custom cut foam padding.  A separate 
           insert for the clip.  She holds, staring at the case.  
                                 MOLLY
                        Where are you, Jack?

           She sighs.  Waiting.  Picks the phone back up and DIALS THREE 
           DIGITS.  The LINE RINGS again.  She walks to the window as 
           she waits, looks at that black GTO, still outside.

                                 ALASKAN 911 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        911.  Please state your emergency.

           Molly silent for a moment, mouth open.  

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m sorry, I hit the speed dial.  I 
                        didn’t mean to.  I’m sorry.

           EXT.  JACK & MOLLY’S APARTMENT - DUSK

           Just moments later.  The black GTO parked near a streetlamp, 
           the cigarette ember GLOWING inside, THE DRIVER’s face still 
           obscured in darkness.  He rolls down his window, tosses the 
           cigarette out onto the curb, rolling the window back up.

           CLOSE ON THE CIGARETTE-- the end glowing fainter and fainter 
           until turning to white ash, extinguishing itself.  A beat.  
           Then, faintly, the sound of FOOTSTEPS ON THE PAVEMENT.

           REVEAL MOLLY walking up from behind the muscle car, the gun 
           tucked down in one hand at her side.  She winces, trying not 
           to shake.  Approaches the driver’s door.  KNOCKS QUICKLY at 
           the window.

           A tense beat.

           The driver turns to look at her-- his face revealed now for 
           the first time: 40s, square with deep-set eyes, a long scar 
           on his cheek, two days stubble.  He stares menacing.  Rolls 
           down his window.

                                 THE DRIVER
                        Can I help you?

                                 MOLLY
                        I wanted to ask you the same thing.

                                 THE DRIVER
                        What’s that?

                                 MOLLY
                        Yeah.  Yeah.  I wanted to--  I 
                        think you know.  I think you know, 
                        OK?

                                 THE DRIVER
                        Know what?

                                 MOLLY
                        I know.  You’ve been following me.  
                        You been parked out here and I--  I 
                        want it to stop.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MOLLY (CONT'D)
                        I want you to get in your car and I 
                        want you to leave.

                                 THE DRIVER
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about, lady.

           And he turns away from her, his face falling back into 
           shadow, seemingly ending his side of the conversation.

                                 MOLLY
                        I said, I want you to leave.

           Quickly, she draws the 941, levels it square at his face.  

                                 MOLLY
                        I want you to leave and I don’t 
                        want you to come back.

           The moment passes.  The driver back toward her, eyes 
           narrowing.  A long beat.  Too long.

           And it happens then.  His arm moving up, FAST, TOO FAST TO 
           REGISTER and he CHOPS Molly’s wrist into the side of the 
           door, the gun FALLING from her hand.

           She SCREAMS, jumps back, reaching down to pick up the 9mm 
           when he SWINGS HIS DOOR OPEN, BLINDSIDING HER.  She TUMBLES 
           BACK, collapsing, a cut across her face, spitting, trying to 
           gain her bearings as he steps out of the car, his heavy steel-
           toed boot coming down hard on the pistol.  

           She scrambles, starts to run toward the back of the car--

           BUT HE’S FASTER, picking up the 941 now by the barrel, 
           holding it club-like and racing up behind her, GRABBING HER, 
           TACKLING HER to the ground.  As they fall, Molly SLAMS into 
           the trunk of the car, one of the TAILLIGHTS CRACKING, red 
           plastic raining down into the dirt.

                                 THE DRIVER
                        That was vintage.

           She tries to SCREAM AGAIN as his hand covers her mouth--

           She BITES DOWN HARD, drawing blood.  

           And that’s it.  He PISTOL WHIPS her with the 941.  She SHUTS 
           DOWN, goes limp in his arms...

           INT.  JACK’S RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - AFTERNOON

           REPLAY: TIGHT ON JACK’S CELL in the cupholder, lighting up as 
           Molly’s call comes up.  And then the phone goes dark.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        I missed her call.  And I think it 
                        was then, in that moment, that all 
                        hell broke loose.  I just hadn’t 
                        gotten the message yet.
           EXT.  ALDRICH HOME - FRONT PORCH - DUSK

           RAIN FALLS at a steady clip now.  Back at that two-story 
           disaster, even worse for wear if such a thing is possible.  
           The FRONT WINDOW covered in PLYWOOD-- never fixed from the 
           drive-by.

           Jack on the porch shaking off the rain.  He presses the 
           DOORBELL.  A long beat.  He looks off over his shoulder, his 
           rental parked out of sight two blocks away.

           CREAKING as the door opens.  Aldrich standing in a bathrobe.  

                                 ALDRICH
                        Can I help you?

                                 JACK
                        Aldrich.

           Aldrich’s eyes narrow.  Remembering.

                                 ALDRICH
                        No.  It can’t be--  Milton’s Jack 
                        all grown up.  

           In the background a KETTLE begins to WHISTLE.

           INT.  ALDRICH HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           FILTH & POVERTY.  Dishes piled in the sink.  A huge stack of 
           NEWSPAPERS propping open a door leading down into the 
           BASEMENT.  Jack pausing there by the stairs, looking away 
           into darkness as Aldrich fusses over a KETTLE by the stove.

           Aldrich’s mother at the vinyl kitchen table, doddering in her 
           wheelchair.  Jack hesitantly sits next to her. 

                                 ALDRICH
                        Just in time for tea, Jack.  Every 
                        afternoon, rain or shine, we’ve 
                        gotta have our tea.  

                                 ALDRICH’S MOTHER
                        Hello.

                                 JACK
                        Hello, Mrs. Aldrich.

                                 ALDRICH’S MOTHER
                        Hello.

                                 ALDRICH
                        She can go on like that for hours.

                                 ALDRICH’S MOTHER
                        Hello.

                                 ALDRICH
                        Just ignore her.
                                 ALDRICH’S MOTHER
                        Just ignore her.

           Aldrich brings over THREE MUGS of tea.  Sets one down in 
           front of his mother, one in front of Jack.

                                 ALDRICH
                        Jack, you’ll want a little pick-me-
                        up with that, yes?

                                 JACK
                        Oh, I think I’m--

           But Aldrich’s already got a SILVER FLASK out of his robe 
           pocket, uncapping it, POURING A GENEROUS TILT OF WHISKEY into 
           Jack’s tea.  STILL POURING.

                                 JACK
                        When.

                                 ALDRICH’S MOTHER
                        Hello!

                                 ALDRICH
                        Mom.  Enough.  For Christ’s sake.

           And he turns to his mug now, pouring even more whiskey in 
           than he gave Jack and taking an extra nip off the flask. 

                                 ALDRICH
                        I gotta tell you.  We don’t get a 
                        lot of company around here.

                                 ALDRICH’S MOTHER
                             (leans into Jack, hushed)
                        Hello.  You’re handsome.

                                 ALDRICH
                        MOM.  JESUS.

           He SLAMS the table.  His mother staring off into space, 
           scooping up her tea cup in both hands, taking a long sip.

                                 ALDRICH
                        I heard about your dad.  My 
                        condolences.  He was always good to 
                        me.  Always treated me right.
                             (beat)
                        Christ.  Look at you, Jack.  I 
                        remember--  You didn’t come up to 
                        my thigh.  Skinny little 
                        motherfucker.

                        to?  I look up, I can’t stand 
                        straight anymore and I don’t even 
                        know why.  Can’t read the Mariners 
                        box score without goddamned 
                        glasses, can’t piss in a straight 
                        line.  This--  This is what you’ve 
                        got ahead of you and don’t think it 
                        won’t come.  It’ll come to you too, 
                        Jack, and there’s nothing you can 
                        do.

                                 JACK
                        I been gone a long time.

                                 ALDRICH
                        You should hear the stories, Jack.  
                        The stories they tell about you.  
                        Grows like a fucking fish, the 
                        money you took off the old man.  
                        Like robbing Fort Knox--

           Jack looks away.

                                 ALDRICH
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t mean--

                                 JACK
                        It’s fine, Aldrich.  I--  If I 
                        could take back what I did.

                                 ALDRICH
                        If we could take back what we done, 
                        Jack, I wouldn’t be living with my 
                        mother in a fucking slum on Capitol 
                        Hill.  Right?

                                 JACK
                        That’s kind of why I’m here.

           The two men make eye contact.  Sussing out the unspoken.

                                 ALDRICH’S MOTHER
                        He’s handsome.

                                 ALDRICH
                        Why are you here, Jack?

                                 JACK
                        Dad--  Milton.  He...  Listen.  I 
                        heard what happened to you.  How 
                        they crossed you out, right?  And I 
                        know Dad never had a bad word to 
                        say about you.  Never.  And I know 
                        what it’s like to have things taken 
                        away by Jimmy Shay.   

           Aldrich’s eyes glistening.  Like someone gets him.
                                 JACK
                        I’ve come home, Aldrich and I--  
                        I’ve come into some money I never 
                        expected to get, you understand?  
                        This is company money.  Jimmy 
                        Shay’s money.  I took it once.  You 
                        know it, everyone knows it and what 
                        the hell, it didn’t solve my 
                        problems.  Didn’t bring anyone 
                        back, in fact they keep going.  
                        They keep passing away.

           He looks at Aldrich’s mom.  How much of this is genuine?  

                                 JACK
                        So this is what I’m telling you.  
                        You understand?  I want to right 
                        some of the wrongs that’ve been 
                        done in this godforsaken city.  
                        Only what’s fair.  So what do you 
                        think would be fair, Aldrich?

           Is he really saying this?  Aldrich stares down into his cup.

                                 ALDRICH
                        Most days, I drink until I can’t 
                        drink no more.  Then I go to sleep.  
                        And then I get up and do it all 
                        over again.

                                 JACK
                        What they’ve done to you isn’t 
                        right.  So what would make it 
                        right?  Ten thousand dollars?

                                 ALDRICH
                        Ten thou---  You’re--

                                 JACK
                        Fifteen.  This isn’t my money.  
                        This is Jimmy’s money and I want to 
                        make things right.

                                 ALDRICH
                        Fifteen.  Jack...

                                 JACK
                        Fifteen.  It’s done.  It’s yours.

                                 ALDRICH
                        Jack...

                                 ALDRICH’S MOTHER
                        Jackpot!

                                 ALDRICH
                        You don’t have to do this.
                                 JACK
                        I want to do this.  OK?  I want to.  
                        But I--  I need to ask you 
                        something.  I...  I been away and I 
                        come back.  And Jimmy’s on trial 
                        and maybe it’s finally...  
                             (beat)
                        A cop’s been by.  Showed up at the 
                        funeral, Aldrich.  Comes to me.  
                        Asking me to talk.  To turn 
                        state’s...  But I can’t.  Right?  I 
                        can’t.

                                 ALDRICH
                        They’d kill you, Jack.  

                                 JACK
                        But that’s not even it, is it?

                                 ALDRICH
                        They’d kill you.  Ten years ago, 
                        I’d’ve killed you.  Wouldn’t have 
                        batted a fucking eye.

           Jack looks around the kitchen.  The squalor of all it all.  

                                 ALDRICH
                        My father told me.  When I was a 
                        kid.  We were living back east 
                        then, Pittsburg.  He said to me, I 
                        remember this...  It’s funny the 
                        shit that sticks when so much else 
                        is gone.  He says to me.  He says.  
                        “Kid, you gotta know, a man don’t 
                        say nothing to nobody about his 
                        business.”  His business, he said.  
                        A man.  That’s about right, ain’t 
                        it?  Cause no matter what we done, 
                        no matter what Jimmy’s done to us---  
                        I ain’t no pig and I ain’t no 
                        fucking stoolie.  I know what I 
                        done.  I know the choices I made.  
                        And a man don’t talk to nobody 
                        about his business.  

                                 JACK
                        You’re right.

           Aldrich half-laughs.

                                 ALDRICH
                        I’m right.  I’m a dinosaur.  A 
                        fucking relic.

                                 ALDRICH’S MOTHER
                        Fucking relic.

                                 JACK
                        Aldrich.  I gotta ask you something 
                        else.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        And I want you to look at me.  Look 
                        at me and I just need you to answer 
                        me.  Honestly.

           Aldrich anxious.  Senses the turn.

                                 JACK
                        We haven’t--  When’s the last time 
                        we spoke?  You and I.  Before 
                        today. 

                                 ALDRICH
                        Christ, Jack.  I dunno.  Jesus, 
                        that’s going back, what?  Gotta be 
                        fifteen years or more, right?  I’d 
                        come over to house, you were so 
                        busy with school--

                                 JACK
                        School.

                                 ALDRICH
                        Yeah, Jack.  School.  You remember 
                        school.  You were good at it.

                                 JACK
                        I remember.  So.  We haven’t spoken 
                        on the phone.

                                 ALDRICH
                        What the hell are you talking 
                        about, Jack?

                                 JACK
                        This morning.  Or this afternoon.

                                 ALDRICH
                        Is this a joke?  Cause I don’t get 
                        it, alright?

                                 ALDRICH’S MOTHER
                        Knock knock!

           A long silence.

                                 JACK
                        Aldrich, I’m--  I’m sorry for what 
                        they’ve done.

           EXT.  ALDRICH HOME - EVENING

           The rain has stopped.  Todd leans against Jack’s rental 
           smoking a cigarette.  Watches as Jack walks down the block 
           from Aldrich’s, hands in his pockets.  Head down.

                                 TODD
                        So?

           Jack walks up to the car.  A little shaken.  Taciturn.
                                 TODD
                        SO?

                                 JACK
                        It wasn’t him, Todd.

                                 TODD
                        Whaddya you mean it wasn’t him?

                                 JACK
                        Listen to me.  I talked to him.  I 
                        know.

                                 TODD
                        You know?  What the fuck do you 
                        know, Jackie Boy?

                                 JACK
                        I know it wasn’t him.  

           Todd FLICKS HIS CIGARETTE to the curb staring deadly at Jack.

           FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

           Todd’s FUMING at the front door, RINGING ALDRICH’S DOORBELL 
           over and over and over and over.  Jack jogs up the front 
           steps, still twenty paces behind--

                                 JACK
                        Todd--

                                 TODD
                        SHUT THE FUCK UP, JACK.

           Back to ringing the doorbell.  Again.  Again.  Again.  Jack’s 
           there now, just as the DOOR OPENS---  Aldrich stands stunned.

                                 ALDRICH
                        Todd?

           Suddenly, Todd draws a PISTOL.  

                                 TODD
                             (to Aldrich)
                        You double-crossing shit.

           And he SMACKS ALDRICH SQUARE IN THE FACE with the muzzle of 
           the gun.  Pushing his way into the house...

           INT.  ALDRICH HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Aldrich bleeds from his nose...

                                 ALDRICH
                        Jack?  What the fuck?!

                                 TODD
                        What the fuck?  WHAT THE FUCK?  
                        YOU’RE ASKING ME, BUDDY?
           Jack enters the house as Todd raises the gun again, marching 
           forward, Aldrich retreating as they continue on to the

           KITCHEN

           Aldrich’s mother in her wheelchair, confused.  Aldrich 
           stumbles in, knocking over dishes, CRASHING TO THE FLOOR.

                                 TODD
                        You think you can get away with it?

                                 ALDRICH
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about--

                                 JACK
                        Todd.  What’re you doing?

                                 TODD
                        SHUT THE FUCK UP, JACKIE.

                                 JACK
                        We had a deal--

                                 ALDRICH
                        A deal?  What’s he--  What’re you--

                                 TODD
                        SHUT UP.  SHUT UP.  SHUT.  THE 
                        FUCK.  UP.  BOTH OF YOU.

                                 ALDRICH’S MOTHER
                             (to Todd)
                        You’re not handsome.

                                 TODD
                        What?

                                 ALDRICH’S MOTHER
                        You’re not handsome.

           Todd spins, point the gun at Aldrich’s mother and FIRES INTO 
           HER KNEECAP.  A SPRAY OF BLOOD.  She SCREAMS.  All at once--

                                 JACK
                        TODD.  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?

                                 TODD
                        Shut the fuck up, Jack.
                             (back to Aldrich)
                        You think you can fucking talk?  
                        You think you can fucking rat on 
                        the fucking family?!?  IS THAT WHAT 
                        YOU FUCKING THINK?!?

           Aldrich’s mother SCREAMS, clutching her BLEEDING KNEE.

                                 ALDRICH
                        It wasn’t me, Todd.  I didn’t--  
                        Jack--  Jack knows.  JACK!
           Todd’s inches away from Aldrich now.  The gun to his temple.

                                 JACK
                        Todd.  Don’t.  He didn’t--

                                 TODD
                        Open your mouth.  Open your mouth 
                        to talk.

                                 JACK
                        Todd.  Stop it.  

                                 TODD
                        OPEN YOUR FUCKING MOUTH.

           Aldrich’s CRYING NOW.  Trembling.  Slowly opens his mouth.  
           Todd PUSHES the barrel of the pistol in, CLACKING against his 
           teeth.  Aldrich GAGS.

                                 JACK
                        TODD--

           Jack begins to RUSH toward TODD, who turns, glancing over his 
           shoulder and then back to Aldrich, makes eye contact.

                                 TODD
                        Say goodnight, sweet prince.

           And Todd PULLS THE TRIGGER.  The back of Aldrich’s head 
           EXPLODES in a JET of BLOOD AND GORE.  

           Todd spins.  Gun trained on Jack.

                                 JACK
                        We had a deal.

                                 TODD
                        A deal?  A FUCKING DEAL?!?

           In the distance, an unmistakable sound.  SIRENS. 

                                 ALDRICH’S MOTHER
                        Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus 
                        tecum.  Benedicta tu in mulieribus, 
                        et benedictus fructus...

                                 TODD
                        You hear that, Jack?  YOU HEAR 
                        THAT?

                                 ALDRICH’S MOTHER
                        ...ventris tui, Iesus.  Sancta 
                        Maria, Mater Dei, ora pro nobis 
                        peccatoribus, nun, et in hora 
                        mortis nostrae...

           Todd grabs her wheelchair, pushing her toward to the 
           basement.
                                 JACK
                        JESUS, TODD.

                                 ALDRICH’S MOTHER
                        Amen.

           And with a final HEAVE, Todd sends the wheelchair RATTLING 
           DOWN the STAIRS, a CACOPHONY OF METAL against WOOD.  
           Aldrich’s mother SCREAMING.  And then.  SILENT.  

           The SIRENS in the distance growing louder.

                                 JACK
                        We had a deal--

           Todd raises his gun.  Aims it squarely at Jack’s head.

                                 TODD
                        And I fucking broke it.  You’re 
                        driving.

           INT.  JACK’S RENTAL CAR (PARKED/MOVING) - SECONDS LATER

           Jack’s hand shaking, he INSERTS THE KEY into the ignition.  
           Todd’s GUN TO HIS HEAD.  And A POLICE CRUISER on the HORIZON 
           MOVING IN FROM THE SOUTH.  FOUR BLOCKS OUT.  THREE. 

                                 TODD
                        COME ON, COME ON.

           The Sebring turns over.  The black & white TWO BLOCKS OUT--

                                 JACK
                        Where am I going?

           ONE BLOCK--

                                 TODD
                        FUCK.  REVERSE IT.  

           And Jack JAMS THE GEARSHIFT DOWN, TIRES SPINNING...

           EXT.  ALDRICH HOME - THAT MOMENT

           The Sebring LURCHES BACKWARDS as the CRUISER ARRIVES, now 
           REDIRECTING, CHASING the Sebring as it HURTLES IN REVERSE up 
           the street HEADING NORTH.  The noses of the cars touching.

           The cruiser ACCELERATES, RAMMING the Sebring.  

           INT.  JACK’S RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - THAT MOMENT

           Jack struggles to MAINTAIN CONTROL as the cops RAM them 
           again.  

           MORE SIRENS SOUND behind them.

                                 TODD
                        You hear that?
           EXT.  CAPITOL HILL - THAT MOMENT

           OVERHEAD as Jack’s car speeds uphill, the cops still nose-to-
           nose.  And as they near a FOUR-WAY INTERSECTION, a SECOND 
           CRUISER ROARS IN from the WEST, PERPENDICULAR, forming the 
           top of a “T.” CLOSING OFF Jack’s escape route--

           INT.  JACK’S RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - THAT MOMENT

           Jack SPINS THE WHEEL, trying to slice past the new squad car.  
           And then, EVEN MORE SIRENS...

           EXT.  CAPITOL HILL - THAT MOMENT

           A third black & white SCREAMS IN from the EAST heading dead-
           on toward the SECOND CRUISER, CLOSING FAST, the GAP NARROWING 
           BETWEEN THEM and THREATENING TO CLOSE JACK’S EXIT.

           INT.  JACK’S RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - THAT MOMENT

           Jack GRINDS THE WHEEL back, the Sebring SQUEEZING BETWEEN THE 
           HOODS of these two latest responders.  SPARKS in the air.  He 
           reaches for the EMERGENCY BRAKE, PULLS IT---

           EXT.  CAPITOL HILL - THAT MOMENT

           The Sebring SPINS 180˚ as the FIRST CRUISER T-BONES the 
           THIRD, SIDE IMPACT, the cars FUSED and SLIDING across the 
           PAVEMENT toward a STREETLIGHT, hitting it, the fixture 
           TOPPLING as the ENTIRE LIGHT POLE ARCS TOWARD THE GROUND---

           INT.  JACK’S RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - THAT MOMENT

           HAND ON THE GEARSHIFT, Jack punches it from REVERSE to DRIVE.  
           Foot to the gas, SPEEDING FORWARD.

                                 TODD
                        LIGHT, LIGHT, LIGHT!

           He looks, sees the LIGHT TUMBLING DOWN.  TOO LATE---

           EXT.  CAPITOL HILL - THAT MOMENT

           The street lamp LANDS HARD on the hood of the Sebring, the 
           LIGHT BREAKING OFF and CRASHING THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD---

           INT.  JACK’S RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - THAT MOMENT

           The light SHOOTS into the Sebring, GLOWING YELLOW MERCURY, 
           landing between Jack and Todd, FLICKERING and then dark. 

                                 JACK
                        Clear the windshield.

           Todd PUNCHES OUT the hanging spiderworks of glass blocking 
           Jack’s view with the butt of his pistol.

           Jack’s eyes to the rearview.  LIGHTS strike up from behind, 
           RED & BLUE, that patriotic strobe.
           EXT.  CAPITOL HILL - THAT MOMENT

           The remaining cruiser PUNCHES HARD into a turn, chasing 
           Jack’s Sebring nose-to-tail.

           I/E.  JACK’S RENTAL CAR (MOVING) / CAPITOL HILL - THAT MOMENT

           Jack SPEEDS down the street, IN AND OUT of traffic, narrowly 
           missing cars, pedestrians.  The cops hot on his tail.  

           Todd looks over his shoulder wide-eyed.

                                 TODD
                        Fuck, Jackie.  FUCK.  This is some 
                        big-time, shit.  You get me?

           Jack doesn’t answer, STEERING, SWERVING.  HORNS sound.

                                 TODD
                        You know what we need?  You know 
                        what we need?  Some fucking music, 
                        man.  Check it.

           And Todd leans down, turns on the car stereo, channel 
           surfing: NPR, RAP, A HAND SOAP COMMERCIAL and then...

           “GIMME SHELTER” by the Stones.  Mick launches into the vocal. 

                                 TODD
                        This is what I’m talking about!

           Jack’s eyes on the rearview.  On the road.  SWERVING.  
           MISSING.  And Todd begins to drum along on the dashboard with 
           the barrel of his gun.

                                 TODD
                             (singing)
                        ...if I don’t get some shelter/ 
                        Ooh, yeah/ I’m gonna fade away/ 
                        War, children, it’s just a shot 
                        away!

           Jack looks over.  Angry.  Goes for the VOLUME knob.  Todd 
           GRABS his wrist.  

                                 TODD
                        Don’t.  Fucking.  Touch it.  Sing 
                        it with me, Jackie.
                             (singing)
                        Rape, murder/ It’s just a shot 
                        away/ It’s just a shot away!

           Jack’s not singing, focussed on driving, on the cops just a 
           car length behind.  Todd presses the gun to Jack’s temple.

                                 TODD
                        FUCKING SING.

           And they do.
                                 JACK & TODD
                        Rape, murder/ It’s just a shot 
                        away/ It’s just a shot away!

           Looming overhead, a BLOCK OUT-- a traffic light turns yellow.

                                 TODD
                        HIT IT, JACKIE.

           Jack looks back at the cops, ahead as the LIGHT TURNS RED.  
           His foot to the gas.  And they burst into the intersection as

           A CARGO VAN--

           enters from the right, SLAMMING into the Sebring’s quarter-
           panel.  The side of the car crumpling, the car fishtailing.

           THE PURSUING CRUISER--

           HITTING THE BRAKES, screeching to a halt.  SMOKE IN THE AIR.

           THE SEBRING’S TIRES--

           SPINNING FUTILELY on the wet pavement as Jack hits the gas 
           again.  More RANCID SMOKE in the air.  The tread on the right 
           rear tire wearing down, WEARING THIN.

           The tires finally find traction.  Jack GUNS IT, grabs the 
           EMERGENCY BRAKE, swinging, turning, heading down a hill.  

                                 TODD
                        THAT’S WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT!!!

           Jack looks into the rearview as the cop car GIVES CHASE.

           OUTSIDE, THE RIGHT REAR TIRE--

           Parts of the tread PEELING OFF, beginning to SEPARATE.  

           JACK’S EYES--

           up to the rearview, watching the sirens, watching the smoke.

                                 TODD
                        Gimme, gimme shelter/ Or I’m gonna 
                        fade away...

           THAT TREAD--

           SPLITS OPEN, the black peels of rubber flying out as the car 
           SLAMS DOWN ONTO THE RIM, SPARKS INTO THE AIR.  A rain of 
           embers like the Fourth of July.

           TODD LOOKS BACK--

           worried now.  Sees the sparks.  Feels the heat.

                                 TODD
                        JACKIE!
                                 JACK
                        I see it.

           Still WEAVING IN AND OUT OF TRAFFIC, OTHER CARS COLLIDING to 
           avoid JACK’S WINDING ROUTE as he SPEEDS DOWNHILL on three 
           tires, SPARKS FLYING, THE CAR SHAKING, SHAKING...

           INT.  POLICE CRUISER (MOVING) - THAT MOMENT

           Two silhouetted FACELESS COPS watch the RAIN OF SPARKS as 
           Jack races down the hill.

                                 COP ON THE RADIO
                        Suspect has lost his right rear 
                        tire...

           I/E.  JACK’S RENTAL CAR (MOVING) / CAPITOL HILL - THAT MOMENT

           Jack SPEEDS THROUGH another red light.  Todd muttering under 
           his breath, nearly unintelligible...

                                 TODD
                        ...come on come on motherfuckers 
                        motherfucking cocksucking cunts...

           THE WHEEL WELL--

           more sparks airborne as the rim spins round and round, the 
           WORST GRINDING NOISE, METAL on ASPHALT going 60 MPH, like a 
           HUNDRED NAILS DOWN A CHALKBOARD.  And then, suddenly, the 
           heat, the embers, ALL TOO MUCH---

           The passenger side of the car ERUPTS IN THE FLAMES.

           JACK & TODD LOOK BACK--

           eyes wide as the FLAMES GROW, LICKING UP in the night sky.

                                 TODD
                        The car’s on fire.  The fucking 
                        car’s on fire.

           He turns to look out the windshield as Jack peers back still 
           staring at the FLAMES, at the COPS--

                                 TODD
                        JACK!!!

           Jack’s head snaps forward.  Sees it TOO LATE--

           A LUMBERING CITY BUS--

           crawling across the next intersection.  No way to avoid it, 
           seconds from impact.  

           THE EMERGENCY BRAKE--

           Jack GRABS IT AGAIN, spinning the wheel, another 180˚ turn in 
           the night as the COPS COME SCREAMING IN.  
           Jack hitting the accelerator, the rim SCRAPING THE PAVEMENT 
           as the FIRE GROWS, FLAMES AGAINST THE REAR WINDSHIELD NOW.

           THE GLASS--

           of the windshield WARPING, BUBBLING in the heat, EXPLODING 
           INWARD as Jack heads back up the hill, the way they’d come.  
           And the STONES STILL ROCKING OUT ON THE STEREO.

                                 JACK
                        What now?  

           The POLICE CRUISER KICKS INTO GEAR behind them.  The FLAMES 
           growing ever LARGER.

                                 JACK
                        THIS THING’S GONNA FUCKING BLOW.

                                 TODD
                        OK!  OK!  Right, right, right, the 
                        fucking sidestreet!!!

           Jack BANGS A HARD TURN, A NARROW STREET, missing a JOGGER.  
           People SCREAMING.  The police closing in.  Then another set 
           of SIRENS.  And another.  THREE CRUISERS IN THE CHASE NOW.

                                 JACK
                        We gotta stop, Todd.

           Todd’s gun to Jack’s head.

                                 TODD
                        No, Jackie.

                                 JACK
                        You wanna die in this car?!

                                 TODD
                        THERE.  THAT ALLEY.  LEFT.

           Jack sees it.  Even narrower than the street they’re on...

           THE ALLEYWAY--

           unlit, a festering heap of trash and filth.  The Sebring 
           turns in HARD, the FLAMES now SCORCHING the brick buildings 
           on either side.  The alleyway not more than a CAR WIDTH wide.

           The police cars STREAM IN behind them, an orderly line.

           A DUMPSTER--

           filled to capacity, blocking their path.  Jack looks back at 
           the flames, forward at the dumpster.  The opening not quite 
           wide enough.  HE FLOORS IT, RAMMING THE DUMPSTER, the TRASH 
           IGNITING IN FLAMES, the driver’s side of the car SHEARED OFF.  

           THE POLICE CARS--

           stopping short at the BURNING DUMPSTER blocking their path.
           TODD & JACK LOOK BACK--

           sees the cops have stopped their pursuit.  Eyes wide. 

                                 TODD
                        WE DID IT!  WE FUCKING DID IT!

           And Todd turns around.  SURPRISED TO SEE...

           A BRICK WALL--

           looming ahead.  The alley DEAD ENDS.  No way out.

                                 TODD
                        JAC---------

           THE SEBRING SLAMS INTO THE BRICK WALL AT FULL BLAST, the nose 
           crumpling, METAL AND GLASS COMPACTING DOWN TO NOTHING as Todd 
           and Jack both FLY FORWARD, Jack’s head CRACKING against the 
           steering wheel, a SPRAY OF BLOOD.  

           NEW FLAMES.  The Sebring’s engine on fire.

           BY THE DUMPSTER--

           the cops begin to exit their cruisers on foot.  Guns drawn.  
           Radios on.  The SQUAWK of the police band.

           AT THE SEBRING--

           Todd stirs first.  Jack’s head still against the steering 
           wheel.  Blood pouring out, dripping down, an endless stream.

                                 TODD
                        Jack? 

           MEANWHILE, DOWN THE ALLEY--

           the cops inch forward, guns ready, taking cover behind the 
           dumpster.  See the flames ahead but can’t quite make out the 
           crashed Sebring.

           TODD--

           leans over Jack, looking at the blood.  The unfocussed eyes.

                                 TODD
                        What can I say?  You gave it your 
                        all, Jackie.  God bless.

           And with a RATTLING OF GLASS, he’s out of the car, rushing 
           toward a fire escape, scaling up up up over the brick wall, 
           disappearing into the night.

           JACK LIES BLEEDING--

           head down.  Eyes wincing from the heat.  From the FIRE 
           ROARING AROUND HIM.  His hand shaking, he reaches for his 
           seatbelt.  Unbuckles it.  A long beat.  The FIRE RAGING.  
           Jack’s breathing LABORED.  
           His hand to the DOOR HANDLE.  CLASPS IT.  HOT FROM THE FIRE.  
           HIS FLESH SIZZLES.  HE SCREAMS.  PULLS THE DOOR OPEN.  
           Falling out into the alley, bleeding, turning down to his 
           hand, a WELTED BLISTERING BURN FRESH ACROSS HIS PALM.

           THE POLICE RUSHING IN--

           guns drawn.  Trained on him.  Stopping fifty feet away.

           Jack, bloodied, drags himself down the alley.  The gash on 
           his forehead still bleeding.  Glass riddling his face.

           Shaking, he begins to right himself.  Pushing himself onto 
           his knees.  Looking at the cops.  At the guns. 

           Slowly he bring his hands behind his head.  Surrendering.  
           Opens his mouth as if to speak.  Says nothing.  Instead, 
           flashes a rueful ruddy grin, his teeth DARK WITH BLOOD.  

           One of the cops NODS to another.  He lowers his gun, takes a 
           PAIR OF HANDCUFFS from his belt.  And then...

           THE SEBRING EXPLODES--

           the shell of the rental flying ten feet off the pavement, a 
           rain of glass and metal showering down into the alley as Jack 
           waits hands behind his head for arrest.  For capture.

           The cops shielding their eyes from the heat of the blast.  
           And now, finally, they MOVE IN--

                                 ARRESTING COP
                        GET DOWN!  DOWN ON THE PAVEMENT!  
                        ARMS BEHIND YOUR BACK!

           And what else can he do?  So he falls as they swarm him, 
           cuffs out, cuffs on, the satisfying METAL CLICK as they lock 
           down, the flames still glowing orange and ominous...

           TIGHT ON THE WRECKAGE--

           There on the pavement.  The keys for the safe deposit box and 
           the storage locker WARPING and MELTING in the fire.

           INT.  JACK’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           DETECTIVE FRANK ENLEY (40s, paunchy, bad mustache) flips 
           through gory crime scene photos of Aldrich and his mother, 
           showing them to Jack who lies in a hospital bed bandaged, 
           cornered.  A beat cop standing guard in the doorway.

                                 ENLEY
                        This looking familiar?  Any of this 
                        looking fucking familiar?  We got 
                        you leaving the scene, Jack.  So 
                        look.  You wanna help yourself, you 
                        gotta help me.  Help me understand 
                        what was going on in that house.  
                             (beat)
                        I’m gonna make a bet with you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ENLEY (CONT'D)
                             (points to the photos)
                        A mess like this, I’ll bet even 
                        money we get your clothes back from 
                        the lab, we get that shirt back, 
                        have ourselves a look, whaddya 
                        think the chances are that yours is 
                        the only blood I find on there?  
                        Not too good, killer.  Am I right?  
                        OF COURSE I’M FUCKING RIGHT.

                                 JACK
                        Dave Bannion.

                                 ENLEY
                        Excuse me?

                                 JACK
                        Dave Bannion.  With the FBI.  
                        Working the Shay case.

                                 ENLEY
                        And I fucking care...?

                                 JACK
                        I wanna talk to him.  
                             (beat)
                        I’ll only talk to him.

           IN DARKNESS--

           A faint BLUE LIGHT visible somewhere overhead.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        As things turned out, it was the 
                        wrong call to make.  But I couldn’t 
                        see it.  I had gone for the bait.  
                        Blind.  All that was left was for 
                        them to haul the goddamned line.

           REVEAL the craggy bottom of the Bering Strait sea floor.  
           Underwater.  And looming in the distance: a CRAB TRAP, filled 
           with dozens of Alaskan King Crabs, claws lunging, snapping, 
           writhing, trying to find their way out...

           INT.  SEATTLE DINER - NIGHT

           A half-eaten plate of very greasy steak & eggs.  A newspaper 
           crossword puzzle.  A brown mug filled with coffee.  

           Bannion sits at the diner counter.  He picks up the coffee, 
           sips it.  To the WAITER clearing plates nearby--

                                 BANNION
                        Hey.  Nine letters.  “Oedipal 
                        offense.”

                                 WAITER
                        Patricide.
           Bannion snaps his fingers.  Begins to pencil it in.  Then his 
           CELL PHONE RINGS.  He pulls it out of his jacket pocket.

                                 BANNION
                        Bannion speaking.
                             (a long beat)
                        Slow down.  Slow down.  Where is 
                        he?

           EXT.  STREET CORNER PHONE BOOTH - MINUTES LATER

           QUARTERS INSERTED into a slot in a phone booth.  Bannion 
           stands inside, dials a number.  A street-sweeper lumbers by 
           in the darkness.  The line RINGING.  RINGING.  Finally...

                                 JIMMY (V.O.)
                        Yeah.

                                 BANNION
                        What the fuck is this?

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT.  JIMMY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT

           Jimmy in an expansive modern kitchen: stainless steel and 
           marble counters.  He watches CNBC on a tiny countertop TV, 
           drinking a glass of red wine and eating a fish-and-rice dish.  
           Earl Howser with him, eating an identical meal, wordless.

                                 JIMMY
                        Bannion?

                                 BANNION (V.O.)
                        He’s in the hospital?  

                                 JIMMY
                        I’m eating.  You always call me 
                        with this fucking bullshit when I’m 
                        trying to sit down--

                                 BANNION (V.O.)
                        The fucking hospital and they’ve 
                        got him under armed fucking guard--

                                 JIMMY
                        This shit I eat, Dave, all lean 
                        protein and none of the stuff I 
                        like, no potatoes, no bread, no 
                        pasta.  They say, “You can have 
                        rice.  You can have couscous.”  
                        What the fuck is couscous?  I can’t 
                        taste a fucking thing.  What I 
                        wouldn’t give for a porterhouse and 
                        a shaker of goddamn salt.

                                 BANNION (V.O.)
                        What’re you--  You’re telling me 
                        about your goddamned diet?
                                 JIMMY
                        Yeah.  I’m telling you about my 
                        goddamned motherfucking diet.  And 
                        you’re telling me--

           He pulls a slender FISH BONE from his mouth.  

                                 BANNION (V.O.)
                        I’m telling you I got a call that 
                        Grant’s in the hospital and they’re 
                        holding him on a murder rap. 

                                 JIMMY
                        Sounds serious.

                                 BANNION (V.O.)
                        This wasn’t the plan, Jimmy.  We 
                        said scare him a little.  Shake him 
                        up.  

                                 JIMMY
                        He called you, didn’t he?

                                 BANNION (V.O.)
                        Yeah.  He fucking called me.  But I 
                        gotta--  Look.  This changes 
                        things.  It’s gonna be harder to 
                        get him out of there.  I’m gonna 
                        have to--  I’m gonna have to take 
                        him into custody and...

                                 JIMMY
                        These are details.  You talk to me 
                        about details.  I don’t know 
                        details from Adam.  Am I a cop?  A 
                        fucking pig?  This is your 
                        operation, boy-o.  So the call’s 
                        come in, right?  So it’s tonight.  
                        Because Little Jack wants to spill 
                        his guts.  So it’s fucking tonight.

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT.  STREET CORNER PHONE BOOTH - THAT MOMENT

           Bannion fussing in the phone booth, looking out into the 
           night, unwrapping a roll of Tums, chewing on a handful.

                                 BANNION
                        I want double what we agreed on.

           Silence from the other end.  Is Jimmy still there?

                                 JIMMY (V.O.)
                        We’ll talk about it when it’s done.  
                        Tonight.  

           INT.  JIMMY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT

           Jimmy HANGS UP the phone, disgusted.  A KNOCK at the door.
                                 JIMMY
                        WHAT?!?

           The door swings open ever so slowly.  REVEAL TODD standing 
           there bloodied and sweating, his clothes torn and ragged.

                                 JIMMY
                        What happened to you?

                                 TODD
                        Aldrich’s dead.

                                 JIMMY
                        And our other problem?

                                 TODD
                        I dunno.  Things got a little out 
                        of hand.

                                 JIMMY
                        Out of hand?  Fuck you, Todd.  FUCK 
                        YOU.  You don’t know, you don’t 
                        know fucking shit.  You find out, 
                        you got me?  You find out and then 
                        you come to me so I’m not asking 
                        you these goddamned questions.  A 
                        fucking child would know better. 

                                 TODD
                        I’ll find out.  I’m--

                                 JIMMY
                        Don’t fucking say it.  Be a fucking 
                        man.  Do your fucking job.

           Jimmy goes back to his meal.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Jimmy had turned the screws down 
                        for good.  Turned them down on all 
                        of us.  So we only had one play 
                        left.  And Bannion’s was a 
                        goddamned opera.

           INT.  HOSPTIAL - NURSES STATION - NIGHT

           Three young FBI agents outside the nurses station: RALPH 
           DEMORY, GEORGE BRIGGS and GENE CORDELL (all 30s, trim, crew-
           cuts, very green).  Detective Enley stands with a couple 
           other PLAINCLOTHES COPS and two beat cops.  Everyone anxious, 
           waiting...

           Demory reads a copy of REDBOOK from a stack of magazines.

                                 CORDELL
                        What the hell is that?

                                 DEMORY
                        I read it for the sex tips.  It’s 
                        like being behind enemy lines.
                                 CORDELL
                        Faggot.  Let me see.

           He snatches the Redbook away from Demory.

           DING.  A chime from the elevators.  Bannion steps out.

                                 BANNION
                             (to Cordell)
                        What are you doing?

                                 CORDELL
                        It was his.

           INT.  HOSPITAL - CHAPEL - MOMENTS LATER

           A small chapel in the hospital.  Overhead lights strike up as 
           the men file in.  Bannion up to the front of the space.  
           Piped in SOFT ORGAN MUSIC on a loop.  Enley, the FBI agents 
           and the cops all fill the pews.

                                 BANNION
                        So here’s the situation.  Seattle 
                        PD, courtesy of Detective Enley, 
                        brings in Jack Grant, son of 
                        Milton, tonight after a shootout 
                        and car chase on Capitol Hill.  
                        Robert Aldrich -- the old Shay 
                        crony -- he’s shot dead along with 
                        his mother.  Grant’s in here and 
                        won’t say word one.
                             (beat)
                        Now.  I’ve been working Grant on 
                        the side, reaching out to see if he 
                        might come in, provide some info on 
                        Shay.  Grant’s in a jam, looks like 
                        he’s ready to crack but he wants a 
                        known quantity and he’s 
                        stonewalling, says he’s only 
                        providing to me.  But I got a 
                        problem.  

           The room’s quiet.  Bannion suddenly turns, looks up at the 
           overhead speaker.

                                 BANNION
                        Can we turn this fucking music off?

           Everyone stares at him, silent.  

                                 BANNION
                        No?  Great.  OK.  Fuck it.  So.  
                        Ten minutes after Enley briefs me 
                        on Grant’s request, I get another 
                        call--  My man on the inside with 
                        Shay says he’s heard they’ve got 
                        word on Grant being cooped up here.  
                        Says they want him quiet.  That 
                        they’re gonna make a play on him 
                        tonight.
                                 ENLEY
                        Says the mysterious contact you 
                        still refuse to turn over to SPD.

                                 BANNION
                        Yeah.  That’s right.  My contact.  
                        You wanna start some departmental 
                        bullshit with me?  You wanna know 
                        why I won’t turn over my source?  
                        How does Shay’s crew know Grant’s 
                        here in the first place?  

                                 ENLEY
                        Are you fucking--

                                 BANNION
                        ENOUGH.  Grant’s wanted on the 
                        homicides, that’s yours and if the 
                        facts bear out, you’ll get him soon 
                        enough.  But I’m telling you we 
                        look into this, the facts aren’t 
                        gonna bear out.  And no one’s gonna 
                        be looking into anything if Grant’s 
                        not around come tomorrow.  He’s my 
                        witness and I’ve got a credible 
                        threat against his life.  So are we 
                        done with the pissing contest?

           Enley looks away, disgusted.  

                                 BANNION
                        Here’s how this is gonna work...

           INT.  HOSPITAL - NURSES STATION - LATER THAT NIGHT

           A nurse typing away at a keyboard.  A printout spitting out 
           of a dot-matrix machine nearby.  Bannion’s speech continues 
           over a QUICK MEDLEY OF PAPERWORK BEING SIGNED, DATED, 
           INITIALED AND STAMPED---

                                 BANNION (V.O.)
                        We discharge Grant.  As far as the 
                        paper trail goes, he’s handed into 
                        SPD custody.  And that’s the only 
                        word that comes out of this room.  

           EXT.  HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

           An AMBULANCE and TWO SQUAD CARS parked outside the ER, lights 
           flashing.  Uniformed cops by the doors.  

                                 BANNION (V.O.)
                        A big production.  So we go out the 
                        front, motorcade style--  Only it’s 
                        not Grant we load up.  It’s Agent 
                        Briggs.

           Nurses appear PUSHING A GURNEY out the hospital doors.  
           Briggs lies FAUX-BANDAGED on the stretcher.
           EXT.  SEATTLE STREETS - NIGHT

           The POLICE MOTORCADE and AMBULANCE SCREAM down deserted 
           streets.

                                 BANNION (V.O.)
                        Assuming the leak to Shay’s not 
                        coming from in here, word gets back 
                        to his crew that Grant’s being 
                        brought into protective custody.  

           INT.  POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Agent Briggs sits handcuffed in an interrogation room staring 
           at his reflection in the mirror.

                                 BANNION (V.O.)
                        So we treat Briggs as Grant the 
                        whole way down the line.  You bring 
                        him in for questioning, leave him 
                        in the sweatbox and it gets around 
                        SPD that he’s in a tight spot.  
                        Shay doesn’t have a fucking play.

           EXT.  HOSPITAL - LOADING DOCK - NIGHT

           Cardboard boxes and dumpsters.  Two Crown Vics sit idling.

                                 BANNION (V.O.)
                        Meanwhile, I take Agents Demory and 
                        Cordell and we move the real Grant 
                        off-site.  Quietly.  So it doesn’t 
                        look like a fucking operation.

           And here comes Bannion, Demory and Cordell escorting Jack out 
           the back door.  Jack’s still bandaged up, limping to the car.  

                                 BANNION (V.O.)
                        For reasons I’ve gone over, I’m not 
                        publicizing our planned route to 
                        anyone in SPD.  I get Grant for the 
                        night and see what he’s got for us.  
                        Ten AM tomorrow, we hand him back 
                        over to Detective Enley as the 
                        situation warrants.  That leaves us 
                        with about eleven hours.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT.  HOSPITAL - CHAPEL - NIGHT

           Bannion waits for any questions.

                                 ENLEY
                        And what if the leak is coming from 
                        inside the room?

                                 BANNION
                        Then you can kiss your fucking 
                        pensions goodbye.
           INT.  BANNION’S CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Later.  Jack and Bannion in the backseat.  Demory drives.

                                 BANNION
                        You wanted to talk.

                                 JACK
                        Where are we going?

                                 BANNION
                        Someplace safe.

           Jack holds.  Distant.  Thinking.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        They had me.  After that, 
                        everything else became superfluous.  
                        A liability.  So they would’ve sent 
                        word then.  That it was over.  To 
                        clear out.  To clean up.

           EXT.  ALASKAN SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

           A forboding stretch of flat ice-covered land.  Stands of 
           trees surround a small single story dwelling that would 
           barely qualify as a house.  A light on inside.  Smoke pouring 
           out the chimney.  And the GTO parked in front.

           INT.  ALASKAN SAFE HOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           A one-room fiasco.  A dirty unkempt bed.  A tiny kitchenette.  
           A rotting sofa.  A small, wood-panelled TV tuned to a COOKING 
           SHOW on the Food Network-- A KNIFE DICING TOMATOES.

           Molly sits tied to a kitchen chair, bound and gagged.  She’s 
           still passed out.  

           Over at a tiny grease-pit of a stove, the driver cooks a 
           ground beef patty in a frying pan.  A wall-mounted PHONE 
           rings.  The driver answers.

                                 THE DRIVER
                        Yeah?

                                 JIMMY (V.O.)
                        Your contract’s been filled.  Don’t 
                        leave a paper trail.

           The line CLICKS OFF.  The driver turns off the gas, the blue 
           flame extinguishing.  He tosses the blackened burger patty 
           onto a plate, viscous grease seeping out brownish yellow.

           He looks at Molly.

                                 THE DRIVER
                        I’m gonna let that cool down.
                             (cocks his head)
                        I’m sorry about this, sweetheart. 
                        But you shouldn’t’ve come outside.
           And then somewhere in the room, a CELL PHONE starts to RING.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        So I missed her call.  And she 
                        missed mine.

           EXT.  BAINBRIDGE ISLAND FERRY - NIGHT

           DARK WATER crashes by in the night.  Jack and Bannion 
           standing on the deck of the ferry, Seattle receding into 
           darkness behind them.  Jack’s on his cell.  The line RINGING.

                                 MOLLY (V.O.)
                             (voicemail)
                        Hi, it’s Molly.  Leave your name 
                        and number after the tone, I’ll get 
                        back to you as soon as I can.  

           Jack eyes Bannion, wary, embarrassed.  Looks away.  Hesitates 
           before HANGING UP.  Turning to Bannion:

                                 JACK
                        He’s got keys.  He’s got the alarm 
                        code for Christ’s sake--

                                 BANNION
                        You’ve gotta trust me.    

           Jack looks out at the chop of the dark water.

                                 BANNION
                        I can help you, Jack.  I know you 
                        didn’t kill Aldrich.  You’re not a 
                        murderer.

           EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

           SWIRLING CHIAROSCURO LIGHT as the Crown Vics pulls up outside 
           the beach house, their highbeams playing through the trees.

           INT.  BEACH HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT

           DARKNESS.  The track lights strike up.  Jack and Bannion 
           enter Milton’s home office.  Jack stands at the window 
           looking out at the sound, his back to the room.

                                 BANNION
                        Time to tell me what happened this 
                        afternoon.

                                 JACK
                        Don’t you already know?
                             (he turns to face Bannion)
                        At the bank this morning.  You knew 
                        I’d gotten a call.  Just like 
                        tonight you knew Shay was planning 
                        to make a move at the hospital.  
                        Smoke and mirrors, right Special 
                        Agent?
           Bannion hesitates.  How much has Jack got figured out?

                                 BANNION
                        So I’ve got a man inside.

                                 JACK
                        You’ve got a man inside.  You know 
                        who started all of this.  You know 
                        who placed those calls.  You know 
                        who tipped the cops off to those 
                        bodies and you knew where I was 
                        going this afternoon.  You knew 
                        about it before I did and that’s 
                        what this is all about.  That’s 
                        what it’s been about since before 
                        you even showed up at the goddamn 
                        funeral.  Your man knew I could get 
                        you something that’d put Shay away 
                        for good, isn’t that right?

                                 BANNION
                        And what if it is?

                                 JACK
                        Todd killed Aldrich.  Todd Shay.  
                        Walked in and shot him in the 
                        mouth.  Thought he was your man.  
                        But Aldrich wasn’t your man, was 
                        he? 

                                 BANNION
                        Aldrich was a grunt.  He carried 
                        the weight they handed him till he 
                        couldn’t carry no more.

                                 JACK
                        Yeah.  That’s right.  So I’ve got 
                        something you want and I’m the only 
                        one that knows where it is now, 
                        cause it’s not in a bank downtown 
                        anymore. 

                                 BANNION
                        But it’s safe.

                                 JACK
                        It’s safe.

                                 BANNION
                        Well you tell me where it is--

                                 JACK
                        You’re not hearing me, are you?  
                        You’re not listening.  I’ve come 
                        in.  I’m talking.  I’ll go on the 
                        record.  Isn’t this what you 
                        wanted?  Todd Shay killed Aldrich.  
                        You bring him in, I’ll come into 
                        court and swear to that on the King 
                        James.
                                 BANNION
                        I’m working on it, Jack.  I got you 
                        this far, didn’t I?  This is what 
                        we’re doing.  You and me.  You’ve 
                        gotta give me something here.

           A beat.

                                 JACK
                        Was my father trying to get out?

                                 BANNION
                        He was trying to protect himself.  
                        He set the whole thing up.  Not us.  
                        A civilian fucking operation.

                                 JACK
                        Wearing a wire.  And for what?

                                 BANNION
                        Whose name was on the account, 
                        Jack?
                             (beat)
                        His leverage.  So you could come 
                        home.  So he could see you.  And 
                        they couldn’t touch you anymore.  
                        Because of what he had.

                                 JACK
                        But things ended before he was 
                        ready to play his hand.

           This floats in the air for a moment.

                                 JACK
                        You want the recordings, get the 
                        cops to bring in Todd Shay.

           Bannion pulls a yellow legal pad and a pen from Milton’s 
           desk.  Sets them down in front of Jack.

                                 BANNION
                        Let’s start by you writing down 
                        what happened today with Aldrich.  
                        In fucking detail, OK?  You write 
                        it down for me here and then we’ll 
                        take a looksee together.  In the 
                        meantime, I’m gonna see if there’s 
                        something to eat in this 
                        godforsaken house.

           KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Bannion turns on the lights in the kitchen.  Opens the 
           fridge.  Recoils at the smell, boxes of weeks-old Chinese, 
           noodles slopped over the edges.  Grimacing, he looks inside 
           the vegetable drawer: a small stack of red delicious apples.
           CLEANING AN APPLE

           - THE FRUIT rinsed under the faucet.
           - PAPER TOWELS polishing it clean.  Shining it up.
           - THE SILVERWARE DRAWER opened.
           - A PARING KNIFE sinks into the gleaming red skin.

           EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - MOMENTS LATER

           Bannion walks outside eating the apple.  Demory on watch.

                                 BANNION
                        Nice night.

                                 DEMORY
                        Fucking cold.  Where’s Grant?

                                 BANNION
                        Inside writing a statement.  I 
                        wanted to see if you needed 
                        anything.  Maybe another Redbook?  
                        Cosmo?

                                 DEMORY
                        Fuck you, Bannion.

                                 BANNION
                        Where’s Cordell?

                                 DEMORY
                        Around the other side by the water.  
                        Watching for boats, he says.

                                 BANNION
                        Watching for boats.  That’s good.

                                 DEMORY
                        Yeah, he----

           But before he can finish his sentence, Bannion grabs him, 
           DRIVES THE PARING KNIFE INTO THE BASE OF HIS NECK.

           Demory STRUGGLES.  GURGLING.  PARALYZED.

           And Bannion SNAPS HIS FUCKING NECK.

           Demory DROPS HARD to the ground.  DEAD.

           Bannion leans down over his body, pulls Demory’s pistol from 
           a shoulder holster.  Tosses the apple out into the woods.  
           Holds before WIPING THE KNIFE BLADE DRY on Demory’s collar.

           SHORELINE - MOMENTS LATER

           Cordell digs a toe into the sand here outside the beach 
           house.  Turns around to look as he hears Bannion approaching 
           from behind him--

           And Bannion RAISES DEMORY’S GUN.  SHOOTS CORDELL POINT BLANK 
           IN THE FOREHEAD.  
           An OWL ALIGHTS from a nearby tree flying off into the night.

           INT.  BEACH HOUSE - OFFICE - THAT MOMENT

           Jack jumps up surprised by the sound of the shot.  Puts down 
           his pad and paper.  Rushes to the window, looking out into 
           darkness.  Sees nothing.  Sprints from the room into the

           HALLWAY

           Running toward his bedroom, crossing inside

           JACK’S ROOM

           Scooping up the shotgun from the side of his bed and then 
           jogging back into the

           HALLWAY

           Jack races full-bore toward the balcony overlooking the first 
           floor.  Shotgun raised and pointing down.  All the lights 
           here turned off.  Peering into the darkness.  

           He holds as the front door opens, Bannion walking inside, 
           super casual, looking up surprised to see Jack there--

                                 JACK
                        What the hell was that?

                                 BANNION
                        Woah, woah, what’re you doing?

                                 JACK
                        I heard a shot.

           Bannion raises his hands.  Walking up the stairs slowly 
           toward Jack at the top of the landing.

                                 BANNION
                        It was Cordell.  Alright?  Got 
                        spooked by something in the woods.  
                        His gun went off.  Fucking 
                        greenhorn, right?  It’s cool.  
                        We’re good.  We’re good, Jack.

           Bannion’s near the top of the staircase.  Jack lowering the 
           shotgun to his side now.  

                                 BANNION
                        Alright?

           Jack lets the barrel of the gun swing south to the floor.  

                                 JACK
                        Christ, I swear I thought--

                                 BANNION
                        I know.

           And Bannion’s side-by-side with Jack now.
                                 BANNION
                        How’s that statement coming?

           But Jack doesn’t answer.  Something amiss.  STARING DOWN 
           HARD.  Bannion follows Jack’s gaze down, down to HIS OWN 
           SLEEVE.  A small splatter of blood staining the cuff.

                                 JACK
                        What’s that on your wrist?

           All at once, Bannion DRAWS HIS PISTOL, LEVELS IT AT JACK.

                                 BANNION
                        Drop the gun, Jack.

                                 JACK
                        What are you doing?

                                 BANNION
                        DROP THE FUCKING GUN.

           Jack holds.  Nervous.  Lets the shotgun fall to the floor.  

                                 BANNION
                        Back to the office.

                                 JACK
                        What was that shot?

                                 BANNION
                        Don’t make this difficult.

                                 JACK
                        You killed them.  Your own men.

                                 BANNION
                        What’d I tell you about government 
                        salaries?
                             (beat)
                        And I didn’t kill anybody.  You 
                        did.  You went crazy.  Stabbed 
                        Demory.  Shot Cordell with Demory’s 
                        gun.  Trying to escape.  Who do you 
                        think they’re gonna believe, Jack?
                             (beat)
                        You’re gonna tell me where I can 
                        get those fucking recordings or I’m 
                        gonna kill you too.

                                 JACK
                        You’re on those tapes.

                                 BANNION
                        Bright boy wins a medal.  Back to 
                        the office.

           Just then, in the distance, the sound of a CAR APPROACHING ON 
           GRAVEL.  HEADLIGHTS PLAY THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOWS, an eerie 
           white glow hot on Jack’s face.  Bannion hesitates.
                                 JACK
                        Who’s that?

           Bannion sweats, turns for a beat to LOOK OVER HIS SHOULDER 
           and Jack takes his opening, CHARGING BANNION like a DEFENSIVE 
           LINEMAN, head into his stomach and THEY TUMBLE--

           FALLING END OVER END down the staircase.  LANDING in the

           FOYER

           JACK ON TOP of Bannion as Bannion’s gun slips from his hand, 
           sliding across the hardwood out of reach.  

           Jack PUNCHES BANNION hard.  His nose BREAKS.  BLOOD.

           Jack’s up now.  RUSHING FOR THE GUN as Bannion rights 
           himself.  Standing.  TACKLES JACK TO THE FLOOR.

           The two men STRUGGLE FOR POSITION.  Trying to CHOKE EACH 
           OTHER.  SCRAPING.  LEGS FLAILING.

           And outside the sound of the CAR APPROACHING GROWS LOUDER.  
           LOUDER.  THE HEADLIGHTS cutting into the room HARD, BLINDING.

           BRAKES whine as the car seems to come to a stop outdoors.  
           The headlights cut.  The room goes dark. 

           Jack struggles, crawls on top of Bannion, smothering him with 
           his bare hands, BLOOD BUBBLING UP through Jack’s fingers.  
           Bannion gasping for breath.

           OUTSIDE, a CAR DOOR OPENS and then SHUTS.  FOOTSTEPS in the 
           gravel.  BANNION GASPING.  GURGLING.

                                 JACK
                        Shhhhhhhhh.

           And he SLAMS BANNION’S HEAD to the ground, jumps off of him, 
           picks up the pistol, DRAWING IT FAST ON BANNION.

           Bannion sits up.  Dizzy.  Disoriented.  And then his CELL 
           PHONE RINGS.  He reaches for his pocket, the blue glow of the 
           LCD display uncanny in the darkness.  Jack walks over, close.  
           All of this IN WHISPERS--

                                 JACK
                        Who is it?

           Bannion, panting for breath.

                                 BANNION
                        Todd Shay.

                                 JACK
                        Answer it.

           The phone still ringing.  Bannion hesitates.

           Jack presses the gun to his head.  Bannion opens the phone.
                                 BANNION
                        I told you not to call this number.

           As Todd replies, Jack LEANS IN CLOSE to the earpiece, the gun 
           to Bannion’s head.  And Todd’s voice comes to them twice, in 
           a delayed echo-- once through the phone and once from the 
           other side of the front door.  An unsettling SLAPBACK.

                                 TODD (O.C. & V.O.)
                        Yeah, well.  I’m outside.

                                 BANNION
                        This was my operation.  Alone.

                                 TODD (O.C. & V.O.)
                        I wanted to make sure everything 
                        went OK, you know?

           EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - THAT MOMENT

           Continuous as Todd looks over Demory’s dead body. 

                                 TODD
                        I see you took care of Dear Old 
                        Demory.

           Behind Todd, standing by a Lexus parked in the driveway are 
           two thugs he’s brought along for the ride: FISHER (now 50s, 
           the original owner of Jack’s Zippo) and LARRY (now 40s, 
           Fisher’s smoking buddy).

           INT.  BEACH HOUSE - FOYER - THAT MOMENT

           Bannion struggling to catch his breath.  Jack leaning in.

                                 BANNION
                        Yeah.  Collateral damage.

                                 TODD (O.C. & V.O.)
                        And Jackie Boy?

           Bannion pauses.  Looks up at Jack.  Jack turns to the door.  
           Back to Bannion.  With his free hand, he gestures A SLIT 
           THROAT ACROSS HIS NECK. 

           Bannion closes his eyes.  Defeated.

                                 BANNION
                        He’s dead.

                                 TODD (O.C. & V.O.)
                        And I fucking missed it.  Come 
                        down.  Let me in.  We’ll talk.

           Bannion turns to Jack.  Jack nods.

                                 BANNION
                        Alright.  I’ll be there in a 
                        minute.
           FRONT LAWN

           Todd hangs up his phone.  Looks back to the car.  Gestures to 
           Fisher and Larry.  

           AT THE LEXUS, SLOW-MO as the thugs step out drawing pistols.

           FOYER

           Jack DRAGS Bannion to his feet.  THE GUN to his temple.

                                 JACK
                        You’re my shield.  You got me?

           FRONT LAWN

           SLOW-MO, CONT’D as Todd and his two henchmen walk to the 
           front door, all three of them WITH GUNS DRAWN...

           FOYER 

           Jack and Bannion edging toward the door, Bannion in front as 
           the aforementioned human shield.

           FRONT LAWN

           SLOW-MO, PT. III: Todd and the thugs climb the front steps.  
           Todd nods to them.  READY?  

           Yeah.  We’re fucking ready.

           FOYER

           Jack and Bannion reach the door.  Bannion trembling.  

                                 JACK
                        Open it, beautiful.

           And Bannion reaches for the handle, PULLS DOWN, the DOOR 
           SWINGING INWARD....

           I/E.  BEACH HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           It’s THREE on TWO: TODD, FISHER & LARRY vs. BANNION & JACK--

           Every single man’s EYES WIDE IN SHOCK at what’s looking back 
           at him from the other side of that doorway.  A moment of 
           SCATTERED CONFUSION.  PANIC.  Then:

                                 TODD
                        GUN!!!

           And he RAISES HIS PISTOL AND FIRES, FIRES, FIRES, FIRES.

           BANNION’S HEAD and CHEST ERUPTING IN AN EXPLOSION OF GORE, A 
           HAIL OF BLOOD like YOU’VE NEVER SEEN IN THIS WORLD.

           Jack DIVING for the floor.  Trying TO SWING the door shut.
                                 TODD
                        YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!!!

           Bannion’s corpse FALLS LIMP.  THE TIP OF HIS FINGER caught in 
           the THE DOOR.  JACK FURIOUSLY TRYING TO SLAM IT CLOSED.

           And now TODD & CO. RAM THE DOOR, nearly sending Jack flying 
           back into the room.  He redoubles his efforts, CROUCHING, 
           PUSHING as a SPRAY OF BULLETS RIP THROUGH THE NARROW OPENING.

                                 TODD
                        SHOOT THIS FUCKING CUNT.

           More SHOTS.  And Bannion’s FINGER STILL IN THE WAY.  Jack 
           can’t get the door closed.  But he can’t hold up much longer.

           QUICKLY NOW, he BRINGS THE PISTOL DOWN onto Bannion’s 
           FINGERTIP and FIRES-- blowing that lifeless digit to pieces.  

           The obstruction gone.

           Jack SLAMS the door.  DEADBOLTS the locks.

                                 TODD (O.S.)
                        JACK!  COME OUTSIDE.  WE’LL TALK.

           Jack rushes to the ALARM PANEL.  Punches in the code.  HITS 
           ARM.  The digital clock on the panel reads 12:03AM.  Jack 
           holds as suddenly the readout FLICKERS and then goes dead. 

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Midnight they cut the alarm.  I 
                        found out later that’s when things 
                        ended up north too.  Just an 
                        estimate, mind you.  Because that 
                        cold air makes it so hard to be 
                        certain.

           EXT.  ALASKAN SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

           The driver’s BREATH hangs thick in the night air.  He carries 
           a large object wrapped in plastic sheeting toward the GTO.  
           The trunk yawning open.  He drops the dead weight inside.

           Moonlight reveals Molly’s lifeless face staring up through 
           translucent acrylic.  

           The trunk SLAMMED SHUT.  Darkness.

           INT.  GTO (MOVING) - MINUTES LATER

           The driver heads down a deserted Alaskan road smoking a 
           cigarette and listening to AM talk radio.  

                                 RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        This guy says he’s a Christian, I 
                        say he’s a heathen with no respect 
                        for Jesus Christ.  And it’s people 
                        like this that’re ruining our great 
                        nation--
           In the rearview, RED & BLUE police lights strike up.  The 
           driver looks up.  Calm.  Turns off the radio.  Slows down.

           EXT.  ALASKAN ROAD - THAT MOMENT

           The GTO pulls to the shoulder.  A STATE TROOPER (30s) 
           directly behind.  The trooper gets out of his cruiser 
           brandishing a FLASHLIGHT.  Walks toward the GTO.  The driver 
           rolls down his window.  

                                 STATE TROOPER
                        License and registration.

           The driver hands the documents over.

                                 STATE TROOPER
                        You know why I stopped you?

                                 THE DRIVER
                        I don’t.

           INSIDE THE CAR, UNSEEN, the driver fingers a SNUB-NOSED .38 
           SPECIAL by his side.

                                 STATE TROOPER
                        You got a broken taillight.

                                 THE DRIVER
                        Really?

                                 STATE TROOPER
                        That kind of thing can cause some 
                        serious safety problems.

           The driver relaxes a little, loosening his grip on the gun.

                                 THE DRIVER
                        I’ll get it fixed right away.

                                 STATE TROOPER
                        I’m still gonna have to give you a 
                        warning...

           He trails off as his FLASHLIGHT BEAM cuts across the driver’s 
           body.  The bite marks on his right hand.  A still-wet smear 
           of blood visible on his chest.

                                 STATE TROOPER
                        Sir.  Have you been injured?

           The driver looks down, innocent, and DRAWS the .38, FIRES.  
           The shot GRAZES THE TROOPER’S FACE, A GASH down his left 
           cheek, HIS EAR TORN CLEAN OFF.

           He SCREAMS.  FALLS to the pavement.  His hand RACING toward 
           his holster.  REACHING FOR HIS SERVICE REVOLVER as the DRIVER 
           FIRES AGAIN, hitting him in the gut.

           The trooper writhing, DRAWING as the driver SHIFTS THE GTO 
           into DRIVE.  The TROOPER FIRES.  
           A CLEAN HEAD SHOT-- the DRIVER’S FOREHEAD EXPLODING, a spray 
           of gore onto the windshield as he collapses onto the wheel.

           The HORN ECHOES infinite into the night. 

           The trooper lies bleeding, the red & blue sirens flashing...

           INT.  BEACH HOUSE - FOYER / UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Jack’s at the top of the stairwell with the shotgun.  Lying 
           prone.  Waiting.  The only sound his shallow breathing.

           A THUD from somewhere outside.  Silence.

           Jack’s eyes darting around the space below him--  THUD.

           Bannion’s corpse lying twisted in a pool of blood--  THUD.

           Jack’s PULSE thick in his TEMPLES.

           Suddenly the WINDOW to the LEFT of the door SHATTERS.  Jack 
           SPINS and FIRES THE SHOTGUN only to realize that it’s not an 
           intruder--  A rock lies in the center of the shattered glass.

           He holds.  Finger tense on the trigger.  And then--

           The BAY WINDOW to the RIGHT of the door EXPLODES, Larry 
           jumping through the opening and SLIDING INTO A TUCK & ROLL.  
           Jack TURNS, FIRES THE SHOTGUN. 

           A SHORT SCREAM as Larry RETURNS FIRE.  The balustrade by 
           Jack’s head EXPLODING.

           Larry QUICKLY VANISHES from sight.  

           The room quiet.  No time to think--  The shotgun’s empty.  
           Jack cracks the barrel, reloading.   Meanwhile in the

           DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Larry writhes down the hall, his mouth open in a half scream 
           but not making any noise.  He clutches his LEFT ARM and now 
           it becomes apparent...

           A DARK STREAK OF BLOOD trailing down the hardwood.  

           HIS HAND swollen, bleeding, riddled with buckshot.  

           HIS FACE scarred through and through.  A gaping hole in his 
           cheek.  Hundreds of tiny puncture wounds.  

           He limps forward, silent as can be, crossing under immaculate 
           framed B&W photographs, end tables filled with expensive 
           imported antiques.  Finally moving into

           THE KITCHEN

           Limping forward, Larry walks to the backdoor.  Opens it.  
           Todd and Fisher are there, crouched, waiting.  They enter.
           UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Leaning into the balcony, Jack hears the SCRAPE of FEET 
           against LINOLEUM below him.  Knows they’re in the kitchen.  
           He looks over his shoulder into Milton’s office.  

           Spies A GIANT 1.75 LITRE BOTTLE OF SCOTCH on a console table 
           glinting in the moonlight.  Some other small bottles of booze 
           nearby.  Holds, thinking.

           THE KITCHEN

           The three intruders together, huddled.  Larry still HOBBLED 
           OVER in pain, trying to communicate the situation in gestures 
           without speaking.  Pointing upstairs and then MIMING HOLDING 
           A SHOTGUN.

           Todd looks at him confused.  Not getting it.  Gesturing 
           “What?”  Larry can’t take it anymore.  Finally SCREAMS:

                                 LARRY
                        A FUCKING SHOTGUN, NUMBNUTS!

           MILTON’S OFFICE

           Jack hears Larry shouting as he GRABS all the booze from the 
           table.  Racing back to the

           UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Returning to his position by the balcony.  Lying down.  
           Uncorking the Scotch.  Takes a LONG, LONG PULL.  Starts 
           unscrewing each bottle top.  Waiting.

           DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Fisher ON POINT as he, Todd and Larry line up one-two-three 
           at the edge of the hall.  Holding there single file. 

           REVEAL WIDE

           Fisher & Co. stand directly below Jack.  Todd nods to Fisher.  

                                 FISHER
                        Jack?  Jack Grant?

           UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Jack concentrates.  Trying to place the voice.  Who is it?  

           DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Fisher hesitates.  Choosing his words.  Todd urges him on.

                                 FISHER
                        Jack, it’s Fisher.  You remember 
                        me?  I worked with your dad.  You 
                        remember.  So whaddya say?  I just 
                        want to talk to you.  Can we do 
                        that?  Can we talk to each other?
           Nothing.  Fisher tries to edge out from the lip of the hall, 
           see if he can make out anything at all...

                                 JACK (O.C.)
                        Fisher?  Yeah...  You gave me that 
                        lighter.  The Zippo.

                                 FISHER
                        Right, right, the fucking Zippo.  
                        Told you not to burn anything down.

           UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Jack’s torn a piece of cloth off his shirt, stuffing it into 
           the bottle of Scotch.  He has the Zippo out, the flame 
           dancing in the darkness.  Hesitates.

           He LIGHTS his whiskey-based MOLOTOV.  The flame brighter now.

                                 JACK
                        How you been, Fish?

           DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Fisher confused by the conversation’s turn.

                                 FISHER
                        Me?  I’ve been good.  How about 
                        you, Jack?

           REVEAL WIDE

           Jack watching the flame licking the neck of the bottle.

                                 JACK
                        I’ve been better.  

           All at once, HE STANDS, HOOKS THE MOLOTOV over the rail, 
           ARCING DOWN and then EXPLODING right at Fisher’s feet.

           BLAM.

           A huge FIREBALL ERUPTS.  Fisher ENGULFED.  And Jack now POURS 
           THE OTHER BOTTLES over the ledge, FUEL ON THE FIRE.  Fisher 
           SCREAMS, FLAILING, IGNITING the WALL NEARBY as Todd and Larry 
           recoil in horror, the FLAMES GROWING EXPONENTIALLY. 

           Fisher turns toward Todd, his face CONTORTED in AGONY, 
           SCREAMING, the FLAMES dancing near Todd’s face.  

                                 FISHER
                        FUCK.  TODD.  HELP ME.  PLEASE.  

           Todd holds and THEN KICKS FISHER in the gut, the BURNING MAN 
           FALLING BACKWARD, CRASHING OVER an end table before sliding 
           onto the hardwood floor.  Trying to roll, to extinguish 
           himself but the flames keep growing as he WRITHES HIS WAY 
           onto a large AREA RUG.  The rug IGNITES.  Fisher SCREAMING.
           UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Jack watches from above as Fisher flails on the floor.  He 
           waits, the fire spreading quickly.  A curtain CATCHES.  Jack 
           levels his shotgun, aims square at Fisher, about to put him 
           out of his misery but then--  

           Fisher GOES INTO HORRIFYING SPASMS as THE FLAMES CHAR HIS 
           SKIN.  His legs kicking.  Kicking.  His right hand grabbing 
           his chest.  Flailing.  Then still.  The house burning.

           DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Todd and Larry stand horrified.  A beat.  Then Larry turns to 
           HIGH-TAIL IT DOWN THE HALLWAY.  Todd spins, furious.  He 
           grabs Larry by the COLLAR, SLAMS him to the floor.

                                 TODD
                        Thought you were good with a piece, 
                        you fucking punk.

           UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Jack looks out at the wreckage below.  Two corpses now.  And 
           the fire spreading out.  Flames licking up into the cavernous 
           cathedral ceiling.  Smoke beginning to collect above.

           Coughing, Jack covers his nose and mouth with the top of his 
           t-shirt.  Looking around for his next move.

                                 TODD (O.C.)
                        JACK!?!?  

           DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Larry cowers.  Todd edges forward into the heat of the fire.

                                 TODD
                        That was clever, Jack.  I gotta 
                        hand it to you.  Some fucking 
                        commando shit, huh?  But here’s the 
                        problem.  Heat fucking rises, pal.  
                             (trying to spy Jack)
                        It’s not too late to work this out.  
                        Not too late to come down and talk 
                        to me.  I don’t wanna kill you.  
                        That was Bannion’s job.  All I want 
                        are the wires.  So how about it?  
                        Where are they?

           UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           The flames climbing the walls.  Moving in.  Jack sinking 
           lower to the ground.  Struggling to breathe.  Tucking the 
           pistol into his belt.  Clutching the shotgun.  

                                 TODD (O.C.)
                        The fucking wires, Jack.  I know 
                        you’ve got them.  Let’s talk.  Like 
                        old times.  You and me.
           Jack hesitates and then STANDS UP, CHARGING out from his 
           position at the balcony and running toward the

           OFFICE

           Racing through Milton’s den.  VAULTING OVER the desk, his 
           FOOTSTEPS HEAVY on the HARDWOOD.

           DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Todd breaks off his pleas for peace, looking up, realizing...

                                 TODD
                        He’s moving.  He’s fucking moving.

           He grabs Larry as they race in the direction of Jack’s 
           footsteps, down the hallway toward the

           KITCHEN

           Todd and Larry rush forward, Jack’s steps overhead suddenly 
           cutting out, silent as...

           OFFICE BALCONY

           Jack waits on the balcony, perched on the ledge.  Looks back 
           at the FIRE RAGING behind him.  At the ground below.  

           Stops as he sees Cordell’s corpse in a dark pool of blood.

           But there’s no where else to go.  He JUMPS, falling DOWN...

           KITCHEN

           Todd and Larry peering out from behind a countertop, crouched 
           in cover as they see Jack’s body SLICE through the air, 
           landing out of sight in the backyard.

                                 TODD
                        FUCK.  He’s outside.  The cars, you 
                        go to the fucking cars.  

           Larry turns, runs out of the room as Todd scrambles forward 
           toward the backdoor.  RIPPING IT OPEN and FIRING a couple of 
           times into the night.  BLIND.

           BACKYARD

           Jack rolls down an embankment, crouching behind a large bush.  
           Looks up at the house.  At the open kitchen door, the glow of 
           the fire.  He levels the shotgun.  Holds.  

           Todd’s shoulder becomes visible in the doorway.  His hand 
           reaching out, BLIND FIRING.  Jack FIRES BACK with the 
           shotgun, SCRAPS OF THE WOOD FRAME BURSTING...

           KITCHEN

           Todd recoils as a BLAST of BUCKSHOT tears through his 
           shoulder.  Blood seeping out onto his shirt.
                                 TODD
                        YOU FUCKING CUNT!

           BACKYARD

           No time to waste.  Jack busts out from the bush, RUNNING FULL 
           TILT around the side of the house toward the parked cars...

           KITCHEN

           Todd staunches the bleeding, looks out to see Jack running...

                                 TODD
                             (screaming to Larry)
                        THE CARS!!!  HE’S HEADED FOR THE 
                        FUCKING CARS!!!

           SIDE YARD

           Jack races around the side of the house, crouching, suddenly 
           hears Todd screaming from inside.  PULLS UP SHORT as he 
           reaches the corner.  Holding.  Inches forward in cover.

           He looks out at the cars.  Quiet.  Edging farther when 
           suddenly LARRY APPEARS FROM BEHIND THE LEXUS, FIRING AT JACK.

           Jack raises the shotgun, RETURNS FIRE, rolling back into 
           cover, SCREAMS as the TOE OF SNEAKER BURSTS, a spray of 
           blood.  He’s been shot.  Looking over his wound when--

           BLAM.

           The siding above his head EXPLODES.  He turns to see Todd 
           tearing around the side of the house, fifty feet out and 
           pistol raised.  

           The shotgun empty.  Jack tosses it to the ground, unholsters 
           his pistol and FIRES BACK----

           Todd gets HIT IN THE SHIN.  Collapses.  Rolls back out of 
           sight behind the back corner.

                                 TODD (O.C.)
                        LARRY!  WE GOT HIM BOXED!

           And Jack turns, pokes his head around the corner of the house 
           to see Larry racing out from behind the car.  Jack levels his 
           pistol, FIRES, but he’s TOO SHAKY from this range. 

           Larry closing in.  Todd at the back corner. 

           Flames climbing into the night.

           Jack looks to his side.  SEES IT ALL AT ONCE.  There it is 
           set in the CONCRETE FOUNDATION--

           A basement window.

           He grabs the shotgun, uses the STOCK to KNOCK OUT the glass.  
           Larry still moving in fast.  No more time.

           Jack DIVES into the shattered window, falling down headfirst 
           as Larry reaches the corner.

           Larry LUNGES, GRABS JACK’S SHOE.  Jack’s fall stopped...

           BASEMENT

           Jack hangs, his ankle sinking into spikes of broken glass...

           SIDE YARD

           Larry tries to pull Jack back outside.  Calling to Todd:

                                 LARRY
                        I got him!  I FUCKING GOT HIM!

           And Todd appears from the corner.  Larry brings his gun hand 
           up, about to fire when JACK’S FOOT SLIPS OUT OF THE SHOE--

           BASEMENT

           Jack TUMBLES DOWN, falling ten feet to solid concrete.  His 
           cheek CRACKS against the floor.  He SPITS out a BLOODY TOOTH.

           SIDE YARD

           Larry dumbfounded holding an empty shoe.  Todd races up.

                                 TODD
                        I thought you said you had him!

                                 LARRY
                        He--  He fell.

                                 TODD
                        Shut the fuck up.  Let me think.

           BASEMENT

           Jack crawls through basement, looking out the window while 
           searching for cover.  BUMPS INTO A WORKBENCH.  A wrench falls 
           to the floor.  He stares at it.

                                 TODD (O.S.)
                        You go inside.  Flush him out.  
                        I’ll take him from here.

           SIDE YARD

           Larry can’t believe what he’s hearing...

                                 LARRY
                        Flush him out?  FLUSH HIM OUT?  
                        He’ll pick me off like fucking 
                        skeet.  The guy’s fucking crazy!

           Todd raises his pistol at Larry’s forehead.
                                 TODD
                        So am I.  In the house or I drop 
                        you right here and now.  I swear to 
                        Christ.

           FOYER

           A regular RAGING INFERNO.  TWO QUICK GUNSHOTS as the 
           DEADBOLTS EXPLODE.  

           Larry steps through the front door.  Wary.  His pistol drawn.  
           Trying to avoid the flames, the smoke. 

           SIDE YARD

           Todd leans into the window.  Shouts--

                                 TODD
                        Hey, Jackie.  When’s the last time 
                        you talked to your woman?  ‘Cause I 
                        heard she might be tied up at the 
                        moment.

           BASEMENT

           JACK’S EYES--  Narrowing.  Enraged.  Waiting.

           SIDE YARD

           Todd still leaning in...

                                 TODD
                        Maybe you should give her a call, 
                        you think?  Make sure she’s OK.

           BASEMENT

           The basement door CREAKS open.  Larry standing at the top.  A 
           pit of fucking blackness before him. 

           Larry takes a first step down the basement stairs.  A second.  
           All Quiet on the Western Front.  His pistol sweeping the 
           space from side to side.  Can’t see a god damned thing.  
           Breathing.  Sweating.  Another step.  Near the bottom of the 
           stairs now when...

           ZZZZZZZZZ!

           A CIRCULAR SAW strikes up.  Jack crouched by the bottom of 
           the stairs SPINS AND PLUNGES THE BLADE INTO LARRY’S ANKLE.  
           PUSHING HARD.  The SAW GRINDING, GRINDING.  

           Larry SCREAMS, an UNGODLY HOWL, COLLAPSING to the bottom of 
           the staircase.  

           His foot hanging on to his leg by a thread, nearly TORN CLEAN 
           OFF.  BLOOD GUSHING.

           And Jack’s on top of him with the CIRCULAR SAW, raising his 
           arms and then HEAVING THE SAW DOWN when suddenly...
           AT THE ELECTRIC SOCKET-- the plug rips out of the wall.  

           The saw goes dead.

           Jack holds.  Considers.  And Larry’s literally in tears.

                                 LARRY
                        Oh Christ.  Thank Christ.  Listen 
                        to me.  Please, just listen--

           But Jack doesn’t give a fuck.  He SLAMS THE SAW DOWN into 
           LARRY’S NECK.  A sick WET POP.  A FOUNTAIN OF BLOOD.  Jack 
           drops the saw.  Stands up.

                                 JACK
                        WHERE’S MOLLY, TODD?

           SIDE YARD

           Todd peers through the window.  Can’t see what’s happened but 
           knows it’s bad.  He sits down, close to the opening.

                                 TODD
                        Is that your girl?  Your lady?  How 
                        should I know where she’s got to if 
                        you can’t keep track, Jackie?  I’m 
                        just telling you things I heard.  
                        Rumors.  That she might be stepping 
                        out with another man.  A real.  
                        Bad.  Dude.  She like bad boys, 
                        Jack?  Maybe they’ll hit it off.

           BASEMENT

           Jack sits down too.  Listens to the FIRE RANGING OVERHEAD.  

                                 JACK
                        If she’s been hurt.  I’ll bleed you 
                        and Jimmy and this whole fucking 
                        city till you’re dry.

                                 TODD (O.S.)
                        I’ll make a note of that.  And I 
                        gotta tell you, you brought your A-
                        game to this one.  Brought your 
                        fucking A-game, killer.  But you 
                        missed something.  You missed it 
                        and it was right there it front of 
                        you and that’s why I’m gonna win 
                        the war, Jackie.  You know why?

           Jack QUIETLY ENRAGED.  Those eyes.  The wheels turning. 

                                 TODD (O.S.)
                        I’ll tell you why.  Because it’s my 
                        time.  It’s my motherfucking time 
                        and you are not gonna stand between 
                        me and what’s mine.  So.  You wanna 
                        know what’s mine?  You want me to 
                        fucking tell you?
           SIDE YARD

           Todd reaches into his pocket.  Takes out a small BLACK 
           PLASTIC CUP shaped like the cone of a gas mask.  FLIPS A 
           SWITCH.  A RED LIGHT GLOWS.  He places the piece over his 
           mouth.  Takes a long, deep breath.  

           And now when he speaks, it’s THAT VOICE.  IT’S ANONYMOUS.

                                 TODD
                        THE WHOLE FUCKING OPERATION.

           BASEMENT

           Chills down Jack’s spine.  It can’t be.  But it is.  Todd’s 
           VOICE STILL ALTERED, DEEP THROUGHOUT--

                                 TODD (O.S.)
                        Didn’t know it was me on the phone 
                        this morning, did you, Jackie boy?  
                        Because you thought just like all 
                        the rest, you thought, Todd’s a 
                        dumb fucking goon.  Well who’s the 
                        dumb fucking goon now?  
                             (beat)
                        I’m not a child.  A fucking kid.  I 
                        muscle up.  I work harder than 
                        anyone in this fucking racket.  
                        Harder than anyone.  And I’m smart.  
                        I see things.  I see openings, I 
                        take them.  Jimmy...  Jimmy didn’t 
                        want to cut me in.  So I decided to 
                        cut myself in.  By cutting.  Him.  
                        THE FUCK.  OUT.
                             (does the routine)
                        Two bodies in limestone.  Foster 
                        Motherfucking Island.
                             (beat)
                        I’m gonna get those wires from you 
                        and then I’m gonna fucking kill you 
                        and watch you die.  The fucking 
                        orphan that you are.

           SIDE YARD

           Todd turns off the voice box.  Waiting.

           BASEMENT

           Jack reels.  Pieces of the ceiling cracking.  Falling.  
           FLAMES visible above.  

                                 TODD (O.S.)
                        So whaddya say, Jackie?  I’m out 
                        here, I’m out here and I’m looking 
                        at this fucking fire and it’s not 
                        looking good.  You don’t wanna burn 
                        up in there, there’s two ways you 
                        can come out.  The front.  Or the 
                        back.  So I’m thinking.

                                 TODD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        You know what I’m thinking?  You 
                        remember the old Westerns?  You 
                        remember those?  The fucking 
                        serials?  Two guys had a problem, a 
                        little dispute, you remember how 
                        they settled it?  They settled it 
                        at High Noon in the middle of the 
                        road.  Quick motherfucking draw.  
                             (beat)
                        So which is it gonna be, Jackie?  
                        The front.  Or the back.

           More of the ceiling BREAKS UP over Jack’s head.  Caving in.  
           He really does have to move.  And now.

                                 JACK
                        The front.  I’m coming out the 
                        front.  

           Jack stands up.  Looks at the flames.  Larry’s corpse.

                                 TODD (O.S.)
                        No fucking parlor tricks now.

           SIDE YARD

           Todd rises.  Walking toward the front door.

           BASEMENT

           Jack climbs the basement stairs.

           FRONT YARD

           Todd reaches the base of the porch.  The TOWERING INFERNO 
           looming overhead.  He looks into the fire.  Waiting.  Raising 
           his pistol.  Ready for Jack’s exit.  Ready for ONE ON ONE.

           DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Jack at the top of the steps.  The FLAMES AROUND HIM UNREAL.  
           He moves forward.  Stops where the Molotov exploded.  

           PARTS OF THE HOUSE COLLAPSING around him.  A wall of fire 
           before him.  If he wants to get out of here, he’s literally 
           going to have to walk through flames.

           FRONT YARD

           Todd licks his lips, his eyes cold, his gun steady.

           DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

           MORE DEBRIS FALLS.  When Jack moves, this is it.  On the 
           other side of those flames, he’ll be in the open.  His last 
           moment.  He holds.  And finally--

           RUSHES FORWARD, PISTOL RAISED HIGH and FIRING.
           FRONT YARD & FOYER

           Todd SEES IT NOW-- Jack BURSTING THROUGH A WALL OF FIRE, the 
           muzzle FLASHING.  He FIRES back.

           Jack opens his eyes, out of the FLAMES NOW, sees TODD FIRING.  
           Suddenly, JACK’S CHEST EXPLODES JUST BELOW HIS RIGHT 
           SHOULDER.  HE’S BEEN SHOT.  COLLAPSING TO THE FLOOR.

           Todd hesitates.  Lowers his gun half an inch.  Stops firing.  
           Can’t believe it.  He got Jack.  He got him.  

           JACK CRUMBLES.  A beat.  And then--  LIGHTNING FAST AS HE 
           RAISES HIS PISTOL and FUCKING UNLOADS.

           Todd’s mouth open in shock as JACK’S ARM COMES UP and now 
           it’s all over, isn’t it?  No time to react--  TODD’S HIT.

           CHEST SHOT.  CHEST SHOT.  HEAD SHOT.  HEAD SHOT.

           A RED RAIN OF BLOOD AND GORE AS TODD FALLS DOWN INTO THE WET 
           GRASS, RIDDLED WITH BULLETS, DYING, DYING, DYING.

           And the flames crawl up up up up up up toward the sky.

           And Jack drags himself bloodied along the hardwood. 

           Todd on the grass.  Gasping.  His last breath.

           Jack pushing onward.  Further.  Onto the porch.  Rolling down 
           the steps.  Landing...

           FACE UP NEXT TO TODD WHO LIES FACE DOWN, HIS EYES FLUTTERING 
           IN HIS LAST MOMENTS OF LIFE.

           The two men make eye contact.  And now.  Finally.  

           TODD IS DEAD.

           Jack looks into the fiery Heavens above.  From the distance, 
           he hears SIRENS.  Looks to the road.  The RED STROBES of 
           approaching FIRE TRUCKS.

           THE SOUND CUTS.  Silence as the house BURNS, the porch 
           collapsing, a RAIN OF GLASS AND WOOD THROUGH THE AIR as Jack 
           lies alone and bleeding.  Alive.

           INT.  AMBULANCE (MOVING) - DAWN  

           STILL DEAD SILENT.  Jack on a gurney as two EMTS hover over 
           him, an oxygen mask strapped to his face.  Struggling to keep 
           his eyes open.  And then finally, he closes them.

           IN BLACK.

                                 A WOMAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        I want you to understand the

                        to do.

                        Afterwards.  And it’s not all foul 
                        play.  Some of them, it’s not even 
                        a guy with a gun in the middle of 
                        the night.  It’s that they go home 
                        and it doesn’t feel like home 
                        anymore.  Because they feel like...  
                        Well, I guess they feel like they 
                        did something wrong.

           INT.  DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           The voice belongs to the DISTRICT ATTORNEY (40s, polished, 
           professional).  Her office adorned with American flags.  A 
           heavily bandaged Jack across from her.  And Seattle behind.

                                 DISTRICT ATTORNEY
                        So what I’m saying to you is you’ve 
                        gotta feel like you’re doing 
                        something right.  

           Jack passes the BLACK iPOD across the desk to the DA.

                                 JACK
                        You’ll have to forgive me.  The 
                        distinction’s a little hazy.

           EXT.  COURTHOUSE - DAY

           A gleaming courthouse.  NEWS VANS & REPORTERS.  A MOB SCENE.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        A shill.  That’s the word they 
                        used.  Appearing for the 
                        prosecution in the case my father 
                        started for the defense.  A 
                        turncoat.  A goddamn traitor.

           INT.  COURTROOM - DAY

           SUPER WIDE all the way from the back of the room as Jack, now 
           suited up, walks up to the WITNESS STAND.  As he crosses, THE 
           SHOT BEGINS TRACKING IN, IN, IN...

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        And bearing witness to what?  A 
                        mile high stack of small change.  
                        Racketeering.  Loansharking.  
                        Narcotics.  Because those were the 
                        charges.  And no more.  So no one 
                        was going to hear about Aldrich.  
                        About Bannion.  About Fisher and 
                        Larry and Todd and a house up in 
                        smoke.  About my mother, my father.  
                        About Molly.  All of them gone.  
                        Buried.  To die again with me.

           Still TRACKING IN past JIMMY and EARL at the defense table.  
           Turning to FOCUS ON JACK as he enters the stand...
                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        But they admitted the wires.  It’s 
                        the little shit that gets you.

                        truth and nothing but the truth?

           CLOSE ON JACK’S FACE.  He turns to look DIRECT TO CAMERA--

           EXT.  STONE HARBOR - DAY

           A beautiful day in Alaska.  Spring’s moving in.  Somewhere 
           far away, a MUSIC BOX plays GOLDBERG VARIATION No. 25.

           INT.  MOLLY’S TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY

           Jack drives the truck, stoic.  MUSIC CONTINUES...

           EXT.  MOLLY’S PARENTS HOUSE - DAY

           Jack at the front door of a tiny one-story home.  The music 
           box clutched in his hands.  The door opens.  MOLLY’S MOTHER, 
           (50s with a stronger trace of Inuit, sad eyes) looks back.  

           Jack hands her the music box.  And MUSIC CONTINUES...

           INT.  JACK & MOLLY’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jack lies awake in bed staring up at the ceiling.  The Zippo 
           in his hand.  Lighting and extinguishing it over and over.  

           INT.  ALASKAN DINER - MORNING

           Jack sits in the Alaskan diner he ate at with Molly so long 
           ago picking at a plate of eggs.  Cable news on a TV mounted 
           over the bar.  Jack’s ears perk up as...

                        reportedly come back hopelessly 
                        deadlocked and unable to reach a 
                        verdict.  We’re being told Judge

                        officially declare a hung jury in 
                        just a few moments.  Mary Troy is

           THE SHOT ON THE TV cuts to a LIVE REPORTER on the scene...

                        Thanks, Roger.  The unconfirmed 
                        reports I’ve received point to one 
                        lone juror as the holdout here...
           The SOUND FADES, replaced by AN IRONICALLY HOPEFUL PIANO RUN. 
           “RAZOR FACE” by Elton John...

           INT.  BLACK HORSE BAR - DAY

           “Razor Face” plays on the juke in this small fisherman’s bar.  
           TIGHT ON A TUMBLER of WHISKEY filled to the brim.  Jack picks 
           it up, staring at the drink.  He knocks it back.  

           The front door to the bar swings open.  Blinding white light.  
           Jack shields his eyes.  Looks up to see Armand, the deckhand 
           from the fishing boat, enter.  

           Armand saunters over to the bar.  Gestures two fingers to the 
           bartender who promptly lines up two more shot glasses.

                                 JACK
                        You’ve taken to drinking at noon or 
                        is this a social visit?

                                 ARMAND
                        Harlan told me you’d be here.

                                 JACK
                             (downing his shot)
                        Harlan was right.

                                 ARMAND
                        It wasn’t your fault.

                                 JACK
                        Yeah.  Yeah, it was.

                                 ARMAND
                        Jack.  You can’t do this.  Come 
                        back to work.  The Delano goes out 
                        day after tomorrow.  Come back with 
                        us.  Get some air, OK?

           They hold, the two men staring at each other.  Finally, 
           Armand downs his shot, SLAMS the glass onto the bar.

           EXT.  DELANO - DAY

           A brilliant day.  The Bering Sea looks raw, beautiful.  
           Deckhands go about their work.  Jack securing lines.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        I started to wonder.  It’d been two 
                        months.  Two months and I thought 
                        for sure, one night, I’d come home 
                        and there’d be the guy with the 
                        gun.  Or the knife.  Or the 
                        garrote.  Or I get in my truck and 
                        turn the key and--  He had to be 
                        coming for me.  He had to.  Because 
                        he might’ve gotten off, but I’d 
                        turned.  Turned for sure.  This 
                        wasn’t fifty grand.  This was a 
                        man’s life.  How many men’s lives?  
                                 (MORE)

                        So I started to dream about it.  
                        Day and night.  Waiting for that 
                        stranger I’d never met.  This time 
                        wouldn’t be like Indiana.  This 
                        time I wouldn’t fight.  Wouldn’t 
                        say a word.  And that would be it.  
                        But he didn’t come.  Why didn’t he 
                        fucking come?

           Jack stares out at the sea, his hand tight on the rail.  And 
           now he HOISTS HIMSELF UP and JUMPS out into the WILD WATERS.

           UNDERWATER - THAT MOMENT

           It’s glorious as JACK’S BODY sinks beneath the surf, the sun 
           SHINING ABOVE.  A SLOW MOTION DEATH to be PROUD OF...

           IN BLACK.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        They put it in the ship’s log that 
                        I’d slipped.  Slipped on some ice 
                        on a beautiful day.

           INT.  DELANO - DECKHANDS QUARTERS - DAY

           Jack wrapped in a blanket, shivering, sipping coffee 
           surrounded by Armand, the captain, the deckhands.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        I wasn’t asked back to work after 
                        that.  Didn’t ask me for anything 
                        at all.  So what was there to do?

           INT.  AIRPORT - TICKET COUNTER - DAY

           A beaming TICKET AGENT (20s) smiles at Jack.

                                 JACK
                        Anything going to Seattle today?

                                 TICKET AGENT
                        Let’s see...  I’ve got a 1:45 if 
                        that works.

                                 JACK
                        Perfect.

                                 TICKET AGENT
                        And when will you be returning?

                                 JACK
                        Just the one way, please.

           EXT.  SEATTLE SKYLINE - NIGHT

           DOWNTOWN TOWERS glowing in the night.  Mountains in the 
           distance.  A THUNDERSTORM moving in.  A CLAP OF LIGHTNING.
           EXT.  JIMMY’S HOUSE - SIDE GATE - NIGHT

           A DOWNPOUR tears across the sidewalk, a gutter overflowing.  
           A hedged fence on the side of Jimmy’s house.  Jack stands 
           dressed in all black, a backpack slung over his shoulder.  

           He reaches into the pack, pulls out a FISHING LINE and 
           GRAPPLING HOOK.  Slings it up over the wall.  It catches.

           INT.  JIMMY’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A well-furnished bedroom.  Dark.  Jimmy asleep.  Suddenly a 
           hand REACHES INTO FRAME, GRABS JIMMY’S WRISTS, PULLING THEM 
           TOGETHER and then TYING THEM TIGHT WITH A LINE.

           Jimmy wakes with a start to see Jack standing over him moving 
           fast, so fast, already securing the line to the BED POST.  
           There’s nowhere to go and Jimmy knows it.

                                 JIMMY
                        Jack.

                                 JACK
                        I thought you’d come for me.  I 
                        waited for you to come for me.

                                 JIMMY
                        I’m too old, Jack.  Too old to care 
                        anymore.

                                 JACK
                        I’m not.

                                 JIMMY
                        But you will be.

                                 JACK
                        Will I?

           Jimmy stares him down.

                                 JACK
                        How much did your freedom cost you?

                                 JIMMY
                        The jury?

                                 JACK
                        What do you think?

                                 JIMMY
                        Ah, but what do you think, Jack?

                                 JACK
                        I think it doesn’t really matter, 
                        does it?

                                 JIMMY
                        Right.
           Jack pulls a Bowie knife from his bag.  Looks at the blade: 
           twelve inches of gleaming steel.

                                 JACK
                        The coroner’s report said she’d 
                        been bound.  Bound and stabbed.  
                        Was that just business, Jimmy?  

                                 JIMMY
                        Jack...

           Jack hesitates.  Turns away.  And then, spinning back, DRIVES 
           THE BOWIE KNIFE DOWN INTO JIMMY’S CHEST.  Blood bubbles from 
           the old man’s mouth.

                                 JIMMY
                        Jack--  I want to ask you 
                        something.  

           Jack stares at him, grasping the knife.  Waiting.

                                 JIMMY
                        Is this--
                             (he coughs up blood)
                        Will this make you feel better?

           Jack holds.  Cold.  Considering.  He PULLS THE KNIFE out of 
           Jimmy’s chest.  Blood dripping down the blade to the floor.

                                 JACK
                        No.

           And here it comes.  The knife down down down one more time, 
           hard fast glacial brutal lethal--  

           The final fucking act.

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        It was Jimmy who taught me how to 
                        clean a fish.

           END TITLES.

                            WHATEVER GETS YOU THROUGH THE NIGHT
