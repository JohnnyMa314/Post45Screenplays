                     (cid:13)           EXT. CHICAGO SKYLINE - NIGHT

           Gliding over the sprawl to the tune of Sam Cooke's 'A Change 
           is Gonna Come.'  Towering monoliths swaying against 
           thunderous winds.  Scores of villages within city limits; La 
           Villita, Chinatown, Greektown, Little Seoul.  A sleepless hub 
           of commerce, poverty, peace.  Crime.  Chicago is now.

           Soaring over the Tri-State Freeway now, an 18-WHEELER motors 
           down the road, nearing the periphery.  Antiquated industrial 
           complexes stand disconnected, abandoned.  Ideal real estate 
           for industries seeking anonymity from society - the law. 

           The truck pulls into a lot, finds shelter in a -

           INT. TRUCK GARAGE - NIGHT

           The 18-wheeler parks in a row of COMMERCIAL VEHICLES, bodies 
           stripped.  MECHANICS unweld metal containers from their rims, 
           concealing bundles of HEROIN.  More bundles are unloaded from 
           the rocker panels, seat cushions.  

           The ACCOUNTANT (30's) punches numbers into his PDA, taking 
           inventory of the shipment - neatly stacked on metal slabs.  
           He moves for an SUV parked idle by the entrance door, climbs 
           in -

           INT./EXT. SUV/GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Sits beside FRANK RUSSO (60's), broad, grizzled.  A relic of 
           the Chicago Outfit, circa Capone.  His eyes are closed, lost 
           blissfully in the epic ballad issuing from the speakers.  

                                 ACCOUNTANT
                        Frank -

           Russo doesn't hear him, in the zone.  Reminiscing.  

                                 RUSSO
                        I remember the first time I heard this 
                        number.  Sinatra did a gig at the Uptown 
                        theater.  '64.  Before Blue Eyes takes 
                        the stage this colored kid does a set. 
                        Sharp threads.  Class.  Voice like silk.  
                        No one would admit it that night, but we 
                        were all thinking it: change, it was 
                        fucking here.

           The song fades.

                                 RUSSO (CONT'D)
                        Again.

           The DRIVER queues the stereo.  Plays Sam all over again.

                                 RUSSO (CONT'D)
                        What's the count?

                                 ACCOUNTANT
                        It's all there.  Five hundred keys.  

           He hands Russo the PDA.

                                 ACCOUNTANT (CONT'D)
                        Your largest shipment to date.  Not a bad 
                        way to retire.

           Russo fumbles with the PDA, alienated by this new technology -

                                 RUSSO
                        Jesus, what ever happened to a pen and a 
                        columnar?  

                                 ACCOUNTANT
                        All tech now, Frank.  Light, easy to 
                        store. 

                                 RUSSO
                        Yeah?  What happens if I drop it? 

           Russo tosses it back.  The accountant nearly fumbles the 
           catch.

                                 RUSSO (CONT'D)
                        Fuck tech.

           BOOM!  An SRT VAN bursts through the entrance, grill fixed 
           with a front-end BATTERING RAM.  Charging.

           Russo produces a REVOLVER.

           The van PLOWS hard into the SUV.  Sends it sailing in 
           reverse.  Colliding with an 18-wheeler.

           Mechanics react, arm themselves as -

           The van locks tires.  Men in tactical gear, ski masks spill 
           out of the double-doors, brandishing assault rifles.  And in 
           a blink, the mechanics are cut down by heavy fire.  
           Mincemeat.  

           The lead shooter steps up, fearless, RELOADS full-tilt.  
           Blows multiple mechanics to hell.  Then, the firing ceases.  
           Over before it began.

           The lead shooter removes their mask.  Reveals:
                                                          (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                      (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)           CANDIE JONES (20's)

           Strong, sexy.  Woman.

           Another shooter removes his mask -

           KENNY (20's)

           Mohawk, boyish.  A jock with a big gun.  He removes earbuds, 
           pauses Brad Paisley on his iPod - his music to murder to.  He 
           activates the iPod's TIMER - counting down.

                                 KENNY
                        Sixty seconds!

           He starts for the heroin, fellow shooters following.  Begin 
           loading product into the van.  

           Jones draws a PISTOL.  Marching amongst the wounded, 
           executing them.  

           A man emerges from the van's passenger-side -

           HANSON (50's)

           Hard features, crew-cut.  A warrior who's been around the 
           block.  He pops a TABLET of Pepto Bismol, following Candie 
           Jones.

           Russo stumbles out of the SUV, banged up, fumbling shells 
           into his revolver.  

           Jones DRILLS Russo in the shoulder, his leg.  KICKS away the 
           six-shooter.  

           The driver goes for his gun; Jones SHOOTS him first. 

           Russo crawls, trailing blood.  Stops at Hanson's boot.  He 
           looks up, meeting his maker -

                                 RUSSO
                        You got some nerve, pal.  What gives you 
                        the right -

           Hanson draws a GLOCK - SHOOTS him in the head.  

           The accountant staggers out the car, hands raised.  Trembling 
           before Hanson, Jones -

                                 ACCOUNTANT
                        Please.  I wasn't even here.  I'll 
                        disappear.  Swear to God. 
                                 (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                            (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                      (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)           Hanson approaches the accountant, looks him up and down.  
           Smiles, amused by the man's fear.  

           SIRENS echo in the distance.  Responding.

           The TIMER on Kenny's iPod BEEPS -

                                 KENNY
                        Time to go!

           Shooters pile into the van, clockwork.

           Hanson looks at Jones, turns away from the accountant -

                                 HANSON
                        Sorry.  Strictly business.

           Walks.  Jones puts pistol-nozzle to the accountant's head.  
           FIRES.

           Hanson, Jones slip into the van.  Peel out.  And Sam still 
           sings from Russo's now totaled SUV, taking it home -

                                 SAM COOKE
                        ...It's been a long, a long time coming, 
                        but I know a change gonna come, oh yes it 
                        will...

           INT. L-TRAIN (MOVING) - PRE-DUSK

           OFFICER WILLIAM FINLEY (27)

           Strong, black.  Chin held high.  A soldier of pride, order.  
           He sits sandwiched between a hoard of commuters.  Pensive.  
           Anticipant.

           The train stops.  An ELDERLY WOMAN (60's) lumbers through 
           sliding doors.

           Finley rises, offers his seat -

                                 FINLEY
                        Please.

           The elderly woman accepts -

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        Thank you.

           She sits, pauses, locked on Finley's HOLSTERED GUN - peeking 
           out of his jeans.  She looks at him, concerned.

           Finley smiles, reassuring -

                        It's all good.  I'm a police officer.

           The woman shifts in her seat, uneasy.  

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        What a waste.  And such a nice young man.  

           Finley watches her rise, searching for another seat.  
           Dispirited.  

           INT. PRECINCT - LOBBY AREA - PRE-DUSK

           Dated, distressed conditions.  On the wall above the waiting 
           area, fading: "WE S  RV  AN PR  TEC  "  A house in disrepair.

           Finley weaves through the bustle.  Uniforms, criminals, 
           victims.  Business is booming.

           INT. ORGANIZED CRIME DIVISION (OCD) - KEEGAN'S OFFICE - PRE-
           DUSK

           A woman at her desk, chair reclined, watching OPRAH online.  
           Empowered.

           SERGEANT CARRIE KEEGAN (late 30's)

           Sporty frame, no time to be pretty.  Jaded by decades of 
           office politics, sexism.  A KNOCK at the door, disruptive.

           Keegan, annoyed, pauses the show, hurries for the door, opens 
           it.  Finley stands before her, ready to work.  

                                 FINLEY
                        Sergeant Keegan?  

           She nods, impatient.  

                                 FINLEY (CONT'D)
                        I'm William.  William Finley -

                                 SGT. KEEGAN
                        You're early.

           She pushes past him, rushed -

                                 SGT. KEEGAN (CONT'D)
                        This way, please.

           Keegan leads Finley to his desk.  Switches on his computer.

KEEGAN (CONT'D)
                        This is your desk.  Roll call's in an 
                        hour.  Major Crimes is stopping by.

           She's already marching back to her office. 

                                 FINLEY
                        What for -

           She slams the door.

           Finley acquaints himself with the desk.  Organizes it to his 
           liking.  He pulls a book from his bag: TECHNIQUES OF CRIME 
           SCENE INVESTIGATION, SIXTH EDITION.  Reads.

           OFFICER AMELIA SANTOS (20's) breezes through, stunning 
           despite the sweat, gym clothes.  She spots Finley, drops her 
           purse on the desk.  If she's interested, she doesn't show it.  
           Running through her e-mail -  

                                 OFCR. SANTOS
                        Amelia.  They call me Santos 'round here.  
                        Last name.  Amelia's cool, too.  Your 
                        choice. 

                                 FINLEY
                        William.

                                 OFCR. SANTOS
                        That's easy.  I'll be in the showers, 
                        William.  

           She exits, leaves Finley no time to catch his breath.  He 
           returns to his book, smitten.  Sees he's lost his page.

           The revamped muscle car roaring through rush-hour traffic,

           Mussy, white.  "Selleck" sprouting above his upper lip.  He 
           dumps half a bottle of Red Bull out the window, refills it 
           with a flask full of vodka.  Sucks it down.  Eyes his watch.  
           HAMMERS the gas.  

           In the REARVIEW: a MOTORCYCLE OFFICER, SIRENS flashing.   

           McCoy steers into the emergency lane.  Stops.

           The officer heads for the vehicle, opening his ticket book.  
           Unlocking his holster -

                                 MOTORCYCLE OFFICER
                        License and registration.

           McCoy feels around for his wallet, clearly can't find it.  

                                 MCCOY
                        Hang on, chief.  It's here.  

           He sweeps a heap of empty Red Bulls off the seat, reveals a 
           HANDGUN. 

           The officer spots the weapon, steps back, hand on his pistol.

                                 MOTORCYCLE OFFICER
                        Step out of the vehicle and put your 
                        hands on your head.

                                 MCCOY
                        Then I can't find my wallet.

                                 MOTORCYCLE OFFICER
                        Get out of the car!  

           McCoy steps out.  Hands behind his head -

                                 MCCOY
                        Dude, I'm a cop -

           The officer searches him.   

                                 MOTORCYCLE OFFICER
                        You smell like shit.  You been drinking?

                                 MCCOY
                        It's five o'clock somewhere.  

           The officer begins to cuff him.

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        C'mon, it's my first day.  Cut me some  
                        slack.  I'm already late for my shift.

                        Look, you want proof?  Tin's in the car.

                                 MOTORCYCLE OFFICER
                        Yeah?  What's your badge number?

           McCoy thinks hard -

                                 MCCOY
                        Wait. I know it.  Five digits.  
                        Four...six - shit.  There's a seven in 
                        there somewhere -

           The officer slams McCoy on the hood, moves for the driver's 
           side. 

           Searches inside.  It's a sty.  Candy wrappers, cigarette 
           cartons, an empty bottle of aspirin.  No sense of ownership. 

           What the officer can deduce: the driver is lazy, spoiled.  
           Lost.  He lifts The Bar Exam For Dummies, finds the BADGE 
           underneath.  

                                 MOTORCYCLE OFFICER
                        Christ.

           He inspects it.  Meets eyes with McCoy - face pinned to the 
           hood.  Wearing an 'I-told-you-so' kind of smile.

           A MUG SHOT of RAYMOND PRIEST (30's), digitally projected on 
           the wall behind LIEUTENANT ROBERT EPPS (30'S), straight and 
           narrow.  Tailored suit boasting superiority.  Addressing the 
           night owls of 2nd shift.  Tired eyes, stubble-ridden jaws.  
           Lowlifes with badges.  

           Finley listens intently, jotting keywords into his steno.  He 
           feels eyes on him, looks opposite -

           Santos's gaze looms, liking what she sees.  Finley turns 
           away, bashful.

                        decade.  Barlow.

           candid of Russo.

                        investigation.  Russo's killers are out 
                        there, along with the heroin.  Best case 
                        is a twofer, nab the killers and the 
                        buyers.  Buyers like Priest looking to re-
                        up their supply.  This station covers his 
                        turf, which means all officers within 
                        Organized Crime Division are to be pulled 
                        from their current cases to aid us in our

           OFFICER JOHN BORKOWSKI (30's), bald and bulky.  A beer and

           fighting from dozing off.

All heads turn to McCoy, cheek 
           shining.  Sedated.  Endeavoring anonymity.

           McCoy grabs a seat between Finley and Santos, blocking their 
           line of sight.  He nods to Santos.  She turns away, repulsed.

                        Recruitment is down, guys.  Everyday 
                        officers  are hightailing it to the 
                        'burbs for fatter checks and shorter

           McCoy leans over to Finley, lost -

                        Dearborn.  

           Borkowski meets eyes with Santos, winks suggestively.  Finley 
           takes note, jealous.

           Finley turns to McCoy, distraught, trepidatious.  He quickly 
           raises a hand.  Keegan pauses -

                        It's our first day.

                        I'm aware.

                                 FINLEY
                        Two rookies to a detail?

                        Relax chief, I showered.

                                 FINLEY
                        It's unorthodox.  We should be partnered 
                        with vets.  

                                 SGT. KEEGAN
                        You ever done a 10-16?

                                 FINLEY
                        Plenty.

                                 SGT. KEEGAN
                        Good.  You can show Jim how it's done. 

           Keegan continues.  Finley buries his head in his palms. Day 
           one gone to hell.

                                 FINLEY (O.S.)
                        I'm better than this detail, sarge.  I 
                        need to be out there learning my 
                        district.

           The team empties out.  Finley follows Keegan to her office -

                        I've done more 10-16's than I can count.  
                        What's an errand to the boonies gonna 
                        teach me that I don't already know?

                        knowledge pertaining to Priest's

           McCoy pouring his flask of vodka into a can of Red Bull.  
           Finley behind the wheel, seething, hating his assignment - 
           hating McCoy even more.

                        There are other ways to caffeinate.  
                        Coffee for one.

                                 MCCOY
                        Joe gives me the shits.  You play ball, 
                        Bill?  

                                 FINLEY
                        The hell's that supposed to mean?  And 
                        it's William.

                                 MCCOY
                        William.  Means you're athletic.  Most 
                        would take it as a compliment.  I played 
                        ball.

                                 FINLEY
                        I've seen you on SportsCenter.  Blew your 
                        shot at the pros.  How old was she?  
                        Sixteen?

                                 MCCOY
                        Seventeen, and her parents consented.  

           McCoy studies Finley, reads his disapproval.

                        Hey, I'm a man.  Athletes get more trim 
                        than rock stars.

                                 FINLEY
                        I know the turf.

                        She wants to pop out your kids and you 
                        haven't even made plans. 

                                 FINLEY
                        I don't rap to coworkers.

                                 MCCOY
                        No dipping in the company ink, right?  
                        Too bad.  That's ass on tap.  You should 
                        talk shit to her, man.  Get your balls 
                        rolling before someone else does.

                                 FINLEY
                        Worry about your own balls, alright?  And 
                        I boxed.  Army circuit.  I got my share.  
                        I know what I'm doing.

           McCoy lights a cigarette, unfiltered.

                                 MCCOY
                        Pugilist, huh?  That's cool.  What are 
                        you?  Middleweight?  Light-heavy -

                                 FINLEY
                        Super middle.  And put out the damn 
                        cigarette. 

           He rolls down the window, fanning smoke.  Annoyed.

                                 MCCOY
                        Can't.  Been buried in books all day.  
                        I'm stressed.

                                 FINLEY
                        Then quit smoking.  

                                 MCCOY
                        You don't want me quitting.  I'd be more 
                        of an asshole than I already am.

           Off Finley, regarding McCoy with contempt.

UNMARKED - MOMENTS LATER

           Finley helps Q into the backseat.  The prisoner eyes McCoy, 
           sizing him up.  Fear tactics. 

           INT. UNMARKED (MOVING) - NIGHT

           McCoy, fidgety, despising the silence.  He turns to Q - idle 
           behind the cage.

                                 MCCOY
                        Skimmed your file, Quentin.  A little 
                        weed, a little speed.  Ten miles over the 
                        limit.  Asshole was just trying to meet 
                        his quota.  Too many people out here 
                        getting away with murder to be worrying 
                        about that shit.

                                 FINLEY
                        Our job is to transport the prisoner, not 
                        engage him in conversation.

                                 Q
                        I blame my whip. 

           The officers pause, listening.

                                 MCCOY
                        Your whip?

                                 Q
                        S-Class, 221.  My new ride.  

                                 MCCOY
                        My dad rolls in one of those.  V-twelve.

                                 Q
                        Mine's diesel.

           McCoy shrugs, jealous.

                                 MCCOY
                        That's cool.

                                 Q
                        Rolling down the Eisenhower, errand to 
                        the burbs.  My girl Kendra blows up my 
                        phone.  All hooting and hollering.  'I 
                        need to talk to you Q.'  I'm like, aight.  
                        Talk.  'But I need to tell you in 
                        person.'

                        That's girls for you.

                                 Q
                        But now she's got my attention and I'm 
                        halfway to where I need to be, so I just 
                        punch it to Crest Hill.  Going so fast I 
                        could see the future. 

                                 MCCOY
                        Bet it didn't help things they saw a 
                        brother behind the wheel.

                                 Q
                        S'why I blame the whip.  Officer smiled 
                        like it was Christmas when he caught me.  
                        Slammed me on the hood and everything.

                                 MCCOY
                           (pointing to his cheek)
                        Been there, chief.

                                 FINLEY
                        What about the hundred grand? 

                                 MCCOY
                        Hundred grand?

           Q looks away, exercising his right to remain silent.

                                 FINLEY
                        If you hadn't just skimmed the report 
                        you'd know the arresting officer found a 
                        hundred thousand dollars in cash stuffed 
                        inside his bookbag.  

                                 Q
                        Yo, that's my money.  Earned every 
                        dollar.  Supports me and my sister.  
                        That's our ticket out.

                                 FINLEY
                        Sure it was yours?  Or Priest's?  I mean, 
                        somebody's gotta do the laundry.  Guy 
                        like that probably has accounts spread 
                        out all over the state.  Am I right?   

                                 Q
                        Yo, I don't wash for nobody. 

                                 FINLEY
                        That what he tells you to say?

                                 Q
                        I don't know about this dude.

                                 MCCOY
                        Me neither.

           EXT. L-TRAIN PLATFORM - SAME NIGHT

           Hanson, Jones, Kenny and fellow MUSCLE ascend the stairs, 
           enter through a caged door - bypassing the turnstiles.  
           Hanson's muscle marked by hard builds, militarized gaits.  
           Professionals. 

           Marching along the abandoned platform, Jones sneaks a playful 
           finger into Hanson's palm, flirting.

           The train doors slide open.  Hanson and his men enter.

           AT THE HEAD OF THE TRAIN

           The MOTORMAN activates the OUT OF SERVICE indicator.  
           Accelerates.

           INT. L-TRAIN - CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Hanson and his men walk the aisle, each grabbing a handle bar 
           - keeping watch.  

           Delegates from all syndicates and their go-to enforcers sit 
           quietly.  Drinking from flasks.  Killing time.

           Hanson stands at the head of car.  Right to business:

                                 HANSON
                        Evening, gentlemen.  Appreciate you all 
                        coming on such short notice.  Time is 
                        money, so brass tacks: Frank Russo is 
                        dead -   

                                 IRISH BOSS
                        Yesterday's news.  Tell us something we 
                        don't know.  Like, who the fuck you are.

           Hanson glances down at the IRISH BOSS (30's), crimson beard, 
           horn-rimmed glasses - Henry VIII with a dash of Elvis 
           Costello.  

                                 HANSON
                        Something you don't know. Well -

           He counts callously with his fingers, going over the facts -

                        I killed Russo.  And I have his heroin.

           The delegates stir, trading WHISPERS, affronted.  The balls 
           on this guy.  

           A RUSSIAN BOSS (50's) speaks up, incredulous, enraged:

                                 RUSSIAN BOSS
                        You've got the nerve, you know?  Frank 
                        was not just an associate, he was my 
                        friend.

           He looks to VICTOR (20's), his Herculean bodyguard, giving 
           the order -

                                 RUSSIAN BOSS  (IN RUSSIAN) (CONT'D)
                        Victor, put down this dog and his bitch.

           Hanson pops a pepto tab as -

           Jones draws her GUN, quickly fixes a suppressor to the 
           barrel.  SHOOTS the Russian boss - his blood painting the 
           adjacent boss's suit.  Jones trains her pistol on Victor - 
           his gun barely drawn.

                                 HANSON
                        Think it over, Grigorovich.  She just put 
                        you in charge of the family.  Power's in 
                        your hands, son.

                                 VICTOR
                        How do you know my name?

           Hanson rolls his eyes, annoyed he has to explain, but -

                                 HANSON
                        Victor Grigorovich.  Five-eleven Hampton 
                        Road.  Wife, Anya; two boys, Felix and 
                        Joseph. And a Boston Terrier named Boris.

           The trains SQUEALS to a stop.  The surroundings: graffitied 
           industrial complexes, miles from downtown.  No man's land.

           Hanson eyes Victor, a direct challenge, as his men carry the 
           corpse of the Russian Boss towards the door -

                                 HANSON (CONT'D)
                        We cool, Victor?

           Victor nods, holsters his weapon like a good boy.

           The doors slide open.  The muscle toss the boss.

                           (to himself)
                        Nobody needs violence. 

           Hanson SNAPS a finger.  Candie Jones pitches him a KILO of H.  
           He holds it high, for all to see.

                                 HANSON (CONT'D)
                        You all want your H?  You buy it from me 
                        now.  All five hundred keys.  

           The stirring heightens.  The JAMAICAN BOSS (30's) pipes up -

                                 JAMAICAN BOSS
                        How much?

                                 HANSON
                        Two-hundred thousand.

                                 JAMAICAN BOSS
                        A kilo?  Mercy.  The Tongs quote at one-
                        fifty -

                                 HANSON
                        Tongs closed shop.  They're out of 
                        business.

                                 JAMAICAN BOSS
                        How do you know?

           Hanson gives a Jones a cryptic look, shifts his gaze back to 
           the Jamaican.

                                 HANSON
                        My price stays at two, non-negotiable.

           The LATIN BOSS (40's) chimes in:

                                 LATIN KING BOSS
                        I'm with him.  What makes you so special?

                                 HANSON
                        Peace, unity.  A fair share for everyone, 
                        so long as you follow my lead.  

                                 LATIN KING BOSS
                        And what do we get in return?  Following 
                        you?

                                 HANSON
                        Immunity.  From all law enforcement

                        I write my own ticket.  And I am your 
                        best option.  Transaction's in 72 hours.  
                        Re-up, or starve.  

           The train SCREAMS to a stop before a platform.  The crime 
           lords trade looks, smiles quickly fading as Hanson and his 
           men empty out.  

           INT./EXT. UNMARKED (MOVING)/STREET (SOUTH SIDE) - LATER

           McCoy, head propped against the window, out.  Q in the 
           backseat, also catching shut-eye.  Finley brakes at a RED 
           LIGHT, scopes the area.  

           ON THE CORNER: A YOUNG MAN in a hoodie, moving for a Caprice - 
           parked idle, tail lights blinking.  He transacts through the 
           passenger window.  Illegal business in plain sight.

           The STOPLIGHT turns green.  Finley jerks the wheel, steers 
           towards the crime.  

           Q stirs awake; McCoy remains comatose.  

           The young man, caught in the headlights, breaks into a 
           sprint, ducks into an alley.  Out of sight.  

           The Caprice tears away from the curb, buys distance.  Getting 
           away.

           Finley pursues.  Angles for the opposite lane, evading 
           multiple collisions.  Weaving like an automotive acrobat.  He 
           eclipses the Caprice.  Cuts it off.  YANKS the brake.  

           Tires lock.  The Caprice rockets into the unmarked, front-end 
           now an accordion.  TOTALED -

           INT. UNMARKED - NIGHT

           McCoy startles awake.  Rattled.  

           Finley, unfastens his seat belt, GUN drawn, BADGE palmed -

                                 FINLEY
                        Don't get me shot.  

           Finley jumps out.

           McCoy fumbles his gun, badge.  Half-asleep.  Way behind.

           Finley circles the Caprice, controlling the scene.

                        Hands on the dash!

           BACKSEAT SUSPECT kicks open the door.  Finley KICKS it right 
           back in, door breaking the suspect's NOSE.

           McCoy hustles for the car, wiping sleep from his eyes.

           Finley rips open the driver's side door, locks on the DRIVER - 
           lowering his hands, reaching for something...

                                 DRIVER
                        You're making a big mistake, pal.

                                 FINLEY
                        Hands where I can see them!

                                 DRIVER
                        We got clearance -

           The Driver goes for the object -

           Finley SHOOTS, grazes the driver's hand.

           McCoy reacts, on edge -

                                 MCCOY
                        The hell was that!?

           The driver GRUNTS, grabbing at the wound.  Drops a BADGE at 
           Finley's feet.  He inspects the tin, engraved: CHICAGO POLICE 
           DEPARTMENT.  Finley drops the badge: no fucking way.

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        Bill!?

           The driver, incensed -

                                 DRIVER
                        C.P.D. dickhead!  We're undercover!

           Finley shakes his head, incredulous.  Wants to crawl into a 
           hole and die.

                                 MCCOY
                        Bill?!

           McCoy, panicked, confused, looks O.C.
                                      (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)           He runs for the unmarked: the BACKSEAT WINDOW has been KICKED 
           OUT - now a shattered sheet of glass on the pavement.  Q is 
           gone.  Coop flown.

           McCoy begins to LAUGH, incredulous, hysterical as -

           Finley moves for the sidewalk, sits on the curb.  Fucked.

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           The Driver, wearing a big frown as a medic wraps his wounded 
           hand.  Another medic tends to the backseat driver - head 
           tilted upward as his nose is set.

           Finley and McCoy on the sidewalk, the latter smoking a 
           cigarette.  Eyes cast down, humiliated.  Keegan paces before 
           them, quietly enraged -

                                 SGT. KEEGAN
                        Those UC's?  They're on the same team, 
                        Bill.  Our side.  They were fishing for a  
                        buyer - another trafficker to lead us to 
                        the H.

                                 FINLEY
                        Sarge -

                                 SGT. KEEGAN
                        And then Ellroy - your prisoner, 
                        Shawshanks his way out of the goddamned 
                        window.  I mean, how the hell do you miss 
                        that?  Look, I don't care how you do it - 
                        find him.  Both of you.  

                                 MCCOY
                        You punishing me for this?  It's his 
                        fault.  Punish him.  Send me home.  Tired 
                        anyway.

                                 SGT. KEEGAN
                        You wanna go home?  Go.  But don't come 
                        back.  Ungrateful prick.  The strings I 
                        had to pull!  You shouldn't even be here.  
                        Make a decision.  Right now.  Work 
                        together, or walk.

           Finley mulls it over, cornered.  Back against the wall.  Off 
           McCoy, hating both options.

           INT./EXT. UNMARKED (MOVING)/STREET - NIGHT

           Motoring along.  Back-end smashed in.  Window kicked out.  
                                (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)

           averted, driving quietly.  An awkward beat.  Then -

                                 FINLEY
                        What?

                                 MCCOY
                        What do you mean 'what'?  You gonna shoot 
                        me, too?

                                 FINLEY
                        Don't tempt me.

                                 MCCOY
                        And how the hell are we supposed to find 
                        Ellroy?  Kid could be in Gary by now.

           Finley draws out the LAPTOP mounted on their dash.  

                                 FINLEY
                        Look, run his name.  Reference known 
                        associates.  

                                 MCCOY
                        I know you're not giving me orders.  
                        Fucking Action Jackson over here killing 
                        my buzz.

                                 FINLEY
                        Work with me.  See if that girlfriend he 
                        was talking about comes up...Kendra.

                                 MCCOY
                        Why the girlfriend?

                                 FINLEY
                        'Cause that's where fools on the run 
                        usually hide.  

                                 MCCOY
                        Gotta get a little pussy before you skip 
                        town, right?

                                 FINLEY
                        Something like that.

           McCoy regards the laptop like a foreign object.  Finley 
           switches it on.

                                 FINLEY (CONT'D)
                        They didn't teach you the system at boot?

           McCoy typing into the laptop -
                                                            (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                 MCCOY
                        The academy?  Didn't attend.  

                                 FINLEY
                        How long were you on patrol before 
                        plainclothes?

                                 MCCOY
                        Four weeks.  Brutal.

           Finley pauses, his silence demanding an explanation. 

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        Don't give me that look.  Like the lady 
                        said, strings were pulled.  Dad's a 
                        lawyer.  Keeps a lot of cops like her out 
                        of trouble.  Glare at him. 

           A MATCH opens on the laptop's screen.

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        We might be in business, chief. I got a 
                        Kendra Daniels in Bronzeville.  210 Ellis 
                        Street.  Worth a shot -

           Finley cuts the wheel, executing a sharp U.  

           McCoy holds tight, Finley accelerating.

           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Finley KNOCKS on the door.  McCoy stands by, tapping out a 
           smoke. 

                                 FINLEY
                        I'll talk.

                                 MCCOY
                        Please.

           KENDRA DANIELS (20's) answers the door, looks the officers up 
           and down.  

                                 FINLEY
                        Kendra Daniels?

                                 KENDRA
                        Ya'll got a warrant?

           Finley looks at McCoy, outsmarted.  Turns back to Kendra.

                        No.  How'd you know we were cops -

McCoy lights a cigarette, 
           moving for the edge of the porch.

                                 MCCOY
                        Good hustle, Bill.  I've seen Jehovah's 
                        Witnesses tally more face time.

           Finley KNOCKS.  No answer.  KNOCKS harder.  

           Then, McCoy, peering into the back alley, spots Q climbing 
           out the side window.  Fleeing.  McCoy turns to Finley, lazy -

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        Found him.

                                 FINLEY
                        Who?

           Finley peers into the alley, sees Q, sprinting away.  

                                 FINLEY (CONT'D)
                        Shit!

           Finley hurtles the PORCH.  Lands it.  McCoy stays put -

                                 MCCOY
                        Do your thing!  I'll catch up!

                                 FINLEY
                        Get your ass down here!  

           McCoy grudgingly steals one last drag of his cigarette.  
           Tosses it.  Clears the porch.  Lands hard on his ass.  
           Stumbles to his feet.  Dragging.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Q - showing no signs of slowing, runs for his life.  

           FINLEY - keeping up, just as fast.

           MCCOY spills into the street, trailing, a bit out of shape.  
           Finley and Q are barely visible.  Just ahead: two YOUNGSTERS 
           pulling wheelies on lowrider bicycles.  McCoy shows his 
           badge, levels KID #1 into the grass.  Steals his bike.

                                 MCCOY
                        Police business!

           He begins to push, catching up.  Then, he stands, pushing 
           faster.  Weaves through sidewalk traffic.  Gaining momentum.

           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)           The kids spit, swear - their only recourse as McCoy flees the 
           scene.

           Q covers another block.  Meets a TAXI.  LEAPS OVER THE HOOD.  
           Still running.

           Finley jumps, slides over the taxi's hood.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Q darting for an OLD BLACK WOMAN entering the building, 
           groceries cradled.  He knocks her over, produce spills.  

           Finley hits the door, helps the old lady to her feet.  She 
           rejects the gesture, swatting him away.  Finley drops her.  

           Q guns for the elevator doors - closing.  He leaps in,  
           crashes into a COUPLE. 

                                 MALE
                        Watch it!

           Q shows a PISTOL tucked in his jeans.  The couple raise their 
           hands, male throwing his wallet at Q's feet.

           Finley nears the closing doors; Q waves goodbye.  The doors 
           SHUT.  Finley watches the NUMBERS climb, top floor: 12.  

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER

           Finley bolts up the stairs - and it's a climb.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER

           McCoy ditches the bike, enters, moving past the embittered 
           old lady -

                                 MCCOY
                        Where'd they go?  

                                 OLD BLACK WOMAN
                        Who?

                                 MCCOY
                        The black dudes!

                                 OLD BLACK WOMAN
                        Kiss my ass, whitey!

           McCoy moves for the elevator, frantically taps 'UP' button.  
           Impatient.  Watches the NUMBERS fall, slow.  He eyes the EXIT 
           for the staircase.

APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER

           McCoy enters.  Looks up, sees Finley nearing the top.  He 
           runs up the stairs.  Instantly loses momentum.  Then, he 
           stops, catching his breath, barely three flights covered.  He 
           turns around, staggers back to the ground floor.  Exits.  
           Refusing the challenge.

           INT. APARTMENT  BUILDING - TOP FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Q spills out of the elevator.  Home free as -

           Finley discharges from the EXIT, weathered.  Meets eyes with 
           Q.  Finley draws.

                                 FINLEY
                        Freeze!

           Q turns, glides for ROOF ACCESS.

           Finley holsters his gun, pursues.  

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Finley emerges, sees Q disassembling his gun, ditching it in 
           a garbage chute - dodging the possession charge.  Then, he 
           leaps from the roof - lands onto the adjacent building.  
           Superhero shit.

           Finley takes a few steps back, bracing himself.  Sprints.  
           Jumps.  Crash-lands the rooftop, rolling.  Back on his feet 
           now as Q enters the rooftop exit.

           STREET LEVEL

           McCoy observes the stunts, jogging along the buildings.  
           Panting.  Sweating gallons. 

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Finley explodes through the entrance, tracks Q - HOPPING FROM 
           FLIGHT-TO-FLIGHT, expediting his escape.

           Finley follows suit, replicating Q's moves.  His foot CATCHES 
           a banister.  He falls hard, tumbles down a flight.  Gets 
           right back up.  Committed.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - Q - CONTINUOUS

           Back on streets.  Tired.  Approaching a DINER on the corner, 
           rounds it.

           Finley, right on Q, cheats path, cutting through the -

           PLOWS INTO Q.  Their bodies rolling on concrete, earning 
           scrapes as -  

           A CAR locks tires, inches from road-killing Finley, Q.  They 
           tussle, each fighting for the advantage...

           EXT. DINER - CONTINUOUS

           McCoy lumbers for the diner, on his last leg.  He cuts into 
           the alley, darts into the -

           INT. DINER - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           KNOCKS over a COOK, falls with him.  Shoves the poor cook 
           away -

                        Get the fuck off me!

           He gets up, wobbles, grabs a TIN OF BEANS on his way out into 
           the dining area...

           EXT. DINER/STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Q KNEES Finley in the groin, disabling him.  He darts away, 
           leaves Finley reeling.  Home free as -

           McCoy explodes out of the entrance, CAN OF BEANS in his grip.  
           He spots Q making a clean getaway, steps back, measuring the 
           distance.  LAUNCHES a Hail Mary, can sailing.  A beat, as the 
           can CRACKS Q over the head.  Grounds him.

           McCoy hunches over, dry heaving.  Finley gets to his feet, 
           running past McCoy - 

                                 FINLEY
                        Nice throw.  

           Rushes Q, drags him by the arm, leading him back towards the 
           diner -

                        Shut-up and cuff me, man.

                                 FINLEY
                        What?

                                 Q
                        You deaf?  I said cuff me, nigga! 

           Finley SOCKS Q in the gut, takes the air out.  Tows him to a 
           parking meter, cuffs him to it. 

           McCoy gets his footing, woozy, notes a small crowd - witness 
           to the episode.  

                                 MCCOY
                        Yo, Bill.

           Finley turns, sees the gathering mob.  He zeros in on a TEEN, 
           recording it all on his mobile.

                                 FINLEY
                        You recording this?

           The teen nods -  

                                 TEEN
                        Putting you on blast, pig.  I'm gonna 
                        make you famous.

           Finley stands motionless, quietly devastated.  A long 
           excruciating beat.  McCoy reads Finley - his common sense 
           fully evacuating self.

                                 MCCOY
                        Bill.  Don't -

           Finley launches himself at the kid - McCoy plays 
           interference, blocks the mad officer.  The mob protects the 
           Teen, his hands thrown up, all bark and swagger -

                                 TEEN
                        Come at me, pig!  Do something!  Do 
                        something!

           Off McCoy and Finley, grappling for dominance.  Fucked again.

           EXT. DINER - LATER

           Curbside bustle.  Cops, photographers, the news.  

           IN AN ALLEY:  Keegan stands before Finley and McCoy.  At a 
           total loss.  McCoy sucks down a gallon of water, hydrating.

                        Just tell me you didn't hit the kid.

           Finley doesn't respond.  Keegan holds his gaze, waiting for 
           him to break.  Then -

                                 MCCOY
                        He didn't hit him.  Just charged him a 
                        little.  Hey, we retrieved our collar 
                        didn't we?

           Keegan stalks away, giving up.  Leaves McCoy and Finley in 
           the alley.

                                 FINLEY
                        Thanks, Jim.

                                 MCCOY
                        No worries, chief.   

           McCoy nearly pats Finley on the back, lowers his hand 
           instead.  Not quite there yet.

           INT. PRECINCT - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Finley, McCoy, Keegan, studying a bandaged Q from behind the 
           two-way mirror: slouched in his seat, feet perched on the 
           table.  Cool as a monk.

                                 SGT. KEEGAN
                           (impatient)
                        Epps should be here by now.  I'm getting 
                        coffee.  Watch him.

           Finley watches her exit.  Moves for the interrogation room.  
           McCoy follows him.  

                                 MCCOY
                        Where you going?

                                 FINLEY
                        Going in.

                                 MCCOY
                        She said watch him.  Didn't say nothing 
                        about interrogating him.  

           Finley opens the door.  McCoy closes it. 

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        Think he's gonna talk to the guy who 
                        assaulted him?

                        I'm better off in there than you are.  
                        Wait for the lieutenants.  Don't be 
                        stupid.

                                 FINLEY
                        They don't know his kind like I do.  Know 
                        the lingo better than anyone in this 
                        department.  Move.

           McCoy steps aside.  

           INT. PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Finley pushing a can of soda before Q, making friends. 

                                               CUT TO:

           INT. PRECINCT - OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           McCoy observing, listening to Finley and Q through LOUD 
           SPEAKER.

                                 FINLEY
                        Been almost an hour.  Ain't thirsty?

                                 Q
                        Can of pop ain't gonna make us friends.

                                 FINLEY
                        Guess I ain't the only one who's been in 
                        that chair before.

                                 Q
                        What'd you do, jack a candy bar?

           Finley looks to the observation window, reaches under the 
           table, flips a TOGGLE SWITCH.  The loud speaker goes dead.  
           McCoy is tuned out.

                                 MCCOY
                        Shit.

           He puts his ear to the glass.  No dice.

                        Candy bar?  I was a soldier.  Had my own 
                        corner and everything.  Shared it with my 
                        brother.  Stack a day, easy.

                                 Q
                        That's it?  Negro, I pull two stacks in a 
                        work day.

                                 Q
                        Whatever.

                                 FINLEY
                        Anyway.  Cop pulled up on us one day.  
                        Lined me and my brother against the wall.  
                        Cleared our pockets in front of the whole 
                        neighborhood.  He had the right, it was 
                        just the way he did it.  Slammed my 
                        brother on the pavement.  Stomped on his 
                        head.   Like it was fun.  Like he was 
                        enjoying it.  So, I reacted.  
                           (beat)
                        Took three officers to pull me off him.  

           He lifts his shirtsleeve, bicep wearing gang ink.

                                 FINLEY (CONT'D)
                        West Ave Mob.  Used to tear shit up.  
                        But, squad was getting out of control.  
                        So, I enlisted.  Joined up with the 
                        Rangers.  Thought I was ducking the 
                        riffraff.

                                 Q
                        Did you escape?  What you was ducking?

           Beat.  Finley shakes his head.

                                 FINLEY

                           (agreeing)
                        No bull.

                                 FINLEY
                        So how long you been pushing for Priest?

           (cid:13)           Q sits back, hands behind his head.  Sharp.

                                 Q
                        Nice try.  But I'm still talking to a 
                        cop.

                                 FINLEY
                        Acting awful gangster for a dude looking 
                        at some sentence.  Already got you on the 
                        reefer.  

                                 Q
                        First offense, fam.  House arrest.  Time 
                        I can sleep through.  And resisting 
                        arrest?  On video I'm the vic.  Maybe I 
                        should be the one asking questions.

           Finley just sits there, tongue-tied.  Bested.

           Keegan enters, fuse short.  Eyes penetrating Finley's.  
           Caught.  

                                 SGT. KEEGAN
                        Priest posted bail. 

           Q levels the can of Coke.  Vindicated. 

                                 Q
                        Justice is served.

                                 SGT. KEEGAN
                        Let's go.

           Keegan leads Q out.  Finley pushes his chair out, follows -

           INT. PRECINCT - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Bumps into a patrolman, calling out -

                                 FINLEY
                        Quentin.  
                           (off Q's turn)
                        Ain't easy saying what's on your mind 
                        around these people.  
                           (eyes on Keegan)
                        They only act like your friends when they 
                        want something from you.  

           He hands Q a card, who reads it.  He smiles, crumples the 
           card, pitches it at Finley.  

                                 Q
                        Thanks for the Coke, Bill.

McCoy catches up, stands beside Finley as Keegan 
           escorts Q to the elevator -

                                 MCCOY
                        What'd did you say to him in there?  
                        After you killed my audio.

           Finley gives him a disagreeable look, in no mood.  Trails 
           off.

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.  Take the 
                        edge off.  Maybe we'll get some strange.

           Finley continues stride, heading for the EXIT.

                                 FINLEY
                        Ain't thirsty and I don't drink. 

                                 MCCOY
                        Then I'll buy you a pop.  We'll shoot 
                        some pool.  Laugh about tonight.

           Finley enters the staircase, SLAMS the door.

           McCoy stands in the hallway, officers brushing past him.  He 
           turns to walk, nearly bumps into a uniform.  Out of sorts,   
           out of place.

           INT. BAR - AFTER HOURS

           The Black Keys wailing bluesy on the jukebox - 'Same Old 
           Thing.'

           McCoy jerks a pool cue, sinks a ball.  He plays alone.  Downs 
           a bottle of beer as a BRUNETTE (late teens) arrives at the 
           pool table, fists around two bottles of domestic.  She places 
           one on the table beside McCoy, who readies the next shot.

                                 MCCOY
                        Thought I was supposed to buy the drinks?

                                 BRUNETTE
                        It's not your beer yet.  Depends on who 
                        you are.

           McCoy sinks another ball.

                                 MCCOY
                        Who I am.  And why's that important?

                                 BRUNETTE

                        Hey, play the game.  Lemme see the tat.

                                 MCCOY
                        Lemme see some ID.

                                 BRUNETTE
                        You a cop?  I'm 21.

           McCoy holds her gaze, serious.

                                 BRUNETTE (CONT'D)
                        All right, 19.  

                                 MCCOY
                        You slip the doorman your number?

                                 BRUNETTE
                        I gave him a number.  Just not mine.

           The brunette points to a herd of females gathered at the bar,  
           stifling giggles.

                                 BRUNETTE (CONT'D)
                        They dared me to ask if you played for 
                        ND.

                                 MCCOY
                        You've seen me play?

                                 BRUNETTE
                        No.  But my dad's a die-hard Irish fan.

           McCoy leans over for another shot, TATTOO peaking out of his 
           sleeve.  The brunette rolls up his sleeve for a full view -

                                 BRUNETTE (CONT'D)
                        Cool.  

                                 MCCOY
                        So, what do you get out of the dare?

           The brunette shrugs, biting her lip, a femme fatale in 
           training -

                                 BRUNETTE
                        I don't know, maybe I get to fuck a 
                        quarterback.

           McCoy sinks the 8-ball.  Drops the pool cue on the table.  He 
           looks her up and down, loving this game -

                        Maybe?

           INT. BAR - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The brunette collides with a mirror, ass mounted on the sink.  
           Her lips meet McCoy's.  He slips a hand under her skirt.  She 
           responds, MOANING.  Her hand stops at his GUN.  She pauses, 
           curious, unbuttons his holster, draws the weapon.  Her finger 
           traces the barrel, slow.

           He places his holster, badge on the towel dispenser.  She 
           feels around his belt, unlocks the handcuffs.  Biting his 
           ear, lips.  Wraps a leg around his waist.  Showtime.

           INT. FINLEY'S APARTMENT - SAME

           Finley executing sit-ups on a decline bench, hugging a forty-
           five pound plate - added strain.

           'THE UNTOUCHABLES' on TV.  Malone and Ness at church. 

                                 MALONE 
                        ...They pull a knife, you pull a gun. He 
                        sends one of yours to the hospital, you 
                        send one of his to the morgue... 

           Finley shadowboxes.  Sharp, rancorous blows.  

                                 MALONE (CONT'D)
                        ...That's the Chicago way! 

           His MOBILE rumbles on the table.  He answers, out of breath -  

                                 FINLEY
                        Hello.

           INTERCUT:

           EXT. STREET CORNER - SAME

           Q, bruised, on his mobile, moving with purpose -   

                                 Q
                        It's me.  

           Finley pauses, not the call he expected -

                        Phone's prepaid, so don't bother calling 
                        back.

                                 FINLEY
                        You're using a burner.  Smart.
                        You alright? 

                                 Q
                        Nope.

                                 FINLEY
                        Priest hurt you?

                                 Q
                        Look, I don't want no part of what he's 
                        getting the squad into.

                                 FINLEY
                        What's he getting ya'll into?

                                 Q
                        Tomorrow at six.  Millennium Park.  I'll 
                        find you.  

           He hangs up the phone.  Tosses it in the gutter.  Rounds a 
           corner.  Then, a SEDAN quietly rolls from the curb.  Follows.

           EXT. SHIPYARD - NIGHT

           Gliding over a legion of shipping containers.  MUZZLE FLASHES 
           strobing between two containers below.

           EXT. SHIPYARD - CONTINUOUS

           A TONG ENFORCER lying in a pool of blood - swearing in 
           Vietnamese.  CANDIE JONES steps over him.  Slaps a magazine 
           into her pistol.  Executes him.  

           She stands amongst a gaggle of corpses, bullet wounds issuing 
           smoke.  Kilos of heroin scattered about - the Tong's supply.  

           SKI-MASKED SHOOTERS collect the kilos, tossing them back into 
           the container.  

           Jones pulls her cell, speed-dials.

                                 CANDIE JONES
                        Almost done.

PENTHOUSE HIGHRISE - BEDROOM 

                                 HANSON
                        So are we.  

           Hanson on the other end, fixed on -

           A TONG BOSS in his underwear, bruised and bound at the foot 
           of his king size.  A CALL GIRL weeps beside him.

                                 HANSON (CONT'D)
                        See you in a few.

           He disconnects.  Kenny stands beside him chewing gum.  
           Silenced pistol at his side.  Hanson pockets his phone, turns 
           to the Tong Boss -

                                 HANSON (CONT'D)
                        I'm burning your supply, your men too.  
                        Competition.  Don't need the headache.  
                        I'd have to match your prices, share 
                        turf, customers.  Times are tight.  Dog-
                        eat-dog, you know.  Funny, you probably 
                        know what dog tastes like.  Kenny.

           Hanson pops a Pepto tab.  Kenny SHOOTS the Tong boss.  The 
           call girl SCREAMS.  Kenny turns the gun on her.  She begs, 
           sopping in sweat, tears -

                                 CALL GIRL
                        He means nothing to me.  He pays me 
                        to...Just let me go.  You'll never see me 
                        again.  Swear.

           Hanson kneels to her level, touches her face, hair, wiping 
           away tears.

                                 HANSON
                        Sorry.  Strictly business.

           Hanson rises, walks away.  Kenny FIRES.

           INT. OCD - SQUADROOM - EARLY EVENING 

           Finley arrives at his desk.  ON HIS MONITOR: YouTube footage 
           of the assault.  He turns to Borkowski and another officer, 
           stifling laughter.

           Santos moves sheepishly for Finley, who sees her approaching.  

                                 FINLEY
                        You got jokes, too?

                        No.  Punk had it coming.
                           (beat; off Finley's 
                            silence)
                        So you lost your cool.  Happens.  Least 
                        you got him back.

           They turn to Jim - snoring at his desk.  Not a care in the 
           world.  Santos shakes her head, feeling Finley's pain -

                                 OFCR. SANTOS (CONT'D)
                        Good luck with that.

           EXT. MILLENIUM PARK - EVENING

           Twenty-five acres of park area situated at the center of 
           town.  Public art, gardens, stragglers.  The sounds of the 
           city are faint, distant.  A quiet refuge for the urban 
           denizen.

           Finley paces, anxious, checks his watch: 7:30 P.M.  

           McCoy on a bench, FLASHLIGHT helping him along THE BAR EXAM 
           FOR DUMMIES, impatient.  He closes the book.  Marches away.

                                 MCCOY
                        Kid clowned us.  Again. 

           Finley takes one last look around the deserted park.  Q isn't 
           coming.

           EXT./INT. UNMARKED/STREET  - LATER

           The unmarked draws up before Q's house.  Finley cuts the 
           engine, unbuckles his seat belt.  McCoy isn't moving.

                                 MCCOY
                        I'll sit this round out.  If he's home, 
                        thank him for shafting us.

                                 FINLEY
                        Fine.  Don't come.  Useless.

                                 MCCOY
                        What?

                                 FINLEY
                        You're useless.  Ellroy called me.  
                        Coulda' pressed charges for what I did, 
                        but he didn't.  With his intel we could 
                        pop Priest, and his supplier.

                        That kind of hustle opens a lot of doors 
                        and I'm not gonna let you fuck it up for 
                        me.  Go on and stay.  Little bitch.  

           Finley climbs out, slams the door.  He fogs the window, 
           writes: BITCH.

           McCoy seethes.

           EXT. ELLROY ROWHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Finley KNOCKS on the door.  No answer.  He tries again.  No 
           dice.  He turns, sees McCoy standing at the foot of the 
           steps.  

                                 MCCOY
                        I'm not a bitch.  And I ain't useless.

           Finley smiles, moving down the steps.  Gets in his face.

                                 FINLEY
                        No?  What are you then?

           McCoy doesn't respond.  

           Finley moves past McCoy, who grabs his shirt.  Finley whirls, 
           lightning in his step, SOCKS him hard in the gut.  McCoy 
           crumples.  And that's what happens when you challenge an ex-
           Ranger to a fight.

           Finley continues for the backyard - McCoy TACKLES him from 
           behind.  They wrestle in the dirt.  Scramble to their feet.  
           Squaring off.

           Finley SIDEKICKS, which McCoy catches, SOCKS HIS GROIN - 
           toppling him.  SWEEPS him.  Gets to his feet, grabs McCoy by 
           the collar, shovels into his body, multiple blows.  McCoy is 
           a punching bag.  He hits the ground again, totaled.  Finley 
           proceeds for the backyard, again.  Then - 

                                 MCCOY
                        Uncle Tom.

           Finley stops, turns -

                                 FINLEY
                        What?

           McCoy spits blood, stumbling to his feet -

                                 MCCOY
                        Think just because you flash a badge 
                        they'll see you any different?  You're 
                        dreaming -
                                                         (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)           Finley charges.  McCoy charges lower - levels him.  Their 
           bodies barrel through the fence, on the way to the unmarked.  
           McCoy tosses Finley, who SPIDERWEBS the back windshield.  

           McCoy holds Finley, liver-punching him.  Finley KNEES his 
           groin.  McCoy visits the pavement. 

           Finley hops off the car, done playing around.

                                 FINLEY
                        Now you gone'n did it.

           And then, in a blink, Finley shows his lethal side.  Applies 
           a trained assault.  Sharp jabs, skilled elbows, fancy 
           footwork.  McCoy is overwhelmed, out-fisted - losing.  Finley 
           takes McCoy's feet from beneath him, KICKS him before he 
           meets the ground.

                                 FINLEY (CONT'D)
                        Peace, motherfucker.

           Finley marches for Q's backyard.  Leaves McCoy writhing on 
           the ground.  Finished.

           EXT. ELLROY ROWHOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Finley rounds the house, LIGHT spilling from the basement 
           door - wide open.  He draws his weapon, proceeds  - FOOTSTEPS 
           from behind.  Finley spins, gun leveled - McCoy raises his 
           hands.  Bloodied.  Pummelled.   

                                 FINLEY
                        You back for more?

                                 MCCOY
                        Not if we're shooting.

           Finley lowers his weapon, points to the door.

                                 FINLEY
                        It was open.  

           He squats, produces a small FLASHLIGHT, spotlights the LOCK 
           on the floor.  Signs of a break-in.

           McCoy reluctantly draws his gun.

                                 MCCOY
                        You first.
                                                                  (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)

ELLROY ROWHOUSE - FINLEY + MCCOY - LIVING ROOM

           Standing before a CORPSE (20's), shot to death, vacant eyes 
           gazing into the television, gun in his grip.  

           McCoy shielding the stench with his shirt-collar.

                                 FINLEY
                        You seen one before?

                                 MCCOY
                        Body?  Once or twice.  Never a murder 
                        vic.  Who is he?

                                 FINLEY
                        Muscle, judging by the build.  Q probably 
                        called in some protection after his spat 
                        with Priest.

           Finley inspects the body, assessing the damage.

                                 FINLEY (CONT'D)
                        Double-taps to the chest.  One in the 
                        head.  Maximizes shock, trauma.  Whoever 
                        they were, they had training.  

                                 MCCOY
                        You a detective now?

           Finley shines a light beneath the sofa.

                                 FINLEY
                        See any casings lying around? 

           McCoy surveys the room, half-assed.

                                 MCCOY
                        Nothing.  Can we call it in now?

                                 FINLEY
                           (ignoring him)
                        Stay close.

           STAIRCASE

           They move up the stairs, cautious.  Finley's gun held low; 
           McCoy's next to his head.  Like he's seen in the movies.

                                 FINLEY (CONT'D)
                        Keep it low.

                                 MCCOY
                        Why?

                        So you don't blow your eardrums if it 
                        goes off.

           They reach the top, alert.  Move down the hall.  McCoy shines 
           a light in a BATHROOM, steps inside.

                                 FINLEY (CONT'D)
                        C'mon, man, here?

                                 MCCOY
                        You shovel-hooked my bladder.  I'm 
                        fucking leaking.

                                 FINLEY
                        Hurry up.  And don't touch anything.

           BATHROOM

           McCoy lifts the toilet seat with his shoe.  Flashes a light 
           on the bowl.  Unzips.  

           HALLWAY

           Finley reaches a room - door closed.  Finley puts a hand in 
           his shirt, uses it to turn the knob.  Enters. 

           He shines a light across the floor before the bed.  
           Disappointment washing over him as he regards:

           Q, laying on his stomach, his hand on a gun he never fired.  
           Two wounds to the back.  One in the head.  A dead body.

           BATHROOM

           McCoy taking a piss.  Then, a faint SOUND from somewhere 
           inside.  He zips up.  Looks at the cabinet below the sink.  A 
           CREAK.  Spooky.

                                 MCCOY
                        Hello?

           He inches for the cabinet - a small figure explodes from 
           inside.  McCoy jumps -

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        Jesus Christ!

           FIRES an errant shot, fragments the wall.  He stumbles, grabs 
           the shower curtain for support.  Falls into the tub.

           down the hall.

           STAIRCASE

           She darts down the stairs - is swept off her feet, a captive 
           in Finley's arms.  He marches up the stairs, ARIANNE (6) 
           kicking and SCREAMING in his grip.

           EXT. ELLROY ROWHOUSE - LATER

           EMTs wheeling out a body bag.  A MALE REPORTER, douchebag tag 
           beneath his lip, standing before the camera, giving the crime 
           scene play-by-play.

           McCoy smokes on the curb beside Arianne - trembling in a 
           blanket. 

           The Reporter and his crew make their way to McCoy and 
           Arianne.

                                 REPORTER
                        That her?  That the sister?

                                 MCCOY
                        Not now.

           The reporter kneels to her level, ignoring McCoy.

                                 REPORTER
                        Arianne, I'm a reporter with Channel 5. 

           Arianne doesn't respond, gaze fixed straight ahead.  In a 
           daze.

                                 REPORTER (CONT'D)
                        Arianne?

                        Three.

ELLROY ROWHOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           EMTs zip up Q.  Cart his body out.  Epps and Barlow inspect 
           the room.  Epps lifts Q's mattress, unearths a small cache of 
           WEAPONS.  Tosses the mattress.

                                 LT. BARLOW
                        That's a lot of chrome.

                        What're you thinking?

                                 LT. EPPS
                        Priest.  Maybe.  Probably ordered the 
                        hit.  

                                 LT. BARLOW
                        So we lean on him.

                                 LT. EPPS
                        On a conspiracy hunch?  Dead-end street, 
                        partner.  Toss it to homicide.  It'll go 
                        cold in a day.

           They remove their gloves, satisfied.

                                 FINLEY (O.S.)
                        Ballistics found no shell casings.  
                        Forensics?  No prints that don't belong 
                        to the occupants of the house.

           Barlow turns to Finley, standing by.  

                                 LT. EPPS
                        We heard.  What's your point?

           Epps nods to Barlow.  They march out of the bedroom.  Finley 
           follows as they head down the stairs.

                                 FINLEY
                        The usual suspects?  They never leave a 
                        scene this clean.  If Priest ordered it, 
                        he outsourced the work.  

                                 LT. BARLOW 
                        You're not giving his bangers enough 
                        credit.

                        Put me with homicide.  Another body might 
                        expedite the investigation, keep it from 
                        going cold.

                                 LT. EPPS
                        Homicide's got all the help they need.  
                        And I got a morgue full of Tongs.  Bodies 
                        were cooked, along with their latest 
                        shipment of H.

                                 FINLEY
                        Think whoever stole Russo's smack is 
                        sending a message to the buyers?

                                 LT. BARLOW
                        You know the priority.  Expedite that.  
                        Officer.

           They exit, leave Finley standing at the door, dejected.  
           Stung.  An OFFICER bumps shoulders with Finley - in the way.  
           Finley steps back, watches the officer yellow-tape the door.  
           Cutting him off.

           McCoy observing through the two-way -

           INT. PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME

           As Santos sits before a blank steno, tapping the paper with 
           her pencil.  Arianne sits frozen in place, traumatized.  

                                 OFCR. SANTOS (O.S.)
                        She's experiencing acute stress.  
                        Symptoms could worsen in a few days.  
                        Once reality settles.  

           INT. PRECINCT - OBSERVATION ROOM - MCCOY, SANTOS - CONTINUOUS

           Watching Arianne through the two-way as she stares at crayons 
           and a coloring book, in no mood to color.

                                 MCCOY
                        What about her parents?  

                                 OFCR. SANTOS
                        Forget it.  Father was killed a year 
                        after she was born. Mother OD'd when she 
                        was two.  Ellroy was all she had.  
                        Break room's got a spare couch.  I'll 
                        take her to CPS in the morning.

                        A group home ain't exactly the wolves, 
                        Jimmy.

                                 MCCOY
                        You seen the living conditions?  Precious 
                        little thing like that's fresh meat.

                                 OFCR. SANTOS
                        It's her only option at this point.

           Beat.  McCoy steals another look at Arianne.  Feeling for 
           her.

                                 MCCOY
                        I'll stay the night.  Take her to CPS 
                        first thing.  

                                 OFCR. SANTOS
                        You sure?

           McCoy is serious for once.

                                 MCCOY
                        Go home.

                                 OFCR. SANTOS
                        All yours.

           They move for the door:

                                 MCCOY
                        Can I ask you something?

                                 OFCR. SANTOS
                        Shoot.

                                 MCCOY
                        When you masturbate, you thinking about 
                        Bill?

                                 OFCR. SANTOS
                        No, but I bet you are.

                                 MCCOY
                        Hands?  Batteries?  Both?

           She slams the door.  McCoy turns to Arianne, watches her 
           through the two-way.  His smile fading.

           (cid:13)           INT. NIGHTCLUB - AFTER HOURS

           Bodies on the floor.  Drunk, wet, horny.  A DJ works the 
           tables.  Remixing Kanye.

           INT. NIGHTCLUB - VIP AREA - CONTINUOUS

           Roped off and smoke-filled.  The walls lined with imported 
           furniture.  Rococo tables hosting tumblers filled with 
           straight doses of vodka, cognac.  Gangster's paradise.

           Priest sits in a corner, KENDRA sitting beside him.  Her arms 
           crossed, looking ill.   Priest looks stressed.  Medicates the 
           tension with cognac.  Hanson to his left, scotch at the 
           ready.  He's loose, tipsy -

                                 HANSON
                        Relax, Ray.  It was clean.  I hear CPD'll 
                        cold the case by morning - not that they 
                        give a shit anyway.  They've got real 
                        work to do. 

           Hanson notes a catatonic Kendra beside Priest, curious.

                                 HANSON (CONT'D)
                        Jesus, what do you got her on?  Girl's 
                        lost in space.

           Priest leans into Hanson's ear, whispers -

                                 PRIEST
                        That's Q's woman.  Thinks I did it.

           Hanson talks lower, ensuring Kendra can't hear -

                                 HANSON
                        You're not worried she'll talk?

                                 PRIEST
                        She knows better.  Round my way, they all 
                        know better.

           A nearby ENFORCER interrupts, nodding to the FLAT SCREEN 
           hanging above Priest, Hanson -

                                 ENFORCER
                        Yo, Ray.  Peep the T.V.  

                                 PRIEST
                        What is it?

                                 ENFORCER
                        Bad news.

                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                 PRIEST
                        This better be good.

           Priest and Hanson look behind them, see: footage of McCoy 
           SOCKING the Reporter, Arianne in his grip.

                                 PRIEST (CONT'D)
                        The hell's she doing with that cop?

                                 HANSON
                        Who's she?

           Priest stands, pissed.

                                 PRIEST
                        His sister, motherfucka!  You watching 
                        the same TV?!  

           Kendra smiles, a small victory amidst the tragedy.

           Priest walks for the bar, on edge.  Hanson follows.

                                 PRIEST (CONT'D)
                        I may be hood, but I'm a professional.  
                        This comes back to bite me, I ain't gonna 
                        be happy.  And I'll let it be known.  
                        Make sure nobody puts money in your 
                        pocket.

           Priest SHAKES his glass at the BARTENDER, who refills it.

                                 HANSON
                        And what would you have to sell, Ray?

                                 PRIEST
                        I'll go through a recession before I go 
                        to jail.  You're about to be bad for 
                        business. 

           Hanson, poker-faced, pushed too far -

                                 HANSON
                        Let's get something straight, I am the 
                        business.  There's a solution to every 
                        problem and you better believe I'm going 
                        to see to the problem.  But you cross me, 
                        I'll make corpses out of every one of 
                        your knucklehead bangers.  Just like that 
                        rat errand boy.  Without me you ain't 
                        shit on the street.

                                 HANSON (CONT'D)
                        Your whiskey's turned.  See you in a few, 
                        Super Fly.

           Priest stands down, remembers his place.  Hanson abandons the 
           bar.  Moves through the crowd.  Candie Jones joins him on the 
           way out, passing -

           FINLEY, who moves deeper into the club.  Arrives at the VIP 
           Area, manned by a club SENTRY.

           Finley shows his BADGE.  The sentry steps aside.

           EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Hanson and Jones spill into the alley.  Kenny stands by their 
           vehicle, waiting.

                                 HANSON
                        Start the car.

           Kenny climbs in.  Fires up the engine.  

           Jones looks to Hanson -

                                 CANDIE JONES
                        Something wrong?

           Hanson CLOCKS her.  She slams into the car.  Winded.

                                 HANSON
                        You didn't see her?

                                 CANDIE JONES
                        Who?

                                 HANSON
                        His goddamned sister!  

           He throws another punch.  Jones blocks it.  

                                 CANDIE JONES
                        I didn't know he had one -

                                 HANSON
                        She was in the house!

           He shoves her to the cement.  Kneels beside her, levels a 
           fist.  A tense BEAT, then he caresses her face, tender -

           INT. NIGHTCLUB - VIP AREA - CONTINUOUS

           Finley stands facing Priest.  Kendra, fear-ridden, remains 
           beside the kingpin.  His thugs are slouched nearby, waiting 
           for a reason.  Another one moves behind Finley.  The rookie 
           is surrounded. 

                                 PRIEST
                        You pay cover, newblood?  Or d'you flash 
                        the bling?

                                 FINLEY
                        How you know I'm a rookie?

                                 PRIEST
                        This my turf, son.  I know about all the 
                        pork patrolling my district.

           Finley meets eyes with Kendra, hoping she's listening.  

                                 FINLEY
                        I found Quentin.

                                 PRIEST
                        You did?  He say anything to you?

           Priest chuckles, looks to his hoods.  They join in.

           Finley smiles, KNOCKS the table over, spilling cognac.  
           Charging Priest -

           The hoods respond, grab Finley before he can pounce.  

                                 PRIEST (CONT'D)

                        have a real talk.

           They drag Finley towards the back.  

           Priest straightens his shirt, looks to his enforcer -

                                 PRIEST (CONT'D)

           Sits beside Kendra, her tears streaming.

           INT. NIGHTCLUB - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Finley, locked in the hoods grip, wrestled into the kitchen.  
           Priest trails behind.  He turns off the stove pilots, barking 
           at the cooks -

                                 PRIEST
                        Everybody take five.  Smoke, drink, piss, 
                        just get the fuck out my kitchen.

           The help obeys, filing out.

           Priest grabs a towel hanging over the sink, runs hot water 
           over it.  Daubs his face.  Then, he marches for Finley, 
           grabbing a BUTCHER KNIFE from the counter on the way.  Face-
           to-face now -

                                 PRIEST (CONT'D)
                        Think you can come play gangster in my 
                        club?  

           He puts the knife in his left hand.  Shovels a RIGHT-HOOK in 
           Finley's gut.  

                                 PRIEST (CONT'D)
                        Motherfucker, you need an invite to do 
                        that.

           Finley spits, hunched over, still here -

                                 FINLEY
                        I won't need shit when I arrest you for 
                        killing Ellroy.  

           Priest grabs Finley's face, so he's listening -

                                 PRIEST
                        Lemme tell you something about that boy,

           drag Finley out.

           INT. DODGE CHALLENGER (MOVING) - MORNING 

           Morbid silence.  McCoy YAWNING behind the wheel, stealing 
           glances of Arianne - dazed, confused.

           He pops open a Red Bull, dumps half out the window.  Readies 
           his flask.  Sees:

           Arianne, staring at him curiously.  

           McCoy pockets the flask, sips the Red Bull.

                                 MCCOY
                        Wanna hear some music?

           No response.

           He switches on the radio: 50 Cent rhymes spitefully, trailed 
           by simulated GUNFIRE.  McCoy powers off.  Drums the wheel, 
           eager to break the ice.  Then, he glimpses - 

           GOLDEN ARCHES, materializing in the distance.  A moment of 
           clarity.

           INT. MCDONALDS - MORNING

           McCoy wolfing down a McMuffin, shovelling hashbrowns.  He 
           washes it down with O.J.  

           Arianne stares at her meal - no appetite to speak of.

                                 MCCOY
                        You're one tough broad turning down a 
                        Happy Meal.  

           He digs in her happy meal, excavates hashbrowns.  Eats.

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        Better stop me.  McMuffin's next.

           Arianne just looks at him, puzzled, unyielding.  He unwraps 
           the toy, pushes it toward her.  She wants nothing to do with 
           it.  McCoy sits back, thinking.  Then -

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        Be right back.

Arianne smiles, sort 
           of.

           EXT. CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES (CPS)/ INT. DODGE CHALLENGER - 
           LATER

           The Challenger draws up to the curb.

           McCoy looks to the passenger seat: Arianne lays dead asleep, 
           traces of ice cream blotting her mouth, cheeks.  McCoy uses 
           the foot of his shirt, cleans her face.

                                 MCCOY
                        We're here. 

           She doesn't hear him, comatose.

           INT. CPS - RECEPTION - MORNING

           McCoy carries Arianne inside.  Stops before the RECEPTIONIST, 
           free hand digging out his badge.

                                 MCCOY
                        Officer James McCoy.  

           He turns, shows Arianne dozing on his shoulder.

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        We have an appointment.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                           (presenting a clipboard)
                        Sign-in.  Someone will be right with you.

           McCoy grabs a pen.

           INT. CPS - WAITING AREA - LATER

           A CHILD (10), sitting across from McCoy and Arianne, waiting 
           to be handed over.  He wears a long face, miserable.  His 
           escort, a uniformed officer, is busy texting.  Indifferent.

           Arianne studies the waiting area; it's cold, sterile.  
           Lonely.  She unconsciously fiddles with the fabric of McCoy's 
           jacket arm, looking for comfort, safety.

           McCoy pauses, unsure how to proceed.

                                 ARIANNE
                        I don't like it here.  I want my brother.

           McCoy purses his lips, angry, feeling her pain.

                        I know you do.

           INT. OCD - PRE-DUSK

           Finley staring into his computer, printing KENDRA DANIELS 
           record. 

           Epps spots Finley from behind, strolls for him, grabs the 
           printout...  

                                 LT. EPPS
                        Kendra Daniels.  Ellroy's girlfriend.  
                        Homicide tried talking to her last night.  
                        Girl didn't say shit.  Case closed.

           Crumples it.  Barlow observes from behind him.   

                                 FINLEY
                        She didn't say anything cause she's 
                        scared.

           McCoy enters, steps slowly for the exchange.

                                 LT. EPPS
                        Last I checked your badge didn't say 
                        homicide.  Five-hundred kilos, junior.  
                        Get to work.  You're wasting my time.

                                 FINLEY
                        Since when is a murder investigation a 
                        waste of time?

                                 LT. EPPS
                        Ellroy was a 'banger.  Dime a dozen in 
                        this city.  More of his kind mopped up 
                        the better - 

           Finley launches at Epps - MCCOY blocks his path.  Saves 
           Finley from losing his job.  Tows him out.

           Epps smiles, asking for it.

                                 LT. EPPS (CONT'D)
                        Better get your priorities in check, 
                        junior.  You don't want me talking to 
                        your Captain.  All I gotta do is take the 
                        stairs.

           INT. PRECINCT - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Finley bursts through the doors, disgruntled.  McCoy draws up 
           beside him, attentive -
                                         (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 MCCOY
                        You cool?

                                 FINLEY
                        Nope.

                                 MCCOY
                        Me neither.  Let's take a ride.  

           Finley stops, unsure where McCoy is taking this.  McCoy opens 
           the door to the EXIT stairs.  He turns, hurried -

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        C'mon, I'm driving.  Let's get some air.

           Finley proceeds, dragging his feet through the exit.

           INT. UNMARKED - CONTINUOUS

           McCoy starts the engine, reads Finley - on fire.  McCoy cuts 
           the engine -

                                 MCCOY
                        Fuck Epps.  No, scratch that.  Fuck the 
                        police and their goddamned priorities. 
                        Ellroy was a dealer - a criminal.  But 
                        some asshole took him from a six-year-old 
                        girl who loved him.  Turned her into an 
                        orphan.  And that shit ain't right.

                                 FINLEY
                        Yeah?  And what're we gonna do?  Talk to 
                        Kendra?  Get her to play ball?

                                 MCCOY
                        It's a start.

                                 FINLEY
                        Did you hear Epps -

                                 MCCOY
                        And I said fuck Epps!  

                                 FINLEY
                        Jim, we go digging any deeper, they'll 
                        take our shields, our jobs.  Win or lose, 
                        we'll go down.  You up for that?

           McCoy, his game face on -

                                 MCCOY
                        Whatever it takes.

           Chicago's finest quickly evaporating.  

                                 FINLEY
                        Fuck Epps.  

                                 MCCOY
                        There you go.

           McCoy fires up the engine.  

           Finley begins to smile, can't believe he's saying -

                                 FINLEY
                        Fuck the police.

           McCoy puts the car in reverse -

                                 MCCOY
                        That's right.  Fuck the police.  

                                 FINLEY
                        Fuck the police!

           He puts it in DRIVE.  

           They peel out of the garage.  Galvanized.  Into the night.

           KNOCKING, O.S.

           EXT. KENDRA'S ROWHOUSE - NIGHT 

           PATRICE (50s), Kendra's mother, opens the door, long grey 
           locks tied in a bun, body built by yoga.  

           Finley prepares to draw his badge -

                                 FINLEY
                        I'm officer William Finley -

           Patrice CLOSES the door - Finley stops it with his foot.  
           Determined.  He talks through the gap -

                                 FINLEY (CONT'D)
                        We just need to talk to Kendra, Ms. 
                        Daniels.

                                 PATRICE
                        She already talked to the police.  Leave 
                        my girl alone.

           She jerks the door - McCoy grabs the frame with his HAND.  
           She releases the door, overpowered.

                        She didn't talk to us.  

           A beat, Patrice staring at the ground, wanting this to stop.  
           She looks up at the officers -

                                 PATRICE
                        She's at work right now.

                                 MCCOY
                        Where's work?

           EXT. WALGREENS - BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           Finley pacing, frustration rising.  McCoy leans against a 
           dumpster, playing with his lighter. 

           Kendra stands against the wall - in Walgreens apparel, 
           vehemently shaking her head.  Refusing to answer their 
           questions.

                                 KENDRA
                        I told you, I said what I had to say to 
                        homicide.  Ya'll taking up my break time 
                        with this shit.

                                 MCCOY
                        Did you say what you really knew?

                                 KENDRA
                        So I can end up like Quentin?  Ya'll 
                        should know better.  And what about his 
                        sister?

                                 MCCOY
                        She's safe.

                                 FINLEY
                        Hey, we're taking a big risk talking to 
                        you.  Our people, they're fine putting 
                        this thing away cold.  Quentin's just 
                        another number to them.  One less problem 
                        they gotta worry about.  

           Kendra looks to McCoy.

                                 MCCOY
                        He's right.  You wanna stick it to the 
                        cops?  Tell us what we need to know.

           A long beat.  Kendra looks at them, a cold chill running up 
           her spine -

                        He thinks 'cause Quentin worked for him, 
                        that somehow he owns me.

                                 MCCOY
                        Who?

                                 KENDRA
                        He won't leave me alone.  Assholes's been 
                        calling me.  Making threats.  Telling me 
                        to practice my answers should ya'll come 
                        around.

                                 FINLEY
                        Give us a name.

                                 KENDRA
                        I tell you who it is and you put him 
                        down, hear me?  This dude's just as 
                        strong inside.

           Finley approaches her, carefully -

                                 FINLEY
                        Please.

           Off Kendra, trembling.  Fear personified.

           INT. OCD - KEEGAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Keegan storms inside through, mind made up -

                                 SGT. KEEGAN
                        Absolutely not.

           Finley and McCoy trail closely behind, hot-blooded -

                                 FINLEY
                        Girl's willing to testify.  Priest 
                        ordered that hit.  

                                 MCCOY
                        She's got voicemails, call lists ID-ing 
                        his land line.  Green light this shit, so 
                        we can do our thing -

           She SLAMS the door, direct -

                                 SGT. KEEGAN
                        Siddown!

           Finley takes a chair.  McCoy plants himself at the edge of 
           her desk, posing.  
                                          (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                 SGT. KEEGAN (CONT'D)
                        Does my desk look like a chair?

           McCoy rises, takes a chair beside Finley.  

                                 SGT. KEEGAN (CONT'D)
                        You want to go back to patrol?  Sweat it 
                        out in the cap and uniform for the rest 
                        of your life?  'Cause that's where you're 
                        going if you keep this up.

                                 FINLEY
                        If I get demoted busting Priest, cover me 
                        in blue.  

                                 MCCOY
                        Amen.

           Keegan sinks into her chair, facing her eager employees, 
           mulling it over -

                                 SGT. KEEGAN
                        And Kendra, you really buy her angle.

                                 MCCOY
                        She was spooked.  I'm sold.

           Keegan shifts focus to Finley, eyes asking for the honest 
           truth -

                                 SGT. KEEGAN
                        Bill?  My ass is on the line, too. 

                                 FINLEY
                        It's a win-win, Sarge.  We play this 
                        right, squeeze him enough, may even get 
                        that H ya'lls are looking for.

           A beat.  Keegan coming to a decision.  She picks up the 
           phone, her eyes drilling into the rookies -

                                 SGT. KEEGAN
                        You go with backup.

           Finley and McCoy share a look, a small victory.

                                 FINLEY
                        You got it.

                                 SGT. KEEGAN
                        Borkowski and Santos.  You take their 
                        lead, or I hang up.  Don't fuck me on

                        Trust us, we would never, ever fuck you -

           Finley looks away, saves himself from laughing. 

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        Ever.

           Keegan wants to throw the receiver at McCoy.  Dials instead. 

           INT. CPS - RECEPTION - DAY

           Candie Jones, healing from Hanson's drubbing, stands before 
           the receptionist.  Peeved.

                                 CANDIE JONES
                        Arianne with two n's.  Last name Ellroy.

           The receptionist is typing away.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Nothing.

                                 CANDIE JONES
                        A police officer brought her here 
                        yesterday.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        I'm sorry.  Not pulling up anyone by that 
                        name in our database.

           Candie picks up the check-in clipboard, impatient.

                                 CANDIE JONES
                        Where's yesterday's?

           INT. UNMARKED CRUISER (MOVING) - MORNING

           Borkowski in the passenger seat, lap hosting five opened  
           packs of sugar.  He tears open his sixth, pours it into a 
           large cup of coffee. 

           Santos drives, sipping coffee.  She adjusts the rearview, 
           verifies Finley and McCoy are still behind them.  

           INT. UNMARKED CRUISER (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           Finley motors close behind, sees Santos's watchful eyes 
           through her rearview, liking that she cares.  McCoy in the 
           passenger seat, his voice groggy -
                                         (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)

                        Dicked around for a while as a paralegal.  
                        Got fired after three weeks. Too many 
                        "smoking breaks."  Before that I was a 
                        commentator for ESPN 2.  Got canned after 
                        the first game.  'Incendiary remarks.'

                                 FINLEY
                        What'd you say?

                                 MCCOY
                        Wished cancer on Miami's quarterback.  
                        Couple viewers called the network.  
                        People are fucking sensitive.  Badge was 
                        just the next job.  How 'bout you?  Lemme 
                        guess.  Your brother got capped and the 
                        police never caught the guy.  Am I close? 

           Finley freezes, provoked.  Gives McCoy a hard look.  A BEAT.  
           McCoy realizing he's gone too far.

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        Yo.  Dude, I'm sorry.  I had no idea.  
                        I'm an asshole.  I -

           Finley smiles, breaking the tension.

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        Jesus!  Think that's funny?

                                 FINLEY
                        Nah, he's alive.  Locked up, but he's 
                        here.  Wasn't always this law-abiding, 
                        you know.  I used to be a troublemaker.  
                        In the DNA, I guess.  Anyway, got 
                        collared for some shit I shouldn't have 
                        gotten into.  Did six months in juvie.  
                        Day of my release, on my way out, guard 
                        said something like he'd see me soon.  
                        You know, anticipating my return.  
                        Something about that just - I swore I'd 
                        spend the rest of my life proving that 
                        asshole wrong.  It's like, if I became 
                        the best of my enemy, I was winning.

                                 MCCOY
                        Well, Bill, lemme be the first to say 
                        you're doing a shit job.  You should 
                        quit.  Like, now.

           Finley smiles, warming up to McCoy's sarcasm.

STREET - MORNING

           Borkowski and Santos, checking weapons, slipping into KEVLAR.  
           Gearing up.  Finley, McCoy stand close by, watching 
           curiously, like they've never done this before.

                                 OFCR. BORKOWSKI
                        Wife and daughter are gonna give me shit.  
                        Serving this arrest's a complete 
                        imposition on family time.

           He tosses two vests to Finley and McCoy -

                                 OFCR. BORKOWSKI (CONT'D)
                        You two are lucky I hate family time.

           EXT. STREET - THE OFFICERS - MORNING

           Moving down the morning sidewalk.  Santos sneaks a glance at 
           Finley, quietly lusting.  McCoy catches her looking, gestures 
           fellatio.  She flips the BIRD. 

           EXT. PRIEST RESIDENCE - MORNING

           Borkowski and McCoy climb the steps of the 19th century 
           palace.  Regal.  Pillared.  Easy living for the South Side's 
           reigning crime lord. 

           Borkowski nudges McCoy, nods to a SECURITY CAMERA perched 
           above the door.

           EXT. PRIEST RESIDENCE - ALLEY - MORNING

           Santos and Finley glide down the alley, opening the gate to a 
           fence.  Crossing into the yard.  Both eager to engage, 
           neither knowing how.  They arrive at the door, trade fleeting 
           glimpses.  Santos quietly SIGHS.  Waiting.

           EXT. PRIEST RESIDENCE - MORNING 

           TANISHA (30s) opens the door.  Morning hair, resentful eyes.  
           Lips pursing her first cigarette of the day, half-smoked.  

                                 TANISHA
                        Ya'll boys know what time it is?

                                 OFCR. BORKOWSKI
                        Yes we do.  S'why we thought the early 
                        hour'd be the best time to speak to Mr. 
                        Priest. 

           He shows her the WARRANT.  She looks over Borkowski and McCoy 
           skeptically.

                        Well, come on an' get him.

           The officers trade looks.  That was easy.

           EXT. PRIEST RESIDENCE - ALLEY - DAY 

           Santos checks her mobile.  A text reads: INSIDE.

           INT. PRIEST RESIDENCE - HALLWAY - DAY 

           Tanisha leads Borkowski and McCoy inside the surprisingly  
           spacious corridor of the house, her feet lazily slapping the 
           polished wood as they move deeper inside.  A covetous

                        Can I interest ya'll in a beverage?  It's 
                        slim pickins.  Got O.J., C.J. and cognac.  

           McCoy is only half-listening, distracted, captivated by the 
           eccentric surroundings.  Warhol meets the mean streets.

                        It's five o'clock somewhere.

                                 TANISHA
                        Ray likes himself some soy milk, but 
                        that's off limits.

                        We're fine.

           She heads up the stairs, calling after Priest.  

           A tense, eerie silence as McCoy loiters, appreciating the 
           gangster's palace.  

                                 MCCOY
                        Asshole's got class.  You see all this, 
                        B?

           Borkowski shifts in place, impatient.  Ready to go.  

                                 OFCR. BORKOWSKI
                        Yeah, I see it.  Stay close, alright?  
                        Don't touch anything.

           A melody thumping from the living room, synthesized, very 
           80's.  McCoy begins humming, identifying the tune.  He peeks 
           into the living room, sees EDDIE MURPHY projected on a wall, 
           singing in the studio.  McCoy quietly sings along -

                        ...My girl wants to party all the time, 
                        party all the time, party all the time.

           Borkowski shakes his head, unamused...

                                 BORKOWSKI
                        Knock it off -

           Turns to face a SHOTGUN BLAST, knocking him off his feet -

           Tanisha RACKS the shotgun, FIRES at McCoy, who DIVES into the 
           living room.  

           INT. PRIEST RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Finley KICKS through the kitchen doors, Santos right behind 
           him.  Guns up -  

           A HOOD SPRAYS fire from an Uzi - 

           Santos TACKLES Finley beneath a table.  Finley PLUGS the 
           hood's leg, who drops, taking aim at the officers.  Santos 
           FIRES first.  Drills him.

           INT. PRIEST RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           McCoy grabs the coffee table.  Shields himself as a shotgun 
           BLAST rips through the wood - inches from his head.  He 
           THROWS the table.  Tanisha BLOWS another hole through the 
           table as it sails in her direction, LEVELS her.

           INT. PRIEST RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - FINLEY & SANTOS - MORNING

           Advancing through the house.  Another HOOD emerges from 
           behind the wall, NAILS Santos.  She slams the ground. 

           The hood hugs the wall - out of harms way. 

           Finley FIRES through the wall - draining his clip.  Drops 
           him.  Dead.

           INT. PRIEST RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           McCoy stumbles out into the hallway, winded, then -

           TANISHA jumps McCoy's back, her elbows strangling.  Back in 
           the living room, losing air, caught in the projector's beam 
           as Eddie and Rick James jam in the studio.

PRIEST RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Finley tends to Santos - fighting off her vest, bullet 
           pancaked into the armor - BANG! BANG! BANG!  Roars by 
           Finley's ear.  He hits the deck, weapon up.

           RAYMOND PRIEST, pistol gripped, is already fleeing. 

                                 FINLEY
                        Freeze!

           Finley sprints through the hall, stops before Borkowski, who 
           writhes on the floor, clutching a wound below the belt.

           INT. PRIEST RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           McCoy GRABS Tanisha's arms, FLIPS her over his head, slamming 
           her onto the floor.  He holds her still, PUNCHING her like 
           she's a guy.  Cuffs her.

           INT. PRIEST RESIDENCE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Finley BARKS into his WALKIE as Santos tends to Borkowski.

                                 FINLEY
                        Adam-six to dispatch.  Requesting a 10-45 
                        at 803 South Harper!  Send an ambulance!  

           Finley lobs Santos the walkie -  

                                 FINLEY (CONT'D)
                           (re: Borkowski)
                        Stay with him.

           Breaks for the entrance.  

           EXT. STREET - MORNING

           Priest huffing for a GARBAGE TRUCK.  A GARBAGE MAN climbs 
           off, collects a bin.  Priest opens the driver's side door, 
           grabs the DRIVER - gunpoint.  Drops him out onto the 
           pavement.  Takes the seat.  Drives.

           The garbage man watches the truck speed away, holding the 
           bin. 

           Finley closes in, blowing past the garbage man, racing for 
           the truck.

           McCoy explodes from the house, catching up.

           The truck makes a sharp turn...

           moving truck, his body colliding with heavy metal, holding on 
           for dear life. 

           McCoy watches in awe as a loud HORN roars from behind.  McCoy 
           spins.  Faces a CITY BUS.  He holsters his pistol.  Rushes -

           INT./EXT. CITY BUS(MOVING)/ STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Inside.  McCoy flashes his BADGE, addressing the DRIVER, 
           morning commuters -

                                 MCCOY
                        Everyone off the bus!  Police business!  
                        Please!

           Passengers GROAN, rolling their eyes, taking their time. 

           Finally, McCoy draws his PISTOL, desperate.  SHOOTS out a 
           window.  Taking control -

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        Are you deaf!?  Get off the fucking bus!

           Passengers REACT.  Empty out like their lives depend on it.

           McCoy yanks the driver out of her seat, pushing her out with 
           the others.  Takes the wheel.  PUNCHES it.  

           The bus turns hard - hugging the curb. Sideswipes a STOP 
           SIGN.  GRINDS along a line of parked cars, scraping paint.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Finley holding tight to the compactor - inching for the 
           driver's side door.  He opens it - looks into the barrel of 
           Priest's gun.  Finley GRABS the firing hand - BANG!  Goes an 
           errant shot.  He loses his footing, hanging from the door.  

           Priest FIRES again - Finley ducks below the window, glass 
           giving a quick shower.

           Priest glimpses the road - BRAKES before a parked sedan.  Too 
           late and too fast.  The RIGHT TIRES climb.  Pancake the 
           sedan.

           The truck continues, barrels through a RED LIGHT.  Leaves 
           multiple collisions in its wake.
                              (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)

           McCoy approaches the RED LIGHT.  BRAKES.  Jerks a sharp 
           RIGHT, avoiding the pile-up.  MERGES, as the bus fights to 
           stay on all fours.  McCoy steps on it.  Continues the charge.

           INT./EXT. GARBAGE TRUCK (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           Finley, clinging to the door, pulls himself up.  Pissed.  He  
           PUNCHES through the window, connects with Priest, who levels 
           his pistol.  Finley makes a grab, the two wrestling for the 
           gun.  SHOTS ringing wayward.

           INT./EXT. CITY BUS (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           McCoy executes a sharp left.  Aligns the bus parallel with 
           the GARBAGE TRUCK.  

           The commercial vehicles are now racing.  The city block 
           between them creating makeshift, industrial-sized lanes.

           McCoy accelerates, pushing the needle.

           INT./EXT. GARBAGE TRUCK (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           Finley pummels Priest.  Priest counters with a PISTOL-WHIP to 
           the head.  Finley nearly loses his footing, grip.  Hangs from 
           the swinging door. 

           Priest readies the gun, hand on the wheel, smiling as he 
           locks on Finley.  

           Finley looks beyond Priest, shock registers; whatever he 
           sees, it's big.  Then, Finley leaps off the truck just as -

           The bus PLOWS into the garbage truck.  Topples it.  

           Priest is ejected from the window, body scraping cement.  
           Then, the TRUCK LANDS ON PRIEST, crushing him.  Coasting on 
           its side.  Leaving a trail of blood as it GRINDS to a halt.

           INT. CITY BUS - CONTINUOUS

           McCoy steadies the wheel, foots the brake.  Climbs out.

           EXT. PRIEST RESIDENCE - CONTINUOUS

           EMTs wheel out Borkowski, breathing.  Surviving.  Santos 
           walks by his side, moving for the ambulance.

           Uniforms lead Tanisha to a black and white.  Her hands cuffed 
           behind her.

STREET - CONTINUOUS

           McCoy walks slowly for the carnage, stops beside Finley, 
           standing quietly before the toppled garbage truck.  Their 
           lead deceased.

           Responding PATROLMEN converge, surrounding the scene.

           INT. PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER THAT MORNING

           Tanisha sits alone.  Cheek bruised, hair a mess.  Cool as 
           ice.

           INT. PRECINCT - OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Finley, Santos, Keegan stand in waiting, watching the gang 
           empress pass the time.

           Epps enters, Barlow trailing.  Moving for the observation 
           window, verifying the subject.  Epps turns to the officers, 
           ready to blow a gasket -

                                 LT. EPPS
                        The hell's she doing in there?  
                           (to: Finley, McCoy)
                        Who gave you two the go-ahead on Priest?  
                        I didn't authorize it.
                           (to: Keegan)
                        Keegan?

           Keegan looks away, timid. 

                                 LT. EPPS (CONT'D)
                        Okay.  I'll make it easy on myself, 
                        recommend everyone for suspension - 

                                 LT. BARLOW
                        I made the call.

           Epps turns to Barlow, betrayed.

                                 LT. BARLOW (CONT'D)
                        They got calls, Rob.  Recorded threats to 
                        Ellroy's girlfriend.  I can play 'em for 
                        you.  

                                 LT. EPPS
                        Priest was a key lead -

                                 LT. BARLOW
                        Yeah, and what if he never took us to the 
                        stash?  He had that boy murdered.  
                        Someone had to answer for it.

                           (re: Tanisha)
                        What do you suggest we do with her?

                                 LT. BARLOW
                        Ask some questions.  See what she knows 
                        under a little pressure.  

           Off Epps, not liking this one bit.

                                 TANISHA (O.S.)
                        Ya'll is way off.  I mean, he and Q may 
                        of had their differences, but he ain't 
                        pull that trigger...

                                 LT. BARLOW (O.C.)
                        Never assumed he did.  We want the man he 
                        hired. 

           Finley, Santos, Keegan observe.  Finley watches with a close 
           eye.  He wants to be in there. 

                                               BACK TO:

           INT. PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Tanisha leans back in her chair, like she owns the place. 

                                 LT. EPPS
                        You're facing an accessory beef.  Charges 
                        could be worse depending on what the D.A. 
                        digs up between now and trial.  I hoop 
                        with D.A. - he's a prick.  Your 
                        circumstance has no weight in his 
                        courtroom.  Play victim all you want, I 
                        guarantee he portrays you as the monarch 
                        of Priest's empire.  With your husband 
                        gone, who's next on the list to point the 
                        finger at?

                                 LT. BARLOW
                        Not a lot we can do for you, Tanisha.  
                        Unless of course, there's something you 
                        can do for us.

           Epps slides a pack of smokes to her side of the table. 

                                 TANISHA
                        Quit a long time ago, baby.  Gonna have 
                        to do a lot better than a six-dollar pack 
                        of jacks.

                        And all you're gonna get is freedom in 
                        return.

           Tanisha looks at the lieutenants, knows she's cornered.

                                 TANISHA
                        Whatchu' want?

                                 LT. EPPS
                        Two things.  Ellroy's trigger man.

                                 TANISHA
                        And?

                                 LT. EPPS
                        Few days ago some guns went gangland on 
                        Frank Russo.  I'm sure you're well aware 
                        of the fact that he was your husband's 
                        supplier for over five years.

           Tanisha averts her eyes, confirming his suspicion.

                                 LT. EPPS (CONT'D)
                        Anyway, guns helped themselves to his 
                        entire supply of Afghan-flavored H.  
                        Priest being a big spender in town, man 
                        had to have an idea who might be off-
                        loading Russo's consignment.  I mean, 
                        what's a dope dealer without his dope?

           Epps draws out a DIGITAL RECORDER, lays it on the table.  A 
           BEAT, then -

                                 TANISHA
                        Not here.  These people, ain't like the 
                        villains I know.  You want me to talk?  I 
                        want protection.

                                 LT. EPPS
                        We'll see what we can do.

                                 TANISHA
                        Uh-uh.  No seeing.  I want guarantees.  
                        My terms, or nothing at all.  First, 
                        let's talk about the safe house: you're 
                        getting me a suite.  Somewhere nice.

                        expenses while I'm there.  I don't pay 
                        for shit.  Soon as you get me there, I'll 
                        tell you what I know.

           Off Epps, Barlow, considering the demands.

           INT. PRECINCT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Finley emerges from the observation room, finds McCoy 
           crouched against the wall - looping the events in his head.  
           Finley sinks to the floor beside him.

                                 MCCOY
                        How's Borkowski?

                                 FINLEY
                        Stable.  You good?

           McCoy, nods, guarded.

                                 MCCOY
                        I'm sorry about Priest.  I was just 
                        trying to help -

                                 FINLEY
                        No.  You saved my ass today. 

           He rises, offers McCoy a hand.

                                 FINLEY (CONT'D)
                        We got escort duty again.  Barlow's 
                        orders.  You in?

           McCoy takes it, gets to his feet.  Off which.

           INT. UNMARKED/GARAGE - DAY 

           Tanisha slides in behind the cage.  Finley buckles up.  McCoy 
           climbs in, careful not to face Tanisha.

                                 TANISHA
                        What's wrong, killa?  Ain't got nothing 
                        to say?

           McCoy remains silent, face forward.

                                 FINLEY
                        Don't let her get to you.

           Two MOTORCYCLE OFFICERS mount their bikes.  Motor beside the 
           unmarked.

Pulls the unmarked out of the 
           garage.

           EXT. UNMARKED (MOVING) - DAY

           The motorcade cruising along the Chicago River.

           INT. UNMARKED (MOVING) - SAME

           McCoy sits anxiously.  Finally turns to her - enough is 
           enough.

                                 MCCOY
                        Look, I'm sorry.  Okay.  For what it's 
                        worth.  I was protecting my partner.  

                                 TANISHA
                        I'm just messing with you, boy.  I knew 
                        the stakes.  I ain't mad atcha'.
                        May have loved Ray, but that don't mean I 
                        liked him.  

           EXT. UNMARKED (MOVING)/STREET - SAME

           As the motorcade merges, another motorcycle officer advances, 
           catching up.  It's Candie Jones, eyes tinted by aviators.  
           Playing the part.  

                                 TANISHA (O.S.)
                        Lied more times than the law allowed and 
                        he sure as hell didn't mind putting his 
                        hands on me once in a while.  Then there 
                        were the girls... 

           She accelerates past the unmarked, moving for the two 
           motorcycle officers.

           She eyes her side-view mirror, establishes the unmarked's 
           position...

           INT./EXT. UNMARKED (MOVING)/STREET - SAME

           Finley addressing Tanisha through the rearview -

                                 FINLEY
                        That was some good hustle you pulled back 
                        there on Major Crimes.  Got them bending 
                        over backwards for your scoop on that 
                        dope stash.  Hope you ain't lying.

                                 TANISHA
                        I got nothing to hide.  Ain't like 
                        they're gonna believe me anyway.

                        Why wouldn't they believe you?

                                 TANISHA
                        Don't be ignorant, boy.  Ya'll are a part 
                        of the biggest gang in the country.  How 
                        you think your peoples are gonna act if 
                        you start going after your own?  That's a 
                        losing battle right there. 

           McCoy and Finley look at each other - heeding the 
           insinuations.

                                 FINLEY
                        Whatchu' saying?  Police got something to 
                        do with the dope?

                                 TANISHA
                        I'm saying the police stole it.

           Jones, motors between the other two officers, draws a 
           silenced PISTOL.  DRILLS one after the other.  Their bikes 
           veering off.  CRASHING.

           Finley and McCoy react, eyes wide, witnessing the carnage 
           ahead...

           Jones locks the brakes, holsters the pistol.  THEN, draws an 
           MP9 SUBMACHINE GUN - bike skidding in reverse for the 
           unmarked.  Steering beside Finley, McCoy, Tanisha...

           Finley instinctively forces McCoy's head down as...

           Jones sprays GUNFIRE.  Windows explode.  The exterior is 
           riddled...

           Finley is GRAZED in the bicep.  Swerves.  Losing control...

           The unmarked careens, crashing through a barrier - into the 
           river.

           Jones U-turns sharp.  Speeds away.  

           INT./EXT. UNMARKED/RIVER - CONTINUOUS

           Sinking.  McCoy and Finley emerge from the passenger-side 
           window.  Finley swims for the backseat - Tanisha is shot 
           dead.  He tries the door, yanks hard.  No give.  He reaches 
           through the window, cuts his arm on broken glass.  Losing 
           air.  Time - MCCOY grabs him by the collar, tows him to the 
           surface.

           (cid:13)           EXT. CHICAGO RIVER - CONTINUOUS

           McCoy and Finley emerge from the water.  Breathe.

           EXT. STREET - LOWER LEVEL - MCCOY & FINLEY - DAY

           Along the guardrail, soaked.  They're hunched over, hands 
           over knees, breathing so deep it hurts.  High speed traffic 
           screaming past them.  

                                 FINLEY
                        Tanisha.  She warned us, man.  She warned 
                        us and they killed her.

                                 MCCOY
                        Tried to kill us.  
                           (beat)
                        Cops.  Our people.  Stealing from 
                        dealers.  Taking over the dope game.  You 
                        surprised?

                                 FINLEY
                        No.  

                                 MCCOY
                        Yeah, me neither.

           Finley removes his overshirt, BITES off a sleeve, wraps it 
           tight around his bicep, oozing blood.

           The echo of SIRENS steals into the atmosphere.  Finley and 
           McCoy trade looks, on the same page.

           They begin to jog away from the scene.

                        You need stitches, chief.

                                 FINLEY
                        No hospitals.  They'll be looking for us 
                        there.

                                 MCCOY
                        Didn't say anything about a hospital.  

                                 FINLEY
                        What do you suggest?

                                 MCCOY
                        I know a nurse.  We can use her place as 
                        a safe house.

           Now they're running as we move TOPSIDE -

           Black and Whites motoring in the opposite direction,

                                 MOM (O.S.)
                        Jesus Christ, what the hell happened to 
                        you?!

           INT. MCCOY RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           McCOY'S MOM (40's) lead the two inside, near panic as she 
           regards their injuries.

                                 MCCOY
                        Just a scuffle, mom.  No biggie.
                           (kisses her cheek)
                        Dad here?

                                 MOM
                        He's cooking dinner.  

           She waves at Finley, awkward, awaiting an introduction -

                                 MOM (CONT'D)
                        Hello.

                                 MCCOY
                        This is Bill.  My co-worker.  He needs 
                        some sewing?

                                 MOM
                        Why didn't you take him to the hospital?

                                 MCCOY
                        Cause you're a nurse.

                                 MOM
                        No, Jimmy, you should've taken him to the 
                        hospital -

                                 MCCOY
                        Mom.

                           (surrendering)
                        Take him downstairs. 

           McCoy leads Finley into the house, Mom calling after them -

           surroundings, impressed.  Prosperous, comfortable.  The kind 
           of home he's only seen on sitcoms.  

                                 FINLEY
                        Nice crib.  You live close by?

                                 MCCOY
                        Just a walk up the stairs.

                                 FINLEY
                           (incredulous)
                        You live with your folks?

                                 MCCOY
                        It's temporary.  'Til I get my shit 
                        together.

                                 FINLEY
                        How long you been here?

                                 MCCOY
                        Five years.

           IN THE LIVING ROOM, Finley spies ARIANNE standing before a 
           television - rocking out to GUITAR HERO.  

                                 FINLEY
                           (low)
                        What's she doing here?

           Finley drips blood all over the carpet.

                                 MCCOY
                        Arianne?  She lives here.  

                                 FINLEY
                        You're gonna be her big brother.

                                 MCCOY
                        Just submitted the paperwork.  Fingers 
                        crossed.

           McCoy opens the basement door, heading down.  Finley pauses, 
           watching Arianne at home in her new surroundings.

MCCOY RESIDENCE - BASEMENT - LATER

           Mom carefully dressing McCoy's wounds.  Finley curiously 
           traces his arm, stitched up.  The young officers going 
           through the possibilities -

                                 FINLEY
                        Nah, she did us a solid giving us Priest.  
                        Don't see her doing dirty.

                                 MCCOY
                        Or maybe she led us to Priest.  You know, 
                        set an ambush.

                        Okay, Santos.

                                 FINLEY
                        Next.

                                 MCCOY
                        Be helpful if you hit that by now, we'd 
                        know more about her -

                        Okay.  The prick lieutenants.  Epps and 
                        Barlow. 

           Finley eyes McCoy - like he's onto something.

                                 FINLEY
                        Maybe.  But their hard-ons for the H

                        Okay, what the hell's going on?  What 
                        kind of trouble you in, Jimmy?

                                 MCCOY
                        I told you, mom, police business, the

                        I don't dress another scratch 'til 
                        somebody talks to me.

           McCoy and Finley trade looks, cornered.

                                 MCCOY
                        Alright, but, just don't tell dad -

                                 MOM
                        James.  Tell me.

           Off McCoy, about to deliver the news.

           INT. MCCOY RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

                                 DAD
                        Are you out of your fucking mind?!

                                 MOM
                           (re: Arianne)
                        Honey, watch your mouth!  You'll scare 
                        Arianne.

           McCOY's DAD (60's), pacing before Finley and McCoy.  Broad 
           shoulders, skin like leather.  A domesticated Warren Oates.  
           He wears a Notre Dame apron around his waist.

           The officers sit on the couch, sheepish.  Like children 
           awaiting the terms of their punishment.  Arianne sits beside 
           McCoy, listening timorously -

                                 DAD
                        Absconding from a crime scene?  You have 
                        to go back to the station.  I'll drive 
                        you.  They know me there. 

                                 MCCOY
                        No way.  We walk back in there and we're 
                        marked for death.

                                 FINLEY
                        He's right.  There's a leak in our 
                        department.  Ain't safe to go back to 
                        headquarters 'til we can identify the 
                        mole.  

           Dad stands before them, out of ideas.  He sits, collecting 
           himself.  Looks into his sons eyes, spiteful.

                        You know, if you'd passed the bar by now, 
                        none of this would have happened.  You 
                        wouldn't even be in this mess.

                                 MCCOY
                        Christ, not now.

                                 DAD
                        Have you even taken the steps to prepare 
                        this time?

                                 MCCOY
                        To hell with that test.

                                 DAD
                        What?

                                 MCCOY
                        So I can follow in your footsteps?  
                        Defending your golf buddies so they can 
                        continue embezzling company funds?  No 
                        thanks.

                                 DAD
                        Smart ass.  I got you this gig as a 
                        temporary means to an end.  So you could 
                        understand the law from the bottom up.  I 
                        got firms all over town holding you a 
                        seat -

           Dad zeros in on the RANGERS tattoo on Finley's wounded arm, 
           distracted.

                                 MCCOY
                        What?

                                 DAD
                        That's some serious ink you got there, 
                        Bill.  Rangers?  

           Finley nods.  Dad rolls up his sleeve, bicep wearing an EAGLE 
           CARRYING AN ANCHOR.

           Dad proceeds to unbutton his shirt -

                                 MCCOY
                        Jesus, here we go with the Navy.

           Dad reveals two BULLET WOUNDS dotting his lower back.

                        Got those underwater.  Rescue mission off 
                        the coast of Hong Gai.  Our SDV's battery 
                        died in Charlie's waters.  Enemy boat 
                        spotted us.  We swam fast to the bottom.  
                        But their bullets were faster.  Missed my 
                        liver by an inch.

                                 FINLEY
                           (playing along)
                        Oh yeah?

           Pulls up his shirt, shows a canvas of SHRAPNEL WOUNDS across 
           his chest.

                                 FINLEY (CONT'D)
                        Shrapnel from a roadside.  Tossed me.

                                 DAD
                        Ugly.  But how about this?

           Dad drops his pants, shows off a scarred cheek.  Finley puts 
           his hands up, slightly uncomfortable -

                                 FINLEY
                        That's close enough.

                                 MOM
                           (disgusted)
                        Jesus Christ, baby!

                                 DAD
                        Charlie slashed me with a saber.  Smarts 
                        more than getting shot.

           McCoy props a leg on the table, unrolls his pants to the knee 
           - an old scar runs vertically.

                                 MCCOY
                        Got that against SC.  Rolled right on a 
                        naked bootleg.  Saw Touchdown Jesus as I 
                        made the pass.  Got clipped by the 
                        biggest truck on the field.  Torn 
                        ligament.  Two knee surgeries.  But we 
                        won.  I was a warrior out there.

                                 DAD
                        Emphasis on was.

           Arianne stands, getting in on the action.  She pulls her 
           shirt down to her shoulder:  A BULLET wound marks it.

           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                 ARIANNE
                        A bunch of them came through our window.  
                        My brother covered me before more of 'em 
                        could catch me.

           Dead silence in the room - no one sure how to react to this 
           child's war story.  Then -

                                 DAD
                        She's got me beat.  Bill?

           And before Finley can respond an EXPLOSION OF SILENCED 
           GUNFIRE rips through the windows.  Sudden.  Without warning.

           Finley hits the floor, all instincts.  

           Dad tackles Mom, seconds before SHOTS tear into her chair.  

           McCoy dives for Arianne, grabs her on his way down. 

           Bullets decimating walls, furniture, appliances.  

           Finley scans the mayhem, army crawling, sees:

           McCoy holding Arianne close beneath a sofa, her protector.  

           Mom CRYING in Dad's arms, helpless as they witness the 
           destruction of their home.  

           Finley arrives at the edge of the HALLWAY, reaches cautiously 
           for the light switch, cuts the lights as -

           The FIRING CEASES.  SOUNDS of weapons reloading.  VOICES in 
           hushed tones.  BOOTSTEPS on the porch.  Coming closer.  
           Approaching the front door... 

           Finley leans against the wall, thinking fast, looks beside 
           him:

           The FIREPLACE, more importantly its TOOLS.  Finley grabs a 
           POKER, sprints into -

           THE HALLWAY

           The FRONT DOOR is battered down...

           Finley charges the intruding SHOOTER, SWINGS hard.  THUMP!  
           Goes the poker, hooked into the shooter's chest.  Finley 
           acquires his SHOTGUN as -

           Another SHOOTER enters, assault rifle leveled and ready...
                                           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)           Finley deftly adapts, shields himself with the first 
           shooter's body - now taking multiple hits from the second 
           shooter.  Finley racks the SHOTGUN with one hand, FIRES.  
           Blows the second shooter out of the house.

           Finley turns, hearing MACHINE GUNFIRE shattering glass -

           IN THE LIVING ROOM 

           A THIRD SHOOTER climbs through the window, turns on his 
           FLASHLIGHT fixed to his assault rifle.  His beam searches the 
           dark, finds -

           Arianne, Mom, Dad, huddled together in a corner.  
           Defenseless.

           Third Shooter levels his weapon -

           MCCOY strangles him from behind. Third Shooter aimlessly 
           FIRES into the ceiling, losing control.  McCoy steals a 
           PISTOL from Third Shooter's holster, FIRES three shots into 
           his back. 

           Mom and Dad cover Arianne's eyes as -

           Third Shooter goes limp in McCoy's arms, drops dead to the 
           floor.

           A HAND grabs McCoy from behind, he reacts, violent, 
           disturbed.

           It's Finley, finger over his lips.  He picks up Third 
           Shooter's assault rife, hands it to him.

                                 FINLEY
                           (whispering)
                        They're all over the place.

           McCoy looks to Arianne, his folks.

                                 MCCOY
                        Basement.

           INT. MCCOY RESIDENCE - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Finley and McCoy hustle the family into the basement.  Out of 
           harms way.  They crouch beneath the staircase.  McCoy hands 
           Dad a pistol.

                                 MCCOY
                        Stay here.

           Dad nods, checking the pistol, no stranger to combat.

McCoy checks the 
           assault rifle. 

                                 MOM
                        Jim -

                                 FINLEY
                        Shhh!

           Multiple BOOTSTEPS from above.  Heavy, tactical.

           Finley looks to McCoy, grave.

                                 FINLEY (CONT'D)
                        They're inside.

           INT. MCCOY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Three remaining SHOOTERS in black camo, ski masks, sweeping 
           the area.  Shooter #4 signals them to split up.  

           DINING ROOM

           Shooter #5 skirts the dining room table. Cautious.  A SOUND 
           in the kitchen.  He puts his back to the window, edges for 
           the kitchen.  SHOTS roar from behind, pump him full of lead.  
           He drops, revealing Finley standing outside, SHOTGUN smoking.

           HALLWAY

           Shooter #4 REACTS, vigilant steps for the dining room.  Finds 
           Shooter #5, dead below the window.  The BARREL of an assault 
           rifle contacts the back of his head - McCoy holds the weapon.

                                 MCCOY
                        Put it down, chief.  

           Shooter #4 drops his gun.  Hands on his head.

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        How many inside?  Minus the corpse?

           Shooter #4 doesn't respond.  Stands motionless, facing the 
           window.  Keeping McCoy guessing.

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        Turn around.

           Shooter #4 whirls with a suicidal ROUNDHOUSE KICK.  Whips 
           McCoy off the ground.  McCoy hits the wood.  Motions to train 
           the machine gun on Shooter #4, who grabs the weapon, forces 
           McCoy to SHOOT sideways, clearing the magazine.  He grabs 
           McCoy by his collar, BODYSLAMS him on the dining room table -
                              (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)
           (cid:13)           Beats the living shit out of him.  Then, yanks McCoy by his 
           shirt, pitches him out the window.

           OUTSIDE

           McCoy eats grass, rolling onto the lawn.  Shooter #4 hops 
           out, strides for him.  McCoy crawls.  Weak.  Shooter #4 KICKS 
           him hard in the gut.  McCoy reels.  He KICKS again.  McCoy 
           spits blood this time.   

           #4 grabs McCoy by the hair, wraps an elbow around his neck.  
           McCoy, choking, losing life by the second, slackens.  Then -

           FINLEY grabs Shooter #4 from behind, BREAKS his neck.

           McCoy gets to his feet, stumbles.  Falls into his partner's 
           arms.  Thrashed.  Gasping.

                                 FINLEY
                        I got you, man!  I got you!  It's over.

           SCREAMING from inside.  Followed by two SHOTS.

                                 MCCOY
                        No!

           McCoy races back inside.  Finley calls after -

                                 FINLEY
                        Jim!

           McCoy turns.  Finley lobs him a pistol.

           INT. MCCOY HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           McCoy moving tactfully down the stairs, pistol low.  Finley 
           right beside him.

                                 MCCOY
                        Dad!...Mom!

           No answer as they inch for the foot of the stairs, breath 
           held, back to the wall, fearing the worst.  They round the 
           corner, do-or-die, find -

           DAD holding a smoking gun, standing over another SHOOTER - 
           breathing heavy, like he's dying.

           Mom and Arianne tremble in the corner, eyes drowning in 
           tears.  Witness to the violence.
                                              (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)           McCoy moves carefully for his Dad - somewhere else now, his 
           first kill since Vietnam.  McCoy carefully takes the gun away 
           from his father's grip, tucks it in his jeans. 

           Finley kicks away the weapon.  Removes his ski-mask: KENNY, 
           eyes vacant.  Expired.

           Then, a Brad Paisley RINGTONE - singin' from Kenny's pocket.  
           Everyone trading confused looks.  

           Finley hands McCoy the phone -  

                                 FINLEY
                        Talk.

                                 MCCOY
                        What?

                                 FINLEY
                        Low voice.  Short sentences.  We need to 
                        know who this is.

           McCoy reads the caller: UNKNOWN NUMBER.  Thumbs the SPEAKER 
           button.  

                                 MCCOY
                        Yeah.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        You all done?

           McCoy thinks fast, improvising.

                                 MCCOY
                        Yeah.  

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Everyone?  McCoy and Finley, too?

           McCoy turns to Finley, who nods "yes."

                                 MCCOY
                        All done.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Couple of black and whites are headed 
                        your way.  Ten minutes, max.  See you at 
                        breakfast.

           The voice disconnects.  McCoy and Finley meet eyes, betrayed.  
           The voice all too familiar.
                                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                 MCCOY
                        Was that -

                                 FINLEY
                        I think so.

           Finley searches Kenny's pockets, snatches out a wallet - 
           there's an ID inside.  It reads: SPECIAL OPERATIONS UNIT - 
           ILLINOIS STATE POLICE.  

                                 FINLEY (CONT'D)
                        S.O.U.

           He passes the I.D. to McCoy.  He takes a moment, processing 
           the implications, anger, hate building inside.  Tosses the 
           I.D. on Kenny's corpse.

                                 MCCOY
                        Fucking cops in this town.

           EXT. MCCOY RESIDENCE/STREET - NIGHT

           Multiple CRUISERS, an ambulance converge on the scene.  

           Finley stands at the front of the house, BADGE raised.  

           McCoy sits on the porch, bitter, vengeful.

           Tires lock before Finley.  Patrolmen spill out, weapons at 
           the ready.

           Neighbors observe from their porches, their typically serene 
           suburban block is now a crime scene.  

           Keegan emerges from one of the cars.  Marches for Finley, 
           regarding the bullet-riddled home.

                                 SGT. KEEGAN
                        Jesus, you two alright?  

           INT. UNMARKED CRUISER (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           Epps driving for the house.  Barlow in the passenger seat, 
           tensing up as he makes out McCoy and Finley - alive and well.  
           He's seeing ghosts.

           EXT. MCCOY RESIDENCE - MOMENTS LATER

           The UNMARKED CRUISER brakes to a stop.  Epps climbs out, 
           notes Barlow, hesitating.

                                 LT. EPPS
                        What's up?
                                         (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                          (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)           Barlow unfastens his seat belt, nervous.

                                 LT. BARLOW
                        Nothing.

           He exits.

           McCoy takes note, walks for the lieutenants, marching past 
           Keegan.  

           A RINGTONE chimes somewhere in the vicinity.  Barlow reaches 
           into his pocket, sees the number, re-pockets the phone.

           McCoy holds KENNY'S PHONE high, closing in on Barlow.

                                 MCCOY
                        Aren't you gonna answer that?  You 
                        motherfucker -

           Then, he breaks into a charge.  TACKLES Barlow to the grass.  
           Wails on him.  Raging fists of fury.

           Finley, Epps, Keegan and fellow officers rush the scrap. 

           Finley fights through the chaos, gets a grip on McCoy, saves 
           him from killing Barlow.  He grabs Kenny's phone, saves it 
           from being trampled.  

           Epps helps Barlow to his feet, gives McCoy a hard look -

                                 LT. EPPS
                        What the hell's gotten into you!?

           Finley labors to contain a spitting, kicking, punch-drunk 
           McCoy -

                                 MCCOY
                        Ask your partner!  He knows!  HE KNOWS 
                        EVERYTHING! 

           Epps turns to Barlow, quizzical -

                                 LT. EPPS
                        What's he talking about?

                                 LT. BARLOW
                        Kid's talking crazy.  How the hell should 
                        I know?

           Finley releases McCoy, who paces, livid.
                                                   (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 MCCOY
                        Go on and tell him!  Catch him up to 
                        speed you back-stabbing piece of shit!

           Finley lobs Epps the phone.

                                 FINLEY
                        Found that on one of the shooters.

           Finley holds Epps's gaze.

                                 FINLEY (CONT'D)
                        Barlow.  He called one of the shooters.  
                        Check his log.  You'll see.

           Epps looks into his partner's eyes, playing out the 
           possibility in his mind.

                                 LT. BARLOW
                        What?

                                 LT. EPPS
                        Let me see your phone.

                                 LT. BARLOW
                        Jesus, you're not actually buying this -

                                 LT. EPPS
                        Jake.  

           A long PAUSE.  All eyes on Barlow, in the hot-seat. 

                                 LT. BARLOW
                        Fuck it.

           He hands Epps the phone, begins to walk for the car, nowhere 
           to run.  Behind him, Epps holds both phones, verifies his 
           suspicions.  A BEAT, as Barlow leans on the car, tense.

           Epps looks up from the mobiles, eyes on Barlow.  He calmly 
           draws his SERVICE WEAPON, holds it at his side.  

           Barlow averts his eyes from Epps, nearly laughs, humiliated.  
           Unholsters his weapon.

           Officers react, hands on their pistol grips.

           Barlow removes his BADGE from his belt.  Surrenders it and  
           his gun on the hood of the car.  He puts his hands behind his 
           head, awaiting arrest. 

           McCoy, Finley, Keegan witness the process unfold as Epps 
           moves for his partner, drawing his cuffs.  Arrests him.

                                 SGT. KEEGAN
                        I need you back at the station.  Your 
                        family, too.  They're safer there.

                                 MCCOY
                        Are they, sergeant?

           McCoy pushes past her, moves for his family as they stand 
           together on the porch, holding each other.  Stressed and 
           shook.  Gracious survivors.  

           INT. PRECINCT - SQUADROOM - AFTER HOURS

           Officers glued to their phones.  Bracing leads.  On the 
           clock.

           Arianne on a corner couch, head resting on Mom's lap.  Dad 
           hovers around them, anxious.  It's been a long night for the 
           McCoy family.

           INT. PRECINCT - OBSERVATION ROOM - AFTER HOURS

           McCoy, Finley, Santos, Keegan, their focus intently fixed on -

           INT. PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME TIME

           The continual HUM of overhead flourescents.  Mood edgy.

           Epps sits before Barlow, tense, quietly enraged.  Betrayed.  

           Barlow refuses to meet his partner's gaze, eyes averted.  
           Failing to hide the angst, shame.

           Epps slides his RECORDER to the center of the table.  

                                 LT. EPPS
                        Make it easy on yourself.

           Barlow stares at the device, cool, half sneering. 

                                 LT. BARLOW
                        C'mon, Rob, you know I ain't saying shit -

           And then Epps explodes, TACKLING Barlow to the ground.  
           Issues three consecutive blows, splitting his lip.  He grabs 
           Barlow by the shirt-collar, face-to-face, delirious.  Hands 
           tightening around his neck -

                                 LT. EPPS
                        You don't want to talk?

                                 LT. EPPS (CONT'D)
                        Fine.  I won't talk either.

           Epps draws his GUN...

           INT. PRECINCT - OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Finley, McCoy rush the door to the interrogation room as...

           INT. PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Epps unlocks the gun's safety, trains it on Barlow - McCoy 
           TACKLES Epps against the wall.  Finley grabs Epps's shooting 
           arm, forces it upward.

           Barlow COUGHS on the floor, sweaty, mug crimson, scared 
           straight.

           Epps breathes hard, slowly coming back to Earth.  He 
           surrenders his weapon to Finley, who locks the safety.

           Finley and McCoy release Epps as Keegan and Santos enter, 
           help Barlow to his feet.

           Epps straightens his jacket, embarrassed.

                                 LT. EPPS
                        I can't...I'm sorry.  I can't do this.  
                           (to: McCoy, Finley)
                        He's all yours.

           Epps leaves the room.

           Keegan picks up the recorder, hands to Finley.  She exits.  
           Santos follows.  The rookies are now in charge.

           INT. PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Finley and McCoy sit before Barlow, who daubs a bloody lip.  
           Finley taps the RECORD button, begins.

                        Or, maybe you don't go quietly.  Maybe 
                        you help us out a little, play the game.  
                        Become an untouchable.

           Finley gives him a look, impressed -

                        It's your only ticket out.  Otherwise,

                                 MCCOY
                        No, fuck you.

           McCoy pushes himself from the table, grabs the recorder, 
           leaning over Barlow, mouth to mic -

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        To the sharks listening to this

           He slams the recorder down on the table -

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        Or don't.

           Returns to his seat, checks his watch, mastering his "bad

           A beat, Barlow shifts in his chair, agitated -

                        I was working vice.  S.O.U. had pictures

                        Who's the man in charge? 

           Barlow SIGHS frustration.  The walls closing in.

                                 LT. BARLOW
                        Hanson.  
                           (beat)
                        Captain John Warren Hanson.  Been around 
                        since the 80's.  War on drugs.  All that 
                        shit.  Unit's well-trained.  The kind of 
                        tactics they teach Special Ops, Delta 
                        Force.  Happy?

                                 FINLEY
                        So he murdered Ellroy.  

                                 LT. BARLOW
                        Probably deferred to one his flunkies.  
                        John don't have the stomach.  

                                 FINLEY
                        Connect Priest.

                                 LT. BARLOW
                        Priest, he came to Hanson as sign of 
                        trust.  Said he didn't want any trouble.  
                        That kid was going to blow the lid off 
                        the entire op.  Hanson took care of it.

           McCoy turns to Finley, the truth dawning -

                                 FINLEY
                        Ellroy was going to tell us about cops 
                        selling H.  Just like Tanisha.

           Barlow hesitates, then -

                                 LT. BARLOW 
                        Man's created a monopoly.  Guarantees

                                 MCCOY
                        In exchange for what?

                                 FINLEY
                        Motive's bullshit.  He knows the turf.  
                        The types he's doing business with.  Why 
                        inherit the stress of being a supplier 
                        this late in his career?  

           Barlow shrugs - 

                                 LT. BARLOW
                        Ask him.  I told you what I know.

                                 MCCOY
                        Not everything.

                                 LT. BARLOW
                        I'm past fucking dead, alright.  What 
                        else you want from me?

           McCoy would smile if he weren't so bitter.

                                 MCCOY
                        Where's breakfast?

           Off Barlow, exposed, cornered.  Where our officers want him.

           INT. PRECINCT - LOCKER ROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Finley and McCoy stand before mirrors, slipping into 
           ballistics vests.  Checking their weapons.  Their nerves 
           going off the charts. 

           Behind them, Epps performs the same ritual, his manner the 
           opposite: casual, controlled, been-there-done-that.

           McCoy splashes water on his face.  Breathes deep.

           Epps takes note, staring at them through his mirror -

                                 LT. EPPS
                        Thanks for...I lost my head back there.
                           (beat)
                        Remember my first raid.  Felt like I had 
                        everything to prove.  Like the weight of 
                        the world was on my shoulders.  Jesus, I 
                        could barely hold my food.  Fear, natures 
                        best laxative.

           Epps slaps a magazine into his pistol, holsters it.  He 
           leaves McCoy and Finley gazing at their reflections, scared

           Hanson at a station, draws fast - quick-fires.  Six 
           consecutive bull's-eyes.  

           INT. ILLINOIS STATE POLICE DEPARTMENT - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Hanson strides through a sea of police officers.  His 
           associates.

           He marches over the State Police Seal, motto declared: 
           INTEGRITY. SERVICE. PRIDE.

           He moves for a door, manned by touch-pad.  He punches in a 
           code.  Enters.

           INT. S.O.U. (SPECIAL OPERATIONS UNIT) - CONTINUOUS

           Stark, sleek, high-tech.  The most high-tech safe-house 
           you've ever seen.  Rows of top-shelf computers, wall-mounted 
           LCD's, cell-phone tracers.  Unlimited access at their 
           fingertips.  Too much power.

           A group of S.O.U. men gear up.  They load PISTOLS, ASSAULT 
           RIFLES.  Provisions.

           He joins Candie Jones and a few others at a table.  They load 
           kilos of heroin into duffle bags, shoulder them, moving for 
           the back door.

           INT. PRECINCT - SQUADROOM - MORNING

           McCoy stands before the parents, Arianne.  He kneels before 
           the little girl, searching for words, the stakes fully 
           realized.  She hugs him tight, shows no signs of letting go.  

           Off-guard, McCoy fights for cool.  Her love giving him 
           strength, purpose.  Hope.

           HEAVY BOOTSTEPS, O.S.

           INT. PRECINCT - CORRIDOR - MORNING

           The underbelly of the precinct.  A long, hollow stretch of 
           chipped concrete and faulty lighting.

           Epps, Santos, a small battery of SWAT OFFICERS stride down 
           the corridor, business in their step, their poise ice-cold.  
           Pugilists trooping for the ring.

           McCoy and Finley bring up the rear of the procession, 
           observing their colleagues with envy, respect.  This is their 
           rite of passage.

           INT. MEAT PACKING RUINS - CONTINUOUS

           Triads, Irish muscle, Latin Kings, Jamaicans.  Small crews.  
           All eyes on a CHEMIST, awaiting the results of the impurity 
           test.  Their heroin-to-be portioned and stacked into small 
           towers on makeshift tables.  Ready for purchase.

           A cadre of S.O.U. muscle running bills through counting 
           machines on makeshift tables.  Ensuring a smooth, friendly 
           transaction.

           Candie Jones checks her watch, impatient, uneasy, reports to 
           Hanson -

                        should be here by now.

           Hanson pops a TABLET, paying her no mind, refusing to embrace 
           her concern.

                        John -

           He moves for his men, carefully counting the money - 

                                 HANSON
                        These men want to go home with product 
                        today.  Hurry your count.

           The Irish Boss smiles, amused by Hanson's anxiety -

                                 IRISH BOSS
                        Relax, John.  We're in no hurry.  Make 
                        sure it's all there.

           Hanson smiles, doing a shit-job hiding agitation.

TRI-STATE FREEWAY - MORNING

           The sun's slow climb over the city's peaks, shafts of morning 
           light pouring through the skyline.  Great weather for a 
           showdown.

           The cavalcade of CPD vehicles and a SWAT VAN speeding down 
           the freeway.  Ripping through traffic, the emergency lane at 
           their full disposal. 

           INT. UNMARKED (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS 

           Finley behind the wheel, resolute, the picture of true grit.  

           McCoy shakes out a cigarette, edgy, then crumples the carton, 
           pitches them both out the window.  Quitting.  

           INT. MEAT PACKING RUINS - MORNING

           Forsaken and beyond repair.  A state of incomplete 
           demolition.  Three crumbling stories of decayed concrete and 
           rusted steel.  Support beams hang like drapes, begging to 
           fall.  

           INT. MEAT PACKING RUINS - ATRIUM - MORNING

           A gathering in what used to be the main floor - now a moss-
           grown, open-air atrium hosting the transaction.

           Enforcers pack product into large suitcases.  Wrapping it up.

           Hanson's men zip up multiple cash-filled duffle bags, filled 
           to capacity. 

           EXT. MEAT PACKING RUINS - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Hanson, Candie Jones, S.O.U. men load into two SUVs.  Four to 
           a truck. 

           Bosses, their enforcers take to their vehicles.  Engines 
           growl to life.

           INT./EXT. SUV/MEAT PACKING RUINS - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Candie Jones keys the ignition, turns on the radio.  Punk  
           rattles the speakers.

           Hanson fastens his seat belt, massages his temples, relieved -

'Baby 
           You're a Rich Man,' or a damn good cover.

           Jones drives, motoring for the street.  Then -

           CPD VEHICLES, SWAT VAN pulling in.  SIRENS wailing.  Blocking 
           passage.  No one is getting out.

           Jones HAMMERS the brake.

           Hanson sits up, shocked, foiled.  Fucked.  He draws his 
           GLOCK.

                                 HANSON (CONT'D)
                        Go back.  Go BACK!

           Jones puts the SUV in reverse, steps on it, back into the LOT 
           - SLAMS into the SUV behind her, forces it off-course. 
           Jones's SUV recklessly CLIPPING multiple syndicate cars along 
           the way - at this juncture, it's every man for himself. 

           Syndicate bosses, their enforcers, S.O.U. men climb out.  
           SCATTER.  Running for their lives.  The mad dash.

           Epps, Santos jump out of their cruiser, guns drawn low.

           SWAT Officers empty out of the van, assault rifles leveled, 
           SAFETIES unlocked.  Routine.

           McCoy and Finley climb out of their unmarked, weapons out, 
           looking like they belong.

           Hanson and Jones, both hefting what money they can salvage, 
           exit the SUV, armed, retreating back into the RUINS.

           SWAT Officers fan out, covering the lot, hastily charging the 
           syndicate bosses, cutting them off.  Subduing them swiftly.  
           Bodies in imported threads slamming the concrete.  
           Apprehended.

           Remaining enforcers, the four sabotaged S.O.U. men skirt the 
           perimeter of the ruins, using the facade as a station to 
           ready weapons.  They FIRE frantically on the law, their shots 
           wayward, panicked.  

           SWAT responds, closing in on their suspect's perch, short, 
           controlled BURSTS taking them down.  Picking off the handful 
           of criminals and dirty cops with terrifying precision.

           Epps leads the charge.  McCoy, Finley, Santos, a SWAT OFFICER

           (cid:13)           INT. MEAT PACKING RUINS - ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           The LOBBY.  Quiet, deserted, gutted.  No signs of Hanson and 
           Candie Jones.

           The officers advance with caution, securing the area.  Into -

           THE CORRIDOR

           Long and narrow.  Multiple doors lining passage.  Hanson and 
           Candie Jones could be hiding behind any one of the portals.

           Epps swings into an old MEN'S ROOM, alert: clear.  Nothing 
           but rubble, a leaky faucet, moss-ridden urinals.  He searches 
           the stalls, kicking down each door.  Grabs his WALKIE, 
           quietly -  

                                 LT. EPPS
                        All clear in the john.  Santos?

           Santos steps into a LOCKER ROOM.  Moves along the rows of 
           rusted lockers, wary, vigilant.  It's empty.  She puts mouth 
           to mic -

                                 OFCR. SANTOS
                        Same story here, Lieutenant.  Burns?

           THE COOLER

           BURNS, the SWAT Officer, pacing along, tracking FOOTPRINTS in 
           the dirt.  Dozens of meat hooks hanging from above.  

           He grabs his walkie -

                                 SWAT OFFICER BURNS
                        I got nothing in the cooler.

           IN THE HALLWAY

           McCoy and Finley remain in the corridor, holding down the 
           fort.  Then, GUNFIRE.  Multiple shots.  Rapid successions.  
           Coming from the cooler.

           McCoy and Finley react, dart for the source.  Enter.  

           THE COOLER

           Find Burns lying motionless.  Bullet-riddled.  

           They discover an additional PASSAGEWAY connected to the room, 
           receding FOOTSTEPS echoing behind it.  Hanson and Jones are 
           close.
                                                         (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                             (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                      (cid:13)           Santos, Epps enter, regard the carnage.

           Finley points to the additional passageway -

                                 FINLEY
                        That way.  Through there.

           Epps takes charge, signaling his inferiors to wait as he 
           peers around the passageway.  Sees a tiled hallway, chipped 
           and mold-ridden, it's only source of light coming from the 
           sun pouring through the spare windows built along the wall.

                                 LT. EPPS
                        Stay close.

           Epps proceeds.  Finley, McCoy, Santos follow.

           INT. MEAT PACKING RUINS - ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Epps creeping into the clearing, trailed by his officers.  He 
           puts a cautious HAND up.

           The officers stop.

           Epps points upward, indicating the upper levels.

           He steps into the opening, spins towards the upper levels, 
           his instincts spot on, reflexes too slow -  

                                 LT. EPPS
                        Shit.

           Automatic GUNFIRE rains from above.  Punching his vest.  
           Taking him off his feet.  He takes one in the LEG, firing 
           back, SHOTS aimed upwards as he falls.  

           Santos provides COVER FIRE, maneuvers them beneath a metal 
           table, bullets ripping into the rusted metal.  Her slide 
           locks back, pistol dry -

                                 SANTOS
                           (to: McCoy, Finley)
                        Third floor!

           McCoy and Finley step back, posted below the upper floors.  
           Hanson and Candie Jones's position revealed.  Finley looks to 
           McCoy, both on the same page.

           INT. MEAT PACKING  RUINS - STAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

           McCoy and Finley racing up, weapons trained every which way 
           as they reach the second floor -

Working as a 
           unit.  Finley signals McCoy to split.  Then, they break off 
           in opposite directions, splitting up.

           McCoy edges towards an abandoned ASSAULT RIFLE, perched on 
           the ledge overlooking the atrium.  Shooter nowhere to be 
           found.

           Finley hugs the wall, nearing a doorway, enters -

           INT. MEAT PACKING RUINS - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Stark and hollow.  An old desk caked in dust.  A rotary phone 
           perched at the edge.  Cobwebbed chairs leaning against the 
           wall...

           INT. MEAT PACKING RUINS - MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS

           McCoy prepares to reach for the rifle, CANDIE JONES emerges 
           from behind, STABS McCoy in the leg with a TACTICAL KNIFE.  
           Yanks him away from the perch.  Holding his hand, forcing him 
           to FIRE into the air, clearing his clip.

           She slams him against the wall, removes the knife.  McCoy 
           SCREAMS.

           INT. MEAT PACKING RUINS - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Finley reacts to the noise -

                                 FINLEY
                        Jim!

           Heading for the hallway - is blindsided by HANSON, holding 
           his Glock - Finley DEFLECTS Hanson's firing hand, SHOT 
           tearing into the wall beside him.  TACKLES Hanson to the 
           ground, SHOTS firing in his grip.

           Finley SLAMS Hanson's hand on the ground, forces the gun 
           free.  Issues head-numbing BLOWS, pummeling the old timer.

           Hanson KNEES Finley in the gut, sends him stumbling back - 
           into the desk.

                                 HANSON
                        Fuckin' rookie!  Fight back!

           Finley grabs the ROTARY PHONE, rips it from the desk's 
           surface.  SWINGS.  Connect's with Hanson's jaw, who spits 
           blood.  He SWINGS again - Hanson ducks it.  SOCKS Finley in 
           the gut.  KNOCKS the phone out of his hands.  The two 
           collide, swinging.  Trading blows.  Furious fisticuffs.  
           Blood.  Sweat.  Fury.

           Candie Jones SLASHES at McCoy, who ducks the swing, her KNIFE 
           cutting a TRAIL OF SPARKS across the wall. 

           McCoy responds, SOCKS Candie Jones in the crotch.  She 
           stumbles back, winded.  Charges again, SLASHING the air, 
           scorned.  

           McCoy dodges her parries as best he can, grabs the knife-hand 
           in the mid-swing.  ELBOWS hard to the face.  Grabs a handful 
           of blonde, PUNCHES again, dragging her -

                                 MCCOY
                        You're one of those crazy chicks.  

           Frees the knife from her grip, sends it sliding. 

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        Wants to be treated like a dude!

           Sneaks a head-shattering jab.

           Jones replies - THREE-KICKS to McCoy's crotch.  He slumps to 
           the ground, pain going to his head -  

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        God...damn

           Jones collects her knife, prepares to pounce - 

                                 OFCR. SANTOS (O.C.)
                        Fuck you!

           SANTOS levels Jones to the ground.  

           The two WRESTLING on the cold, cracked surface.  Fighting to 
           kill.

           McCoy limps for the perched ASSAULT RIFLE, grabs it.  He 
           checks the magazine: it's loaded...

           Santos is losing, Jones laying down a barrage of bruise-
           inducing blows as - AUTOMATIC FIRE RIPS THROUGH JONES, 
           hurtles her forward.  She staggers, clutching multiple GSW's.  
           She looks at McCoy, incredulous, spits blood - 

                                 CANDIE JONES
                        Wa...wait...

           She draws her BADGE, begging for mercy, her life.

           (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)           McCoy lowers the assault rifle, merciful.  Then something 
           cold in McCoy's eyes.  Vicious, grim.

                                 CANDIE JONES (CONT'D)
                        Please...I'm a cop -

           McCoy FIRES again, drying the magazine - hammering Jones to 
           the wall.  She sags, making her slow trip to the floor.  
           Exhales her last breath.  No more.

           Santos SIGHS, beaten, floored.  Then, notes something behind 
           him - 

                                 OFCR. SANTOS
                        McCoy!

           She grabs McCoy's PISTOL, heaves it to him. 

           He catches it, spinning -

           Finley stands before Hanson, pistol-nozzle to his head, sans 
           ballistics vest.  A hostage.  

                                 MCCOY
                        Let him go, asshole.

                                 HANSON
                        Bad start, kid.  You're supposed to talk 
                        the hostage-taker down.  Be his friend. 

                                 MCCOY
                        I ain't your fucking friend.

                                 HANSON
                        You got a mouth, don't you?  Think I 
                        liked you better when you were a 
                        quarterback.

                                 FINLEY
                        Why you doing this?  

                                 HANSON
                        Fuck 'why.'  Because I had to.  Because 
                        the law don't pay.  And when it's all 
                        said and done a gold watch and a pension 
                        worth less than my left nut don't make 
                        ends meet these days.

                                 FINLEY
                        Wasn't about peace in the streets.  You 
                        weren't taking over shit.  Deal's just a 
                        quick dollar.

                        It's called retirement money and I 
                        fucking earned it.  Thirty-one years of 
                        service and I got the scars and two ex-
                        wives to show for it.  You play the game 
                        long enough, see what I've seen, you'll 
                        come around. 

                                 MCCOY
                        Bad news, chief, this place is locked 
                        down.  You're going nowhere.

                                 HANSON
                        Exactly why it's time to negotiate.  I 
                        think you know the terms, so decide fast - 
                        before SWAT complicates things.

                                 FINLEY
                        Jim, shoot this motherfucker!

           Hanson FIRES a shot in the air.  Presses the barrel to 
           Finley's neck, burning him.

                                 HANSON
                        The hostage doesn't have a say in the 
                        negotiations, Billy-boy.  Shut the fuck 
                        up.
                           (to: McCoy)
                        Gun on the floor, Jim.  And I will walk.  
                        And he will live.  Very.  Fucking. 
                        Simple.

           McCoy stands motionless.  A tense BEAT.  Then, he drops the 
           gun.  

           Finley closes his eyes, hopeless.

                                 HANSON (CONT'D)
                        Jesus.  You really are a rookie.  Nothing 
                        personal...  

           He turns the gun on McCoy, Santos -

                                 HANSON (CONT'D)
                        Strictly business -

           Finley grabs Hanson's firing hand, the two wrestling for 
           control of the pistol - SHOOTS himself.  Drops.  

           McCoy takes a knee - grabs his gun.  Takes aim.  A clear shot 
           as -

           Hanson looks up -
                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)

Two in Hanson's chest.  Then, 
           McCoy stands - SHOOTS again.

           Hanson is taken off his feet - one in the head.  

           Finley lies on the floor, nursing a wound in his stomach.

           McCoy responds, runs for his partner.  He takes Finley in his 
           arms - unresponsive.  Near death.

           SWAT arrives at the scene.  All eyes on the wounded officer. 

           EXT./INT. STREET/ AMBULANCE (MOVING) - DAY 

           Tearing down the road. 

           EMTs work overtime, trying to revive Finley - breathing 
           through an oxygen mask, body linked to tubes.

           McCoy sits beside him, losing it.  Sees Finley's hand, 
           hanging from the stretcher - twitching.  Showing signs of 
           life.  McCoy takes it, holding his friend's hand.  Fighting 
           back tears.  

           INT. HOTEL - BANQUET HALL - DAY

           Students waiting anxiously, chugging caffeine.  Knees bounce. 
           Shoes tap carpet.  Everyone sweating bullets as they endure 
           the Illinois Bar Exam.

           McCoy is nowhere to be seen.

                                 MCCOY (O.S.)
                        Fuck.  The.  Bar.

           INT. PRECINCT - HALLWAY - DAY 

           McCoy and a living, breathing FINLEY, both slouching in 
           chairs outside the CAPTAIN'S OFFICE.  Finley's face an 
           equally gruesome canvas of scrapes, cuts, bruises.  They 
           watch the station traffic, cool, calm, ready to accept their 
           punishment like men.  

                                 FINLEY
                        How'd your pops take you skipping out?

                        Arianne's the only one who knows.  
                        Speaking of which, adoption papers were 
                        approved.

           They trade daps.

                        Big brother.

                                 MCCOY
                        Got her in a great school.  Testing high 
                        in her class.  Girl's gonna change the 
                        world.

           Finley lifts his shirt, distracted, admiring the giant 
           bandage across his belly.  Still healing.

           McCoy looks away, disgusted -

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        Yo, how many times you gotta look at it?  

                                 FINLEY
                        Baby's gonna scar nice.  You gonna cry 
                        again?

                                 MCCOY
                        That's all in your head, chief.  I never 
                        cry.

                                 FINLEY
                        Wasn't that dead, Jim. 

                                 MCCOY
                        Heads up.

           Finley turns, sees -

           Santos marching for them.  Writing on her steno.

           Finley sits up, losing cool.  

           Santos rips the paper from her steno, hands it to Finley -

                                 OFCR. SANTOS
                        This is my cell.  Ask me out sometime.

                                 MCCOY
                        'Bout time Santos.

                                 OFCR. SANTOS
                        Blow me.

           She storms off, her peace made.

                                 MCCOY
                        That woman is going to own you.

           Finley watches her walk, owned.  And then he rises.  Marches 
           after her.  

                                 MCCOY (CONT'D)
                        Where you going?

           Finley doesn't hear him.  Catches up to Santos.  Grabs her 
           hand -

                                 SANTOS
                        What?

           Steals her into the -

           INT. PRECINCT - BREAK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Draws her close.  Kisses her.  She pulls back.  A beat, 
           Finley looking deep into her eyes.  Then, Santos kisses back. 
           Deeper.  Harder.  She lays her head on his chest, exhales.  
           These two need each other.

                                 SANTOS
                        Good luck with the Captain.

           INT. PRECINCT - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY

           McCoy and Finley sitting nervously before the -

           CAPTAIN (60's), hard exterior, an old WOUND scarring his 
           cheek - a man who's earned his survival.  He quietly reads a 
           report.  Then looks up, studies the two officers, eyes 
           injecting fear.

           SIDE NOTE: Cameo moment.  We're talking iconic, cop film 
           legend.  For the qualified few reading this, you know who you 
           are.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Which one of you assholes slugged the 
                        reporter from Channel 5?

           McCoy apprehensively raises a hand, sheepish.

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                        He lost a tooth.  Don't worry about his 
                        dental bill, it's on us.

           McCoy lowers his hand.  The Captain continues -

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                        Epps told me all about the shit-show you 
                        put on this week.  Said you were 
                        stubborn.  Disobedient.  
                            (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)

                        That you had issues with authority.  
                        Would you agree with his assessment?

           They shake their heads hesitantly, too timid to answer yes or 
           no.

           The Captain digs in his drawer, extracts a BADGE.  Tosses it 
           to Finley. 

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                        For you.

           Finley inspects the shield, confused -

                                 FINLEY
                        Says detective.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        You've been promoted.  Homicide Division.  
                        Thank Epps.

           Finley gives him a quizzical look, stifling a smile.  McCoy 
           looks at the badge, left out, jealous.

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                        It was his belief that your skills would 
                        be put to better use elsewhere.  Think he 
                        said something like, you needed a 
                        challenge, or some fucking thing.

                                 MCCOY
                        That's all great, Captain.  But where's 
                        mine?

                                 CAPTAIN
                        You'll get yours - after the academy.  

           McCoy shifts in his seat, not sure he heard him correctly.

                                 MCCOY
                        The academy.  

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Thirty-six weeks.  And you have to 
                        graduate.

                                 MCCOY
                        Captain that's nine months you're 
                        talking.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        That gonna be a problem?  

           Before McCoy can respond -
                                                        (cid:13)                    (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)

                        I mean, it'd irk me to no end if I knew 
                        my friend and former partner was kicking 
                        ass where it counts, while I wasted away 
                        in a shit unit.  All because I refused to 
                        undergo the basic training required of 
                        every man and woman pursuing a career in 
                        law enforcement. 
                           (beat)
                        But, that's just me.

           Off McCoy, frustrated, speechless.

           INT. PRECINCT - LOBBY AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           McCoy explodes out of the elevators, incensed.  Pushing 
           through the bustle.  Finley barely keeps up with him -

                                 FINLEY
                        Come on, Jim.  Ain't like he said 
                        forever.  

           McCoy only walks faster -

                                 MCCOY
                        It's another test.  The Bar all over 
                        again.  

                                 FINLEY
                        But you're my fucking partner, man!

           A BEAT as McCoy stops in mid-stride.  Slowly moves back for 
           Finley, eyes narrow, curious.

                                 MCCOY
                        The hell you just say?

                                 FINLEY
                        Don't act like you didn't hear me.  I'm 
                        not working up there without you.  The 
                        badge is yours, so suck it up.  Finish 
                        this. 

           McCoy lets out a deep SIGH, mulling it over -

                                 MCCOY
                        You really think I can do this?  

           Finley holds his gaze, convinced -

                                 FINLEY
                        Jim, you'll kill it.  You're a good cop.

Never once associating himself with 
           the phrase.  He likes it.  Almost smiles, beginning to 
           believe -

                        I'll kill it.

           Finley smiles, moving -

                        You better.

           They begin to walk for the door, pass a MAINTENANCE WORKER 
           applying paint to the wall above the waiting area, filling in 
           the letters that were once missing.

                                 FINLEY (CONT'D)
                        Let's get fucked up.  On me.  We're 
                        detectives now.

                                 MCCOY
                        Oh, so now you're thirsty.  Thought you 
                        didn't drink.

                        It's five o'clock somewhere.

           And our officers exit the building, stepping out into the 
           world.  Stronger.  Ready for the next chapter.

           The maintenance worker steps down the ladder, gathers his 
           tools, his little project complete.

           The wall now reads:  WE SERVE AND PROTECT

           And we -

                                               CUT TO BLACK.
