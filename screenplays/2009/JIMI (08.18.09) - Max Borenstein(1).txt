           we begin in whiteness

           a landscape of pure sound.

           the sound of thirty-thousand human beings waiting in silence.

           listening for the first whisper of music, a primordial rhythm

           ch-chk-chick-chicka-chaka-chicka-chak-chk

           a pick scratching muted strings

           long brown fingers

           against the white plastic sheen of a Fender electric guitar.

           chick-chak-chicka-chak

           the guttural rhythm rising

           and then the voice

           wah-wahwah-wahwahwah

           not a human voice.

           but the yearning cry of a man’s soul

           wah-wahwah-waah

           It is the sound of Jimi Hendrix.

           The song is Voodoo Child (Slight Return)

           but it cuts short with an abrupt squawk of feedback. The buzz 
           of distortion. Just a false start. And we are

           EXT. WOODSTOCK FESTIVAL - BEFORE DAWN (1969)

           A muddy expanse of farmland littered with refuse of the 
           “Summer of Love”: smoldering joints, sagging tents, soggy 
           flower children stricken by heat, exhaustion, the bummers.

           This is the portrait of a generation. But it is not the 
           generation that concerns us. It is the man on stage. The 
           black gypsy with a white guitar. Cigarette in his teeth. 
           Drenched in sweat. Searching for something. Looking 
           displeased. But focusing on the sound.

                                 JIMI
                        If you just, uh, bear with me for a 
                        minute and a half while we tune up.
           He taps a harmonic triad. Nothing musical. But enough to 
           elicit a boisterous scream from the crowd. It distracts him.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                             (wincing)
                        Yeah, baby, I love you, too. But if 
                        you don’t mind, uh, little quiet.

           For these people he is a god. For you he may be a legend. For 
           others a cliché- that voice on the radio, face on a T-shirt.

           For us he is only... JIMI. The aching hero of our story.

           (Note: It is 1969. But no chyron tells us so. This is not a 
           history lesson. This is the story of a young man.)

           Fade on super: Woodstock. 26 years old.

           The back-up band is growing restless.

           Jimi’s harried manager, MICHAEL JEFFREY, paces in the wings. 
           He is a pint-sized English pitbull. Calculator for a heart. 
           Snagging the head roadie (GERRY; cockney, good-natured)-

                                 JEFFREY
                        How long’s he been up there?

                                 GERRY
                        Almost three hours.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Jesus. Get him off.

           Jeffrey signals “cut” to the drummer (MITCH).

                                 JEFFREY (CONT’D)
                             (mouthing)
                        One more song! Tell him!

           But Jimi is in his own private universe. Obsessively tuning, 
           searching, fixated on the sound. As his cigarette burns out. 
           Gerry hustles up to replace it. Lighting a fresh one.

                                 JIMI
                             (off mic)
                        How bad is it?

           His eyes are bloodshot. He hasn’t slept in days.

                                 GERRY
                        Bad? No. It’s great. Great set! But 
                        we’re just thinking it’s almost 
                        sunrise. Mr. Jeffrey’s thinking 
                        maybe it’s about time...
           But Jimi leans into the mic.

                                 JIMI
                        You all ready to quit?

           The crowd roars. They are not.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                             (back to Gerry)
                        Guess we’re still searching.

           Gerry scampers offstage as Jimi picks up the rhythm. Wah-wah-
           chicka-chicka. The band joins in. Drums. Then bass. A groove 
           taking shape. Becoming a melody. Jimi can start to feel it...

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        WELL, I STAND UP NEXT TO A MOUNTAIN
                        CHOP IT DOWN WITH THE EDGE OF...
                             (stops short)

           He has seen something in the crowd-

           A woman, dancing. Or not a woman. The mere suggestion of a 
           woman. Barely more than a blur of otherworldly light. And yet 
           as she twirls- the glint of a warm smile- and kind eyes- 
           uncanny- connecting with Jimi alone across this sea of 
           humanity. Returning his hypnotized gaze. Penetrating him.

           INT. CATSKILL BEDROOM - DAY (ONE WEEK EARLIER)

           A quiet space. Only the whir of a portable 8-track recorder. 
           As Jimi noodles the first line of a tune on his guitar. Then 
           repeats it. Refining it. He is alone. His eyes are shut in a 
           sort of agony. Birth pangs. He is writing a new song. And 
           this one is a struggle. Blood from a stone.

                                 JIMI
                             (replaying the phrase as 
                              he tests lyrics)
                        ANGEL GO UP...
                        ANGEL GO DOWN...
                        ANGEL COME DOWN

           Yes. That’s it. But just as he takes a step forward...

                        ANGEL COME DOWN-

           A blast of raucous clatter cuts him short. Door swinging 
           open. Stoned revelers stumbling in. The party has found him.

                                 VOICES
                        Hey Jimi! Putting on a show?
           EXT. WOODSTOCK FESTIVAL - AS BEFORE

           The show has stopped. Jimi is frozen on stage. Eyes wide. 
           Transfixed by that dancing woman in the crowd. As the band 
           trades nervous looks. Restarting the groove. Repeating Jimi’s 
           cue. Once, twice... But no use. Finally falling silent.

                                 MITCH
                        Jimi?

           IN THE WINGS-

           Jeffrey grabs a blitzed-out hippie by the lapel.

                                 JEFFREY
                        What the hell did you give him?

                                 HIPPIE
                        Nothing- nothing all week!

           INT. CATSKILL LODGE - DAY (ONE WEEK EARLIER)

           A sprawling former hunting lodge. Taxidermy. Bohemian 
           transplants. But we catch the milieu only in passing. We are 
           tight on Jimi, guitar in hand, moving through the endless 
           party, jostling, searching for a quiet place to play. But 
           around every corner, through every door- more people.

                                 JIMI
                             (forcing hospitality)
                        Yeah, groovy, baby- glad you could 
                        make it.

           Jimi “knows” them all. None know him. Just bodies. Noise. 
           Confusion. Closing in. No peace, no relief.

           But amidst the bustle-

           We see something Jimi does not. The blur of a woman dancing. 
           A glimpse of those eyes. Kind eyes. Watching him.

           (Note: This woman will continue to appear. Always dancing. 
           Always fleeting. Visible only to Jimi. His angel.)

           Hands snare him. Tugging him to-

           A table scattered with tarot cards. A patchwork of images. 
           Pictograms. Cups, swords, symbols... faces.
                                 JIMI
                        Hm, me? Oh, no. Naw, man. I’m not-

           Hands gather up the images... offering Jimi the deck. He 
           hesitates. But he is trapped.

           EXT. WOODSTOCK FESTIVAL - AS BEFORE

           The crowd is growing restless. Heads turning. What does Jimi 
           see? An agitated documentary director barks into his walkie.

                                 MARTIN SCORSESE
                        Hey, what’s he looking at? Can 
                        camera six get a shot?

           Camera six whips the ocean of bodies, following Jimi’s gaze 
           to where the woman was standing. But the camera sees nothing.

           INT. CATSKILL LODGE - AS BEFORE

           Jimi has drawn a card. He is studying it intently. It has 
           given him pause...

           It is The Jack: a brown-skin man with a stringed instrument. 
           Vague resemblance to Jimi.

           EXT. WOODSTOCK FESTIVAL - AS BEFORE

           Jimi, captivated by the woman only he can see. Dancing to a 
           music only she can hear. Her face just a blur. Yet as she 
           twirls- the glimmer of a star-shaped earring... the red 
           streak of a stockinged foot... mismatched gloves... a white 
           flower... Each glimpse is another clue to her mystery.

           INT. CATSKILL LODGE - AS BEFORE

           Jimi lays out the next four tarot cards. They are The Queens. 

                                 JIMI
                             (reads)
                        Perhaps they represent a person in 
                        your life. Or people. If they are 
                        face cards, do they look familiar?

           And they do. Each with a different key attribute-

           A pair of star-shaped earrings... red stockings... mismatched 
           gloves... a white flower... As we

                                                              FLASH TO:

           The woman at Woodstock. Dancing. A blur of light. And

                                                         STILL FARTHER:

           A distant memory in fleeting glimpses: A night sky. Fireworks 
           exploding. And the same woman below. Seared by the light.

                                 JIMI (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        A wrong has been committed. You

                        you. This wrong has you trapped.

           The fireworks fade. And at last the woman’s eyes resolve from 
           the light. Kind eyes. A warm smile. But instantly...
           EXT. WOODSTOCK FESTIVAL - AS BEFORE

           A flare of blinding light as sunrise crests the hills.

           Jimi lurches, squinting, guitar whining feedback... And the 
           woman is gone.

                                 JIMI (V.O.)
                        Seek them out. Resolve this past to 
                        clear a path to your future.

           Jimi scans the crowd, frantic. As feedback mounts to shrill, 
           excruciating heights. The crowd cringes. Too much to bear.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Enough! Cut it! Get him off!

           Gerry scrambles for the audio cut-off switch. But just then-

           Born out of the sonic wreckage... that voice.

           The sound of Jimi’s guitar.

           Playing notes crisp and pure as any we’ve ever heard. It is a 
           familiar tune. It is The Star-Spangled Banner.

           But we have never heard it like this before. Keening, 
           searing, exploding like firecrackers through distortion.

           The band joins in a military cadence.

           Jeffrey and Gerry freeze...

           The crowd is rapt, hearing their nation’s anthem made new, 
           for a new generation...

           But for Jimi this song is not political. It is personal. The 
           crying wail of his soul. Eyes shut. Face contorted in 
           anguish. Yearning for a memory, just out of reach.

           As a final, piercing high note swirls back into noise, 
           nothingness, pure sound. And then

           Tremulous fingers. Haunted eyes. As Jimi draws a final card. 
           It is Judgement: a graveyard scene. Sallow corpses writhing 
           up from open crypts. Their arms outstretched. Up to heaven. 
           Where a beautiful angel is just emerging from the clouds.

           another day, another city, taking in the damage. The debris 
           of a never-ending tour: butts, roaches, dead soldiers.

           Daylight slices the curtains. Jimi squints. He should be 
           asleep. He gropes the floor for a phial of prescription 
           sleeping pills... all out. And there will be no sleep without 
           pills. Jimi falls back to the pillow. Lighting a cigarette.

           His battered guitar case is open by the bedside. Jimi pulls 
           out the white Fender Stratocaster. It gleams in the sun. 
           As Jimi lays it across his chest like a missing appendage. 
           Finally taking a breath. Calm washing over him as his long 
           fingers settle onto the strings. This guitar is his peace, 
           his salvation, his home. He powers on a portable amp. And 
           begins to play...

           Plunk-plunk. The strings are muted. There is a card woven 
           through the fret-board. Jimi slides it out: a tarot card. 
           Judgement. Jimi darkens. Memory flooding back. Haunted.

                                 SUE
                        Still stuck?

           Jimi jolts. He thought he was alone. He is not. SUE is 18, a 
           groupie, yawning up from the tangled bedsheets.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        I dig the intro-
                             (sings)
                        ANGEL TAKE ME...
                             (stops)
                        Guess that’s pretty much all you 
                        got, so far. I like it though. 
                        Really- speaks to me. Ya know?

           A beat. Finally-

                                 JIMI
                        Sure.

           She smiles, relieved.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        What’s it say?

                                 SUE
                        The song?

           Gulp. This stumps her.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        Well- um- like-
                             (uncertain)
                        There’s an angel? Taking you? But- 
                        I guess you’d know better than me.

           Jimi stares. At this child. So desperate to please. He could 
           destroy her. But he relents. She can be of use.

                                 JIMI
                        Where are we?

           He sits up, woozily.
                                 SUE
                        Don’t you remember?

           She hops out of bed, yanking open the curtains to reveal- the 
           space needle set against a gloomy Northwest sky.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        You’re home!

           Chyron: Seattle, Washington. 27 years old.

           Sue steps out onto the balcony. Peering down-

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        Just last night, that was me-

           To the sidewalk below. A few dozen teenage fans are holding a 
           round-the-clock vigil. Waiting for a glimpse of their hero.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        Then you pointed down, and voila...

           A cheer rises as the fans spot Jimi- wearily stepping out.

                                 SUE (CONT'D)
                             (waving back)
                        This morning, I’m a queen!

           Jimi flinches. This word strikes a nerve. He spins back and 
           tugs the curtains shut, stranding Sue on the balcony.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        Jimi?

           She pokes in, sheepishly.

                                 JIMI
                        You should go.

           He is rifling his guitar case-

           Searching for something, amidst scraps of paper. Notes. 
           Lyrics. Finally finding... the four tarot Queens.

                                 SUE
                        Go? But- is it something I-

                                 JIMI
                             (flashing anger)
                        Ain’t you got a home or something?!

           His eyes are fierce, cruel. And instantly, Sue is in tears.
                                 SUE
                        Oh, I always ruin everything!

           She bites back sobs, fumbling to gather her clothes. Dropping 
           things. Empathetic. And Jimi cannot help it- anger subsiding- 
           he feels her pain. He is this way with women.

                                 JIMI
                        Hey- naw- I didn’t mean it. Don’t 
                        cry, girl. Don’t ever cry.

           He stops her, wiping tears with his fingers.

                                 SUE
                        ...Sue.

                                 JIMI
                        I remember. Seattle Sue. Don’t you 
                        know how much I like you?

                                 SUE
                        You do?

                                 JIMI
                        Sure I do. Even wrote you a song!

           And in a single motion, he slings on the guitar, tweaks the 
           tuning, and strums into a familiar melody. The same song he 
           began at Woodstock: The Wind Cries Mary.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        AFTER ALL THE JACKS ARE IN THEIR 
                        BOXES

                                 SUE
                        Aw, don’t tease.

                                 JIMI
                        Who’s teasing?

                                 SUE
                        I’m your biggest fan, remember? 
                        That’s an old one. You just met me 
                        last night.

           She has a point. But it is no match for Jimi’s charm.

                                 JIMI
                        Yeah, girl, but you my queen, 
                        remember? I knew you were coming.
                             (sings)
                        AND THE CLOWNS HAVE ALL GONE TO BED
                        YOU CAN HEAR HAPPINESS STAGGERING 
                        ON DOWN THE STREET
                                 (MORE)
                                 JIMI (CONT'D)
                        FOOTPRINTS DRESSED IN RED
                        AND THE WIND CRIES... SUE

           If ever a man had an element, these are Jimi’s: a guitar. And 
           a woman. She melts. And as the song continues we drift out to

           INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

           Several maids crouch above a discarded tray of room service, 
           eavesdropping on the free show.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Tickets are 2.75 at the stadium, 
                        ladies!

           Jeffrey barrels up with a clipboard, the harried Svengali.

                                 JEFFREY (CONT'D)
                        No refunds!

           He shoos them off, briefly glancing at the room service bill. 
           Tallying the figures. Always tallying figures. Displeased.

           As a Western Union messenger boy appears-

                                 MESSENGER
                        Telegram for Mr. Hendrix?

                                 JEFFREY
                        He’s mine.

           Jeffrey snatches it, ignoring the customary tip. He scans the 
           message for a name, reading...

                                 JEFFREY (CONT’D)
                        Kathy.

           His perennial frown droops to a grimace. This could spell 
           more than the usual trouble.

                                 JEFFREY (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - AS BEFORE

           Jimi is just finishing the song for a spellbound Sue.

                                 JIMI
                        AND THE WIND CRIES...

           As Jeffrey barges in- cutting him off.
                                 JEFFREY
                        Jail bait.
                             (a stern look)
                        Now drop the ax and let her go.

           INT. HOTEL CORRIDORS - DAY

           Moving at a rapid clip. Jeffrey leads the way. Jimi lags 
           behind, preoccupied by the telegram. Gerry trails them both, 
           escorting Jimi’s precious guitar case.

                                 JIMI
                             (reading aloud)
                        In Seattle Fairmont Hotel. Miss 
                        you, stop. Kathy.

                                 JEFFREY
                        ‘Nother one from the woodwork, eh? 
                        How long’s it been?
                             (pointed)
                        Nine months?

           But Jimi has stopped in his tracks, wheels spinning.

                                 JIMI
                        Hm?

                                 JEFFREY
                        You know- since you and her last-

                                 JIMI
                             (distracted)
                        Oh, um- three years.

                                 JEFFREY
                        That’s a relief. I’ll tell her to 
                        piss off then.

           He checks the item off his list. Tugs Jimi along.

                                 JEFFREY (CONT’D)
                        Now then: that contract we talked 
                        about...

                                 JIMI
                        I hurt her.

                                 JEFFREY
                             (ignoring him)
                        Just a basic extension of our 
                        arrangement...

           He produces paperwork: a management contract.
                                 JEFFREY (CONT’D)
                        Boilerplate, really. I say, what’s 
                        a signature between friends? Word 
                        is bond, all that. But you know the 
                        lawyers...
                             (finally stops, hearing)
                        You what?

           Jimi, that haunted look.

                                 JEFFREY (CONT’D)
                        Jesus. Fine. Invite her to the 
                        show. Just no more freebies. If we 
                        comp every bird you ever shagged, 
                        we’ll never earn a dime.
                             (next item)
                        Which reminds me...

           More paperwork on the clipboard: a travel itinerary.

                                 JEFFREY (CONT’D)
                        Your British dates. Eight weeks 
                        then Europe. We leave tomorrow.

                                 JIMI
                        No. I told you. I can’t. I’m-

                                 JEFFREY
                        Stuck. Yes, I remember. Like that 
                        record we promised. Two years ago. 
                        The one we had to build a brand-new 
                        studio to record. Six figures and a 
                        couple ulcers later, I’m juggling 
                        death threats from Warner Brothers. 
                        And you’re seeing ghosts!
                             (off Jimi’s look)
                        Yeah- Gerry told me.

                                 JIMI
                        It was a woman.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Isn’t it always. Dancing in 
                        shimmering light, was she? I swear 
                        that head of yours is a fucking 
                        Chinese box. Riddle in a riddle. 
                        When the only mystery you need to 
                        solve is how to shut it off.

           They reach an elevator- doors gliding shut. Descending.

                                 JIMI
                        I just need to get things straight.
                                 JEFFREY
                        Is that why you’re calling Chas 
                        Chandler?

           This catches Jimi off guard. It was meant to.

                                 JIMI
                        That’s private.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Not when I pay the phone bills-

           Still more paperwork: the hotel phone bill.

                                 JEFFREY (CONT’D)
                        Forty-three quid to Newcastle?

                                 JIMI
                        Chas is a friend.

                                 JEFFREY
                        You don’t have friends, Jimi. 
                        You’re a 27-year-old millionaire 
                        with charmed fingers and a 10-inch 
                        cock. Everybody wants something.

           He draws a bottle of barbiturates from his coat pocket: red 
           devils. Planting it in Jimi’s palm.

                                 JEFFREY (CONT’D)
                        Now take two of these. And smile!

           Ding. The doors open onto- an explosion of flashbulbs.

           INT. EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Brown fingers unfold Jimi’s room service bill... The tempting 
           undertones of a practiced black-marketeer.

                                 REGGIE
                        Hot off the presses.

           REGGIE is 40s, black and streetwise, in a dishwasher’s smock. 
           The “Guest Signature” is an illegible scrawl. TOBY is wary.

                                 TOBY
                             (inspects it)
                        Are you sure it’s really him?

           He is 18, white, callow, changing out of a bellhop uniform.
                                 REGGIE
                        Presidential Suite. Heard him phone 
                        the order myself: cheeseburger, 
                        fries, apple pie for dessert.
                             (feigning impatience)
                        Say, I thought your girl was a fan.

                                 TOBY
                        Well, she is, but-

           Reggie snatches it back.

                                 REGGIE
                        Then it’s twenty for the tickets. 
                        Ten for the signature. And another 
                        fiver for housekeeping.

                                 TOBY
                        Thirty five? That’s a whole week.

                                 REGGIE
                        Tell you what. I was gonna price 
                        this item separate-

           He unfurls a cellophane wrapper to reveal... a long strand of 
           kinky black hair.

                                 REGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Two white chicks went into that 
                        room last night, both of ‘em 
                        blonde. Go on, have a feel. Just 
                        for you. A little piece of Jimi.

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

           The explosion of flashbulbs. A media frenzy. Assaulting Jimi. 
           Jeffrey gobbles it up with a shark-tooth grin.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Thank you- Certainly- Seattle is a 
                        very special place for Jimi-

           We catch only snippets of the flurry:

                                 MEDIA VOICES
                        Jimi! Jimi! What do you say to the- 
                        Rumors...? Lawsuits...? Drug 
                        bust...? Album delay...? Burnt 
                        out...? Flash in the pan...?

           But Jimi hears none of this. His POV scanning the crowd to 
           spot- Gerry, transporting his guitar through a service exit. 
           Jimi tries to follow, but he is cut off... trapped. 
           Like a deer in the headlights. Petrified. Desperate to 
           escape. But with nowhere left to run. Then suddenly-

           Jimi turns to the cameras... and smiles. That megawatt charm. 
           Flashbulbs explode in a flood of blinding light.

                                 MEDIA VOICES (CONT’D)
                        Jimi! Jimi! Jimi!

           Until the blindness clears. Lenses, eyeballs darting about...

                                 MEDIA VOICES (CONT’D)
                        Jimi?

           But Jimi is gone. Service doors swinging in his wake.

           EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY

           A beat-up Volkswagon Beetle. Tattered ragtop. Peeling banana 
           paint. But a brand-new state-of-the-art stereo, playing-

           Jimi Hendrix: Crosstown Traffic.

                                 SONG (ON RADIO)
                        YOU JUMP IN FRONT OF MY CAR
                        WHEN YOU KNOW ALL THE TIME
                        THAT NINETY MILES AN HOUR, GIRL
                        IS THE SPEED I DRIVE

           As the bug pulls out into traffic

           INT. VW BUG - CONTINUOUS

           Toby is at the wheel. Distracted by his new purchase: the 
           scalped tickets, room-service bill, strand of hair. A hint of 
           buyer’s remorse. Did he really just pay for this?
                        YOU TELL ME IT'S ALRIGHT
                        YOU DON'T MIND A LITTLE PAIN
                        YOU SAY YOU JUST WANT ME TO
                        TAKE YOU FOR A RIDE

           And just then, from the corner of his eye-

           A figure darts out ahead. Toby slamming the brakes- screech- 
           within inches of... Jimi.

           Guitar in hand. Staring back. And looks to be in a hurry.
                        YOU’RE JUST LIKE CROSSTOWN TRAFFIC 
                        SO HARD TO GET THROUGH TO YOU
                        CROSSTOWN TRAFFIC
                        I DON'T NEED TO RUN OVER YOU
                                 (MORE)
                                 SONG (ON RADIO) (CONT'D)
                        CROSSTOWN TRAFFIC
                        ALL YOU DO IS SLOW ME DOWN

                                 JIMI
                        Goin’ my way?

           Toby, jaw in his lap. As Jimi hops in. And they peel out...

                                 SONG (ON RADIO)
                        AND I'M TRYIN' TO GET
                        ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN

           EXT. HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Jeffrey bursts out the service exit to find- Gerry at the 
           tour bus, loading gear. Jimi’s guitar is gone.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Where the hell is he?

           INT. VW BUG - DAY

           Rounding a corner... and out of sight. As Jimi lets out a 
           whoop, laughing, drinking the freedom. Wind in his hair.

                                 JIMI
                        Got a name, brother?

           Toby is in shock.

                                 TOBY
                        Uh- erm-

           He spots the cellophane wrapper: tickets, room-service bill, 
           strand of hair. Sweeping it to the floor before Jimi notices.

                                 TOBY (CONT’D)
                        Toby.

                                 JIMI
                        Far out. Call me Jim.

           EXT. AFFLUENT SUBURB - DAY

           A tree-lined street. Green lawns. Picket fences. Toby parks 
           the bug in front of a well-kept home. Leaving the key in the 
           ignition. The door unlocked.

                                 JIMI
                        Nice neighborhood.
           Which means, not the kind that Jimi is used to.

                                 TOBY
                        Aren’t you from Seattle?

                                 JIMI
                        Not this one.

           He is drawing glances. The conservative neighbor on his 
           porch. The nosy housewife snipping her azaleas... Eyeing the 
           black stranger with suspicion, outright hostility.

                                 TOBY
                        You can come in if you want. Only 
                        take a minute.

           INT. AFFLUENT HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Plush, homey decor. Radiating warmth. Family. Jimi inspects 
           the home-spun poem on a woven wall-hanging:

           “Here may you find comfort and rest
           Here you are always our welcome guest.”

           Banal, sure. But to a man without a home, nirvana.

                                 JIMI
                             (marvelling)
                        Home sweet home.

           A pristine baby-grand piano is topped with an array of family 
           portraits. Tow-heads. Mother, father, teenage daughter: Lane.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        Your girlfriend?

           Toby pauses at the stairs. Thinking twice.

                                 TOBY
                        Maybe just hang down here a beat. 
                        She’s- kind of a fan.

           INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY

           This is Lane’s room. A veritable shrine to Jimi Hendrix. 
           Walls plastered with his two-dimensional image: posters, news 
           clippings, ticket stubs. (The way we know Jimi today.)

           A record spins on the turntable: Voodoo Chile.
                                 SONG (ON RECORD)
                        YEAH, I’M A VOODOO CHILE
                        LORD, I’M A VOODOO CHILE

           The door is a life-size cutout of Jimi. Toby pokes in behind 
           it...

                                 TOBY
                        Lane?

           But the music is too loud. Steam is billowing from the 
           bathroom door, slightly ajar. And through it- just the 
           faintest wisp of blonde hair, naked skin. Toby is caught 
           staring... when he accidentally bumps the turntable.

                                 SONG (ON RECORD)
                             (skipping)
                        VOODOO CHILE... VOODOO CHILE... 
                        VOODOO CHILE...

                                 LANE
                        Next time you sneak up on a girl, 
                        try not to skip the record.

           LANE is 18, fresh from the shower, stunning. She corners him.

                                 TOBY
                        No, uh- wait, we’re not-

                                 LANE
                        It’s cool. My mom’s at the store.
                             (hopeful)
                        Did you get the tickets?

                                 TOBY
                        The-? Oh. Uh- yeah, but there’s 
                        actually something else you-

                                 LANE
                        Shh!

           The solo kicks in- plaintive moan of Jimi’s guitar.

                                 LANE (CONT’D)
                             (plucks her bubble gum)
                        I love this part.

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS WASHROOM - SAME

           Floral wallpaper. Potpourri. The song faintly audible from 
           above. Jimi is alone at the sink. Studying... the pictograms 
           of his four tarot Queens. We do not yet see them in full. 
           Only their key attributes: red stockings on one... mismatched 
           gloves on another... a white flower... star-shaped earrings.

           And maybe for an instant- behind Jimi in the mirror, the 
           briefest blur of light- that woman, dancing. His angel.

           But then gone. His heart skips a beat. Shaken.

           Jimi pockets the cards. Uncapping the bottle of barbiturates. 
           Two pills... three. He gulps them with a handful of water.

           Sound of a car door slamming. As Jimi reenters

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Coming face to face with- MARIE, 40s, elegant, just returning 
           with a bundle of groceries. She shrieks, spilling groceries.

                                 JIMI
                        No- wait, wait-

                                 MARIE
                             (stumbling back)
                        Take anything!

                                 JIMI
                        Don’t run-

                                 MARIE
                        Where’s Lanie? Where’s my baby?

                                 JIMI
                        She’s- just upstairs, I think. 
                        With, uh, Toby.

                                 MARIE
                        Toby?

           A beat. Trying to process-

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        Toby Comstock?

                                 JIMI
                        Must be. Yeah.

                                 MARIE
                             (narrows her eyes)
                        You do look familiar.

           The face from her daughter’s shrine.
                                 JIMI
                        Oh, yeah?

           So much for freedom. But Marie can’t quite seem to place it.

                                 MARIE
                        Do you work at the hotel?

                                 JIMI
                        Uh- yes ma’am!

           Jimi grins- blissful anonymity.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        Elevator operator. Here, let me get 
                        those.

           He kneels to collect her groceries. Repacking the bundle. And 
           Marie is impressed. A perfect gentleman, despite the sizable 
           afro, hippie attire... not to mention, well, being black.

                                 MARIE
                        Thank you, that’s very- polite.

           Jimi meets her smile. That irresistible charm.

                                 JIMI
                        You have musical hands.

           He takes one- by way of returning the repacked groceries. It 
           sends a girlish flush to her cheek. She does not pull away.

                                 MARIE
                        Oh! Well- I teach.

           AT THE PIANO - A MOMENT LATER

           Jimi and Marie sit side by side.

                                 MARIE
                        Now don’t slouch! Proper playing 
                        requires a proper posture.

                                 JIMI
                        I think you’ll find I’m chock full 
                        of bad habits, miss-?
                             (fishing for her name)

                                 MARIE
                        Marie.
                                 JIMI
                        Truly?
                             (lighting up at the name)
                        Sweet Marie! How about that! You’re 
                        not going to believe this... but I 
                        think I wrote you a song.

           INT. LANE’S ROOM - DAY

           Up here, the record has come to an end. Needle rhythmically 
           scuffing the center groove. As Toby and Lane make out... 
           Sound of piano music wafting up from below.

                                 TOBY
                        Do you hear that?

                                 LANE
                             (between kisses)
                        Mm? Mom must have a student.

                                 TOBY
                        Oh- right.
                             (then, remembering)
                        Jimi!

                                 LANE
                        What?

           Toby springs to the window, spreading the blinds to reveal- 
           Marie’s station wagon parked below. He sprints out.

                                 LANE (CONT’D)
                             (following)
                        Where are you going?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Jimi chords a piano rendition of The Wind Cries Mary. An old 
           song. But this time for a new audience. Marie is rapt.

                                 JIMI
                        THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS, THEY TURN BLUE 
                        TOMORROW
                        AND SHINE THEIR EMPTINESS DOWN ON 
                        MY BED
                        THE TINY ISLAND SAGS DOWNSTREAM
                        ‘CAUSE THE LIFE THAT LIVED IS DEAD
                        AND THE WIND SCREAMS... MARIE

           But just now, it is Lane who screams... seeing Jimi Hendrix 
           in her living room, with her mother.
                                 MARIE
                             (shushing her)
                        Quiet, dear!

           But Jimi does not miss a beat. He is lost in the song, 
           reinventing it for virgin ears. Hearing it, himself, anew.

                                 JIMI
                        WILL THE WIND EVER REMEMBER
                        THE NAMES IT HAS BLOWN IN THE PAST?

           His eyelids flutter shut. An electric guitar picking up on 
           track for an extended solo. As we

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           EXT. LONDON - ESTABLISHING - DUSK (1966)

           A TWA jumbo jet touching down on the Heathrow tarmac.

           INT. HEATHROW TERMINAL - DUSK

           A sea of English travelers. White faces. Among whom the black 
           American stands out: Dylan style-curls, cowboy boots, 
           Cherokee hat. Not yet a star. But already a peacock. Carrying 
           the same battered guitar case. As a CUSTOMS AGENT studies his 
           passport: “Occupation: Musician”

                                 CUSTOMS AGENT
                        This is a non-work visa.
                             (knits a brow)
                        That wouldn’t be your instrument, 
                        would it?

           Chyron: London. 23 years old.

                                 JIMI
                        Oh- um-

                                 CHAS
                        No, sir!
                             (cuts in, snatching it)
                        All mine.

           CHAS is 30, working-class Brit. Mod hair, three-piece suit. 
           Newcastle boy made good. He is Jimi’s brand-new manager.

                                 CHAS (CONT’D)
                             (reassuring)
                        Mr. Hendrix is here exclusively on 
                        pleasure.
           The Customs Agent chews a cheek, dubious. Then stamps the 
           passport. Waving them through. Chas exhales relief.

                                 CHAS (CONT’D)
                             (to Jimi, sotto)
                        Right then, let’s hope not. First 
                        step, find you a band. I’ve already 
                        placed an advert. I’m thinking bare 
                        minimum: drums, bass, you...

           But his voice drowns into the din- guitar solo rising on 
           track- as Jimi stares across the crowded terminal, fixated 
           on... the red stockings of a TWA stewardess. Her alabaster 
           skin, ginger hair in an up-do, blue eyes unabashed, returning 
           his gaze with an instant, carnal attraction. This is KATHY.

                                 CHAS (CONT’D)
                        What do you think? Jimi?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SOHO FLAT - THE NEXT DAY

           Jimi is buck naked on the windowsill- dangling a post-coital 
           cigarette. Finishing the same song on his guitar.

                                 JIMI
                        AND WITH THIS CRUTCH, ITS OLD AGE, 
                        AND ITS WISDOM
                        IT WHISPERS NO, THIS WILL BE THE 
                        LAST
                        AND THE WIND CRIES... KATHY

           Kathy is brewing a pot of tea. She is cockney. Streetwise 
           beyond her 20 years.

                                 KATHY
                        For me, eh? You use that line on 
                        every girl you shag? ‘Cause we only 
                        met last night and frankly I didn’t 
                        see you do much song-writing.

           Jimi spreads a coy grin, plays a sexy lick on the guitar.

                                 KATHY (CONT’D)
                        Do you always let that instrument 
                        do the talking?

           He does it again, making the guitar “talk”: Mm-hm.

                                 KATHY (CONT’D)
                        I might get tired of this.
           The room is sparse, student-chic. Jimi notices a ceramic bust 
           on the mantel. Talks the guitar: Who’s that?

                                 KATHY (CONT’D)
                        Him? Georg Handel. The composer. He 
                        used to live just across the yard.

                                 JIMI
                        You don’t say?
                             (peers out, captured)
                        Heavy. I live next door to Handel.

           This takes Kathy by surprise.

                                 KATHY
                        Moved in already, have you?

                                 JIMI
                             (shrugs)
                        Why not? Got all my possessions 
                        right here.

           He reels her in with the neck of his guitar.

                                 KATHY
                        Now just what exactly are you 
                        calling a possession?

                                 JIMI
                        Well-

           He snags her red underpants with a free hand, slips them off-

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        How about these for starters?

           and sails them out the window with a flip of the wrist.

           EXT. SOHO - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           The Polytechnic Theater. Ground zero of mod, happening 
           London. Sassoon haircuts. Carnaby Street duds.

           A marquee announcing: “Eric Clapton and Cream”

           INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           A dusky labyrinth. Chas leads the way. Past scenesters, 
           roadies. Jimi keeps up, Kathy on his arm. Already an item.

                                 KATHY
                        Eric Clapton? Really?!
                                 JIMI
                        Can you dig it, Kath? Wants to hear 
                        me!

                                 CHAS
                        Do I do my job, or do I do my job?

           The reach the dressing room door. Jimi pauses to reflect.

                                 JIMI
                        Back home no one knows my name.

                                 CHAS
                        Back home you never had me.

           And into

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ERIC CLAPTON is 21, hair in curlers. Not yet the elder 
           statesman. Here, just a cocky prince.

                                 CLAPTON
                        Chas Chandler! What do you think?

           He is trying on a T-shirt in the mirror: “Clapton is God”

                                 CLAPTON (CONT’D)
                        Fan printed up a whole box. Never 
                        went in much for church, but this I 
                        could get used to.

                                 CHAS
                        Eric, there’s someone I’d like you 
                        to-

                                 CLAPTON
                             (turning back)
                        Hello, love.

           He glosses right past Jimi- taking Kathy by the hand. She 
           blushes. Jimi sees it. Chas is slightly thrown.

                                 CHAS
                        Erm- Eric, this is Jimi Hendrix.

                                 CLAPTON
                        Of course. The Yankee sensation- 
                        who no one’s even heard play!

                                 JIMI
                             (weathering this)
                        Glad to meet you.
           Clapton casually avoids his handshake.

                                 CLAPTON
                        But who needs to hear a man with a 
                        face like that? Chas says you’re 
                        the genuine article. A real blues 
                        man- with the skin to prove it. You 
                        have any idea what my mates and I’d 
                        have given for that?

                                 JIMI
                             (a slow burn)
                        Trust me- it ain’t all roses.

                                 CLAPTON
                        Cries the coconut with a little 
                        white dove on his arm!
                             (pointed)
                        We English always did have a taste 
                        for the exotic.

           Jimi is ready to flare. But Chas stays him.

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        On in 5! Clear out, please!

                                 CLAPTON
                             (to Kathy)
                        Oh, you can stay, love.

           Throws Jimi a T-shirt-

                                 CLAPTON (CONT’D)
                        T-shirt, Johnnie?

           INT. POLYTECHNIC THEATER - NIGHT

           An elite crowd. VIP faces we might recognize. White, English 
           faces. Jimi storms past. Tossing the T-shirt.

                                 CHAS
                        Jimi, wait! Hold up-
                             (chasing him)
                        Listen, it isn’t personal. You’re 
                        the new cock on the walk, he’s 
                        threatened. It’s only human.

           Chas catches him at the door. Jimi spins back, noticing-

                                 JIMI
                        Where’s Kathy?
                                 CHAS
                        I, uh- thought she was following.
                             (a shot in the dark)
                        Maybe the loo?

           But they both know exactly where she is.

                                 CHAS (CONT’D)
                        You just met her, Jimi. Better now-

                                 JIMI
                             (determined)
                        Get me up there.

           The stage. House lights beginning to dim.

                                 CHAS
                        Of course. In good time.

                                 JIMI
                        No. Here. Tonight.

                                 CHAS
                        Well, Jimi, that’s not-

                                 JIMI
                        This is the scene, isn’t it? Where 
                        it’s at?

                                 CHAS
                        Well, yes- but we can’t just-

           But Jimi is resolved.

                                 JIMI
                        Where’s my guitar? I’m sitting in.

                                 CHAS
                        You can’t!

                                 LOUDSPEAKER
                        Ladies and gentlemen...

                                 CHAS
                        This isn’t some pub band, Jimi, 
                        it’s-

                                 LOUDSPEAKER
                        ...Cream!

           Cream taking the stage. Clapton, basking in the cheers. 
           Spotting Jimi in the crowd- and Kathy, just emerging from 
           backstage. He gives her a wink. And that’s the straw.
                                 JIMI
                        Screw it.

                                 CHAS
                        Jimi!

           But in a flash... Jimi darts to the front of the theater, 
           climbing a guardrail and mounting the stage.

                                 KATHY
                             (returning to Chas)
                        What the hell is he doing?

                                 CHAS
                        Where were you?

                                 KATHY
                        Went to the loo. Why?

                                 CHAS
                        Oh, shit.

           A confused murmur ripples the crowd, as Jimi bounds up the 
           stage- to Clapton’s rack of guitars. All right-handed.

                                 JIMI
                        Mind if I borrow one of these?

           Clapton stammers, caught off guard.

                                 CLAPTON
                        We- erm- were about to play a set, 
                        Johnnie.

                                 JIMI
                        It’s Jimi-
                             (leans into the mic)
                        Jimi Hendrix.

           The crowd falls silent. No idea who he is. But piqued.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        What do you say, folks? Y’all think 
                        god here is ready for a dance with 
                        the devil?

           He slings on a right-handed guitar- upside down.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        ‘Course I normally play lefty, but 
                        I reckon he deserves a little 
                        handicap.

           This wins a laugh from the crowd. Clapton is not pleased.
                                 CLAPTON
                             (a whispered shout to 
                              security in the wings)
                        What the hell are you waiting for? 
                        Get him off!

           A pair of massive bouncers promptly rush the stage, but-

                                 VOICES
                        Let him play!

           The crowd cheers in affirmation. Hungry for a showdown. And 
           Clapton finds himself between a rock and, well, a rock-star.

                                 CLAPTON
                        Very well, then.
                             (rising to the challenge)
                        Twelve-bar blues?

           Jimi grins.

                                 JIMI
                        Name that tune.

           And with a nod to the band... Clapton kicks off a bluesy 
           rhythm. The song is Crossroads.

                                 CLAPTON
                        I WENT DOWN TO THE CROSSROADS
                        FELL DOWN ON MY KNEES

           Jimi joins in.

                                 JIMI
                        I WENT DOWN TO THE CROSSROADS
                        FELL DOWN ON MY KNEES
                        ASKED THE LORD ABOVE FOR MERCY
                        SAVE ME IF YOU PLEASE

           Clapton takes the first solo. A pentatonic run. Nothing 
           flashy. Simple. Virtuosic. Finishing high and sweet.

                                 CLAPTON
                        I WENT DOWN TO THE CROSSROADS
                        TRIED TO FLAG A RIDE
                        I WENT DOWN TO THE CROSSROADS
                        TRIED TO FLAG A RIDE

           Clapton is singing directly to Kathy in the crowd. Jimi sees.

                                 JIMI
                        NOBODY SEEMED TO KNOW ME
                        EVERYBODY PASSED ME BY
           And now it is his turn. The next solo. Jimi launches in 
           without restraint. Shredding up and down the scales. No doubt 
           about it. He is showing off. And a shade too much, at that.

                                 CHAS
                             (rooting quietly)
                        Don’t force it, Jimi.

           Jeffrey sidles up with a whisky. Assessing Jimi, dubious.

                                 JEFFREY
                        This the new phenom, Chas?

                                 CLAPTON
                        YOU CAN RUN, YOU CAN RUN
                        TELL MY FRIEND POOR WILLIE BROWN

                                 JIMI
                        YOU CAN RUN, YOU CAN RUN
                        TELL MY FRIEND POOR WILLIE BROWN

           And the next solos trade fast and free. Phrase by phrase. 
           Riff by riff. Each one-upping the last. As the crowd, rapt, 
           judges every trill, hammer-on, and flourish.

                                 JEFFREY
                             (unimpressed)
                        Me-thinks the lady doth protest too 
                        much.

           And he’s right...

           Clapton tones it down for the last solo. A plaintive, crisp 
           retort to Jimi’s flash. Slaying him. With a final, 
           devastating wink to Kathy. That leaves Jimi, seething.

                                 CLAPTON
                        AND I’M STANDING AT THE CROSSROADS

                                 JIMI
                        BELIEVE I’M SINKING DOWN

           The crowd goes wild. Rendering a unanimous verdict: Clapton 
           is still their god.

           Chas sinks, defeated- so much for the next sensation.

           On stage, the bouncers close in. As Jimi, thinking fast-

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                             (grabs the mic)
                        This next song goes out to the 
                        white dove in the red panties.
           Cheers subside. Jimi is staring right at Kathy. She blushes.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        Baby, you know who you are.

           And with that-

           Jimi spools his volume knob, blasting overdrive. A tidal-wave 
           of distortion smacking the crowd. Obliterating the blues. 
           This is the new sound. This is why it is called “rock”.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        Try to keep up, boys-

           Crashing into a power chord intro-

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        ALRIGHT, NOW DIG THIS BABY
                        YOU DON’T CARE FOR ME?
                        I DON’T CARE ABOUT THAT
                        YOU GOT A NEW FOOL?
                        HA! I LIKE IT LIKE THAT

           He is singing to Kathy. Heads turn. She is mortified.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        I HAVE ONLY ONE BURNING DESIRE
                        LET ME STAND NEXT TO YOUR FIRE!

           Jimi tears into a frenzied solo- wild, but nothing forced 
           about it. This is scorching, erotic...

           It vibrates seats in the house. Rumbling more than guts. 
           Women bite their lips. Pure sound has invaded them.

                                 JEFFREY
                        What’d he say his name was?

           Chas smiles. This is Jimi Hendrix.

           On stage, even Clapton is humbled, in awe. As Jimi literally 
           nudges him aside-

                                 JIMI
                        OH! MOVE OVER, ROVER
                        AND LET JIMI TAKE OVER!

           Jimi skids across the stage for a final blistering solo... 
           playing the guitar behind his back, with his tongue, his 
           teeth. It is a pyrotechnic explosion that surmounts mere 
           music. This is complete theater. The guitar solo that will 
           change the face of rock and roll... And then it’s over.

           And for a moment-
           Jimi hangs there, spent.

           The longest silence in the world.

           Then- thunder. Crowd leaping to its feet. Worshipping their 
           new god.

           And for the first time in his life to this point- Jimi feels 
           the love- soaking it in- squinting into the spotlights...

           But sees Kathy storming out.

           INT. BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           VIPs crush in to greet the new sensation.

                                 CHAS
                        Jimi, this is Michael Jeffrey. He 
                        manages The Animals.

                                 JEFFREY
                        And you next, I hope!
                             (adding, as an 
                              afterthought)
                        Along with Chas, of course.

           But Jimi is distracted. Craning for Kathy. She is gone.

                                 JIMI
                        Uh- yeah, groovy. Will you excuse 
                        me?

           EXT. SOHO STREET - NIGHT

           Kathy stalking off...

                                 JIMI
                        Hey there! Where you running?
                             (hustling up)
                        Hang tight, will ya?

                                 KATHY
                        If you’ve come to stake a claim, 
                        try lifting your leg on a wall. I’m 
                        nobody’s trophy.

           She hails a taxicab. Pops the door. Jimi stops her.

                                 JIMI
                        Aw, no, come on. I’d never think so- 
                        I just got carried away is all.
           Kathy takes him in, genuinely perplexed.

                                 KATHY
                        Who are you?

                                 JIMI
                        You remember, girl. Just Jimi.

                                 KATHY
                        Then who the hell was that?

           Back in the club. Back on the stage.

                                 JIMI
                        I- I don’t know. When I’m up there- 
                        it’s different. Something comes 
                        over me.

                                 KATHY
                        Doctor Jeckyll and Mister Hendrix? 
                        Is that it?

                                 JIMI
                        No. Well, I guess- it’s like up 
                        there, I feel- whole.

           Jimi is baring his soul. Kathy sneers.

                                 KATHY
                        Lovely. Then why don’t you go shag 
                        an audience and leave me out of it?

           She slides into the cab.

                                 JIMI
                        No, wait! Listen, don’t leave- 
                        please.

                                 KATHY
                        Give me one good reason.

           But Jimi the on-stage dynamo has shrunk back to human scale. 
           From hound dog to whimpering puppy.

                                 JIMI
                        Didn’t you dig the music?

           A beat. It is the best he’s got. It is plenty.

                                 KATHY
                        Yes.
                             (laughing)
                        Yes, it was amazing!
           Jimi smiles- a glimmer of that hound dog trickling back.

                                 JIMI
                        Anyhow- I can think of at least one 
                        more thing in this life- makes me 
                        feel whole.

           Those bedroom eyes. Kathy, falling in. Falling hard. As we

                                                             RETURN TO:

           INT. SEATTLE HOTEL - DAY (1970)

           Jeffrey’s suite. A frenzied hive of activity. Roadies bustle 
           about, lackeys deflect reporters.

                                 JEFFREY
                             (into phone)
                        No, no one ran off... yes, Jimi 
                        is... of course it was a planned... 
                        He’ll be back for the show!

           He slams the phone. Just as Chas comes through the door. 
           Startled by the hubbub.

                                 CHAS
                        What’s all this?

                                 REPORTERS
                             (descending like vultures)
                        Chas? Chas Chandler? Are you back 
                        in Jimi’s life? Do you know where 
                        he’s gone?

                                 CHAS
                             (confused)
                        Gone?

           Jeffrey elbows them aside, tugging Chas into-

           THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Where a startled Gerry is just having a piss. Jeffrey slams 
           the door. Fists at Chas’ lapels. Fury in his eyes.

                                 JEFFREY
                        You!

                                 CHAS
                        Pleasure’s mutual.
                                 JEFFREY
                        Where is he?

                                 CHAS
                        Who? Jimi? Isn’t he here?

           Jeffrey reads him. A beat. But Chas is clearly in the dark.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Shit.

                                 GERRY
                        Guess we can cross Chandler off the 
                        list.

           He shakes it, zipping up.

                                 GERRY (CONT’D)
                             (offering a hand)
                        Chas.

                                 CHAS
                             (avoiding it)
                        What list? What’s going on?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Why don’t you tell me? Forty-three 
                        quid in phone calls to an old 
                        manager across the pond?

                                 CHAS
                        He’s been upset. Home town always 
                        puts him on edge.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Is that why you just happen to roll 
                        in the very day he pisses off 
                        without a word?

                                 CHAS
                        You know Jimi- probably skipped out 
                        for a shag.

                                 JEFFREY
                        So find him.

                                 CHAS
                        That’s your job. Maybe Jimi wants 
                        to be gone. I know I did.

           He moves to the door, but Jeffrey blocks him.
                                 JEFFREY
                        The door tonight is a hundred 
                        grand.

           This is an old game. Chas knows it. Wants no part.

                                 CHAS
                             (brushing past)
                        Which you can enjoy in peace.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Bring him back alive, you take home 
                        twenty.

           Chas stops. Slowly turning back-

                                 CHAS
                        Alive?

           INT. JIMI’S SUITE - DAY

           It has been torn apart. Scavenged for clues. But all they 
           managed to find was- a single tarot card: Judgement.

                                 SUE
                             (teary-eyed)
                        He was obsessing over it all night.

           Chas inspects the pictogram. Ominous. But still-

                                 CHAS
                        It’s just a tarot card. So what?

           Sue looks to Jeffrey. He gives her the nod.

                                 SUE
                        He was writing a song. Having a 
                        hard time. It was a new one. I 
                        never heard it before.

                                 JEFFREY
                        You know Jimi hasn’t written a new 
                        song in two years.

                                 CHAS
                        Well, then- that’s good! What’s the 
                        worry?

                                 SUE
                        This was about an angel. Coming 
                        down- to take him away.
           Just like the image on the tarot card. Chas darkens. As 
           Jeffrey pulls up the portable 8-track. Pressing “play”...

           Recorded sound: Jimi working out that unfinished song.

                                 JIMI (RECORDED)
                        ANGEL COME DOWN...
                        ANGEL FLY DOWN...
                        ANGEL TAKE ME...

           The guitar finally stops.

                                 JIMI (RECORDED) (CONT’D)
                             (muttering)
                        I’m going to die.

           Thunk. Sound of the mic dropping. Sssss... Then silence.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Last night, he’s recording a 
                        suicide note. Today, he’s MIA with 
                        a bottle full of red devils.

                                 CHAS
                        Barbs? Who gave him those?!

           Who else?

                                 JEFFREY
                        How the hell was I supposed to 
                        know?

           INT. VW BUG - DAY

           Driving. An awkward silence. Jimi is lost in thought.

           Toby and Lane sneak glances. Trying not to. But they cannot 
           help it. They are staring.

           Jimi finally notices. He smiles. Just trying to be normal. 
           But Toby and Lane quickly turn away.

           Normal is out of the question.

                                 TOBY
                        Little music?

           He switches on the stereo. The Who: My Generation.

                                 SONG (ON RADIO)
                        PEOPLE TRY TO PUT US D-DOWN
                        JUST BECAUSE WE GET AROUND
                                 (MORE)
                                 SONG (ON RADIO) (CONT'D)
                        THINGS THEY DO LOOK AWFUL C-C-COLD
                        I HOPE I DIE BEFORE I GET OLD

           This lyric strikes a nerve-

                                 JIMI
                        No!

           He snaps it shut. Toby and Lane, surprised.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                             (blushes, covering)
                        If it’s all the same to you, just- 
                        a little quiet.

           He sinks back into the busted seat, shutting his eyes. Tuning 
           out the world. But the sound-scape consumes him: rumbling 
           tires, creaking springs, the clank-tap of an engine... all 
           coalescing into- a rhythm. The same rhythm. He cannot escape.

                                 THE WHO (PRE-LAP)
                        WHY DON'T YOU ALL F-FADE AWAY?-

                                                            FLASH BACK:

           EXT. MONTEREY POP FESTIVAL - DUSK (1967)

           A sea of young people taking in The Who on stage.

                                 THE WHO
                        I'M NOT TRYING TO CAUSE A B-BIG S-S-
                        SENSATION
                        I'M JUST TALKIN' 'BOUT MY G-G-
                        GENERATION

           Their sound is fierce, but the act is static. Four mop-top 
           white kids with dour, art-school pretensions. Hardly the 
           kinetic bad boys of rock they will one day become.

                                 THE WHO (CONT’D)
                        THIS IS MY GENERATION
                        THIS IS MY GENERATION, BABY

           A manic drum solo carries us to

           EXT. FAIRGROUNDS - SAME

           An airstream dressing trailer just beyond the stage.

                                 CHAS
                        Jimi? Open up, love-
           He pounds at the locked door. Jeffrey, losing patience.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Where’s my gun? I’ll blow the 
                        fucking lock!

           Chyron: Monterey Pop Festival. 24 years old.

                                 GERRY
                        Got her!

           Gerry rushes up, dragging-

                                 KATHY
                        What’s going on? Is Jimi in there?

                                 CHAS
                        Pete Townsend won the coin toss. 
                        Took The Who on first. I tried to 
                        tell Jimi it’s better this way- he 
                        can close the show.

                                 JEFFREY
                        But the prima donna in there 
                        refuses to follow!
                             (shouts at the door)
                        You have any idea what kind of 
                        strings I had to pull for this? A 
                        fucking unknown, first show back in 
                        the States- and he pulls this!

           Jeffrey kicks the trailer door, denting the tin.

                                 CHAS
                        He’s right, though, Kath. It’s all 
                        building to this. We flake now- 
                        there won’t be another chance.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Fuck another chance- another 
                        breath!

           Kathy spots an open window above the trailer door.

                                 KATHY
                             (hitching her skirt)
                        Can you lift me up?

           INT. AIRSTREAM TRAILER - DUSK

           Sound of The Who still playing outside. As Kathy wriggles 
           through the upper window...
                                 JIMI
                        Tell Jeffrey no dice!

           Jimi is curled on the cot, a fetal ball.

                                 KATHY
                        Have you looked out there? That’s 
                        90,000 ears, Jimi. You’ve been 
                        waiting all your life for this.

                                 JIMI
                        Not tonight, not feeling it-

                                 KATHY
                        Then a stage is just the thing, 
                        isn’t it? Make you whole again.

           Then she sees his face- green to the gills, shivering. 
           Finding a sheet of acid... half the tabs used up.

                                 KATHY (CONT’D)
                        Jesus. How many tabs did you take?

                                 JIMI
                        Not enough to follow that.

           He nods out the window at- The Who on stage, finishing their 
           act with a crescendo of adolescent fury: Keith Moon kicking 
           over his drums. Townsend smashing his guitar.

           And Kathy suddenly realizes. They had it all wrong.

                                 KATHY
                        Poor thing, you’re no prima donna- 
                        you’re a nervous wreck.

           She cradles him, maternally.

                                 JIMI
                        I should never have come back.

                                 KATHY
                        Is this the same man who took 
                        London by storm? Torched Clapton at 
                        his own gig?

                                 JIMI
                        This is a different scene. These 
                        folks don’t know me.

                                 KATHY
                        Well I do- and I also know the two 
                        things in life that make you whole. 
                        The bedroom and the stage. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KATHY (CONT'D)
                        Did you ever stop to think what 
                        they have in common? Love, Jimi. A 
                        vast ocean of it. And it’s out 
                        there. Waiting for you to go up and 
                        win it. Like you won me.

           Jimi glances up for the first time- a glimmer of that old, 
           seductive charm. Pulling her close.

                                 JIMI
                             (suggestive)
                        With you, I had a different set of 
                        tools at my disposal.

           But Kathy glides a hand past his crotch... to the neck of his 
           guitar.

                                 KATHY
                        Far as I can tell, you only really 
                        needed one.

           EXT. FESTIVAL STAGE - NIGHT

           Facing utter darkness. A vast, swelling ocean of silhouettes. 
           Jimi is on the pitch black stage. Eyes flitting. Heart 
           pounding. Jaw chomping bubble gum. Trying to steel himself, 
           struggling trying to center. But hearing only-

           A cacophony of distracting sounds: the band settling in... 
           Chas pacing in the wings... Jeffrey barking orders... Kathy 
           biting her fingernails... strangers shifting/coughing/waiting 
           in the crowd... This whirlwind swelling to a climax. Until it 
           is too much to bear. And then, suddenly-

           The spotlight- like an angel from heaven.

           Flooding Jimi, and instantly bringing his world to silence. 
           Nothing but the tremolo gasp of his guitar...

           The sound swells, filling him. Literally reviving him. And

           Buh-buh-wah!

           His gaze finds a girl in the crowd- singling her out.

                                 JIMI
                        NOW YOU KNOW YOU ARE A CUTE LITTLE 
                        HEARTBREAKER
                        FOXY!

           The next line to another girl-
                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        AND YOU KNOW YOU ARE A SWEET LITTLE 
                        LOVE-MAKER
                        FOXY!

           And on like this- a different girl for every line.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        I WANNA TAKE YOU HOME
                        I WON'T DO YOU NO HARM, NO
                        YOU'VE GOT TO BE ALL MINE, ALL MINE
                        WHOO, FOXY LADY!

           Jimi blisters into a solo, eyes shut, tongue licking up at 
           the night sky in sync- lost in the music...

           As boys clutch their girlfriends tight. Girls squeeze their 
           boyfriends back. But every one is picturing Jimi.

           Jeffrey marvels from the wings.

                                 JEFFREY
                             (to Kathy)
                        What the hell did you give him back 
                        there?

                                 KATHY
                        Everything you can’t.

           And this line goes right to Kathy-

                                 JIMI
                        HERE I COME BABY
                        I’M COMIN’ TO GET YA
                        OOH, FOXY LADY!

           And we

           TIME LAPSE-

           Later in the set. The massive crowd, stirred electric.

                                 JIMI
                        PURPLE HAZE ALL IN MY BRAIN
                        LATELY THINGS DON'T SEEM THE SAME
                        ACTIN’ FUNNY AND I DON'T KNOW WHY
                        ‘SCUSE ME WHILE I KISS THE SKY

           Jimi is feeding off their love- giving it back in song.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        PURPLE HAZE ALL AROUND
                        DON'T KNOW IF I'M COMIN' UP OR DOWN
                                 (MORE)
                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        AM I HAPPY, OR IN MISERY?
                        WHATEVER IT IS, THAT GIRL PUT A 
                        SPELL ON ME

           Another sizzling solo, and we

           TIME LAPSE AGAIN-

           The crowd goes wild. Jimi is exhilarated, drenched in sweat- 
           soaking it in like a drug.

                                 JIMI
                        Thank you! Hah! Y’all don’t know 
                        what this means!

           More love than he’s felt in a lifetime- consuming, 
           overwhelming him. He glances to Kathy: “What now?”

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        I just, uh- I could sit up here all 
                        night and say “thank you, thank 
                        you, thank you”- but what I really 
                        want to do is just- grab you and- 
                        Mmmm!- every last one of you!

           A woman’s bra flies up on stage.

           IN THE WINGS-

                                 JEFFREY
                        Did he just say he wanted to fuck 
                        every last one of them?

                                 CHAS
                        I believe he said “mmmm”.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Yeah, well-
                             (to Kathy)
                        I’d look out if I was you.

           BACK ON STAGE-

                                 JIMI
                        I do! I do! But I just can’t do 
                        that!

           The crowd cheering. As Jimi paces- wracking his brain.
                                 JIMI (CONT'D)
                        I just gotta- find some other way 
                        to show my-

           Another bra flies up, snagging a mosquito lantern- and 
           knocking over a squeeze-bottle of kerosene... which rolls 
           upstage to Jimi’s feet. He sees it.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                             (an idea dawning)
                        Show my sacrifice-

           His eyes find Kathy-

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        That’s what love is, right?
                             (snatching the kerosene)
                        That’s what I’m gonna do. Sacrifice- 
                        something that I really love.

           Jimi spins to the band, inspired-

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        Alright, now-
                             (back to the crowd)
                        Y’all ready? Bear with me. ‘Cause I 
                        don’t think I’m losing my mind... 
                        And I want everybody to join in, 
                        too! ‘Cause there’s nothing more I 
                        can do for all these- look at it- 
                        all these beautiful people!

           He maxes the volume on his guitar- sending a hurricane of 
           feedback through the air... waves of rumbling sound.

           Jimi shuts his eyes. Grinding the guitar against his hip, 
           like a mystic shaman conjuring primal, elemental noise.

           He spanks the fret-board, squeezes the tremolo, causing the 
           instrument to belch forth shocks of screaming overdrive...

           Each new sound eliciting a collective wince/gasp/shudder from 
           the crowd. Jimi is playing them all- right to the brink.

           And then, finally-

           The release: that first thundering chord chop.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        Come on, sing it with me!
                             (singing)
                        WILD THING!

           Band kicking in.
                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        YOU MAKE MY HEART SING
                        YOU MAKE EVERYTHING GROOVY
                        WILD THING

           Jimi thrusts to each beat- and the whole crowd responds in 
           sync. 90,000 people dancing in perfect rhythm.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        WILD THING, I THINK YOU MOVE ME
                        BUT I WANT A KNOW FOR SURE
                        COME AND SSSSOCK IT TO ME ONE MORE 
                        TIME
                             (snps his tongue)
                        YOU MOVE ME

           Another chorus, this time the whole crowd joining in. Jimi is 
           working them up to a fever.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        WILD THING, I THINK YOU MOVE ME
                        BUT I WANT TO KNOW FOR SURE

           Guitar at his crotch, stroking the neck- once, twice.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        COME ON AND SSSSOCK IT TO ME ONE 
                        MORE TIME AGAIN
                        AW SHUCKS! I LOVE YA!

           He thrusts the guitar between his legs for a feverish solo. 
           Falling to his knees- straddling the instrument like a woman- 
           whacking the tremolo bar- arching his back in ecstasy.

           The crowd, throbbing- verging on sonic climax.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                             (howling)
                        WILD THING, I THINK I LOVE YOU!

           And with a physical shudder- Jimi unleashes a stream of 
           kerosene, dousing the prone, wailing instrument.

                                 JEFFREY
                        What the bloody hell? No! Our 
                        fucking insurance!

           But Jimi- seeing Kathy, locks eyes- sparks a post-coital 
           match and... Whoosh! The guitar bursts into flames.

                                 JEFFREY (CONT’D)
                             (grabs Gerry)
                        What are you waiting for? Put it 
                        out!
                                 CHAS
                             (stops him)
                        Wait! Listen!

           The crowd is roaring at the greatest sex they’ve ever had. As 
           Jimi, drained, blows them a kiss-

           And staggers off.

                                 CHAS (CONT’D)
                             (rushing the mic)
                        Jimi Hendrix!

           EXT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Jimi sees Kathy and their eyes meet. Rushing together...

           But a swarm of humanity floods between them: star-fuckers, 
           sycophants- swallowing Jimi whole.

           And leaving Kathy cut off, alone.

           INT. AIRSTREAM TRAILER - NIGHT

           The cramped space now teems with hipsters and pop royalty- 
           laughing, swooning, clamoring for their taste of Jimi...

           He is splayed on the cot, encircled by a trio of gorgeous 
           young groupies- the PLASTER CASTERS. They are: DELORES, 
           mixing up plaster in a vase; MARGE, keeping minutes in a log; 
           and CYNTHIA, stroking fingers up his thigh.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        We already got Frank Zappa. And the 
                        whole Rolling Stones.

                                 JIMI
                        Well- uh, which hand do you want?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Oh, no hands.
                             (unzips his fly)
                        We like to get- to the root of a 
                        star’s power.

           And down she goes. Jimi, gasping- caught, quite literally 
           with his pants down- as the crowd casually ogles his public 
           fellating. He does not exactly fight it off... And yet 
           something is missing. Jimi spots the open window.
           EXT. FAIRGROUNDS - NIGHT

           Kathy has wandered off. She is having a lonely smoke. As 
           roadies strike the stage nearby. When... from the airstream 
           window behind her- the blur of a figure slipping out.

                                 KATHY
                        Jimi?

           She spins, but the figure is gone. Nothing but a sheet of 
           tarpaulin on the dewy grass. Kathy loses hope, turning back- 
           As the tarp flies up... Jimi wrapping her from behind.

                                 JIMI
                        Did you miss me?

           They are under the tarp. Face to face. A private world. Lit 
           only by the ember of her cigarette.

                                 KATHY
                             (laughing)
                        I thought you were busy “mmmm”-ing 
                        every last one of them.

                                 JIMI
                        Let my guitar do that-
                             (palm to her cheek)
                        All I want is you.

           But her fingers find... his unzipped fly, specks of plaster.

                                 KATHY
                        And what did she want?

                                 JIMI
                             (a guilty look)
                        That- uh- it’s not what it-

                                 KATHY
                        You can spare the bull. I’m a 
                        modern girl, I know the rules. And 
                        I don’t care what you do with other 
                        girls. All I need is my Jimi- the 
                        real one. Whole.

           Their eyes meet. Then their lips. And- the tarp rolls to the 
           grass, hiding them from view. As we

                                                             RETURN TO:

           EXT. FAIRMONT HOTEL - DAY (1970)

           Downtown Seattle. The beat-up bug parked at the curb.
           INT. VW BUG - SAME

           Toby and Lane have been left alone. With Jimi’s battered 
           guitar case on the seat between them. They trade wary 
           glances: this is the holy grail, at their fingertips.

                                 LANE
                        Should we- Can we-

                                 TOBY
                             (stopping her)
                        Wait!
                             (then)
                        Do you think he’d-

                                 LANE
                        Together.

           They reach out, tremulously- in unison- and pop the latch. 
           Slowly prying open the case to reveal...

           The white Strat. Gleaming. When suddenly-

           Rata-tata-rata-tata-rat!

           The machine gun burst of Jimi’s guitar.

           They slam the lid with a terrified gasp.

           But the song continues. Machine Gun. It is coming from the 
           stereo of a passing car, just stopped at a traffic light.

                                 SONG (ON RADIO)
                        MACHINE GUN
                        TEARIN’ MY BODY ALL APART

           And it drives off, taking the sound of Jimi with it. Toby and 
           Lane exhale in unison, exchanging rattled looks...

           Just the radio. Or was it?

           INT. FAIRMONT HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

           An august hall. Burl wood, marble. Posh clientele. A pair of 
           stately black valets cast sideways glances at Jimi- setting 
           him on edge. His hand jitters as he slides Kathy’s telegram 
           across the front desk.

                                 JIMI
                        I’m, uh- here to see a guest?

                                 CONCIERGE
                        Of course, sir. If you could just-
           CONCIERGE stops, seeing him. Taking more than casual notice.

                                 CONCIERGE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll have to phone up from the 
                        back.

           INT. BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Concierge briskly shuts the door... dialing a number on the 
           telephone. It rings. Then-

                                 CONCIERGE
                        This is the Fairmont Hotel...
                             (a beat)
                        Yes sir- he just arrived.

           INTERCUT-

                                 CHAS
                             (on phone)
                        Brilliant! Keep him right there.

           He hooks the phone, rushing into

           INT. BEDROOM - JEFFREY’S SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           Jeffrey is with an older man in a conservative suit, hunched 
           over a spread of paperwork. A life insurance policy.

                                 LAWYER
                        I’m afraid this policy on Mr. 
                        Hendrix does have a two year 
                        suicide exclusion.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Exclusion? So you’re saying I’d get 
                        nothing?

                                 CHAS
                        Glad to see your motives are still 
                        intact.

           Jeffrey rolls an eye.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Heaven spare me from the righteous.
                             (looks up, realizing)
                        You found him!

                                 CHAS
                        You’re a terrible human being.
                                 JEFFREY
                        About to be terribly generous. 
                        Where is he? Sixty-forty split- the 
                        whole tour!

           INT. LOBBY - FAIRMONT HOTEL - DAY

           Concierge is returning from the back office.

                                 CONCIERGE
                        If you’ll just wait here, Mr. 
                        Hendrix. Your friend will be right-

           But Jimi is gone.

                                 CONCIERGE (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Hendrix?

           And we

                                                            FLASH BACK:

           Hands pulling a pair of closet doors shut. Trapping us in-

           INT. LINEN CLOSET - DAY (1968)

           Near blackness. The mere shadows of Jimi and Kathy- keeping 
           hush as distant voices call their names: Jimi? Jimi? Jimi?

           They are hiding from the world.

                                 KATHY
                        Come on, then- we can’t hide in 
                        here forever.

                                 JIMI
                        Shh!
                             (whispering)
                        Sure we can. Every second I’m not 
                        on stage- just you and me, our own 
                        private universe.

                                 KATHY
                        I’m pretty sure it’s a linen 
                        pantry.

           And suddenly- the doors fling open, daylight flooding in.

                                 AYAKO
                        There you are!
           AYAKO JINKA is 40s, Japanese. Brimming with guileless good 
           cheer. She yanks them out into

           INT. HENDRIX-JINKA HOUSE - DAY

           Tugging them down the hall...

                                 AYAKO
                        Come- I make chicken. Tempura fry.

                                 KATHY
                        Thank you, Ayako. Sounds delicious. 
                        Doesn’t it, Jimi?

                                 AYAKO
                        Call me mom!

           Jimi bristles, clinging to Kathy.

                                 JIMI
                             (through gritted teeth)
                        Don’t call her that.

                                 KATHY
                        Oh, lighten up, will you? It’s 
                        sweet.

                                 JIMI
                        It’s a circus.

           And into

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           A modest home. Teeming with strangers. Guests from the 
           neighborhood. People Jimi does not know. But they all know 
           Jimi. Heads turning. Bald-faced stares. A banner strings the 
           stair-rail: “Welcome Home, Jimmy!”

           Chyron: Seattle. 25 years old.

           This Jimi is only months older than we left him at Monterey. 
           But his life has changed. He is, forevermore, a celebrity.

                                 AYAKO
                             (prodding him on)
                        Oh, you just shy like your papa!

           AL HENDRIX is nearby, holding court to a group of guests 
           including Chas and a barely sentient Jeffrey. Al is 40s, 
           short of stature but long on swagger. “Shy” is far from the 
           operative descriptor.
                                 AL
                        This is where it all started, folks-

           Showing off an old, beat-up electric guitar.

                                 AL (CONT'D)
                        Whole week’s pay right here. I 
                        bought it for him after he set the 
                        first afire. Back then, it wasn’t 
                        no act, neither- Jimmy was trying 
                        to quit. Only I wouldn’t let him! 
                        Always encouraged the boy.

                                 CHAS
                        Sounds like we should be paying you 
                        twenty percent.

                                 AL
                             (lights up)
                        See? Now there’s an idea!

           The talk of money is enough to startle Jeffrey from his 
           stupor. Shooting Chas a glare.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Joking! Chas is only joking.

           NEARBY-

           Kathy and Jimi look on. They cannot hear the conversation.

                                 KATHY
                        See how proud he is?

                                 JIMI
                        You don’t know him.

                                 KATHY
                             (exasperated)
                        Well- maybe you don’t either. Ever 
                        thought of that?

           And frankly, he has not.

                                 KATHY (CONT’D)
                        Trust, Jimi. Love. Some people 
                        manage to find it outside the 
                        bedroom or the stage. Anyway, you 
                        can’t well live your life always 
                        waiting for the other shoe to drop. 
                        People grow up. People change.
                             (off Al)
                        You should try it, sometime.
           Ayako returns on cue with a heaping plate of tempura.

                                 KATHY (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, mom!

           Jimi glowers.

                                 AL
                        Katie!
                             (bounding up)
                        Get over here, girl.

           Jimi winces.

                                 JIMI
                             (correcting him)
                        It’s Kathy, pop-

                                 KATHY
                             (cuts him off)
                        It’s fine.

           She takes Al’s hand.

                                 AL
                        Come on, sweetheart.

           Kathy glances back to Jimi- a pointed look- and he relents, 
           gradually forcing himself to trust. He steps to follow, but-

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Not you, boy. Can’t well dish the 
                        dirt with him sulking around.
                             (leading Kathy off)
                        Did you know he first learned to 
                        play the blues on my push broom?

           And they are gone. Leaving Jimi, alone. So much for change.

           INT. DEN - MOMENTS LATER

           A framed portrait of Jimi rests on the mantel- promotional 
           shot, the man and his guitar, signed: “For Pop Your Son Jimi” 
           His record spins on the brand-new hi-fi. Not the only sign in 
           this house of recent, profligate spending. Courtesy Jimi.

                                 SONG (ON RECORD)
                        MANIC DEPRESSION IS TOUCHING MY 
                        SOUL
                        I KNOW WHAT I WANT BUT I JUST DON’T 
                        KNOW
                        HOW TO GO ABOUT GETTIN’ IT
           Jimi, momentarily lost in his own lyric. He can relate.

                                 JANIE
                        Is that you?

           JANIE is 6, Asian... craning up innocently at the strange man 
           in the pictures.

                                 JIMI
                        So they say.

                                 JANIE
                        My name is Janie. Mama says I’m 
                        your sister.

                                 JIMI
                        Well- then I guess you are.

           He kneels to take her hand.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        Nice to meet you, Janie.

           Jimi notices a shelf of dusty old 78 records. Mostly jazz, 
           blues... this is the music of his youth. He slides one out: 
           “Benny Goodman Sextet with Charlie Christian” A grinning 
           black man with a hollow-body electric guitar.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        Say, sis- you like to dance?

           Jimi yanks the needle on his own song. Cuing up the old 78: 
           the crackle of pitted grooves...

                                 VOICE (ON RECORD)
                        Charlie Christian on guitar. 
                        Playing: “Chonk, Charlie, Chonk!”

           On record: a blast of horns leads into the staccato jangle of 
           old-time guitar. Such a far cry from Jimi’s sound. But this 
           is where it all began.

                                 JIMI
                        You know, my papa was a world-class 
                        dancer? Met my mama at a contest. 
                        She was the only lady short enough 
                        to be his partner.

                                 JANIE
                        He met my mama at the church.

           Jimi cannot help but smile. Not the Al he remembers.
                                 JIMI
                        People do change.
                             (then)
                        Come on, step up-

           He takes her hands- pulling Janie up onto the tops of his 
           feet. Swaying her to the music.

                                 JANIE
                        Am I short enough?

                                 JIMI
                        You? Far as I’m concerned, sister, 
                        you’re just right.

           And they dance like this to the sweet guitar. Brother and 
           sister. A new family. Until suddenly...

           Sounds of commotion from the other room. Angry voices. 
           Shouting. Jimi perks at- a man’s voice, a voice he knows.

           EXT. PORCH - SAME

           The voice belongs to LEON HENDRIX, 20, polyester suit. He 
           dodges a swinging broomstick as Ayako chases off the stoop. 

                                 LEON
                        Hey now! Watch it!

                                 AYAKO
                        Stay out of my house! You not 
                        welcome!

                                 LEON
                        I ain’t come for your damn house, 
                        lady! Where’s by brother? Where’s 
                        Jimi?

                                 JIMI
                        Leon?

           Jimi shoves through a crowd at the doorway- seeing him.

                                 LEON
                        Buster.

           And they crash together. Brothers. Embracing for dear life.

                                 JIMI
                        Pop said you skipped town.
                                 LEON
                        Hey- 
                             (shrugs it)
                        Who ain’t got troubles?

           And Jimi gets a good look at Leon for the first time- 
           noticing needle pricks, track marks, hollow eyes...

           Leon hikes his sleeves, hiding it.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        No reason to miss my main man’s 
                        homecoming!

           A car full of unsavory-looking street hoods is parked across 
           the street. Waiting for Leon. Jimi notices.

                                 JIMI
                        You know, I got plenty of bread 
                        these days. ‘Case you’re owin’.

                                 LEON
                        Me? Naw, you kidding? I’m king 
                        around here! Those cats are pals.

           And that may be even worse.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                             (changing the subject)
                        I got all your records, you know? 
                        Some of those brothers can’t dig 
                        it. Say it got no soul. I say they 
                        got no ears. I hear how you do, 
                        Jimmy- whole world full of blues.

           The car horn honks across the street.

                                 JIMI
                        Why don’t you tell those boys to 
                        beat it, Leon?
                             (taking his hand)
                        Come on home.

           But-

                                 AL
                        Let him go, Jimi!

           Al barrels up, snatching the broomstick.

                                 LEON
                        Missed you, pop.
                                 AL
                        You ain’t welcome.

                                 JIMI
                        Hey, pop, wait a minute-

           But Al brushes Jimi aside.

                                 AL
                        This ain’t your concern.
                             (to Leon)
                        Cops is on their way, boy.

                                 JIMI
                        Cops? Pop!

           But Leon backs away- tossing up his hands.

                                 LEON
                        It’s cool, baby! We cool. Ain’t 
                        gotta go where I ain’t wanted.

                                 JIMI
                        No- he don’t mean it, man. Come on 
                        back here- this is family.

                                 LEON
                        Who needs family?
                             (stumbling back)
                        You know how it is, Jimmy. Guys 
                        like us got the whole wide world-

           And into the busy street- cars swerving. Neighbors looking on 
           from porches, fire-escapes.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        Shoot, I’m Jimi Hendrix’s brother!

           INT. FINISHED BASEMENT - LATER

           Muffled sounds of the party up above. Jimi is taking refuge. 

           A cork board wall is tacked with report cards and Polaroids 
           of Janie and four other Asian children... But no sign of Leon 
           nor Jimi. This is Al’s new family.

                                 AL
                        Sorry you had to see that.

           Al descends the stairs with a bottle of bourbon, two glasses.
                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Damn fool pimp he done made his-
                        self.

                                 JIMI
                        Can’t see how it helps things 
                        tossing him out.

                                 AL
                        Man grows up, learns it ain’t no 
                        use trying to fix the past. Best 
                        start looking to the future.

           He pours the bourbon, giving one to Jimi.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        There’s a lawyer upstairs. Mel 
                        Steingart. Smart fella. Handled the 
                        adoption.

                                 JIMI
                        Adoption?

                                 AL
                        Yako didn’t tell you?

           He indicates the cork board family... genuine pride.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        They’re mine now. Ours. Call that a 
                        fresh start.

           Jimi had not heard, and it throws him.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, Mel’s been chewing my ear 
                        off about a will. There’s this 
                        thing called a “beneficiary”.

                                 JIMI
                             (catching on)
                        It’s cool, pop- you leave it all to 
                        them. I got plenty.

           But that’s not quite what Al is getting at.

                                 AL
                        Well, see- that’s what we been 
                        talking about, me and Mel: plenty, 
                        what you got. Even too much not to 
                        spread around.

           And Jimi begins to understand.
                                 JIMI
                        You mean-

                                 AL
                        When’s your birthday, October?

                                 JIMI
                        November.

                                 AL
                        And how old you turning?

                                 JIMI
                        Twenty-six.

                                 AL
                        Getting on, see? Time to start 
                        looking past your own self. To the 
                        future.

                                 JIMI
                        You want my money.

                                 AL
                        Well not yet, boy! But this life is 
                        a fragile thing. ‘Specially in your 
                        line, candle burning at both ends.

           Jimi absorbs this, shattering.

                                 JIMI
                        You want me to die.

                                 AL
                        Now don’t be a fool! Just got a 
                        family to think of now. Big one.

                                 JIMI
                        Yeah, I get it, you and that lawyer- 
                        adopting five new kids when you 
                        could never even care for your own.

           This stings- it is meant to. And Al slaps him hard across the 
           face. Pain, fury gushing up from someplace deep.

                                 AL
                        You boys are just like your mama! 
                        Cherokee blood pumping through you 
                        like a poison, burning everyone you 
                        touch. Like that pretty girl up 
                        there. Seems to think you really in 
                        love-
                             (ice cold)
                        How long before it burns her, too?
           He swigs his bourbon, and thrusts the bottle.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Go on, take it. It was your mama’s 
                        favorite.
                             (beat)
                        I’ll go get Mel.

           He stalks out. Leaving Jimi, for a long beat, dazed. This was 
           the old Al. The one Jimi expected all along. And slowly... he 
           smiles. Deriving some morbid satisfaction. He was right: 
           people never change.

           EXT. GARFIELD HIGH - AFTERNOON

           The run down campus of an inner-city high school. Cinder-
           block. Black Power graffiti. At odds with the limousine 
           parked out front. Next to the “Jimi Hendrix” tour bus.

           INT. ASSEMBLY HALL - SAME

           A blown-up year-book photo of Jimi spans the stage. Beneath 
           it, a drum kit, Marshall stack. These face a sea of 
           indifferent faces. Students. All black. They are not fans.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Today, we sons and daughters of 
                        Garfield have special reason to be-

           Something clatters from the wings, turning heads. It is an 
           empty bourbon bottle, rolling to the stage.

                                 PRINCIPAL (CONT’D)
                        -erm- proud.

           IN THE WINGS-

           Jimi is a wobble-kneed wreck.

                                 JIMI
                        Where’s my bottle? Get my bottle-

                                 KATHY
                        Christ, Jimi!
                             (imploring)
                        You can’t let him go on like this.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Let him? He asked for it. Took me 
                        six months to set this up. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JEFFREY (CONT'D)
                        Fucking bureaucrats. Drive a harder 
                        bargain than the Fillmore!

           Jimi gulps, and retches into a waste-bin.

                                 CHAS
                        Maybe just a Q&A?

                                 JEFFREY
                        Q&A? Are you daft? This is fucking 
                        rock and roll.

           Jimi’s Caucasian band-mates peer out, seeing- a cadre of 
           Black Panthers at the front of the crowd. Stone-faced. Scary.

                                 NOEL
                        It’s not exactly our fan base.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Fan base? 10 years ago, that was 
                        Jimi out there! Wishing one day 
                        he’d make it here, where he is 
                        today.

           Jimi is puking into a rubbish bin.

                                 JEFFREY (CONT’D)
                        This is for that dreamer!

                                 CHAS
                        And because Motown is starting to 
                        move more units than Capitol.

                                 JEFFREY
                             (shrugs, shamelessly)
                        I don’t know about you blokes, but 
                        my wallet is color blind.

           And with that-

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Let’s have a warm hand for one of 
                        our very own- Mr. Jimi Hendrix!

                                 KATHY
                             (stops him, a tender hand)
                        You don’t have to do this, love-

           But Jimi bats her away. The icy look of Mr. Hyde. And onto
           THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Jimi staggers out to scattered, tepid applause. Fumbling his 
           guitar. It emits a sour squawk.

                                 JIMI
                        ‘Scuse me- I just need to-

           He trips, stumbling over a mic stand.

                                 BLACK PANTHERS
                        He’s drunk! Get off the stage, 
                        uncle tom!

                                 JIMI
                        Hey now- that’s not-

                                 BLACK PANTHERS
                        Honky-lover! Freak!

           The catcalls slam him like a whirlwind. Shaking him. A far 
           cry from the love Jimi has come to expect on stage.

           Until finally...

           And Kathy can take no more, rushing out.

                                 BLACK PANTHERS (CONT’D)
                             (hissing)
                        Little Miss Ann! White meat!

                                 KATHY
                        That’s it, Jimi, let’s go!

                                 JIMI
                        But don’t you see?
                             (his stare is cold)
                        They love me-

           Litter sails up, pelting them. But Jimi just stands there.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        Just like you.

           EXT. GARFIELD HIGH - MOMENTS LATER

           The limousine peeling out...

           As Kathy and the others emerge, just in time to see: Jimi’s 
           middle finger, receding down the street. Slicing the wind.
           INT. FLEABAG MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           A motley crew of hustlers and hos from the old hood. Smoking, 
           snorting, spiking, and swigging. This is Leon’s new family. 
           Jimi noodles his guitar in a blitzed-out haze.

                                 JIMI
                        IS THAT THE STARS IN THE SKY
                        OR IS IT RAIN FALLIN’ DOWN?
                        WILL IT BURN ME IF I TOUCH THE SUN
                        SO BIG, SO ROUND?

           He is singing this to a trashy tart on either arm-

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        WOULD I BE TRUTHFUL, YEAH
                        IN CHOOSIN’ YOU AS THE ONE FOR ME?

           A hush falls...

           Kathy is standing in the doorway. Catcalls start up. But-

                                 LEON
                        Y’all shut up! That’s Jimi’s girl! 
                        Makes us family.

           Leon shows her in, past a gauntlet of unnerving stares. In 
           fact, the only eyes not fixed on Kathy belong to Jimi...

           Still playing his guitar.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                             (to tarts)
                        Go on, scram!

           The tarts begin to scoot aside, but Jimi stops them.

                                 JIMI
                        Did I say go?
                             (singing)
                        OH, MY HEAD IS POUNDIN’, POUNDIN’

                                 KATHY
                        Look at me, Jimi.

           But here he is again, letting his guitar do the talking.

                                 JIMI
                        GOIN’ ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND AND 
                        ROUND

                                 KATHY
                        Let’s go home.
           Jimi plays a violent riff...

           Kathy flinching, summoning composure.

                                 KATHY (CONT’D)
                        Give me your hand.

                                 JIMI
                        Ain’t the old man told you? Touch 
                        me, you’re gonna get burned.

                                 KATHY
                        That’s not you, Jimi.

                                 JIMI
                             (icicles)
                        People change.
                             (singing)
                        OH, MY HEART BURNS WITH FEELIN’

                                 KATHY
                        Jimi, stop it.

                                 JIMI
                        BUT MY MIND IS COLD AND REELIN’

                                 KATHY
                             (tears welling)
                        I love you. Remember?

           And the coup de grace-

                                 JIMI
                        BUT IS THIS LOVE, BABY?
                        OR IS IT CONFUSION?

           A stinging solo...

           Kathy can take no more. She grabs the guitar.

                                 KATHY
                        Enough!

           Jimi flashes up and slaps her face. Like Al slapped him.

           The party skids to a halt. All eyes on-

           Kathy, welt rising, too stunned to cry;

           And Jimi, ice cold. After a beat, he settles back calmly. Re-
           tuning his guitar.

                                                             RETURN TO:
           INT. FAIRMONT HOTEL - DAY (1970)

           A washroom mirror. Jimi’s eyes are bloodshot wells of regret. 
           He is alone, scrutinizing a tarot Queen. His hands trembling. 
           Face glistening a cold sweat. This more than just nerves. He 
           spills a handful of pills into his palm. Considering it... 
           But swallows only two.

           And for a sudden instant, in the mirror behind him, a blur of 
           light: those kind eyes, smiling. But just then-

                                 TOBY (O.S.)
                             (rattling the door)
                        Mr. Hendrix?

           INTERCUT-

           Toby in the hall. Concerned.

                                 TOBY
                        Your friends are waiting.

                                 JIMI
                             (hopeful)
                        Kathy?
                             (then, hesitating)
                        Who else?

                                 TOBY
                        Some English guy. Raymond? Redmon? 
                        Her husband, I think.

           Jimi pales.

           INT. LOBBY - DAY

           Concierge continues to wait with Kathy and her husband. 
           Cardigan, chinos, a proper English gent.

                                 CONCIERGE
                        I am sorry, ma’am. I expect he’ll 
                        have to come out sometime.

           But Kathy, knowing better-

                                 KATHY
                        Does that john have a window? 

           EXT. FAIRMONT HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           The bug squeals off...
           As Kathy rushes out, just a moment too late.

           INT. VW BUG - CONTINUOUS

           Jimi hunkering low in the back seat- watching the smudged 
           reflection of Kathy in the rearview, receding out of sight.

           INT. FAIRMONT WASHROOM - LATER

           Chas and Jeffrey have arrived. Finding the tarot card left 
           propped above the sink. It is The Queen of Wands. And for the 
           first time we get a full look at her pictogram: her red 
           stockings, ginger hair, alabaster skin...

           She is the spitting image of Kathy.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Another tarot? Has he gone totally 
                        fucking bonkers?! What next? We 
                        hunt down every doll he ever 
                        boffed?

           But Chas is catching on.

                                 CHAS
                        No, not every. Just the queens.

           EXT. SPANISH CASTLE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

           A backwoods blues joint in the shade of the great sequoias. 
           The bug rumbles up a gravel drive, raising dust...

           If we didn’t know better, this could be another age. Instead, 
           it is a place out of time.

           INT. BLUES JOINT - MOMENTS LATER

           All sawdust and peeling wood. A few barflies shoot pool. An 
           old blind blues man coaxes music from a battered guitar.

           All of these faces are black. And a few heads turn as Jimi 
           enters with Toby and Lane. But the stares don’t bother Jimi. 
           He is captivated by the man with the guitar. Singing a slow, 
           simple rendition of a tune that Jimi has made famous.

                                 BLIND BLUES MAN
                        I SHOULD HAVE QUIT YOU
                        A LONG TIME AGO
                        I SHOULD HAVE QUIT YOU, BABY
                        A LONG TIME AGO
                                 (MORE)
                                 BLIND BLUES MAN (CONT'D)
                        BUT YOU GOT ME MESSIN’ ROUND WITH 
                        YOU, BABY
                        YOU GOT ME CRYIN’ ON A KILLIN’ 
                        FLOOR

           Jimi steps nearer as the old man plays- his own fingers 
           tracking an imaginary fret board in imitation. Absorbing some 
           subtle new techniques. When suddenly-

                                 BLIND BLUES MAN (CONT’D)
                        Well?

           The old man is facing Jimi. Like somehow he can “see” him.

                                 BLIND BLUES MAN (CONT’D)
                             (re: guitar case)
                        You planning to play that ax, or 
                        just buy it a cocktail?

           MOMENTS LATER-

           Jimi is on stage with the old man. Trading casual licks. As 
           Toby and Lane look on in awe, sipping soda-pop.

                                 BLIND BLUES MAN
                        Smooth riff. You write that one?

           It is the intro melody to the unfinished song we heard 
           before. The one Jimi that cannot seem to crack.

                                 JIMI
                        Trying. All I got so far-

           Plays it again. And again. And again- but no farther. Stuck.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        Just- ain’t feelin’ it lately. You 
                        ever had that?

                                 BLIND BLUES MAN
                        Me? I had just about everything 
                        they is to have, one time or 
                        another. Used to think that’s what 
                        the blues was all about: gotta live 
                        ‘em to play ‘em. Buncha baloney. 
                        Lifetime of misery and regret, 
                        ‘fore I finally realized this music 
                        ain’t about being blue, it’s about 
                        healin’ it.

           And the blind man is “looking” at Jimi... through him.
                                 BLIND BLUES MAN (CONT’D)
                        Your fingers already got what it 
                        takes, boy. Try shinin’ a little 
                        love on the rest of you for a 
                        change.

           This resonates. The blind man solos into a 12-bar blues...

                                 BLIND BLUES MAN (CONT’D)
                        OH YEAH, OH YEAH
                        EVERYTHING’S GONNA BE ALRIGHT THIS 
                        MORNIN’
                        HAVE MERCY!

           He howls along with a wailing lick-

                                 BLIND BLUES MAN (CONT’D)
                        WHEN I WAS A YOUNG BOY
                        ‘ROUND ABOUT THE AGE OF FIVE
                        MAMA SAID I WAS GONNA BE
                        THE GREATEST MAN ALIVE

                                 JIMI
                             (joining)
                        BUT NOW I’M A MAN
                        WAY PAST TWENTY-ONE
                        WANT YOU TO BELIEVE ME, BABY
                        I HAD A WHOLE LOT OF FUN

           And as they jam, for the first time in a long time, Jimi 
           seems at peace... lost in the sheer exuberance of the song.

                                                            FLASH BACK:

           INT. HARLEM APOLLO - NIGHT (1965)

           A world apart. A palatial theater buzzing with hep cats and 
           rouged womens, all bumping and jiving to a rollicking R&B 
           rendition of the same song. Mannish Boy.

                                 LITTLE RICHARD
                        I’M A MAN
                        SPELLED M - A - N

           LITTLE RICHARD is 35, sky-high hair, sequin suit. A human 
           fireball, bounding across the stage, conducting-

           A full band, among whom...

           Jimi in a matching skinny suit, pompadour, pencil mustache. 
           No more than back-up guitar. But yearning for the spotlight.

           Richard gyrates to the front row. Making the women swoon.
                                 LITTLE RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        M - A - N, M - A - N
                        DO-DOO-DO-DOO-DOO-DO-DO-DOO-DO-DOO!

           Pure showmanship. Jimi learned it here, first. In fact, he is 
           learning it right now. Imitating the moves... And absorbing 
           fast. He flashes a wink to some ladies in the front row.

           Richard sees this. Glowering.

                                 LITTLE RICHARD (CONT’D)
                             (shimmying over)
                        Listen up, pimple face, I thought I 
                        told you to shave that mustache!
                             (singing)
                        ‘CAUSE I’M A MAN
                             (back to Jimi)
                        I am Little Richard. The 
                        Originator. The Georgia Peach!
                             (back to the ladies)
                        NATURAL BORN LOVERS MAN
                             (pointed)
                        And I am the only one in this show 
                        allowed to look pretty!

           He cues the horn section with a pelvic thrust.

                                 JIMI
                        Sorry, boss- ran outta soap.

           But Richard shoots a withering look.

                                 LITTLE RICHARD
                        Then pluck it with your fingertips!

           Those ladies in the front row, still making eyes at Jimi.

                                 LITTLE RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Welcome to the rhythm section, boy.

           He spins down the volume knob on Jimi’s guitar.

                                 LITTLE RICHARD (CONT’D)
                             (to RHYTHM GUITARIST)
                        You there, take his solo.

           The rhythm guitarist is caught off guard. He weakly runs a 
           scale. No flash, no style...

           As Richard sweeps back across stage to reclaim him audience.

           Jimi endures the lackluster performance as long as he can, 
           but finally cracks. Cranking his volume-
           And tearing into a dizzying riff. Dazzling the crowd with a 
           flurry of guitar pyrotechnics.

           Richard spins back, upstaged by the upstart. Livid.

           As Jimi finishes his solo with a skid across stage- and right 
           up to Richard’s mic for a final, shouted chorus:

                                 JIMI
                        YES, I’M A MAN!

           EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

           The stage door slams open. Jimi being cast out. No more trace 
           of the strutting cock. He is meek, pleading.

                                 JIMI
                        I’m real sorry, Mr. Richard-

                                 LITTLE RICHARD
                        Real finished, is what you is! I 
                        knew I should have left you back in 
                        Memphis. You’re Chitlin’ Circuit 
                        through and through. Born to be 
                        background.
                             (to BOUNCER)
                        That guitar stays with the act.

           The bouncer snatches it back.

                                 LITTLE RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        And the suit.

           Jimi glumly forks over his sequin coat and tie.

                                 JIMI
                        I know I shouldn’t’a cut in like 
                        that, but Randy just can’t solo. 
                        And you always say “put on a show”!

                                 LITTLE RICHARD
                        Yeah, boy, my show.

           And with that, he’s gone. Bouncer nodding to the rest of 
           Jimi’s costume: shiny slacks, patent leather spats. And we

           EXT. HARLEM STREETS - NIGHT

           Jimi is stripped to his boxers, undershirt, and a pair of 
           threadbare socks. Tip-toeing between puddles... but wearing a 
           cocky grin despite it all.
           Chyron: Harlem. 22 years old.

                                 OLD GRANNY
                        Good lord, what happened to your 
                        clothes, son?

                                 JIMI
                             (acting surprised)
                        Hm? Well, how about that? Guess I 
                        just played so dang hot, it burned 
                        ‘em off!

           EXT. HARLEM TENEMENT - NIGHT

           Local whores mill about the stoop, touching up nail-polish, 
           gossiping. They spot Jimi, returning home in the buff.

                                 WHORES
                        Lookin’ good, Jim-bo!

           INT. TENEMENT ROOM - DAY

           An Oriental screen divides the tiny flat in two. From behind 
           it, the rhythmic huff and thud of sex. Jimi is alone on his 
           side, trying to drown it out, but his fingers are fretting an 
           imaginary guitar. His battered guitar case is empty.

                                 JIMI
                             (singing softly)
                        A BROOM IS DREARILY SWEEPING
                        UP THE BROKEN PIECES OF YESTERDAY’S 
                        LIFE
                        SOMEWHERE A QUEEN IS WEEPING
                        SOMEWHERE A KING HAS NO WIFE
                        AND THE WIND, IT CRIES-

           But a shout cuts him short.

                                 DEVON
                        Fuck me!

           It comes from behind the screen. DEVON is 16, a Black Lolita, 
           red lips. Belly-up on a rickety cot, bland look in her eyes, 
           as an anonymous “John” humps her furiously.

                                 DEVON (CONT’D)
                             (to Jimi)
                        Y’all better pay royalties on this 
                        rhythm section, pervert!

           Jimi drops his hands, giving up. No use.
           He pulls a dog-eared record sleeve from the battered guitar 
           case: Bob Dylan. “Highway 61 Revisited.” The printed lyrics 
           have been marked up, underlined, annotated by Jimi.

           He cranks up the disc on an old Victrola, mouthing along-

                                 SONG (ON RECORD)
                        ONCE UPON A TIME YOU DRESSED SO 
                        FINE
                        THREW THE BUMS A DIME IN YOUR 
                        PRIME, DIDN’T YOU?

           Jimi moves into the

           KITCHENETTE - CONTINUOUS

           No more than a hotplate and a dripping faucet. Nary a crumb 
           in the pantry. But Jimi goes straight for the rat trap on the 
           bottom shelf, easing it aside to reveal a cigar tin. Devon’s 
           private stash: rolled bills, assorted pills. Jimi swallows a 
           few with a handful of water. Peeling off some cash...

                        NOW YOU DON’T TALK SO LOUD
                        NOW YOU DON’T SEEM SO PROUD
                        ABOUT HAVING TO BE SCROUNGING
                        YOUR NEXT MEAL

           As Devon pops up behind him- Jimi jolts.

                                 DEVON
                        I’m gonna spot you those uppers. 
                        But I ain’t recall hiring no pimp.

           She snatches the cash.

                                 JIMI
                             (pleading)
                        You know I ain’t no thief, Dev! 
                        Just a loan. Get my ax out of hock. 
                        I can pay you back right after the 
                        gig, promise. Do not pass “go”!

           The “John” appears, zipping up. Tossing a few bills.

                                 DEVON
                             (counts it)
                        Hold it, Negro. You’re short.

                                 “JOHN”
                        Call it a tax. For making me listen 
                        to this honky shit.
           “John” moves off... but in a flash, Devon slings out a large 
           butcher knife, pressing it to his throat.

                                 DEVON
                        Only person paying a tax tonight is 
                        you!

                                 “JOHN”
                        Whoa! Simmer down, bitch!

           He retrieves a billfold with shaking hands- Devon grabs it.

                                 DEVON
                        And that “honky shit” is called 
                        ambiance!

           With a shove out the door-

                                 DEVON (CONT’D)
                        Classless motherfucker.

           She counts out her pay, giving the extra cash to Jimi.

                                 JIMI
                        Thanks, Dev! You’re a real pal.

                                 DEVON
                        Naw, just a sucker for a boy with 
                        motherless eyes.

           A beat. Jimi moving off.

                                 DEVON (CONT’D)
                        He ain’t wrong, though-
                             (re: Dylan album)
                        Soul brother like you got no 
                        business with this cracker.

           The organ solo whirls up on track, carrying over

           EXT. NYC STREETS - DAY/DUSK

           Jimi on his long walk from Harlem to Greenwich Village...

           Taking in the panoply of urban life along the way: players 
           and pimps, bankers and bums, ad men and flower children. Jimi 
           is a part of this world, yet apart from it.

                                 SONG
                        HOW DOES IT FEEL?
                        HOW DOES IT FEEL?
                        TO BE WITHOUT A HOME?
                        LIKE A COMPLETE UNKNOWN?
           Jimi ducks into

           INT. PAWN SHOP - DUSK

           Forking over the cash and retrieving his cheap knock-off 
           guitar. Jimi signs a pawn slip for the umpteenth time...

           Pawnbroker rolling an eye: “He’ll be back...” And finally

           INT. EAST VILLAGE DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           A smoke-clouded cave. A world apart from Harlem. Sparse all-
           white crowd of Hippies and Beats. Paying no attention to-

                                 JIMI
                             (singing on stage)
                        WHEN YOU AIN’T GOT NOTHING
                        YOU GOT NOTHING TO LOSE
                        YOU’RE INVISIBLE NOW
                        YOU GOT NO SECRETS TO CONCEAL

           His act is unpolished. But he sings with a hard-fought 
           feeling Dylan never approached. He knows how it feels.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        HOW DOES IT FEEL?
                        HOW DOES IT FEEL?
                        TO BE ON YOUR OWN?
                        WITH NO DIRECTION HOME?
                        LIKE A COMPLETE UNKNOWN?
                        LIKE A ROLLING STONE?

           Jimi solos out to finish the tune. And then it’s over. And no 
           one seems to notice, except...

           A round of vigorous applause from a back table. White gloves, 
           clapping. This is LINDA, 20, jet-black hair, ivory skin. Her 
           eyes meet Jimi across the dusky room. Connecting. Piercing. 
           Perhaps he is not so invisible now, after all.

           INT. JANE STREET WALK-UP - DAWN

           A bohemian pad. Hazy with reefer. Floor spread with records: 
           blues, folk, rock and roll. And on an island in the middle, 
           Jimi plays guitar. The last chords of a familiar song.

                                 JIMI
                        AND THE WIND WHISPERS... LINDA

           Linda laughs, charmed. It is the end of a long-night. And 
           much to our astonishment, they are both still fully-clothed.
                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                             (self-conscious)
                        You don’t dig it.

                                 LINDA
                        Dig it? It’s brilliant!

           An English accent, upper crust.

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        I just wonder who the wind cried 
                        for last night.

                                 JIMI
                             (a Cheshire smile)
                        Only you, girl. Only ever you.

           His hand moves for hers. She casually ignores it.

                                 LINDA
                             (changing the subject)
                        Try these-

           She ties on a houndstooth scarf, pair of dark sunglasses.

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        Bobby Dylan in black face.

           Turning him to the mirror-

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        You’ll have to lose the Pompadour, 
                        though. And that D.A.

           She musses a hand through his grease-straitened conk.

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        You have such wonderful curls. Why 
                        not let them out? There...

           Jimi blurts laughter. She has given him a Dylan fro.

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you like it?

                                 JIMI
                        Times may be a’ changin’, but I go 
                        back uptown like this, they’ll 
                        reject my Harlem passport.

                                 LINDA
                        So let them! You belong down here.
                                 JIMI
                        Got that right!

           His hand finds her thigh. But Linda avoids it.

                                 LINDA
                        I mean downtown. You and your 
                        music.

                                 JIMI
                        That part’s easier said.

           He reaches for her cheek. 

                                 LINDA
                             (stopping him)
                        I want you to meet a friend.

                                 JIMI
                        Anything you say, Miss Ann.

                                 LINDA
                        Who’s that- “Miss Ann”?

           Jimi gives a smile: her ignorance says it all.

                                 JIMI
                        Only everything you is... and I 
                        ain’t.

                                 LINDA
                        Don’t patronize me, Jimmy James. 
                        You’re gonna conquer the world. 
                        Harlem can get in line.

           Jimi laughs, noodling an old blues.

                                 JIMI
                        GYPSY WOMAN TOLD MY MOTHER ‘FORE I 
                        WAS BORN
                        YOU GOT A BOY-CHILD COMIN’

                                 LINDA
                             (cuts in, she knows it)
                        GONNA BE A SON OF A GUN
                        MAKE ALL THE PRETTY WOMENS
                        JUMP AND SHOUT
                        AND THEN THE WHOLE WORLD WANNA KNOW
                        WHAT THIS ALL ABOUT

           She grins. Jimi is impressed.
                                 JIMI
                        Where’d such a pretty English 
                        sister learn Willie Dixon?

                                 LINDA
                        My boyfriend likes the blues.

           And this drops- “boyfriend”- with a thud.

                                 JIMI
                             (taking a hint)
                        Oh.

                                 LINDA
                        Where’d a Harlem brother learn Bob 
                        Dylan?

           A beat. Jimi unties the scarf, sunglasses.

                                 JIMI
                             (moving to go)
                        Just fooling his-self, I guess.

           Linda stops him.

                                 LINDA
                        I don’t think he is. I think music 
                        is bigger than black and white. Big 
                        enough to change us.

                                 JIMI
                        Sure, sister. Big enough to change 
                        us all-

           He flips through her records...

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        From Chuck Berry to Elvis Presley. 
                        From Bo Diddley to the Beatles.

           For every black original, a more popular white imitator.

                                 JIMI (CONT'D)
                        Muddy Waters to-
                             (what’s next?)
                        The Rolling Stones.

           Linda is stung. Jimi softens, taking her hand.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        Look, you’re a sweet kid.

                                 LINDA
                        I told you I have a boyfriend.
                                 JIMI
                             (glances around)
                        Where?

           And he leans in, planting a kiss on her neck.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        Here?
                             (her earlobe)
                        Or maybe in here. I’ll keep 
                        searchin’.

           Fingers undoing her blouse.

                                 LINDA
                        Actually, you’re already looking at 
                        him.

           The Rolling Stones record: a young Keith Richards.

                                 JIMI
                        Him?

                                 LINDA
                        He may not have been born with the 
                        blues, but he plays like he was.
                             (driving it home)
                        Just like Jimmy James plays rock 
                        and roll.

                                 JIMI
                        That was ours, too. White cats just 
                        took it.

           But Linda is having none of his self-pity.

                                 LINDA
                        So stop whining and take it back!

           She tosses another record to his chest. A white folk singer 
           with a guitar. Tim Rose: Hey Joe. And we

                                                                CUT TO:

           The record needle drops on the bitter folk ballad. Carrying 
           over a montage of Jimi’s transformation:

           --In his dingy tenement, studying the song. Singing along 
           with the record.

                                 SONG (ON RECORD)
                        HEY JOE, WHERE YOU GOIN' WITH THAT 
                        GUN IN YOUR HAND?
                                 JIMI
                        HEY JOE, I SAID WHERE YOU GOIN' 
                        WITH THAT GUN IN YOUR HAND?

           As Devon rolls her eyes behind the Oriental screen;

           --In Linda’s flat, she works Jimi’s straightened hair into 
           curlers. He continues to play. He is getting better.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        I'M GOING DOWN TO SHOOT MY OLD LADY
                        YOU KNOW I CAUGHT HER MESSIN' 
                        AROUND WITH ANOTHER MAN

           She removes the curlers. Revealing his hip new Dylan fro;

           --In vintage Village clothes shops, hunting the racks for 
           paisley shirts, wide-brim hats, feathered boas;

           --In Harlem, drawing stares from the zootsuiters... but 
           ignoring them. Jimi is coming into his own;

                                 SONG (ON RECORD)
                        HEY JOE, I HEARD YOU SHOT YOUR 
                        WOMAN DOWN
                        SHOT HER DOWN TO THE GROUND 

           --At a downtown recording studio, Linda leads Jimi past 
           security with a friendly smile. Opening the doors on...

           A room of gleaming electric guitars. Jimi is in paradise. As 
           he picks up his first gleaming white Fender Stratocaster.

           EXT. CAFÉ WHA? - NIGHT

           Hip crowd wandering up. Past the chalkboard marquee. Opening 
           act: “Jimmy James and the Blue Flames”

           INT. CAFÉ WHA? - NIGHT

           Hub of the white Village rock scene. Jimi has transformed: 
           linen shirt, hobnail boots, hair in a small fro. He has also 
           made the song his own, turning folk ballad to muscular rock.

                                 JIMI
                        YES I DID, I SHOT HER
                        YOU KNOW I CAUGHT HER MESSIN’ 
                        AROUND TOWN

           He may still be hampered by nerves. But raw talent and 
           natural stage charisma shine through.
                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        AND I GAVE HER THE GUN
                        I SHOT HER!

           Jimi fires into an extended solo...

           As Linda watches from a front table with ANDREW OLDHAM, 30s, 
           a music manager who takes it in without reaction. Linda, 
           studying his poker face. And we realize: this is an audition.

                                 LINDA
                        So? What do you think?

                                 OLDHAM
                        Keith told me about your little 
                        Pygmalion project.

           He is another jaded Londoner, not easily impressed.

                                 OLDHAM (CONT’D)
                        Have got to admit I was skeptical.

                                 LINDA
                        He can play, though, can’t he?

           Oldham shrugs. A suggestive look-

                                 OLDHAM
                        I just wonder what else he can do.

                                 LINDA
                        You’re not suggesting-

                                 OLDHAM
                        It’s a modern world, Linda. 
                        “Colorblind”, wasn’t that the 
                        pitch?

                                 LINDA
                        This is business, Andrew.

                                 OLDHAM
                        Glad to hear it. So is this-

           He scoots back his chair, standing to go-

                                 OLDHAM (CONT’D)
                        Keith is my biggest client. He also 
                        happens to be your boyfriend.

                                 LINDA
                        I’m telling you, this isn’t-
                                 OLDHAM
                        Then what is it? If you want to 
                        live vicariously, Linda, have a 
                        child.

           From on stage, Jimi sees this exchange. But cannot hear it.

                                 JIMI
                        HEY JOE
                        WHERE YOU GONNA RUN TO NOW?

           Linda grabs Oldham on his way to the door-

                                 LINDA
                        He’s a brilliant guitarist!

                                 OLDHAM
                        Of course he is. Best I ever heard- 
                        when you shut your eyes.

           Jimi is blazing through a final solo, eyes shut.

                                 OLDHAM (CONT’D)
                        But if you want to be in this 
                        business, Linda-love, here’s a tip: 
                        try keeping them open for a change.

           He tugs away, brushing past her to the door...

           Where Chas Chandler has just arrived. And stands frozen, 
           watching Jimi in awe. He stops Oldham.

                                 CHAS
                        Hey Andy, is he one of yours?

                                 OLDHAM
                        Him? What’s it look like I run, a 
                        minstrel show?

           And with that, he departs. Opportunity out the door. As the 
           song ends. Jimi, finally opening his eyes to see-

           Linda, crestfallen... Oldham is gone.

           EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - NIGHT

           Jimi hotfoots out the club, across Washington Square Park.

                                 LINDA
                             (hustling to keep up)
                        It’s one manager, Jimi-
                                 JIMI
                        One of three. In a week.

                                 LINDA
                        The others are still thinking.

                                 JIMI
                        Yeah, thinking the same thing he 
                        did: too downtown for Harlem, too 
                        uptown for here.

                                 LINDA
                        Who cares what they think? You 
                        belong on that stage.

           She catches him, but he spins back.

                                 JIMI
                        I don’t belong anywhere.
                             (glancing around)
                        Look around you, girl!

           The park is abuzz with Hippie life: white faces, every one. 
           Casting oblong stares at Jimi, black man with a white girl.

                                 LINDA
                        So let them look!

           She tugs him up, kissing him hard, for all to see. And she 
           means it. But Jimi is steely.

                                 JIMI
                        And here I thought I was the one 
                        trying to be somebody else.

                                 LINDA
                        I love you.

                                 JIMI
                        No. You love the idea of me. And I 
                        don’t blame you. So did I.

           He shoves back the borrowed guitar.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        Thank Keith for the ax.

           And he brushes past, leaving Linda, spurned in his wake.

                                                             RETURN TO:
           INT. BLUES JOINT - DAY (1970)

           The Spanish Castle. Bustling now. Happy hour crowd on the 
           dance floor. And among them, we just might notice-

           A pair of mismatched gloves, one black, one white.

           But Jimi does not see. He is hunched at a corner pay phone, 
           beads of sweat risen on his brow. Hands trembling. It rings.

           INTERCUT-

           A white glove answering the phone in a Manhattan flat.

                                 LINDA
                             (into phone)
                        Hello?

           Sounds of a posh party in her background...

           Jimi bites his tongue.

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        Jimi is that you? Are you okay?

           He slams the receiver.

           Jimi pops another dose of barbiturates with palsied fingers.

           Drawing out another tarot card: Queen of Coins. Jet-black 
           hair, ivory skin, white glove. For all the world like Linda.

           INT. MANHATTAN FLAT - NIGHT

           Linda quickly dials the number written on a pad. After a beat-

                                 LINDA
                        Hello, Chas?

                                                            FLASH BACK:

           EXT. VILLAGE STREET - NIGHT (1965)

           Only moments after we just left Jimi, rushing off.

                                 CHAS
                        Hey! You! Hi there! Wait up!
                             (hurrying up, winded)
                        James, isn’t it? Jimmy James?

           But not anymore. That dream is dead.
                                 JIMI
                        Hendrix.

                                 CHAS
                        Oh. Well, I just saw you at the 
                        “Wha?” Bloody brilliant!

           Jimi absorbs this, but shakes it. Walking on.

                                 CHAS (CONT’D)
                        I’m Chas Chandler, by the way. I 
                        play bass with the Animals. “House 
                        of the Rising Sun”?

                                 JIMI
                        Y’all stole that from Leadbelly.

                                 CHAS
                        Erm- yes, I suppose- that’s true. 
                        But actually this is my last tour 
                        with the band. I’m becoming a 
                        manager. I’ve never heard anyone 
                        play like you.

                                 JIMI
                        Come uptown. Anytime. Welcome to 
                        take whatever you can steal.

           He moves on. Chas, dogged.

                                 CHAS
                        But- no- that’s not- that is, I 
                        couldn’t even if I tried.
                             (cuts him off)
                        I want you to play it-
                             (flashing a BUSINESS CARD)
                        As my first client.

           Jimi stops, warily inspecting the card.

                                 JIMI
                        Well, at least your ears work.

                                 CHAS
                        Thank you.

                                 JIMI
                             (as a fact, not bitterly)
                        But you might want to do something 
                        about those peepers.

           And he walks off.
           INT. HARLEM HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

           Black folks sipping whiskey, smoking reefer. Jimi plays 
           slithering sexy blues on his guitar, cigarette dangling.

                                 JIMI
                        THERE’S A RED HOUSE OVER YONDER
                        THAT’S WHERE MY BABY STAYS
                        THERE’S A RED HOUSE OVER YONDER, 
                        BABY
                        THAT’S WHERE MY BABY STAYS

           Devon sidles up. She looks a trashy shade of “elegant” in 
           long black gloves, red lipstick. Mussing his “downtown” hair.

                                 DEVON
                        Shit, fetch this boy some lye! He 
                        gone all kinky on us!

                                 JIMI
                        WELL I AIN’T BEEN HOME TO SEE MY 
                        BABY
                        IN ABOUT NINETY NINE AND ONE HALF 
                        DAYS

           Devon grooves along-

                                 DEVON
                        ‘BOUT TIME YOU SEE HER NOW!
                             (a drag of his smoke)
                        Is good to have you back in Kansas, 
                        Dorothy. Get this from the wizard?

           She has found the business card: “Chas Chandler/Music 
           Manager”

                                 JIMI
                        English cat. Says I’m the best he 
                        ever heard.
                             (sings)
                        WAIT A MINUTE, SOMETHING'S WRONG
                        MY KEY WONT UNLOCK THIS DOOR
                             (grinning)
                        Wants to sign me.

                                 DEVON
                        Must be needing a new butler.
                             (yelps)
                        Ooh-ee! Burn!

           But Jimi is too cool to feel the jibe.
                                 JIMI
                        Naw, mama. Rock and roll act.
                             (sings)
                        I GOT A BAD, BAD FEELING, MAMA
                        MY BABY DON’T LIVE HERE NO MORE
                             (then)
                        Gonna take me to London. Says over 
                        there things is different.

           And Devon sees he means it.

                                 DEVON
                        London, England?
                             (a hint of envy cracks the 
                              cynical shell)
                        Well, shit!

                                 JIMI
                        Reckon I could still use someone to 
                        darn my socks. Gotta get a 
                        passport, though.

           Devon lights up. With it all, still just an innocent girl.

                                 DEVON
                        You mean it?! Ha! Society Devon!
                             (doing “British”)
                        The honor is mine, your majesty!

           She sounds ridiculous. Jimi busts out laughing.

                                 JIMI
                        Dream on, girl! You can’t even fake 
                        an orgasm!

           But Devon has let down her guard, and this stings.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        ‘CAUSE IF MY BABY DON’T LOVE ME NO 
                        MORE
                        I KNOW HER SISTER WILL

                                 DEVON
                             (lashes out, old defenses 
                              springing back)
                        Well fuck you, too, Hendrix!

           This brings the party, and Jimi’s song, to a screeching halt.

                                 JIMI
                        Whoa! Hey, Dev, I’m only teasing.
                                 DEVON
                        You think you just one of a kind, 
                        don’t you? Remake yourself at the 
                        drop of a hat. Well, I got news for 
                        ya, Jimi. You may win the world on 
                        that guitar. But take it off-
                             (yanks it)
                        You just another lonely nigger.

           Devon crumples the business card, and storms out.

                                                             RETURN TO:

           INT. BLUES JOINT - DAY (1970)

           The pay phone dangles, abandoned. Emitting a steady dial 
           tone. As Chas rushes up. Once again, too late to find Jimi.

                                 CHAS
                             (into phone)
                        Hello, operator? Can I have the 
                        reverse directory on a call just 
                        placed to New York City?

           After a beat, the phone rings. Someone picks up.

                                 CHAS (CONT’D)
                        Linda?

           But instead we

           INTERCUT-

           A Harlem sanitarium. Hollow-eyed patients in the background.

                                 NURSE
                        Wrong number, pal.

                                 CHAS
                             (confused)
                        I’m sorry? Did you just get a long-
                        distance call from a man called 
                        Jimi?

                                 NURSE
                        Oh. Seattle, right? Guy was calling 
                        for a patient. Devon Wilson.

           Chas makes the connection.
                                 CHAS
                        Of course: Devon! Could you please 
                        put her on?

                                 NURSE
                        Well, buddy, I’d like to- ‘cept she 
                        died. Few weeks back. Suicide.

           Chas turns ashen.

           Slowly hooking the receiver... when he notices the tarot card 
           tucked into the change slot. Chas unfolds it to reveal: Queen 
           of Coins. A wider view this time. Revealing that this woman 
           has two faces. One white, the other black. Red lips. Lolita 
           lips. And a long black gloves. A dead ringer for Devon.

           INT. VW BUG - DAY

           Jimi in the passenger seat, a hollow gaze. Shivering from a 
           cold sweat. The shakes are getting worse. He needs a fix.

                                 JIMI
                        Are we, uh- near a bathroom?

           Toby and Lane trade concerned looks.

                                 LANE
                        Almost home.

                                 TOBY
                        Could take you back to the hotel, 
                        though. Or the stadium?

           But just then

           EXT. AFFLUENT SUBURB - CONTINUOUS

           The bug screeches to a stop... within inches of a mob of 
           neighborhood teens.

                                 TEEN VOICES
                        There he is!

           They are fans. Dozens of them. Swarming the vehicle.

           INT. VW BUG - CONTINUOUS

           Toby shifts quickly into reverse, but...

                                 TEEN VOICES
                        Jimi! Jimi! Jimi!
           They are surrounded. Fists pounding the glass. Toby honks.

                                 TOBY
                        Sorry, Jimi!

                                 LANE
                        Swear we didn’t breathe a word!

           But Jimi has noticed, across the way, the conservative man on 
           his porch. The nosy housewife snipping azaleas. So much for 
           his own private universe.

                                 TOBY
                        Show starts in a few hours, anyway. 
                        Maybe it is best we-

           But Jimi pops the door lock.

                                 JIMI
                        What’s the difference? Crowd’s a 
                        crowd.
                             (grabs his guitar)
                        And I’m just another lonely nigger.

           And steps out into the clamoring throng. Turning it on.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        Y’all come here for a show?

           INT. AFFLUENT HOUSE - DAY

           Another red devil down the hatch. Jimi, steeling himself. As 
           the shakes subside... at least for the moment.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Neighborhood teens pack the house like sardines. Jimi is back 
           at the piano bench, this time with his guitar. Plugged into a 
           borrowed amp. He riffs into a mournful blues.

                                 JIMI
                        WELL I WAIT AROUND THAT TRAIN 
                        STATION
                        WAITING FOR THE TRAIN
                        TO TAKE ME FROM THIS
                        LONESOME PLACE

           The song, taking us back to

                                                            FLASH BACK:
           EXT. AFFLUENT SUBURB - DAY (1958)

           The same tree lined street, a decade earlier. Picket fences. 
           Green lawns. Black gardeners hard at work. Except for-

           Jimi, up in a tree branch, playing his cheap guitar. Push 
           mower parked below, the grass still uncut.

                                 JIMI
                        I’M GONNA LEAVE THIS TOWN
                        GOTTA LEAVE THIS TOWN
                        GONNA MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY
                        GONNA BE BIG YEAH

           He is serenading his sweetheart: BETTY JEAN, 16, brown 
           ringlets, saucer eyes. Poodle skirt flared on the lawn.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        GONNA BUY THIS TOWN
                        AND PUT IT ALL IN MY SHOE
                        MIGHT EVEN GIVE A PIECE TO YOU!
                        THAT’S WHAT I’M GONNA DO

           Betty Jean claps exuberantly.

                                 BETTY JEAN
                        You getting better all the time, 
                        Jimmy!

           Chyron: Seattle. 16 years old.

                                 JIMI
                        Ain’t nuthin’ without my muse.

           He hops down, falling to the grass with his head in her lap. 
           Guitar in his own.

                                 BETTY JEAN
                        What’s that, a guitar thing?

                                 JIMI
                        Naw, muse is a person. Person in 
                        your life makes you feel things. 
                        Person you play for.

                                 BETTY JEAN
                        Oh-
                             (fishing)
                        So who’s yours?

                                 JIMI
                        You kidding, girl?
           He plucks a white flower from the grass, tucking it behind 
           her ear. Leaning in for a kiss. But just then-

           They are cut short by the sound of a car rumbling up. 
           Creaking suspension, squealing brakes. Jimi instinctively 
           grabs his guitar.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        Shoot!
                             (leaping up)
                        You better skedaddle.

           He tugs her to her feet.

                                 BETTY JEAN
                        Why? Who is it, Jimmy?

                                 JIMI
                        This way!

           He hoists her over the back gate-

           As an old jalopy rounds the corner: “Hendrix Landscapes”

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                             (frantic)
                        And take her, will you?

           Jimi passes the guitar carefully over the fence. This is his 
           true queen.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        He’ll only smash her up again.

           Betty Jean hesitates, reaching for his hand but Jimi is gone.

                                 AL
                        What the hell, boy? You been 
                        snippin’ these blades one at a 
                        time?

           Jimi hustles back to the push mower.

                                 JIMI
                        Sorry pop, uh, lost a-

                                 AL
                        Lost your good sense, most like!

           He grabs Jimi by the hand, inspecting his callous-tipped 
           fingers. Jimi has been playing the guitar.
                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Get these from hard work, did you? 
                        Probably think you beguilin’ the 
                        poor girl with that devil music. 
                        Only it’s the other way ‘round.

           He collects the push mower, rake, gardening tools.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        That’s how the woman lays her hooks 
                        in. Makes you feel like king of the 
                        world. Then drops you flat. ‘Fore 
                        you know it, no more music, no more 
                        dancin’. Just a skinny young punk 
                        turned into a big fat zero like me.

           Al yanks Jimi to the truck.

                                 JIMI
                        What’s the big hurry, another yard?

           INT. OLD JALOPY - CONTINUOUS

           Al shoves Jimi inside.

                                 AL
                        Scoot over, boy-

           LEON is here. He is 8, wide-eyed and good natured

                                 JIMI
                        Don’t he have school?

                                 AL
                             (climbing in)
                        Not today.

           He cranks the ignition. As Leon beams.

                                 LEON
                        Mama’s coming home!

           EXT. CENTRAL DISTRICT - DAY

           An inner-city street of ramshackle row houses, run to seed. 
           The jalopy parked out front.
           INT. HENDRIX ROW HOUSE - DAY

           Once upon a time this was a home. Now, it is barely a house. 
           Seriously lacking a woman’s touch. But the boys rush about, 
           doing what they can to whip the place into shape.

           Al unpacks a shoebox of dusty old photos on the mantel.

                                 AL
                        Your old man could really cut a rug 
                        back in those days! At one with the 
                        music, you know?

           Jimi pauses on an old picture, lingering on the image: the 
           face of a beautiful young woman. It is Lucille, his mother.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        And real music, too. Swing. Bop. 
                        All the big bands used to come 
                        through town before the war.
                             (swats Jimi)
                        Don’t just stare at the dust, boy, 
                        clean it!

           Al pauses on a photo of him and Lucille with a dance trophy.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        That night it was the King himself: 
                        Benny Goodman, and his main man, 
                        Charlie Christian. Now there was a 
                        brother who could play. This was 
                        the biggest contest of the season-

           The boys chime in: 

                                 BOYS
                        “Washington Hall”

                                 AL
                        That’s right! But you know us 
                        Hendrix folks: what the good Lord 
                        done give in beauty-

                                 BOYS
                        He done took away in size.

                                 AL
                        Not where it counts, mind you!

           The boys laugh. They have heard the same story a thousand 
           times. But tender moments are few and far between.
                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Anyhow, your mama got that Cherokee 
                        blood. So outta all the girls in 
                        Seattle-

           And this is the key line, right here:

                                 BOYS
                        She was the perfect fit.

                                 AL
                             (lost in the memory)
                        Meant to be.

                                 BOYS
                        Kismet!

           Now they’re mocking him.

                                 AL
                        Well shoot, I gonna tell this 
                        story, or you?

                                 LEON
                        You!

                                 AL
                        Well-
                             (but the good cheer fades)
                        That was it, really. Took her home, 
                        had our fun. 9 months later-

           A glance at Jimi, some deep resentment.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        No more dancing.

           But Jimi is too distracted to feel the sting. He is studying 
           the old picture of Lucille, so young, so alive.

                                 LEON
                        She gonna stay this time?

           Harsh reality sinking back.

                                 AL
                        Docs say she kicked the sauce. 
                        Still a fragile little bird. But 
                        that woman already done me wrong 
                        every way to Sunday. Reckon there’s 
                        no surprises left.

           Al shrugs, a simmering stew of mixed emotions.
                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Maybe that’s the meaning of love, 
                        right there.

           Sound of a car pulling up out front. Toot of a horn.

                                 LEON
                        It’s her!

                                 AL
                             (suddenly excited)
                        Go on, then!
                             (then wavers)
                        No, wait! Get back over here!

           Al smooths their hair, adjusting threadbare trousers to cover 
           the holes. Even now, he is no more than a silly fool in love.

           EXT. ROW HOUSE - DAY

           A white ambulance. Big red cross. Several orderlies help a 
           frail woman to the curb. Parting to reveal her gaunt figure. 
           Jaundiced skin. Sallow cheeks. Limbs palsied from the DTs. 
           LUCILLE is only 35, but twice that in wear.

                                 LEON
                        Mama! Mama!

           Leon rushes up exuberantly, too young to recognize the 
           horror. But Al and Jimi stand back, petrified at the sight. 
           Of their vibrant, beautiful wife/mother... now a mere ghost.

                                 LUCILLE
                        Look at you, my little man! All 
                        growed up.
                             (squints at Jimi)
                        Buster, is that you?

                                 LEON
                        It’s Jimmy, now, mama.

           Lucille spreads her arms, but Jimi is frozen.

                                 AL
                             (smacks him)
                        Well? What you waiting for, boy? Go 
                        give your mama a kiss!

           Al, ever the master of sensitivity. He spanks Jimi onward 
           because he cannot bear to go himself.

                                 JIMI
                        Uh- welcome home, mama.
           INT. HENDRIX ROW HOUSE - LATER

           The family is having afternoon tea in the Depression glass 
           that passes for fine china. Lucille fights tremors just to 
           bring a cup to her lips... but it spills, scalding her.

                                 LUCILLE
                             (blushing)
                        Now there, look how clumsy! Must be 
                        the music in my bones.

           Al nudges Jimi to wipe the mess.

                                 LUCILLE (CONT’D)
                        But I hear it runs in the family. 
                        Papa says you took up an 
                        instrument? Says you got talent!

           And this is a surprise. Papa said that? Jimi glances to Al. 
           He thought that subject was taboo.

                                 JIMI
                        Uh- well-

                                 LEON
                        Jimmy plays the guitar!

                                 LUCILLE
                        Oh my! Did you know that’s always 
                        been my favorite? Well, where is 
                        it? Let’s hear something!

                                 JIMI
                        Oh, um- actually- well it ain’t 
                        exactly-

                                 LEON
                        Papa won’t let him keep it in the 
                        house.

           Al blushes.

                                 AL
                        Leon, now don’t be a fool.

                                 LEON
                        But you said it’s the devil’s 
                        music. Same what done in mama.

           From the mouths of babes. Al, mortified.
                                 AL
                        Boy’s imagination, Lucy! Jimmy was 
                        just wasting too much time, is all- 
                        ruinin’ his schooling.
                             (prods Jimi)
                        Well, go on! Don’t let the grass 
                        grow! Get that guitar so you can 
                        play something for your mama.

           Jimi hesitates.

                                 JIMI
                        But- really, mama, I ain’t so hot 
                        or nothing.

                                 LUCILLE
                        Hogwash!

           She brightens for the first time. A glimmer of her former 
           self. And how could Jimi possibly resist that?

                                 LUCILLE (CONT’D)
                        I bet you’ll have me up and dancing 
                        in no time!

           EXT. PUGET SOUND - DUSK

           A pebbly beach. Waves lapping in. Jimi plays a song we have 
           heard before, many times.

                                 JIMI
                        AND THE WIND CRIES... BETTY

           His eyes flutter open, sheepish. He has been playing for 
           Betty Jean.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        I mean, I know the words is stupid.

                                 BETTY JEAN
                        Stupid? Jimmy, they beautiful!

                                 JIMI
                        Yeah?
                             (then)
                        I wrote it for you.

           She sparkles. Jimi, marvelling at the power of his music.

                                 BETTY JEAN
                        You mean it? Like your muse?
                             (takes his hand)
                                 JIMI
                        Think she’d like it, though?

                                 BETTY JEAN
                        Hm? Oh- Your mama? Sure she would, 
                        Jimmy!

                                 JIMI
                        She used to sing me stories. ‘Bout 
                        far off places. Seein’ the world. 
                        Crazy dreams. Never rhymed or 
                        nuthin’, just made ‘em up as she 
                        went along. But she used to say 
                        singin’ something makes it real.

           He darkens. The recent memory returning.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        Man, Betty, you should have seen 
                        her. Like a ghost, or something. 
                        ‘Til Leon mentioned the guitar, 
                        then she just- lit up, you know? 
                        Her eyes. Almost like she used to.

                                 BETTY JEAN
                        That’s great, Jimmy.

                                 JIMI
                        Great? Foolishness is what it is. 
                        Like some dumb song could fix her.

                                 BETTY JEAN
                        Maybe it can. Maybe it’s like she 
                        says, maybe singing makes it real.

                                 JIMI
                        If a song could do that, I’d write 
                        one for us.

           Fashioning a “ship” from the sand-

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        ‘Bout a big ol’ sailin’ ship.

           Betty Jean sidles close, sharing the fantasy.

                                 BETTY JEAN
                        Carry us across the universe!

                                 JIMI
                        Far away from here.

           Her fingers find his.
                                 BETTY JEAN
                        You gonna write that song, Jimi. 
                        And when you do, just promise it’s 
                        me you take along for the ride.

                                 JIMI
                             (laughs)
                        Who else, girl?

           And at least for the moment, he means this.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        You my queen.

           Their lips meet. Rolling softly to the sand... As the tide 
           licks up, washing away their “ship”. Music rising on track.

                                 JIMI (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        SHE DREW HER WHEELCHAIR TO THE EDGE 
                        OF THE SHORE
                        AND TO HER LEGS SHE SMILED YOU 
                        WON’T HURT ME NO MORE
                        BUT THEN A SIGHT SHE’D NEVER SEEN 
                        MADE HER JUMP AND SAY
                        LOOK, A GOLDEN-WINGED SHIP IS 
                        PASSING MY WAY!

                                                             RETURN TO:

           INT. AFFLUENT HOUSE - DAY (1970)

           Jimi, lost in the song, the past.

                                 JIMI
                        AND SO CASTLES MADE OF SAND
                        SLIPS INTO THE SEA, EVENTUALLY

           And as he opens his eyes- for a flash, through the crowd of 
           ogling neighborhood fans, Jimi glimpses: a blur of light, and 
           those kind eyes, smiling. His angel. Or ghost.

           And then she’s gone. Jimi, haunted.

           EXT. SICK’S STADIUM - DAY

           Jeffrey elbows through a horde of ravening press.

                                 VOICES
                        Where is he? Where’s Jimi?
                                 JEFFREY
                        If you want to see him, pay for a 
                        ticket!

           He slams the doors behind him. As we crane up the marquee: 
           “One Night Only: Jimi Hendrix”

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY

           Still no Jimi. Chas is scrutinizing the tarot cards. Wracking 
           his brain. As tape spins on the portable 8-track. Recording: 
           Jimi and his guitar, struggling with the unfinished song.

                                 JIMI (RECORDED)
                        ANGEL COME DOWN...
                        ANGEL FLY DOWN...
                        ANGEL TAKE ME...

           Chas studies the Judgement card: angel peering from the 
           heavens. Corpses writhing up. What does it mean?

           INT. CONCERT ARENA - DAY

           Roadies prep the stage. As Jeffrey barrels through... Gerry 
           scampering along.

                                 GERRY
                        I phoned our contact at the police 
                        department.

                                 JEFFREY
                        And how much to keep the news away 
                        from those buzzards?
                             (re: press)

                                 GERRY
                        Two-hundred.

           Jeffrey winces.

                                 GERRY (CONT’D)
                        And the insurance company called-
                             (rifling clipboard)
                        Ten million. So long as it’s not by 
                        his own hand.

           Jeffrey swallows a handful of antacid.

                                 JEFFREY
                        All this heartache, the bastard’s 
                        worth more dead than alive!
           He bursts into

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Where Chas is still studying the tarot, lost in thought.

                                 JEFFREY
                        Your time is up, mate! Cops are 
                        involved now. And I want you out.

           But Chas has reached a conclusion.

                                 CHAS
                        Let him go.

                                 JEFFREY
                        I beg your pardon?

                                 CHAS
                        Don’t you get it, Jeffrey? Jimi 
                        isn’t lost. He’s escaped. And he’s 
                        better off that way! It’s all this-
                             (snatches clipboard)
                        It’s us that’ll kill him!

                                 JEFFREY
                        Kill him? You daft ponce! We 
                        fucking made him, you and me!

                                 CHAS
                        He’s a lonely kid.

                                 JEFFREY
                        He’s an act! All this?

           He throws open the door to the stage, crew, empty arena...

                                 JEFFREY (CONT’D)
                        Me? You? Gerry, here? The fucking 
                        boys in the fucking sound booth? 
                        The fucking spotlights? This is 
                        Jimi Hendrix, right here!
                             (grabs the tarot)
                        Him? He’s just some bloke we pay to 
                        play the guitar.
                             (tosses it)
                        So get out of the way, or fucking 
                        find him. And if he really wants to 
                        snuff it, tell him to do it on 
                        stage, where he belongs!

           He shoves past, walking off. As the phone rings.
                                 GERRY
                             (answers it, eyes go wide)
                        It’s the cops!

           Jeffrey stops. Chas turns back.

                                 GERRY (CONT’D)
                        House party out in the suburbs. 
                        Neighbors just called to complain- 
                        some strange negro with a guitar.

           INT. AFFLUENT HOUSE - DAY

           A bathroom mirror. Jimi is alone. Sallow, pallid. Icy beads 
           of sweat on his brow. That haunted look.

           His hands are once again aquiver as he fumbles to uncap the 
           bottle of barbiturates, accidentally spilling pills across 
           the counter. Jimi collects them into his palm. Begins to 
           funnel them back... when he stops. A whole handful of pills.

           Maybe this is what he has been searching for all along... 
           True escape.

           Jimi squeezes his eyes shut. And mouths the entire handful of 
           pills. A suicidal dose. Swallowing it with a wince.

           And then a long beat. He’s done it.

           But nothing happens yet. Just the wait. Cuckoo clock ticking 
           among homey knickknacks on the wall.

                                 LANE
                             (steps in)
                        Oh! Sorry-

           Jimi quickly pockets the empty pill bottle.

                                 LANE (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t realize-

           But she stops, seeing Jimi’s face. Ashen, clammed in sweat.

                                 LANE (CONT’D)
                             (concerned)
                        Do you need anything?

           Jimi spreads that irresistible smile.

                                 JIMI
                        Just a little peace.

           Despite it all, managing to put her at ease.
                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        Why, you got some?

           INT. LANE’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Lane unfolds a tin foil pouch to reveal two tabs of acid. She 
           licks one up, offering the other to Jimi. He takes it. And 
           they fall back to the bed. Side by side. Gazing up at walls 
           plastered with images of “Jimi Hendrix”. A record spins.

                                 SONG (ON RECORD)
                        I AIN’T READY!
                        I AIN’T READY!
                        LET ME LIVE!

           The song is 51st Anniversary. After a long beat-

                                 LANE
                        What’s it like?

                                 JIMI
                        Hm?
                             (then)
                        Tingles.

                                 LANE
                        No. I mean being famous. Being him.

           The posters, clippings, album sleeves.

                                 JIMI
                        Oh. Pretty flat, I guess.

                                 LANE
                        Huh? Oh, I get it. Flat. You’re 
                        funny.

                                 SONG (ON RECORD)
                        LET ME LIVE!
                        LET ME LIVE A LITTLE LONGER!

           The song ends and another begins. It is The Wind Cries Mary.

                                 LANE
                             (laughs)
                        I still can’t believe you told my 
                        mom you wrote this for her.

           But Jimi is drifting, pills beginning to take effect.

                                 JIMI
                        I wrote it for you.
                                 LANE
                        Ha ha ha. How many girls you tell 
                        that, anyway?

                                 JIMI
                        Every one.

           Lane giggles. But Jimi means this. It is a confession.

                                 LANE
                        So who’s it really for, then?

                                 JIMI
                        I-

           And this is hard. This is frightening.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know. But I hurt her. I 
                        hurt them all. And I’m dying.

                                 LANE
                        Don’t say that!

                                 JIMI
                        Forgive me. Please.

           He shuts his eyes.

                                 LANE
                             (suddenly terrified)
                        Jimi!

           She rolls on top of him, shaking.

                                 LANE (CONT’D)
                        Jimi, wake up! Help!

           But he is not gone, yet. Eyes flickering, as he sees behind 
           her- that blur of light: kind eyes, smiling back.

                                 LANE (CONT’D)
                             (smacks him)
                        Jimi? Stay with me! You didn’t hurt 
                        anyone. Do you hear me? We love 
                        you. You wrote this for us! You 
                        wrote it for all of us!

           She kisses him. Hard, desperate, flush on the mouth...

           And his eyes slam wide- seeing her blonde hair falling loose 
           above him, exposing the glint of silver earrings.

           They are star-shaped earrings.
                                 TOBY
                             (rushing in)
                        Lane? Jimi?

           But Jimi is suddenly wide awake, rifling his pocket for- 
           another tarot card: Queen of Swords. Blonde hair, blue eyes, 
           and a pair of star-shaped earrings... She is Lane.

           EXT. AFFLUENT SUBURB - MOMENTS LATER

           Jimi barges out, past the ogling neighborhood fans. And up to 
           the bug parked in the drive... key still in the ignition.

                                 TOBY
                        Jimi, wait!

           But Jimi peels out.

           INT. VW BUG - CONTINUOUS

           Jimi is drenched in sweat, teeth jittering, fighting the 
           imminent overdose as he speeds across town. He cannot let go. 
           Not yet. There is something left to do. His body is running 
           on pure adrenaline. Hyper-alert. When he notices...

           The cellophane wrapper on the floor: concert tickets, room 
           service receipt, and a kinky strand of hair.

                                                            FLASH BACK:

           EXT. CENTRAL DISTRICT - DAWN (1958)

           A woman’s fingers weave through Jimi’s kinky hair...

                                 JIMI
                        I better hustle. Pop’s gonna have 
                        my-

           Fingers plucking a strand-

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        Ouch!

           The fingers belong to Betty Jean. She plucks a hair of her 
           own and twines it with Jimi’s in an infinite knot.

                                 BETTY JEAN
                        Take it.

           They are in the same clothes, damp from a night on the beach.
                                 BETTY JEAN (CONT’D)
                        Means we won’t ever be apart.

           She wants an oath. But Jimi is preoccupied.

                                 JIMI
                        Betty, I really gotta-

           But this is important to her. He sees this. And takes it.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        You bet it does.

           Jimi sprints off around a corner.

           EXT. HENDRIX ROW HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           A police cruiser is parked out front, dome lights flashing in 
           the pre-dawn. Jimi skids up across the street, seeing this.

                                 JIMI
                        Shit. Must have called in a search 
                        party.

           INT. BOYS’ BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jimi shimmies up a drain pipe on the side of the house, 
           climbing in through the window, to find...

           Both beds are still made. Leon is missing.

                                 JIMI
                        Leon?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jimi steps in cautiously, still holding his guitar. Seeing a 
           frazzled Al at the table, surrounded by police.

                                 JIMI
                        Hey, sorry I’m late- I ain’t hurt 
                        or nuthin’-

           Heads turn. Jimi sees Leon’s tear-stained face.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                             (realizing)
                        Where’s mama?
           EXT. FUNERAL HOME - THE NEXT DAY

           Al staggers down the steps, pale as a sheet. Ordinarily a 
           tough customer. But this blow has laid him low. He pauses a 
           beat to steel himself, bury the pain...

           Before returning to the old jalopy parked in the drive.

           INT. OLD JALOPY - CONTINUOUS

           The boys wait within. Leon whimpering. Jimi just gazing 
           ahead, numb. As Al pops the passenger door-

                                 AL
                        Y’all can go take a gander if you 
                        want-
                             (avoiding eye contact)
                        Ain’t much to see, but I suppose 
                        her good looks went some time ago.

           He tugs Leon.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Go on, be a lesson to you.

           But Jimi grabs him-

                                 JIMI
                             (fiercely protective)
                        Leave him be.

           Their eyes meet. Al’s are stinging.

                                 AL
                        Ain’t you even want to see for 
                        yourself what you done? Old girl 
                        wanted music so bad, when you never 
                        showed up, she snuck out and found 
                        some. Music and whiskey. Danced 
                        ‘til she dropped out the door. 
                        Ruptured her spleen. Bust clean 
                        open. Poisoned her from the inside. 
                        But still peaceful as an angel, on 
                        the out. Doc says it ain’t nobody’s 
                        fault but her own-

           But Al thinks otherwise. He climbs in, starts the engine.

                                 AL (CONT'D)
                             (back to Jimi)
                        What do you think?
           EXT. HENDRIX ROW HOUSE - DUSK

           Jimi sits on the stoop, lost in guilt, regret, cradling his 
           guitar. But not playing. Not even noticing the nightfall. As 
           Al teeters out behind him, a half-drunk bottle of bourbon in 
           his fist. Probably not the first.

                                 AL
                        Gettin’ cold.

           Jimi merely stares ahead. Shattered. Even Al feels a pang.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Look, boy-

           This is Al showing concern. He searches for the words.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        That woman was a mess long before 
                        she ever brought you into this 
                        world.

           Jimi continues to stare.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        What I mean to say- well- I ain’t 
                        blamin’ you, is all.

           This is the best he can do. It is not enough.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Smoke?

           He pries a cigarette from the pack, but his own hands are 
           shaking. He fumbles a matchbook, dropping it.

           Jimi remains silent.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, funeral’s down south a 
                        ways. Place called Greenwood. Only 
                        a pauper’s grave. I ain’t goin’.

           All that anger, pain. He swallows it back, making an effort.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        But no one’s stoppin’ you. If you 
                        want, that is.

           Al empties some change from his pocket- maybe a dollar.
                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        You can go ahead and take your 
                        brother on the bus. I’ll mow the 
                        lawns myself, tomorrow.

           And for Al, this is a great effort. But Jimi remains silent. 
           Eyes to the front.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Well-

           Al falls silent.

           He is a man ordinarily more comfortable that way. And yet 
           just now he wishes for all the world he could find the words.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Guess I’ll be turnin’ in.

           He sets the bottle of bourbon on the stoop, next to Jimi.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                             (wistful)
                        It was her favorite.

           And walks back in.

           INT. HENDRIX ROW HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Al shuts the bedroom door behind him. Finding himself alone 
           for the first time. And breaks down, sobbing uncontrollably. 
           Here, by himself, letting tears flow. When he notices...

           Firelight flickering in from the window. Al peers out to see-

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Jimi’s guitar in the middle of the street. It has been set 
           ablaze. Jimi stands above it, pouring on the bourbon. This is 
           not a sacrifice. It is a suicide.

           Varnish blisters... Strings pop... Flames crackle an erratic 
           rhythm... All reflected in his dark eyes.

           INT. BASEMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A girl’s bedroom. Betty Jean is in shock, consoling.

                                 BETTY JEAN
                        Oh, lord! Oh, Jesus! Oh, Jimi!
           She embraces him, but Jimi stands frozen, benumbed.

                                 JIMI
                        She was waiting for me.

                                 BETTY JEAN
                        You didn’t do this, Jimi. Do you 
                        hear me?

           She reaches for him, but he flinches back

                                 BETTY JEAN (CONT’D)
                        I need to you listen. This wasn’t 
                        you. This is not on you.

                                 JIMI
                        I’m leaving.

                                 BETTY JEAN
                        You- When? Now?
                             (trying to process)
                        Well- you know what? That’s good! I 
                        mean, why not? Let’s do it. 
                        Wherever you want to go! Across the 
                        universe!

           She moves to the dresser, rummaging a coffee tin.

                                 BETTY JEAN (CONT’D)
                        I even got money for the-

           But stops, seeing...

           The army enlistment form. Jimi’s name is on the dotted line.

                                 BETTY JEAN (CONT’D)
                             (shatters)
                        Oh.

           EXT. BETTY JEAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jimi climbs out the basement window. Pausing to look back-

                                 JIMI
                        Promise I’ll write.

           Betty Jean forces a smile. But bites back tears. She knows 
           this is goodbye.

                                                             RETURN TO:
           EXT. CENTRAL DISTRICT - DUSK (1970)

           Jimi stands outside the same house. The same basement window. 
           Dark, now. Reflecting his eyes, deep wells of regret.

           When suddenly- a reflection in the glass: that blur of light, 
           those kind eyes. Jimi spins back.

                                 JIMI
                        Hey!

           The blur is gone. But Jimi is tired. Time is running out.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        Who are you?! Speak to me!

           A light comes on above him, in the upstairs window of the 
           house. The silhouette of a woman peering out. It is

                                 BETTY JEAN
                        Somebody out there?

           Jimi freezes. And

           INT. VW BUG - MOMENTS LATER

           Jimi floors the gas, speeding off.

           EXT. BETTY JEAN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           As the front door throws open, Betty Jean rushing out. But 
           his gone. She holds a newborn child in her arms. Signs of 
           warm family life through the door within. She has moved on.

           She notices... a square of color on the path. A tarot card.

           INT. VW BUG - MOMENTS LATER

           Jimi jerks to a stop at a red light. His reflexes are shot. 
           He is fighting the drugs, drifting in and out of focus.

           EXT. BETTY JEAN’S HOUSE - SAME

           Betty Jean kneels to inspect the tarot card: Queen of Cups. A 
           woman seated by the sea shore on a sand-castle throne. Brown 
           skin, black ringlets, a white flower in her hair.

           She is Betty Jean.
           INT. VW BUG - DUSK

           A car horn blares. Jolting Jimi awake. The light has changed. 
           But Jimi is fading. On the brink of blacking out...

           When he notices something. A roadside billboard: “Greenwood 
           Memorial Park - 10 miles”

                                 AL (FROM MEMORY)
                        Funeral’s down south a ways. Place 
                        called Greenwood.

           Jimi stiffens at the memory. And suddenly he knows where he 
           has to go. Where he has been headed all along.

           Music fades up on track: All Along the Watchtower. As we

                                                                CUT TO:

           The drive south. Jimi, fighting off the mounting overdose. 
           One thing left to do. As his mind flashes a montage of 
           memory. Kathy, Linda, Devon, Lane, Betty Jean... his Queens.

                                 SONG
                        THERE MUST BE SOME KIND OF WAY OUT 
                        OF HERE
                        SAID THE JOKER TO THE THIEF
                        THERE’S TOO MUCH CONFUSION
                        I CAN’T GET NO RELIEF

           Snippets of voices we’ve heard-

                                 VOICES (FROM MEMORY)
                        Wrongs from the past... You hurt 
                        these people... Seek them out... 
                        I’m a queen!... You my queen... Who 
                        are you?! Speak to me!...
                             (and finally)
                        I’m dying.

           Arriving at

           EXT. MEMORIAL PARK - NIGHT

           Jimi skids onto the curb, staggering out.

                                 SONG
                        ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER
                        PRINCES KEPT THE VIEW

                        BARE-FOOT SERVANTS, TOO
           EXT. CEMETARY GROUNDS - NIGHT

           Jimi stumbles through the headstone maze of an overgrown 
           welfare section, scouring the plain granite markers...

                                 SONG
                        OUTSIDE IN THE COLD DISTANCE
                        A WILD CAT DID GROWL
                        TWO RIDERS WERE APPROACHING
                        AND THE WIND BEGAN TO HOWL!

           The song fades.

           When-

           A sudden movement in the gloaming: that blur of light. Jimi 
           spinning back to see... the glint of an earring. Then gone.

           Another blur-

           Jimi spins... this time, a streak of crimson red.

           Jimi loses his balance, bracing himself on a headstone. And 
           suddenly, there before him:

           The woman from Woodstock- twirling in the bright light.

           Red heels... mismatched gloves, one white, the other black... 
           star-shaped earrings... a white flower in her hair.

           And she spins to face us

                                                            FLASH BACK:

           EXT. CENTRAL DISTRICT - NIGHT (1948)

           The same woman, dancing under a flare of fireworks in the 
           night sky. Bleaching her face for a moment. Then revealing-

           She is Lucille.

           Young. Vibrant. Stunning, in red heels, black and white 
           gloves, star-shaped earrings, a white flower in her hair.

           She is alive. In a memory Jimi has all but forgotten.

           BUSTER is 6, wide-eyed, craning up at his mama...

           She is dancing with Al on the porch. A Lindy Hop with wild, 
           cheerful abandon. Carefree, in love.

           As the entire neighborhood gathers to watch. None more 
           spellbound than Buster/Jimi...
           Knowing now and forever: this is his Queen.

           The swing tune ends. Followed briefly by a flourish of the 
           Star-Spangled Banner. It is July 4.

           Lucille twirls to a stop, facing Buster/Jimi with those kind 
           eyes, smiling warmly. She offers her hand for the next dance.

           And instead of old-time swing, we hear- over this same radio, 
           the first, ghostly chords of a familiar song.

                                 SONG (ON RADIO)
                        AFTER ALL THE JACKS ARE IN THEIR

                        AND THE CLOWNS HAVE ALL GONE TO BED

                        FOOTPRINTS DRESSED IN RED

           Mother and son begin to dance. And as the song continues, 
           playing whole for the first time, we

           INT. HENDRIX ROW HOUSE - NIGHT (1958)

           That fateful day. A frail Lucille. On the evening of her 
           return from hospital. Only this is a fantasy...

           Jimi has returned with his guitar. And Lucille is alive. He 
           is playing for her. He is saving her life. And his own.

                                 SONG
                        WILL THE WIND EVER REMEMBER
                        THE NAMES IT HAS BLOWN IN THE PAST?
                        AND WITH THIS CRUTCH, ITS OLD AGE, 
                        AND ITS WISDOM
                        IT WHISPERS, “NO, THIS WILL BE THE 
                        LAST”

                                                             RETURN TO:

           EXT. CEMETARY - NIGHT (1970)

           Jimi is standing face to face with a young Lucille. A deep 
           calm consuming him. As he realizes now, for the first time-

                                 JIMI
                        I wrote it for you.

           But she has known all along.

                                 LUCILLE
                        I know.

           He takes her hand. The great regret of his life. Finally 
           fulfilled. And we

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                 SONG
                        AND THE WIND CRIES MARY

                                                         SMASH BACK TO:

           Jimi, alone. Hovering above a simple headstone: “Lucille 
           Hendrix - Loving Mother”

                                 CARETAKER
                        That your man?

           Chas rushes up.

                                 CHAS
                        Jimi!
           But Jimi appears to be fine. He is not shaking. And, 
           miraculously, no longer covered in sweat. Seemingly at peace.

           It is Chas who looks like the nervous wreck.

                                 JIMI
                        You okay, man? Look like you seen a 
                        ghost.

           EXT. MEMORIAL PARK - MOMENTS LATER

           Chas and Jimi return to a waiting limo. As Jeffrey snags the 
           caretaker.

                                 JEFFREY
                        You there!
                             (a wad of cash)
                        Not a word of this- ever.

           EXT. CONCERT ARENA - NIGHT

           Masses filing in. Among them, Toby and Lane. Almost showtime.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jimi steps in with his battered guitar case. Back to the old 
           life. Chas lingers at the door, a hint of residual concern.

                                 CHAS
                        You, uh- sure everything’s groovy? 
                        I don’t care what Jeffrey says, no 
                        one’s forcing you out there 
                        tonight.

           Jimi looks back. This means something. But for the first time 
           in a long time, there is something easy about his smile-

                                 JIMI
                             (reassuring)
                        I’m ready to go.

           Chas nods. And leaves him in privacy.

           After a beat, Jimi locks the door behind him.

           Retrieving the empty pill bottle from his pocket.

           He sets it down on the coffee table before him. And sinks 
           back into the couch. Allowing himself, finally, to relax.

           Allowing the drugs to wash back over him. He begins to drift.
           When he notices... a tarot card on the floor beside him.

           It is Judgement. The pictogram: corpses emerging from their 
           graves. Yearning up at an angel in the clouds... We have seen 
           it before. But this time we see something new.

           The face of the angel. She is Lucille.

           And suddenly-

           Something clicks in. This image is not an end. It is a 
           beginning. Jimi quicky grabs his guitar, plugging in-

           As beads of sweat rise again on his brow. His fingers 
           beginning to tremble as he plays.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        ANGEL CAME DOWN
                             (writing as he goes)
                        FROM HEAVEN YESTERDAY
                        STAYED WITH ME JUST LONG ENOUGH TO-

           But the word literally chokes in his throat.

           Jimi convulses with an electric shot, as the drugs finally 
           take hold. But now he is not ready.

           He tries to fight it. Playing again-

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        STAYED WITH ME JUST LONG ENOUGH-

           But his fingers slip like noodles from the strings.

           Jimi staggers to his feet, but trips to the floor. Struggling 
           to pull himself to the door...

           As another shudder rocks him. He cannot make it any farther.

           The room swirls, sputters, fades.

           But just then- up above: those kind eyes, that beatific face 
           staring back, smiling. Lucille. His angel.

           INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           Lights flash.

                                 GERRY
                        Five minutes, everyone!

           He reaches the dressing room door. Knocking-
                                 GERRY (CONT’D)
                        Jimi?
                             (knocks again)
                        Jimi, you in there?

           No response. Sudden concern.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The door smashes in...

                                 CHAS
                        Jimi?

           But he is gone. Gerry and Chas spin about, perplexed.

           When suddenly-

           Sounds of retching from the bathroom. They pound the door.

                                 CHAS (CONT’D)
                        Jimi? Jimi, open up!

           Spotting the empty pill bottle, guitar on the floor.

                                 CHAS (CONT’D)
                        Knock it in!

           Gerry reels back to kick, but just then-

           Sound of a toilet flushing. And the door swings open.

           Jimi is staring back- a little pale, but alive.

                                 JIMI
                        I finished the song.

           INT. CONCERT ARENA - NIGHT

           Capacity crowd. Jimi is on stage- refreshed, reborn.

                                 JIMI
                        ANGEL CAME DOWN
                        FROM HEAVEN YESTERDAY
                        STAYED WITH ME JUST LONG ENOUGH TO 
                        RESCUE ME

           A raw, stirring poem of redemption.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        AND SHE TOLD ME A STORY YESTERDAY
                        ABOUT THE SWEET LOVE

                        SEA

           We notice Kathy in the crowd- she has come for her friend.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        THEN SHE SPREAD HER WINGS HIGH OVER 
                        ME
                        SHE SAID, I SHALL RETURN TOMORROW

           And we stay with Jimi for the whole song...

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        AND I SAID FLY ON, MY SWEET ANGEL
                        FLY ON THROUGH THE SKY

           Chyron: Jimi was 27 years old.

                                 JIMI (CONT’D)
                        FLY ON, MY SWEET ANGEL
                        TOMORROW I WILL BE BY YOUR SIDE

           Chyron: This was the last song he ever wrote.

           But as the song ends, we

                                                               FADE TO:

           A final chyron over white: He lives on...
