           EXT. BRYANT PARK - DUSK

           BEGIN OPENING CREDITS.

           New York City in June.  The late afternoon sun fades and 
           hundreds of people settle onto blankets, popping open wine, 
           cheese, etc.  It's crowded, with not a lot of space to sit.

           The opening credits for Woody Allen's 'Manhattan' commence on 
           a giant screen. Five pretty TWENTY-SOMETHING GIRLS sit on a 
           blanket, as Woody goes into his, "Chapter One..." bit.

           There's a disturbance off-screen, a few "excuse me's" and 
           "sit down, assholes", as two early-thirties guys, MAC DANKO 
           and NATHAN SMALLS appear, squeezing onto the girls blanket.

           Mac's attractive enough, but might be a little long in the 
           tooth for the vintage Jefferson Airplane t-shirt he wears.  
           Nathan, glasses, is a little more conservative.

                                 GIRL #1
                        Hey, do you mind?

           The girls roll their eyes at each other.  This is exactly 
           what they didn't want to deal with tonight.  Mac ignores them 
           and pats a glum Nathan on the back, comforting.

                                 GIRL #2
                        Are you deaf, VH1?  Hit the road...

           The girls snicker at Mac's expense.  Mac turns to them.

                                 MAC
                        No, I'm not deaf. I am, though, a 
                        bit concerned about my friend 
                        Nathan here.  He needs to sit for a 
                        minute, then we'll be on our way.

           Nathan wipes a tear away and waves at the girls.

                                 GIRL #3
                        Yeah right, buddy...  Just take 
                        your sad little friend and your 
                        replica t-shirt out of here, okay?

           Nathan whimpers a bit, another wave of grief.

                                 MAC
                        I'll gladly leave when my boy here 
                        gets it together.

                        Then you can go back to your 'We're 
                        mean girls with no feelings or 
                        manners' act.  And FYI, I got this 
                        shirt at auction, 200 bucks.  It's 
                        the real deal.

           The girls shake their heads and watch Woody, save for Girl 
           #1, sitting next to Mac.  She leans over to him.

                                 GIRL #1
                             (whispering to Mac)
                        What's wrong with...  Nathan?

                                 MAC
                        His fiance literally dumped him 
                        about two hours ago.  Tell your 
                        pals. I'm sure they'll get some big 
                        yucks over it.  Let's go, Nathan...

           Mac begins to get up, holding a teary Nathan by the arm.

                                 GIRL #1
                        Wait, um... Why don't you guys just 
                        sit here for now, okay?  I'm really 
                        sorry about your fiance, Nathan...

                                 NATHAN
                        Me too.

           Mac ponders for a beat.  On cue, Gershwin's 'Rhapsody In 
           Blue' crescendos in the 'Manhattan' opening and the glorious 
           shot of fireworks exploding over the city fills the screen.

           CLOSE ON Girl #1, staring up at Mac.

           EXT. BRYANT PARK GRILL - 5TH AVENUE - LATER - 2:00 AM

           Mac, Nathan, and the same five girls spill out of the Grill 
           onto the sidewalk, drunk and laughing.  Cabs speed by.

                                 NATHAN
                        I feel a lot better.  Thanks, 
                        everyone.  You've helped me ride 
                        out a tough day.

           Mac checks the time on his iPhone as Nathan hails a cab.

                                 MAC
                        Well, the night doesn't have to be a 
                        memory just yet... You girls ever 
                        been to the Bamboo Room?  After hours 
                        joint in Brooklyn Heights?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           CLOSE ON the girls.  Of course not.  

           EXT. BRYANT PARK GRILL - 5TH AVENUE - MOMENTS LATER

           In perfect synch, Nathan holds the cab door as Mac ushers the 
           girls in.  Mac eyes the exposed thong of the last girl 
           climbing in.  Nathan slams the door behind her.  Mac smiles.

                                 MAC
                        Woody Allen night at Bryant Park?  
                        Genius. What would I do without you?

           Nathan smiles proudly.  They exchange a little hand slap, 
           climb into the cab, and screech out of frame.

           END OPENING CREDITS.

           INT. MANHATTAN LAW FIRM CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           A pretty, focused woman, HILARY KEELER, 32, sits across from 
           a few middle-aged, wealthy men lead by TRENT RADLEY.

                                 HILARY
                        In plain terms, our argument is 
                        that the tax department has no 
                        authority to impose a multi-year 
                        allocation rule on stock options...

           Radley glances down at Hilary's chest, then whispers to an 
           associate.  They chuckle.  Hilary stops, sneering.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        Should I continue, Mr. Radley, or 
                        do you want to find another firm 
                        that essentially redefined tax law?

           Hilary stares through Radley, who looks ashamed.

                                 TRENT RADLEY
                        Uh... Yes, Miss Keeler.  Sorry...

                                 HILARY
                        Okay, let's move on...

           INT. HILARY'S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER

           Hilary strides past her ASSISTANT and into her office.  She 
           answers her ringing Blackberry and sits at her desk.

                                 HILARY
                        I can't talk now, Mel...

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MELANIE (V.O.)
                        Then listen... Meet me at Ink after 
                        work.  That new place in the 
                        meatpacking district...

                                 HILARY
                        Mel, I really have to work...

                                 MELANIE (V.O.)
                        Not a request.  It's my birthday, 
                        for one, and for two you need to 
                        start looking...

           A law partner, FRED MORTIMER, fifties, enters Hilary's 
           office.  She holds up a 'wait a second' finger to him.

                                 HILARY
                        Okay, okay, I'll meet you.  I have 
                        to go now. Bye. (To Fred)  Sorry...

           Fred closes the door behind him.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        I just filled Radley in on what our 
                        strategy is... although he didn't 
                        seem particularly interested.

                                 FRED MORTIMER
                        The only thing that old dickwad's 
                        interested in is not paying taxes.

           They chuckle.  A beat.

                                 FRED MORTIMER (CONT'D)
                        You're being very strongly 
                        considered for partner, Keeler.

           Hilary let's this set in.  Wow.

                                 FRED MORTIMER (CONT'D)
                        It'll play out in the next couple 
                        months, so... be ready. It's a life 
                        decision, though.  Precludes 
                        everything, even a social life. I 
                        have two ex-wives to prove it.

           Hilary chuckles to herself, ironically.  A beat.

                                 FRED MORTIMER (CONT'D)
                        Congratulations, Hilary.

           Fred exits Hilary's office.  CLOSE ON Hilary.
           INT. INK - CROWDED MEATPACKING DISTRICT LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Hilary and MELANIE, blonde, kind of sexy, sit at a banquette, 
           martinis in front of them.  Hilary works her Blackberry.

                                 MELANIE
                        ... and all you've done since is 
                        obsess over him and make partner.

           Hilary doesn't look up from her Blackberry.

                                 HILARY
                        I don't obsess over him, I obsess 
                        over it.  The breakup. I don't know 
                        what happened. 

                                 MELANIE
                        It's been six months.  We're at  
                        'move on' time.

                                 HILARY
                        The first month we were just taking 
                        personal time, so the actual break-
                        up was under five months...  And I 
                        haven't made partner.  Yet.

                                 MELANIE
                        God, listen to yourself.  Hey, look 
                        at me...  Don't be 'that woman'.

           Hilary looks up.  This struck a nerve.

                                 HILARY
                        I am not 'that woman'.  And I'm not 
                        obsessing.  Aaron and I, we just... 
                        fit, you know?  

                                 MELANIE
                        The only thing I know is that 
                        you're trashing the last of your 
                        hot years.  Shit, you haven't even 
                        had sex since Aaron.

                                 HILARY
                        I have too. I've had plenty of sex.

                                 MELANIE
                        Yeah?  When?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 HILARY
                        That case in Houston. I met this 
                        arbitrator and we, huh, totally 
                        fucked ourselves silly for an 
                        entire weekend.  I didn't tell you?

                                 MELANIE
                        Pathetic...  Women who lie about 
                        sex usually say they didn't when 
                        they actually did.

           Hilary lowers her head, beaten, vulnerable.

                                 MELANIE (CONT'D)
                        C'mon, Hil, you're just rusty.  We 
                        used to run game all the time.

                                 HILARY
                        I don't want that life anymore.  

           QUICK TO the other end of the club, where Mac and Nathan do 
           their thing, chatting up two HOT GIRLS, mid-twenties.

                                 MAC
                        ... It's this little after-hours 
                        joint in Brooklyn Heights.

                                 HOT GIRL #2
                        After-hours?  It's eight-thirty.

           The girls share a look, not digging our boys.  Mac winks at 
           Nathan and, on cue, Nathan lowers his head sadly.

                                 MAC
                        Um, look... My friend here just got 
                        dumped, like, two hours ago...

                                 HOT GIRL #1
                        Yeah... That's a shocker.

           The girls laugh loudly.  Mercifully, Nathan pulls Mac aside.

                                 NATHAN
                        That was absolutely brutal...  I'm 
                        not so into this tonight.

                                 MAC
                        C'mon, don't fade on me, bud.  I 
                        can't do this without you.

           Nathan nods, gets his bearings, and looks across the bar, 
           spotting Hilary and Mel, while Mac continues his yapping.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        We need to be more Darwinian.  Go 
                        after the weak and the dying...  
                        Like the Nature Channel.

           Nathan points out Hilary and Mel.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        Golden Girls...  Like two wounded 
                        wildebeasts.  Wanna pounce?

           QUICK TO Hilary and Melanie, same spot at the bar.  

                                 MELANIE
                        You work twenty hours a day already.

                                 HILARY
                        But I'd be the youngest partner...

           Hilary stops as she sees Mac cruising over with a grin.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        Oh, shit... Here we go.

                                 MAC
                        You ladies know what goes great 
                        with vodka martinis?  More vodka 
                        martinis.

           Mac holds four fingers up to the bartender.

                                 HILARY
                        Don't bother.  Really...

                                 MAC
                        Mac.  And this here is Nathan.

           Sad Nathan stands behind Mac.  He and Mel make eye contact.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        He may look harmless, but watch 
                        your fingers, ladies.  He...

                                 HILARY
                        Move it along, killer.  What you're 
                        selling, we ain't buying.

           Mac and Nathan exchange looks.  Nathan acts upset.

                                 NATHAN
                        Sorry, pal.  I'm killing your game.  
                        My heart's just not in it right now.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           A bummed-out Nathan mopes out of frame.  Mac makes a 'now 
           look what you've done' face at the girls.

                                 MAC
                        My best friend there just got 
                        dumped by his fiance and all I 
                        wanted was to show him a decent 
                        time.  Sorry if I don't know how to 
                        play this 'game' the way it's 
                        supposed to be played.  I thought 
                        we all grew out of that.

           Mac sighs, shakes his head, and walks away.

                                 MELANIE (O.S.)
                        Wait!

           Melanie raises her fresh martini.  Hilary rolls her eyes.

           EXT. INK - MEATPACKING DISTRICT LOUNGE - LATER

           Hilary and Mel pull their coats on as Mac and Nathan try to 
           hail a cab in the background.

                                 HILARY
                        You were just being polite when you 
                        said we'd go to that Bamboo Den or 
                        Banana Room place with them, right?

                                 MELANIE
                        I know their routine's played but 
                        that Nathan's kinda cute. Just roll 
                        with it... I'm the birthday girl.

           Mac opens a cab door. Hilary eyes Mel and sternly mouths 'You 
           owe me' and climbs in.  Mac grabs Nathan before they follow.

                                 MAC
                        Refresher course: Heather's the ice 
                        queen dressed like Condi Rice, and 
                        Marisa's the blonde that's into me?

                                 NATHAN
                        Hilary's the brunette.  And 
                        Melanie's the blonde, and... I 
                        thought she seemed kinda into me.

                                 MAC
                        Whoa.  Who stole my wingman and 
                        left me a demon who's practicing 
                        evil cockblockery?

           A beat.  The two pals just laugh.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NATHAN
                        You realize we can't do this 
                        forever.  It has to end a some 
                        point, right?  

                                 MAC
                        Never.

           On that, both dart for the cab door at the same time.

           INT. MAC & NATHAN'S APT. (THE BAMBOO ROOM) - LATER

           The foursome enters a tricked-out duplex...  Asian lanterns, 
           Polynesian island music, and a neon 'BAMBOO ROOM' sign blast 
           on with the flick of a switch. Hilary gives a horrified gasp.

                                 MAC
                        Voila.  The Bamboo Room.  Not too 
                        crowded tonight, huh, Nathan?

           A garish Tiki bar in the corner.  The women share a look.

                                 HILARY
                        I don't know whether to laugh or 
                        run for my life.

           Melanie gives Hilary a 'Can we stay, please?' look.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        One drink.  But that's it.

           With a lei around his neck, Mac's already behind the bar.

                                 MAC
                        One drink coming up...

           Mac places one huge Buddha-head bowl in front of them and 
           begins filling it with booze.  Nathan lights it on fire.

           INT. MAC & NATHAN'S APT. - A LITTLE LATER

           Nathan and Melanie sit close on the couch, hitting it off.

                                 NATHAN
                        So I found out later that the woman 
                        never even practiced astrology...  
                        She was just an identity thief.

                                 MELANIE
                        That's insane...

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NATHAN
                        I know.  Stole all of my friends 
                        info, social security numbers...

                                 MELANIE
                        Did they steal your fiance's?

           Nathan smiles, sheepish.  Melanie smiles back.

                                 MAC (O.S.)
                        Who needs a refill on Party Punch?

           Nathan and Melanie just laugh at this, turning to the other 
           side of the room, where Mac is slumped at the bar.  Hilary 
           sits a few feet away, typing an email on her Blackberry.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        You ever not working that thing?

                                 HILARY
                        Only when there's something more 
                        interesting to do.

                                 MAC
                        Ah, career woman... That'll end in 
                        tears.

           The two watch Nathan and Melanie climb the spiral staircase 
           to the bedroom level.  Hilary looks up at Mac.

                                 HILARY
                        And what about you?  What do you do 
                        when you're not reliving 1997?

                                 MAC
                        Graphic design... Getting my own 
                        idea together but for now I'm at a 
                        company called Blue Star.  It's...

                                 HILARY
                        An HMO provider in midtown.  My 
                        firm does your taxes.

           Mac tries to stealthily top off Hilary's drink.  She 
           reflexively covers her glass with her hand.

                                 MAC
                        Mind-numbingly boring was what I 
                        was gonna say.  But the pay's good, 
                        they have Yankee seasons I get to 
                        use... And my mistletoe hat makes 
                        me the life of the Christmas party.

                        Is this the part where I'm supposed 
                        to giggle?

           Mac puts his glass down hard, annoyed.

                                 MAC
                        I get it.  Good cop, bad cop.  When 
                        you go out tomorrow night you'll be 
                        the cute one in the naughty top and 
                        she'll be the scary shrew in 
                        sensible shoes?

                                 HILARY
                        You know that game too? So next time 
                        Nathan gets to be the gropey horndog 
                        in the too-tight country-rock t-
                        shirt with all the stale one-liners?

           Mac stares down at his 'Flying Burrito Brothers' shirt.  
           Hilary motions to the Bamboo Room.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        I mean seriously, does this lame 
                        routine really work with any women?

           Mac points up to Nathan and Melanie, who stand in the doorway 
           of Nathan's bedroom.

                                 MAC
                        It reeled in your gal pal, hook, 
                        line and sinker.

                                 HILARY
                        Mel's controlling that situation. 
                        She'll flip that hair of hers in a 
                        second, give me 'the look', and 
                        then shut the door behind them.

           Sure enough, Melanie flips her great hair, gives Hilary 'the 
           look' and shuts the bedroom door behind her and Nathan.

                                 MAC
                        You're a fool.  My boy's got her 
                        thinking she's in control.  That's 
                        the brilliance of it.  In five 
                        minutes she'll be in her birthday 
                        suit and ready to rumble.

                                 HILARY
                        She'll have a car here within five 
                        minutes of their first kiss.

                        She already called for one when she 
                        went to the bathroom.

           Mac gives a disbelieving look.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        Looks like my work here's done.

           Hilary puts on her coat and gives Mac an exaggerated salute.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        It's been a crashing bore, jackass.

           Hilary smiles and exits.  Mac watches Nathan's door. The 
           light turns off under the crack and Mac smiles.  Victory.

           EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NEXT MORNING

           Mac and Nathan jog the Brooklyn Bridge path, to Manhattan.  
           Nathan's in better shape than Mac, who breathes heavy.

                                 MAC
                        ... I jump grenade on Judge Judy 
                        and you don't even tap that ass?

                                 NATHAN
                        What could I do?  We barely started 
                        making out when all of a sudden 
                        she's got a car waiting downstairs.

           CLOSE ON Mac.  Hilary was right.

                                 MAC
                        Well, thanks for leaving me the T-
                        Rex with the Rage Virus.  She's why 
                        we don't hit on chicks over thirty.

           Mac ratchets up his running quality as two FEMALE JOGGERS 
           approach.  They pass and he lets out the belly, exhaling.

                                 NATHAN
                        Give her a break. Melanie said that 
                        she got dumped really bad and that 
                        she's having a rough time.

                                 MAC
                        So she got dumped.  Big deal.

                                 NATHAN
                        What, you can't identify?

           Mac glares at Nathan - this topic is off limits. They stop on 
           the Manhattan side of the bridge, cooling down, stretching.

                        I know I broke every rule, I 
                        just... thought she was very cool.

                        Not fucking you is cool now?  You

                        on, friend.  I'm sickened by this.

                        I thought she seemed cool is all.

           An awkward beat.  Mac runs in place.

                        You ready?

                                 NATHAN
                        I think I'm gonna keep going this 
                        way.  Go a little further.

                                 MAC
                        Suit yourself.  I'm heading back.

           Nathan takes off. Alone, Mac watches his buddy disappear into 
           Lower Manhattan, moving on. CLOSE ON Mac, contemplative.

           INT. BLUE STAR HMO - AFTERNOON - THREE WEEKS LATER

           A grey corporate office, full of suits, ties, and cubicles.

           INT. BLUE STAR HMO - MAC'S CUBICLE - SAME

           Mac, with an ample beard that betrays a THREE WEEK TIME-
           LAPSE, sits in front of two computers. His area is messy and 
           suggests he's the 'creative guy' in this corporate landscape.

           A pic of Mac and Nathan on a beach hangs on a bulletin board.  

           INSERT:  Mac's screen. He eBays for an old Charlie Daniels 
           Band shirt, gets the 'High Bid' message, and pumps his fist. 
           Mac's Blackberry rings and he sneers at the familiar number.

                                 MAC
                        There you are...  I know you've 
                        betrayed every best-friend decree I 
                        value but you can't return calls?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NATHAN (V.O.)
                        Sorry, Mac, I've just been working 
                        a ton and, uh, hanging with Mel...

                                 MAC
                        Hanging with Mel?  You've been 
                        living there for the last three 
                        weeks and we sure as shit haven't 
                        been out chasing chicks.

                                 NATHAN (V.O.)
                        You've got other friends, Mac.

                                 MAC
                        Not ones that roll like you and me.  
                        I need you.  I need some ass...

           A CO-WORKER hears this and eyes Mac strangely.  Mac leans 
           forward, as if to get privacy.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        Well, we're still on for Friday 
                        night, right?

                                 NATHAN (V.O.)
                        Shit... I forgot.  I'm going to 
                        Mel's parent's house in Montauk...

                                 MAC
                        What about me, huh?  We have a give-
                        and-take partnership here and...

           Mac eyes his boss, MR. EXLEY, fifties, grey-hair, approach.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        I...  I have to go.

           Mac clicks his phone off and looks up at Exley.

                                 MR. EXLEY
                        Danko...  When can I take a looksie 
                        at the new directory?

                                 MAC
                        How does right now sound?

           Mac minimizes his eBay page and taps away at the computer.  
           Mr. Exley points to the Nathan/Mac beach photo, smiling.

                                 MR. EXLEY
                        Now that the Old Lady has moved in 
                        with her Life Coach, I just might 
                        join you on your little pussy hunts.

           CONTINUED: (2)

           Exley does a few nauseating pelvic thrusts, cackling.  Mac 
           ignores him and types. His screen fills with a flashing 'Blue 
           Star' insignia and multi-colored options.  It looks awesome.

                                 MAC
                        I used a pastel color palette, 
                        Bauhaus design and Palantino font 
                        for a more contemporary feel...

                                 MR. EXLEY
                        Whoa...  Slow down, Picasso.  Who 
                        do you think we are, Napster?

           Exley winks at Mac proudly at his own hip reference.  

                                 MR. EXLEY (CONT'D)
                        We're an HMO.  Do something simple, 
                        straightforward...  not so fancy.

                                 MAC
                        You mean like this?

           Mac uploads the directory, in Helvetica, sans any creativity.

                                 MR. EXLEY
                        Bingo!

           Exley smacks Mac on the back.  CLOSE ON Mac, demoralized.  

           EXT. MAC'S OFFICE BUILDING - LATE FRIDAY AFTERNOON

           Among a throng of suits rushing home, Mac's on his cell.

                                 MAC
                        Hey, Timmy!  Been a dog's age...  I 
                        know this killer new band.  Let's 
                        grab some beers and...  Oh, AA?

           EXT. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS PROMENADE - A FEW EVENINGS LATER 

           Mac strolls and talks on the phone, trying to find a wingman.

                                 MAC
                        Hello?  Hey, it's Thursday night 
                        fuckface!  (smile fading)  Oh, 
                        sorry, bud, is your Daddy home?

           INT. MAC'S APARTMENT - A FEW EVENINGS LATER 

           The apartment's a disaster. In boxers, Mac's on the phone as 
           he opens up a UPS package:  The Charlie Daniels Band t-shirt.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        tonight, whattaya say?  (a beat, 
                        Mac listens) Mac Danko?  JFK High 
                        School?  What's the word, nerd...

           A click and a hang-up.  Mac looks at his phone.

           INT. DOWNTOWN CLUB - A FEW NIGHTS LATER

           Alone in the crowd, Mac loudly whistles and claps for the 
           band. Two VERY HOT GIRLS look back at him, then each other, 
           whispering, laughing.  Mac, self-conscious, heads to the bar.

           Mac watches as a YOUNG GUY AND HIS WING approach the VERY HOT 
           GIRLS and have them laughing in no time.  CLOSE ON Mac, down.

           INT. MAC & NATHAN'S BROWNSTONE FOYER - A FEW EVENINGS LATER

           Mac enters his pad, returning from work, looking weary, 
           until...  Bright light spills from upstairs, loud music 
           emanating. Mac laughs, joyous, and dashes up the stairs.

           INT. MAC & NATHAN'S DUPLEX - UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

           Mac emerges from the spiral staircase, excited.

                                 MAC
                        Where's my boy?! I knew you'd be 
                        back.  Just let me change my 
                        clothes and let's go get some...

           Mac sees Nathan's room and his jaw drops... Boxes everywhere, 
           walls stripped, computer equipment packed up.  Nathan appears 
           in his doorway, seeing Mac.  He clicks off the music.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        No.  This isn't what I think it is.

           Nathan just looks at Mac.  Yes, indeed.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        No!  Nathan, no!  You can't!  You 
                        barely know this chick!

                                 NATHAN
                        It's a little premature but Mel's 
                        roommate is moving and we'd get a 
                        place together eventually anyway.

           Mac kicks a DVD box across the room.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        doing?  This can't happen. Not now.

                                 NATHAN
                        Then when?

                                 MAC
                        Just... Not now, not ever!  It's a 
                        ruse, it's bullshit, relationships, 
                        and you're falling for it!

                                 NATHAN
                        Mac, I gotta be honest with you...  
                        I'm over it, this life, what we do, 
                        the wingman stuff. I just...  don't 
                        want to live like a kid anymore.

           Mac slides to the floor, agonized, anguished.

                                 NATHAN (CONT'D)
                        And you should think about doing 
                        it, too.  Settling down, you know?

                                 MAC
                        Been there, done that, blew my 
                        brains out...

           A beat.  Nathan pulls a bottle of bourbon and two glasses 
           from a box.  Mac exhales, a little calmer.  Nathan sits next 
           to him and pours two shots, handing one to Mac.  A beat.

                                 NATHAN
                        C'mon... Toast me.  I'm moving five 
                        stops away on the F-train.  No big 
                        deal.  And Mel and I are having a 
                        little get together on Tuesday.

                                 MAC
                        Tuesday?  What about Mets/Phils?

                                 NATHAN
                        You think I won't have the game on 
                        at Mel's, dude?  C'mon...

           Nathan holds up his shot.  Mac reluctantly follows.

                                 NATHAN (CONT'D)
                        There he is, that's my boy...

           INT. BLUE STAR HMO BREAK ROOM - MONDAY

           Tired, Mac drops a few Alka-Seltzers into his mug as ELI, a 
           twenty year-old hipster creative intern, enters frame, 
           grabbing a Red Bull from the refrigerator.

                                 ELI
                        Haven't heard any babe stories from

                        Um, yeah, yeah...  Everything's

                                 ELI
                        I hear that.  Hooked up with an 
                        entire FaceSpace network Saturday 
                        night.  I'm glad when Monday comes 
                        just to give me a break from all 
                        the betties hounding me. (Eli's 
                        phone beeps)  Oh, man... another.

           Eli chuckles nervously, not sounding very convincing.  Mac 
           watches Eli IM someone.  This hi-tech kid has it going on.

                                 MAC
                        Hey, we should hang sometime.  The

                        wall-to-wall... betties.

                        Yeah, and then drag them back to

           Exley hurries out as Eli offers Mac a pity shrug.

           INT. MEL AND NATHAN'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - TUESDAY EVE.

           On a big, awkward sofa with a Pabst, Mac's flanked by Nathan, 
           Melanie, Pregnant LILLY and TOM NOONAN on one side, and a 
           silver-haired DR. RICHARD, forty-five, and Hilary the other.

                                 HILARY
                        ... Mel is always saying she can't 
                        wait to get a cavity, just so she 
                        can go see her favorite dentist...

                        There's an oxy-moron for you.

           They chuckle.  Mac rolls his eyes at Hilary's weak banter and 
           turns up the TV volume.  He stuffs some chips in his mouth.

                                 DR. RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        Melanie mentioned you like to run

                        Definitely...  I like to rally at 
                        6:30 every Monday, Wednesday, and 
                        Friday mornings and 8 on Saturdays.

           A beat. Mac leans behind Hilary, gives Dr. Richards a look, 
           and mouths 'Yikes'. Hilary picks up her Blackberry, scanning.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        I could push back to 8:30 Saturday?

                                 MAC
                        Really playing it by ear over there.

           Mac mugs with Dr. Richard and they chuckle.  Hilary stares at 
           Mac with contempt for a beat, then back to Dr. Richard.

                                 HILARY
                        Better yet...  Why don't we just 
                        meet at The Bamboo Room?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DR. RICHARD
                        The Bamboo Room?  What's that?

           Mac freezes, slowly turning his head toward Hilary.  Hilary 
           sneaks a peak back at Mac, narrowing her eyes.

                                 HILARY
                        Oh, it's this great new place in 
                        Brooklyn Heights.  Mac here turned 
                        me on to it.  Right, Mac?  

           Mac reddens and stands.

                                 MAC
                        Anyone need a brew?  I'm up.

           Mac quickly shuffles out of frame.  Hilary smiles, satisfied.  

           INT. MELANIE AND NATHAN'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Mac scurries into the kitchen, and strides to the fridge. He 
           eyes an assortment of photos hanging on the door.

           MAC'S POV:  Photos of Nathan and Melanie at a bunch of 
           different locales.  The two beam, in love.  After a beat, Mac 
           notices pictures hidden underneath the visible ones.

           Mac flips through them, some old pictures of he and Nathan.  
           INSERT:  The same Nathan/Mac beach photo from Mac's office. 
           Mac stares at it for a beat, contemplative, and puts it back.

           INT. MEL AND NATHAN'S APARTMENT - LIVNG ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           By now, Hilary has the small party laughing pretty hard.

                                 HILARY
                        ... Palm leaves everywhere. And for 
                        that little touch of class... A giant 
                        Buddha head, filled with booze.

           More laughter, as Mac reenters the room, glaring at Hilary.

                                 TOM NOONAN
                        Is that what it takes to get girls 
                        these days? Turning a floor-through 
                        apartment into a Tiki Lounge?

                                 LILLY NOONAN
                        Is he... Are you having a hard time 
                        meeting someone, Mac?

                                 HILARY
                        Of course he is...

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LILLY NOONAN
                        Because a friend of mine, Felice?  
                        She's so nice, and so funny...

           Tom leans behind Lilly, giving Mac a serious head shake. 
           Felice is single for a reason. Nathan and Mel exchange looks.

                                 MELANIE
                        Everybody?  Nathan and I have an  
                        announcement...

           Nathan shuts the baseball game off.  Mac groans.

                                 NATHAN
                        Mel and I took a drive up to 
                        Woodstock yesterday, beautiful 
                        ride, and we stopped at Overlook...

                                 MELANIE
                             (excited, in one breath)
                        ... Mountain and that's when Nathan 
                        got down on one knee and...

           Mel holds up her hand to display her ENGAGEMENT RING.

                                 HILARY
                        OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!

           Hilary gives Mel a big hug.  The Noonan's join in.  Even Dr. 
           Richards gets into the spirit of it.  All save for Mac.

                                 MAC
                        Hey, I'm the one that first took 
                        you hiking there.  That's our spot.

           Mac shoots Hilary a 'stay out of this' look.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Wait, wait, wait...  You two have 
                        been dating, what, two months?

                                 NATHAN
                        Less than two months.  I know it's 
                        crazy.  I love that it's crazy.  
                        And I love you, Mel.

           Mel kisses Nathan hard.  Tom pops and pours champagne.

                                 MAC
                        Wait a second here, Nathan...  Are 
                        you out of your fucking mind?

           Silence.  The whole party glares at Mac in shock.  A beat.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Take it easy.  I'm just looking out 
                        for my best friend, that's all.  
                        Looking out for both of you...

                                 HILARY
                        Looking out for them, huh?

           Tom hands out the final glass and raises his high.

                                 TOM NOONAN
                        Everyone?  To Mel, Nathan, and a 
                        long, wonderful marriage.

           Everyone hoists their glass.  Mac, too, reluctantly.

                                 MAC
                             (muttering)
                        If you actually go through with it.

           Hilary sneers at Mac.  The congregation taps glasses.  Ding.

           INT. MARRIOTT MARQUIS CONVENTION ROOM - FRIDAY NIGHT

           An event room. Mac, bummed, picks through the buffet and 
           scans the room:  Mostly middle-aged biz-types in nametags. On 
           cue, a moussed-up, jet-black-haired Exley bounces over.

                                 MR. EXLEY
                        Save your appetite, Big Mac 
                        Attack...  There's a hottie buffet 
                        right behind you.  All you can eat.

           Mac turns to his boss-gone-wild.  Gonna be a long night.

                                 MR. EXLEY (CONT'D)
                        Already laid tracks with one lonely 
                        little bee ready to get busy.

           Exley physically turns Mac to look at his target:  A 
           depressed, lonely middle-aged BUSINESS WOMAN eating a sundae.

                                 MAC
                             (really creeped out)
                        Jesus... Um, you two kids have fun.

                                 MR. EXLEY
                        Whoa.  Wouldn't ditch my new 
                        wingie.  Boss man's talking 'sex 
                        sandwich' with all the fixin's.

           Exley takes away Mac's dinner plate.  A nauseated Mac chokes.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MR. EXLEY (CONT'D)
                        I booked a suite upstairs on 
                        company plastic.  All it'll cost 
                        you is sweat.

           Mac gulps, panicked.  He looks around desperately, 
           spotting... Hilary!  She's walking out of the party.

                                 MAC
                        Hey!  Hey!  Hilary!  Over here!

           Hilary turns around, sees Mac, and cringes.  Mac scurries 
           over to her, Exley following.  He looks back at Exley.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        Love to join you, but I already got 
                        this one in the bag.

           They reach Hilary.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        There you are.  I was looking all 
                        over for you.  Ready to go?

           Exley ogles Hilary, giggling.  He points to the LONELY WOMAN.

                                 MR. EXLEY
                        Beep me later.  The three of us can 
                        meet in my room for a night-cap.

           Hilary sees the woman, too, and looks at Mac disgustedly.  
           Mac literally pushes her out the door.

           EXT. GANSEVOORT HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           Bursting from the hotel, Hilary strides up 9th Avenue.  Mac 
           keeps pace, briskly walking to catch up.

                                 MAC
                        Holy shit, I owe you...  I can't 
                        believe you were at that thing.

                        Our firm does pro bono for them. 
                        And I'll consider saving that woman 
                        a lifetime of therapy my good deed.

                                 MAC
                        You actually think I'd go along 
                        with that?

                        man as we speak.

           They reach the Old Homestead Steak House.

                                 MAC
                        Man, you are so cranky. And women 
                        like you wonder why they're single.

           Incensed, Hilary spins on Mac to hit him but freezes, looking 
           through the Old Homestead window.  Mac cowers.  Hilary 
           continues to gaze through the window.  She whimpers.

           HILARY'S POV:  Meticulously dressed and gorgeous, AARON 
           ACKERMAN sits alone.  CLOSE ON Hilary, silent, longing.  Mac 
           steps closer to the window, staring.  He laughs, realizing.

                                 MAC
                        That's the guy? American Psycho in 
                        there? He's the one your panties 
                        are all in a bunch over? Oh, man...

           Mac continues laughing.  Hilary finally turns.

                                 HILARY
                        What's funny, huh?  You take 
                        pleasure in other people's hurt?

                                 MAC
                        What's funny is that women are all 
                        alike.  Overpay some decent looking 
                        guy and stuff him into a Brooks 
                        Brothers suit. That's all it takes.

           Hilary ignores him.  She looks around, fidgety, nervous.

                        Not quite sure what you are...

           A long beat, as Mac stares at Hilary intently.

                                 MAC
                        Relax a little.  Maybe undo the top 
                        two buttons there and let your 
                        Wonder Twins activate...

           Hilary looks at Mac with fire in her eyes.

                        Then we go get a table. You make 
                        like you're hitting the john, 
                        recognize him as you pass by and 
                        ask him to join us for a drink. He 
                        will.  No one eats alone when 
                        people they know are watching.  And 
                        I'll play the client who's secretly 
                        yearning to 'make messy' with you.

           Hilary cringes but Mac keeps going.

                        Then I order oysters, bottle of 
                        red, but I get an emergency call 
                        from my best bud who's in the ER 
                        and I insist on seeing him solo 
                        because it's some embarrassing 
                        groin injury and I apologize for 
                        ditching you.  Then you and John-
                        John there will be alone, tipsy, 
                        and sucking tongues by dessert.

           Hilary's stunned, impressed.  Mac smiles wide.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        Men come in many styles, but when 
                        it comes to women we're all working 
                        from the same playbook.

                                 HILARY
                        Wow.  That might be the least 
                        moronic thing you've ever said.

           Mac shrugs.  Hilary breathes deep and undoes her top buttons.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        All right...  Let's do this.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           Hilary heads to the restaurant door.  Mac stops her.

                                 MAC
                        What, you're gonna step onto the 
                        mound now with the same junk you 
                        threw at him last time?  When he 
                        dumped you?  Not a good idea.

           Hilary stands stoic.  An EXQUISITE BLONDE walks by and into 
           the restaurant.  Hilary watches Aaron chat with a WAITER.

                                 HILARY
                        I just don't know what happened 
                        with us.

                                 MAC
                        Every girl that gets dumped says 
                        that.  'What happened' is that he 
                        didn't want to date you anymore. 

           Hilary glares at Mac for a beat.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        No offense...  Just a fact.

                                 HILARY
                        How do you know all this?

                                 MAC
                        Why's water wet?  It just is.

           Hilary stares into the restaurant.  HILARY'S POV:  Aaron 
           stands and greets... The Exquisite Blonde.  They kiss.  Mac 
           follows Hilary's eye-line and chuckles.  

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Don't feel bad.  You can't compete 
                        with that. Not in your present state.

           Mac shrugs and checks the time on his iPhone.  

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Anyway...  Thanks again for the 
                        help back there.  See you around.

           Mac strides out of frame. Hilary watches him leave, then 
           turns her attention back to Aaron and the Exquisite Blonde, 
           whispering, kissing, flirting.  Hilary winces.  

           She looks around:  Couples everywhere, a palpable romantic 
           energy in the air.  CLOSE ON Hilary.  She's had enough.  She 
           looks off-screen.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Hey, Mac...!  Wait!

           She runs down the sidewalk, heels clacking, out of frame.

           INT. WEST VILLAGE CAFE - LATER 

           Only Mac and Hilary, tired, and a few others linger in this 
           hip, loungey cafe.  Mac ogles the PRETTY WAITRESS'S ass.

                                 HILARY
                        ... We were talking about getting 
                        married...  Then out of nowhere he 
                        said he needed time to get his head 
                        straight before he could take our 
                        relationship to the next level.

           Mac nods knowingly.

                                 MAC
                        That excuse is like government 
                        issued to every born male... They 
                        should staple it onto birth 
                        certificates.

                                 HILARY
                        So you think I can't compete with 
                        girls like that blonde?  

                                 MAC
                        You can compete on an aesthetic 
                        level.  I mean, aside from a few 
                        easy fixes you're pretty hot.

                                 HILARY
                        What fixes?

           Mac turns Hilary around to the window, her reflection:  
           Severe, hair back, collared suit, furrowed brow...

                                 MAC
                        See?  A little severe but that's 
                        the least of it...  There's a 
                        perfect shit-storm going on here.     

           Hilary rolls her eyes, dubious.

                                 HILARY
                        Humor me.

                                 MAC
                        You don't have the tools. You're 
                        rattled, you're scared...

                        a figure skater who falls during her 
                        routine.  Then she falls again, and 
                        again, and again...

                                 HILARY
                             (interrupting)
                        I get it.

                                 MAC
                        You need to hone your skills, go on 
                        dates, find some guys, learn how 
                        they think...  Find out what you're 
                        missing.  Then you can compete with 
                        girls like that blonde.

           A beat.  Hilary exhales heavy, exhausted.  The Pretty 
           Waitress arrives at their table.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Hey, what time do you shut this 
                        joint down?  There's a great bar a 
                        block away. Two for one body shots 
                        and the best karaoke book in town.  
                        Lemme guess, you're an alto?

           The waitress stares at Mac like he's from another planet.

                                 HILARY
                        Sorry...  See, we're looking for a 
                        place to have a private party and my 
                        cousin Mac here is just describing 
                        one of the dives down the street.

                                 PRETTY WAITRESS
                        The Red Room on Waverly is a pretty 
                        cool place to have it.

                                 HILARY
                        Yeah? Mac's throwing a surprise 
                        anniversary party for his parents.

           Waitress smiles at Mac.

                                 PRETTY WAITRESS
                        That's really cool of you...

                                 HILARY
                        He's always doing stuff like that.

           Mac just shrugs, smiling.  Waitress scribbles out the check.

           Hilary and Mac watch the waitress walk out of frame.

                                 HILARY
                        You have the tact of a viking.

                                 MAC
                        Well, what good did your stupid 
                        little story do?  She walked away.

           Hilary flips over the check:  MARGO 212-938-3948.  Mac is 
           speechless.  Hilary stands and grabs her jacket.

                                 HILARY
                        It's been memorable...  At the very 
                        least I'll have some material for 
                        my shrink tomorrow.

           Mac nods his head, still stunned.  Hilary turns to leave.

                                 MAC
                        Wait.

                        I don't think that's possible.

                                 MAC
                        The two of us lost our wing people.  
                        But if we worked together...

                        I can do it myself, thank you.

                                 MAC
                        You've already done it yourself and 
                        failed miserably.  You could do a 
                        lot worse.  You already are.

           CLOSE ON Hilary.  A beat.  She hears this.

                                 HILARY
                        What exactly are you suggesting?

                        get you your dream dude, an all new 
                        Aaron.

           Mac puts his hand out.  A long beat as Hilary wrestles with 
           this.  Then... She clasps Mac's hand.  They shake.  It's on.

           INT. MEL AND NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Nathan and Melanie roll around, making out on a bed 
           absolutely covered with wedding magazines and fabric 
           swatches.  Nathan's cell rings.

                        Sure, sure...  I won't say a word.

           Mac and Nathan hang up.  Nathan exits the walk-in closet.

           INT. MANHATTAN LAW OFFICE CORRIDOR - SAME DAY

           Hilary walks out of the commissary.  Another Saturday at the 
           office.  She answers her ringing Blackberry.

                        Are you out of your mind?

                        Well, do you have better ideas?

                        right about one thing... Aaron 
                        already gave me the ax, as is.

                        You're in flux, Hil. You've got

                        Oh, is that all?

                        Hold on...  (call waiting)  Hello?

                                 MAC (V.O.)
                        Project Fuck Buddy is in full 
                        effect, boyeeee!!!!

           Hilary cringes.

                                 HILARY
                        I'll call you back.

           Hilary clicks back to Melanie.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        Okay, you're right.  I'll tell him 
                        it's off.

                                 MELANIE (V.O.)
                        Thank God.  Bye.

           Hilary strides to her office, punching in Mac's number.  She 
           turns a corner and runs smack into, BETH, forties. Hil's 
           Blackberry falls to the ground.  Beth's papers everywhere.

                                 BETH
                        I'm sorry, Hilary...

                                 HILARY
                        You would think the hallways would 
                        be safe on a Saturday morning.

           The two chuckle as they pick up their stuff.

                                 BETH
                        And seeing you're doing weekend 
                        hours as an Associate...

                                 HILARY
                        I just... needed time to catch up.

                                 BETH
                        See, that's the trap.  You never 
                        catch up.  Trust me, I know.

           Hilary smiles, a little awkward.

                                 BETH (CONT'D)
                        Wait til you make partner.  And 
                        congratulations by the way... I'm 
                        told it's a sure thing.

           As Beth reaches for a document Hilary sneaks a peak at Beth's 
           hands.  INSERT:  Beth's ring finger.  Bare.

           They stand.  Hilary grabs her phone and looks at it.  INSERT:  
           Mac's number is still highlighted.  

                                 BETH (CONT'D)
                        Well... Have a good weekend.

           Hilary smiles and Beth strides down the hall.  CLOSE ON 
           Hilary, contemplative, watching Beth.  After a beat she 
           presses 'SEND' on her Blackberry, holding it to her ear.

                                 HILARY
                        I'll see you tonight. Nine o'clock.

           INT. JAKE'S DILEMMA - UPPER WEST SIDE BAR - SATURDAY NIGHT

           A semi-rowdy dive with a lot of young jackasses.  Mac stands  
           at a Doom arcade game.  Hilary enters, overdressed.  She 
           spots Mac, who tosses some lucky dude the game gun. 

                                 MAC
                        Thought you weren't gonna show.

           Hilary makes room for two TWENTY YEAR-OLD girls pushing by.  
           Mac checks out their asses.

                                 HILARY
                        I didn't agree to help you pick up 
                        girls born in the 90's. Sorry, pal.

           Hilary starts to walk away.  Mac stops her.

                                 MAC
                        We're not here for me, counselor.  
                        Ladies first.

                                 HILARY
                        You're not serious.  I wouldn't go 
                        to places like this in high school.

                                 MAC
                        Quit bitching and go grab yourself 
                        a drink.  Then we get started.

           Hilary elbows her way to the packed bar. Mac watches as she 
           tries to flag the BARTENDER down with her AmEx card.  He 
           ignores her to serve young girls with less clothing.

                                 HILARY
                        Excuse me? Hello? I was before her.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           He ignores her.  Hilary bangs a peanut dish on the bar.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        HEY! Is there a sign that says my 
                        underwear needs to be sticking out 
                        of my pants to get a drink?!

           The Bartender and a row of kids turn and stare at Hilary.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        Thank you.  Now, can you please 
                        make me an Apple Pucker Sweetini?  
                        All I know is that it's green and 
                        has a coconut after-taste.

           The bartender cracks open a recipe book.  Mac joins Hilary.

                                 MAC
                        You just got your first 'F'.

                                 HILARY
                        For what?  Asserting myself?

           Hilary reflexively checks her email.  A beat.

                                 MAC
                        Is Melanie hotter than you?

                                 HILARY
                        I don't... What kind of question is 
                        that?

                                 MAC
                        Fuck no.  You got a tight little 
                        rig, classic cheekbones, bee-stung 
                        lips. Way hotter. So why did Nathan 
                        and I go after Melanie that night?

           After a beat Hilary throws her hands up, stumped.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        Her vacancy sign was on.  Your's 
                        was off.  You might as well be 
                        wearing a sign that says No Entry.

           Hilary scowls.  Mac snaps an iPhone photo of her. 

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        Meet your 'bitch face.'

                                 HILARY
                        I do that with my nose?

                        That puss may have taken you from 
                        associate to partner but you think 
                        men want to look at that?

           Hilary stares at her own image.  Mac claps his hands.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        Let's not go all negative.  I want 
                        you to go pick up a guy.

                                 HILARY
                        You want what?  Are you crazy?

                                 MAC
                        You don't have to bring him home.  
                        I just want to see you in action, 
                        see what we're working with.

           Hilary looks around.  Mac points at some muscular Bridge & 
           Tunnel GUY wearing a crimped baseball cap.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        How about 98 Degrees over there?

                                 HILARY
                        The guy at the popcorn machine?  He 
                        looks like he's fifteen.

                                 MAC
                        No way.  Tight security here.

           Mac points to the DOOR GUY who makes out with a girl as kids 
           just stroll right in.  Hilary shrugs and downs her Sweetini.

                                 HILARY
                        What the hell.  I'll do it.

           Hilary awkwardly pushes through the crowd, sidling up to the 
           GUY.  She looks back at Mac who gives her a thumbs-up.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        Um, hey there.  Free popcorn.  
                        Sweet, right?

           The guy doesn't turn around, rolling eyes at his pal.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        Yeah, it's cool... Hi, I'm Hilary.

           The GUY finally looks at Hilary and freezes, eyes wide.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                             (blushing)
                        I doubt it.  I mean, I work out at 
                        Equinox, so maybe...

                                 GUY
                        No, I have.  It's coming to me, 
                        it's coming to me...

           The guy looks her up and down, smiles and snaps, realizing.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        MILF Hunter!  Holy shit, that's 
                        where I know you from.

                        The MILF Hunter got you! Oh, man...

                        Is that some kind of drinking game?

           The Guy stands tall, calling out.

                                 GUY
                        Hey, Tommy! Tommy! Nicky!  Check it 
                        out!  MILF Hunter chick over here!

           A throng of admiring young men encircling Hilary.  After a 
           beat, Mac pushes his way through and grabs her.

                                 MAC
                        Alright, okay...  Time to go.

           Mac pulls Hilary toward the door, hastily.

                                 HILARY
                        What's... What's a MILF Hunter?

                                 MAC
                        Nothing you would approve of...

           Mac and Hilary exit the bar.
           INT. HIP CHELSEA CLUB - LATER

           Hilary, mopey, and Mac, sit at a banquette. Beautiful girls 
           stride by.  Hilary looks up from her Blackberry.

                                 HILARY
                        Am I supposed to sit here with you 
                        just to signal to other women that 
                        you're not some disgusting psycho?

                                 MAC
                        You're supposed to be helping me 
                        like I helped you. Not my fault you 
                        look like some internet porn star.

           More GIRLS pass, all styles of hot, and all ignoring Mac.

                        Well, look at you.  The way you 
                        dress.  You're telling the world 
                        that you don't take yourself 
                        seriously so why should they?

           Mac looks down at his Charlie Daniels Band shirt, proudly.

                                 MAC
                        That's an asset.  I'm loose and 
                        happy-go-lucky. I go with the flow.

                                 HILARY
                        Not taking yourself seriously is 
                        only an asset directly proportional 
                        to whether or not you have anything 
                        to actually take seriously.

           Two BEAUTIFUL BLONDES walk by Mac like he's a parking meter.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        See? You're cutesy-cutesy, man-child 
                        act might play at the ESPN Fun Zone 
                        but it won't with girls like that.

           Mac shrugs, dismissive.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        And, you're not good looking enough 
                        for it to not matter.  Like him...

           Hilary points across the room to a hipster, JUDE LAW-TYPE GUY 
           in a t-shirt and jeans.  Mac looks a little self-conscious.

                        You... exist, that's what.  Men are 
                        a joke.  At the end of the day it 
                        comes down to one thing.  Looks.

                                 MAC
                        What about you?  You're hot and 
                        totally single.  Anyway you cut it 
                        you have to be the complete package.

                                 HILARY
                        And what about me isn't the 
                        complete package?

                                 MAC
                        That's what we're gonna find out.  
                        But I promise you, guys like Aaron 
                        want the complete package. And 
                        somewhere, somehow... you don't cut 
                        it.

           Ouch.  Hilary glares at Mac, hurt.

                                 HILARY
                        You are a true asshole.

           Hilary throws her stuff in her bag and storms out of frame.  
           After a beat she reenters frame, strides past Mac, over to 
           the Gorgeous Asian Girl, and begins talking to her.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           After a beat Hilary walks by Mac, not breaking stride.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        Her name's Paula. Your piece of ass 
                        for the evening.  Have a nice life.

           Hilary exits.  Mac looks at the Asian Girl motioning for him 
           to join her.  CLOSE ON Mac, confused but not at all unhappy.

           INT. MID-TOWN REHEARSAL SPACE - WEEK DAY

           A STRING QUARTET finishes Sonatina. Melanie claps politely as 
           the quartet bows.  Hilary busily returns emails.

                                 MELANIE
                             (to the musicians)
                        Thank you very much for coming.  
                        We'll be in touch.

           The Quartet exits.  Melanie looks at Hilary, typing away on 
           her Blackberry.

                                 MELANIE (CONT’D)
                        Hil, I need more enthusiasm from you.  
                        It's the Maid Of Honor's job to pretend 
                        she cares just as much as the bride.

           Hilary realizes.

                                 HILARY
                        Aww.  I'm Maid Of Honor?  Really?

           Hilary hugs Melanie.

                                 HILARY (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, Mel...  And dare I ask 
                        who the Best Man is?

                                 MELANIE
                        Nathan and I are in negotiations.

           Hilary eyes the ID of an incoming call:  Mac. She ignores it.

                                 HILARY
                        You believe this guy?  God, what a 
                        desperate mistake on my part.

                                 MELANIE
                        What did you expect would happen?

                        to do something.  Action begets 
                        action.  So says my shrink.

                                 MELANIE
                        And what does she say about Aaron 
                        and your inability to move on?

                                 HILARY
                        Nothing I find very supportive.

           A beat, as Hilary contemplates.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        Mac did say something that I can't 
                        get out of my head, though. He said 
                        that men like Aaron won't settle 
                        for anything less than the complete 
                        package, and that I don't cut the 
                        mustard.

           Melanie waves the notion away, dismissive.

                                 MELANIE
                        Mac's a moron.

                                 HILARY
                        I know.  But do you think that's 
                        true?  I mean, the stuff Aaron said 
                        about having to get his head 
                        straight before he could take our 
                        relationship to the next level?  
                        Mac says that's all bullshit.

                                 MELANIE
                        It is bullshit, but... it's bullshit 
                        we have to accept.  Like when people 
                        say that you have an "open invite" to 
                        drop by their country house.  They 
                        don't mean it and nobody actually 
                        does it. It's just something you say.

                                 HILARY
                        So you think Mac is right. 

                                 MELANIE
                        I think Aaron's a jerk for letting 
                        you go and that you were too good 
                        for him.  Onward...

                        something happen with...  someone.

                                 MELANIE
                        And if you don't?

                                 HILARY
                        I take the partnership, get rich, 
                        adopt an Angelina kid and just have 
                        an endless rotation of young, hot 
                        studs to play with until I'm too 
                        old to care.  Then die.

                                 MELANIE
                        God, that sounds depressing.  What 
                        about the Internet?

                                 HILARY
                        Online dating?  Jesus, Mel, welcome 
                        to the nineties.

           Hilary bites into a sandwich, exasperated, at a loss.

           EXT. HUGE CORPORATE BUILDING - MIDTOWN - A LITTLE LATER

           A huge public fountain bursts as a throng of suits file in 
           and out of the building.  Hilary powerwalks through the pack.

                                 MAC (O.S.)
                        Hilary!  Hey, Hilary!

           Hilary pretends not to hear.  Mac weaves his way through the 
           crowd, standing out amongst the conservative attorneys.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        Hilary... Wait!

           Mac gently jostles her off to the side, near the fountain.

                                 HILARY
                        What do you think you're doing?!

                        You were fantastic Saturday night.  
                        I owe you big time.

           Fred Mortimer walks by, overhearing this.  Hilary smacks Mac.

                                 HILARY
                        That was a partner, for Christ

                        girl who was looking to hook up.  

           Hilary makes a move to leave.  Mac stops her.

                        But you held up your end and I let 
                        you down with that dive bar. 

           Hilary exhales.  She laughs to herself at the absurdity.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        I think I've never heard you laugh.

                        Look... Let's just forget this

                        some of our dignity still intact.

                        One last shot.  You pick the place 
                        and I guarantee results this time.

           Hilary mouths 'No' and heads toward the building entrance.  
           We watch Hilary merge into the steady flow of lawyers and 
           execs.  After a beat she stops, turning toward Mac.

           QUICK TO Mac, watching Hilary turn toward him.  He smiles.

           CLOSE ON Hilary.

           INT. WHISKEY BLUE BAR/W HOTEL - LATER - EVENING

           Hilary and Mac share a table at this more upscale bar 
           bustling with hip professionals. Mac eyes the joint.

           Mac excuses himself and approaches the bar, pacing the length

                                 MAC
                        Go over, order a Bud bottle - no 
                        glass - and smile like there's 
                        nothing you'd rather be doing.

                                 HILARY
                        And then?

                                 MAC
                        And nothing. Any guy worth his salt 
                        who receives a woman's smile will 
                        initiate contact within 60 seconds 
                        or be kicking himself all night.

           Hilary doesn't look particularly convinced.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        Trust me.

           INT. WHISKEY BLUE BAR/W HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Hilary pushes her way up to the bar. Mac's guy, SEAN, glances 
           over as Hilary flags down the bartender with a winning smile.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Bud, bottle.  No glass.  Thanks.

           Hilary catches Sean looking and gives him a polite smile.

                                 SEAN
                        King of Beers, huh?

           Hilary glances back at Mac who gives a big thumbs up.

                                 HILARY
                        Uh, Yeah, yeah...  Old Reliable.

                                 SEAN
                        I assume you're from out of town.

                                 HILARY
                        Nope.  Big Apple, born and raised.  
                        In Chelsea now.

                                 SEAN
                        Yeah?  Me too.

                                 HILARY
                        Just moved there, actually.

                                 SEAN
                        Well, you're a welcome addition to 
                        the neighborhood.  I'm Sean.

           Mac creeps in behind Sean for support.

                                 HILARY
                        Hilary.

                        Can you believe the new Equinox on 
                        23rd?  It's like the Pentagon of 
                        gyms.  Four hundred bucks a month 
                        and a six month waiting list...

                                 HILARY
                        Guess I joined at the right time.

                                 SEAN
                        I'll think of you as I'm walking 
                        ten blocks to the Y every night.

                                 HILARY
                        Actually... I get a certain amount 
                        of guest passes.  If you...

           CONTINUED: (2)

           Panicked, Mac bumps Sean from behind.  Sean pitches forward, 
           spilling beer on Hilary.  Mac slips out before he's seen.

           EXT. LEXINGTON AVENUE - A LITTLE LATER

           Mac stuffs half of a hotdog into his mouth when Hilary 
           appears, her blouse sopping wet.  Mac offers her a bite. 
           Hilary smacks the hotdog out of his hand, angry.

                                 HILARY

                        Flirt, tease, but never, ever under 
                        any circumstances, ask a guy out.

                                 HILARY
                        They were just free gym passes.

                                 MAC
                        Gym passes, first-class plane 
                        tickets to Hedonism II... It all 
                        sends the same signal to us.

           Mac waits for a beat.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        So...?

           Hilary slowly breaks into a smile.

                                 HILARY
                        It worked!  He gave me his number.

           Hilary takes out Sean's business card.

                                 MAC
                        Fantastic!

           Mac takes the card from her... and rips it into confetti.

                                 HILARY
                        What are you doing?!

                                 MAC
                        Let him call you.

           Hilary tries to pick up the tiny pieces of paper.

                                 HILARY
                        I didn't give him my number, moron!

                                 HILARY
                        But what if he can't?

                        Then he ain't much of a catch, is he?

           Mac dashes across the street, hailing a cab.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        You'll hear from our boy by end of

           CLOSE ON Hilary, a reluctant smile.

           INT. HILARY'S OFFICE - FOLLOWING AFTERNOON - FRIDAY

           Hilary at her desk. She glances at her desktop clock:  INSERT 
           CLOCK: 6:00 PM.  Hilary exhales, disappointed, muttering.

                                 HILARY
                        Idiot.

           Mac, palpably excited, sits at a table with his laptop and a 
           a gaggle of other MALE WORKERS standing behind him.  An open 
           'Hot Places To Go' issue of Time Out sits next to his laptop.

           The guys 'ooh' and 'ahh'.  Mac picks up his iPhone.

           Hilary clicks her headset on and picks up Mac.

                        You sure he didn't call?

           Knock, knock. Hilary's assistant walks in with a huge bouquet 
           of flowers.  He sets them on Hilary's desk and tip-toes out.  
           Mac babbles on in the background. Hil quickly opens the card.

           INT. SCHWARTZ ATHLETIC CENTER - BROOKLYN - NIGHT

           Loud music blares as young, hot, tightly-uniformed ROLLER 
           DERBY GIRLS skate and slam into each other.  The crowd of 
           hipsters and blue-collars scream mightily.

                                 MAC (O.S.)
                        That's it, Marlene! Great recovery!

           Camera finds Mac - on his feet - and a none-too-thrilled 
           Hilary in the stands, not very far from the action.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        I kid you not.  These chicks are 
                        cheerleaders, strippers, gymnasts, 
                        and figure skaters all in one.

           A deceptively cute girl rides up on an opposing player and 
           slams her head into the railing, right in front of Hilary.

                        act like you and it sets me apart 
                        from all these shitbags...

           Two SHITBAG GUYS glare over at Mac with offense.

                        Plus... They only take couples.

           Before a puzzled Hilary can respond a buzzer stops the round 
           and a REFEREE grabs the microphone.

           Mac smiles devilishly. CLOSE ON Hil, no idea what's going on.

           INT. ROLLER DERBY TRACK - A LITTLE LATER

           Mac and Hilary are outfitted, pads, skates... Mac smiles at 
           his team, the BROOKLYN BOMBSHELLS - specifically Marlene 
           Speedrich.  Hilary nervously tests out her protective pads.

                        Relax. Nobody really gets hurt. 
                        It's like wrestling, but with tits.

           Hilary's team, the MANHATTAN MAULERS, sneer at her.  The 
           BOMBSHELLS theatrically crack their knuckles and line up.

                        being body slammed.

           Mac fastens his helmet and smacks Hil on the ass.

                        And stay out of my way. This is 
                        about making me look good for her.

           Mac points at Marlene Speedrich.  The ref whistles.  It's on.
           INT. ROLLER DERBY TRACK - A LITTLE LATER

           Mac and Hilary skate at the back of their packs. Hilary 
           drifts forward until she's blocked by two BOMBSHELLS.

                                 BOMBSHELL
                        Don't even try, McBeal.  Just run 
                        out the clock and I'll make sure 
                        you don't break a nail.

           The BOMBSHELLS cackle and take off. CLOSE ON Hilary, glaring.

           Meanwhile, Mac is happily man-handled by his teammates.

                        Don't hold back.  I'm not ticklish.

           The Bombers hurl him to the front of the pack, where he 
           skates beside Marlene Speedrich.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        Let's find a little nook later 
                        where you can buy me a drink.

           Marlene breaks through a couple blocking opponents, making 
           way for Mac to skate past.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        And don't worry about the brunette.  
                        An old friend with a puppy crush...

           One of the Mayhem's skate at Mac, swinging a metal chair.  
           Marlene smashes the girl in the face, saving Mac.

                                 MARLENE SPEEDRICH
                        Just play the game, douchebag.

           Marlene skates away.

                        Coming through, losers!!

           Mac glances back, his eyes wide, as Hilary burst from the 
           pack like a freight train and gains ground on him.  Hilary 
           fakes out one Bombshell then deftly spins to avoid two more.

           Mac can't believe his eyes as Hilary motors on, executing an 
           awesome pivot to avoid Marlene, who crashes into the crowd.  
           She catches up to Mac, who's speechless.  Hilary just shrugs.

                        poster on my wall.

           On that, Hilary grabs Mac and swings him into the rail and he 
           sprawls across the track.  Mac cowers as the rest of the 
           girls buzz past him, inches from smashing into him.

           Hilary takes the lead, smiling wide, enjoying herself.  She 
           crosses the finish line, arms raised, victorious.

           EXT. SCHWARTZ ATHLETIC CENTER - BROOKLYN - LATER

           Mac paces in front of the arena's side door.  After a beat, 
           Hilary exits, carrying with her a big trophy.

                                 ROLLER GIRLS (O.S.)
                        Later, Hilary!/ Call Me!/ Nice work!

           Beaming, Hilary lets the door shut as Mac rushes over.

                                 MAC
                        What the hell?  You were supposed 
                        to bring me back to Marlene!

                                 HILARY
                        Her real name is Cameron and she's 
                        studying for her LSAT's.  I'm 
                        writing her a recommendation.

                                 MAC
                        For Christ's sake... At least you 
                        got her phone number for me, right?

           Hilary ignores Mac and walks on.  Mac eyes his watch, fuming.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        Well...  We can still make last 
                        call somewhere. You owe me tonight.

                                 HILARY
                        I'm going home, big guy.  I've got 
                        three depositions in addition to my 
                        regular load, plus my date with Sean.

                                 MAC
                        Your date!  Exactly!  Aren't you 
                        forgetting a little something?

                                 HILARY
                        I agreed to help you meet women. 
                        Not be your booze buddy.

                        This is bullshit.  One date and 
                        you're lawyering me out of my turn.

                                 HILARY
                        Good night, Mac.

           Hilary strides out of frame.  CLOSE ON Mac, exasperated.

           EXT. HUDSON RIVER - SATURDAY

           Manhattan's stunning skyline soars over the river, as Mac and 
           Nathan kayak into frame, side by side, paddling amateurishly.

                                 MAC
                        The point is that she's supposed to 
                        be helping me.  I can not get laid 
                        on my own, thank you very much...

                                 NATHAN
                        You know what I think?  I think you 
                        have a little thing for her.

           Mac looks at Nathan like he's crazy and makes the universal 
           game show sound for wrong answer.  Mac's iPhone rings.  

                                 MAC
                             (cringing)
                        That waitress...  No way.

           Mac hits 'Ignore' and puts the phone in his shirt pocket.

                                 NATHAN
                        Well now you have to call her back.  
                        You could of just talked to her.

                                 MAC
                        But I know when she can't answer 
                        her phone so I'll call then.

           Nathan shakes his head at this rationale.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        That reminds me...  Paula teaches 
                        class now.  I'll leave her a 
                        message, tell her I can't hang out.

           Mac does and then exhales heavy, stressed.  Nathan chuckles.

                                 NATHAN
                        You're a basketcase.  Juggling 
                        girls, leaving voicemails, making 
                        plans, breaking plans...

                                 NATHAN
                        Maybe you should give one of these 
                        girls a chance, you know? Try to get 
                        to know them and build something.

                                 MAC
                        Who are you, Dr. Bill Cosby all of 
                        a sudden?  You were doing the same 
                        thing I am, what, two months ago?

                                 NATHAN
                        Well... I don't miss it.

                                 MAC
                        You don't miss what, getting ass?  
                        I need tail.  It's just who I am.

                                 NATHAN
                        And how many of these girls have 
                        you had actual sex with?

           Mac shrugs, dismissive.

                                 NATHAN (CONT'D)
                        See?  The single life is an 
                        illusion.  I've had sex twice today 
                        and it isn't even noon yet.

                                 MAC
                        You think you're gonna be saying 
                        that a year from now?  You're about 
                        to find out the hard way, pal...

           Nathan bristles a little but bites his tongue. 

                                 NATHAN
                        I don't know...  Mel feels right to 
                        me.  The whole thing.  I feel like 
                        I'm settled but not... settling.  I 
                        just don't feel like I'm missing 
                        out on anything when I'm with her.

                                 MAC
                        Well you know what my father says?  
                        "Never marry. Just find a woman you 
                        don't like and buy her a house".

                                 NATHAN
                        That's because he pays alimony to 
                        three different women.

           A small yacht buzzes by Mac and Nathan, creating a huge wake 
           that rocks their kayaks.  Mac holds on tight, scared.

                                 MAC
                        Look, you getting hitched isn't a 
                        complete disaster, okay?  I'm still 
                        the Best Man and I'm still going to 
                        throw you the sickest Bach-Bash 
                        anyone's ever seen, right?

           CLOSE ON Nathan, uncomfortable.

           INT. EQUINOX YOGA STUDIO - NEXT MORNING

           Hilary sits amidst a gaggle of twenty and thirty-something 
           WOMEN and a few MEN, all sitting indian-style on yoga mats.  
           A YOGA INSTRUCTOR does one of those chant/ohm things.

           Hil peeks up at the clock: 7:15. She rolls her eyes, irked.

                                 YOGA INSTRUCTOR
                        Okay, let's go into a Crow Pose.

           The class goes into a sort of handstand, putting their knees 
           on their elbows and balancing, legs in the air.  Not easy. 
           Mac enters, in sweatpants and an Allman Brothers shirt.  The 
           door closes loudly behind him.  People topple over, startled.

                                 MAC
                             (loud, to the room)
                        Studio 2, right?

           Hilary hustles over to Mac and pulls him aside, accidentally 
           knocking his Starbucks onto the floor, spilling everywhere.  
           Mac reaches for it and a muffin plops onto the floor as well.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        This starts at 7 on the nose?

                             (angry whisper)
                        That's what 'Starts at 7' means.  

           Mac eyes the class.

                                 MAC
                        I get it.  Hot women abound, and...

           Mac motions to an obviously GAY MAN and does a floppy-wrist.

                        coming here and that he's a great 
                        catch and pretty cute and all that.

                        kicking it up a notch here for you.

                        No, I don't. Now go sit over there.

           Mac mouths a sarcastic 'Thank you', and heads over to Ingrid.

           EXT. EQUINOX GYM - LATER

           Hilary and Ingrid stand on the sidewalk, drinking water, with 
           the requisite rolled up yoga mat appendage on their backs.

           Mac enters frame, holding his ass like a child who had an 
           accident.  Hilary shrugs at Ingrid, sheepishly.

           INT. BLUE STAR HMO - MAC'S CUBICLE - MONDAY MORNING

           Mac, iPod blaring, sits at his computer, focused in a way we 
           haven't seen before. INSERT:  Mac's screen, where he finishes 
           the final touches of a t-shirt design for a local rock band.

           He smiles, satisfied, as Eli enters frame, coffee in hand.

                        back for seconds on Sunday.

           Eli puts his fist out for a celebratory bump.  Mac complies.

                                 ELI (CONT'D)
                        How about you?  How many bare 
                        breasts did you see this weekend?

                                 MAC
                        Um... None.  No breasts.

                        Bummer, man.  Crap weekend, huh?

           Mac thinks about this, then smiles.

           Eli laughs as if Mac's joking.  Mac clacks at his keyboard, 
           then looks over his shoulder to see if the coast is clear.

           Eli checks out the spread.  A Mac designed shirt, album 
           cover, and logo for a New York City punk band.

                        Fellas, fellas, fellas...

           Mac clicks out of his project as Exley - his hair midnight 
           black - strides into their cubicle.  NOTE:  Exley is 
           inexplicably lisping all of his S's.

                                 MR. EXLEY (CONT'D)

           Mr. Exley attempts awkward high-fives with Mac and Eli, who 
           have mercy on him and slap his hand.

                                 MAC

           Mr. Exley sticks out his tongue.  INSERT:  CLOSE ON Exley's 
           tongue, badly pierced and possibly infected. Mac and Eli gag.

                        meeting a friend.

           Exley slithers his tongue a little and winks.

                                 MR. EXLEY
                        Oh, I get it.  Afternoon delight.

           Mr. Exley slaps Mac on the back, laughs, and exits frame.  

           EXT. BRYANT PARK - LUNCH

           Bright, beautiful afternoon, hundreds of fashionable 
           Manhattanite white-collars sit around the park at tables, 
           having lunch, reading, checking each other out.

           Hilary buries her nose in depositions, nursing a sandwich, as 
           Melanie plays with her laptop and a salad.  Mel laughs loud.

                                 MELANIE
                        Oh, man...  Check this guy out.  Says 
                        he's five foot-eight and he has a 
                        funky hat on in every picture.

                                 HILARY
                        So?

                                 MELANIE
                        So it means he's five-two and bald.

                                 HILARY
                        I said I'm not doing that.   Ten 
                        years ago it was a novelty - early 
                        twenties, instant gratification.  
                        Now those sites are just self-
                        contained incubators of STD's.

           Melanie drops her fork, disgusted.

                                 MAC (O.S.)
                        Sorry, sorry... I tried to get up 
                        here as fast as...

           Mac arrives, Wendy's bag in hand, planting himself at their 
           table. He pulls out a Baconator and peers at Mel's screen.

                        No age.  What does it mean when the

                                 MELANIE
                        It means she's betting the barn 
                        that she looks younger than she is.

           Mac snickers at this.  Hilary checks the time, antsy.

                                 HILARY
                        Can we just do this please?

                        Okay, so... I made eight o'clock 
                        reservations at Lure - Mel got us a 
                        table.  We'll have after-dinner 
                        espressos at The Mercer, across the 
                        street. Then we have the option to 
                        walk to the jazz club a few blocks 
                        east for the ten-thirty set...

                        I left some room for spontaneity.

           Mac laughs, giving Mel a 'You believe this chick?' look.

                        even think about sending dinner back.

           Mel drops her fork again, disgusted. Hilary titters as Mac 
           makes like he's going to snap a photo of her with his iPhone.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)

                        I'm helping you here.  'Low-

                        Mel?  How does this all sound?

                        Slightly more impressive than I 
                        would have thought.

           Mac winks at Mel.  Hilary retrieves a yellow notepad.

                        Now for your date... The low-

           Engagement party.  Camera pans the party.  On the WASP-ier 
           side.  Lot's of wine, not a lot of food.  Melanie and Nathan, 
           beaming, go from person to person, hugging, laughing, etc.

           Guests mill about, talking, laughing... We catch up to Mac

                                 NATHAN (CONT'D)
                        I'm serious.  You two are both so 
                        bad at dating that you don't even 
                        realize you're dating each other.

           Mac laughs and slugs some beer.

                                 MAC
                        What, because we go to bars 
                        together, restaurants?  It's only 
                        because we're...

                                 NATHAN
                        Dating.  That's what constitutes 
                        dating for people on Planet Earth.  
                        You two talk on the phone, text, 
                        emails... everyday.  That's dating.

                                 MAC
                        We don't have sex. That's dating...

           CONTINUED:

           Mac chortles, then looks through the glass doors, into the 
           party.   MAC'S POV:  Hilary, talking to a few guests.   CLOSE 
           ON Mac snorting, dismissive.  Nathan looks out over the park.

                                 NATHAN
                        Not a bad view, huh?

                                 MAC
                        If you're going to jail why not get 
                        the most tricked out cell...

           Mac chuckles.  Nathan doesn't.  Thunder sounds off-screen.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        C'mon, bud...  I'm playing around 
                        with you.  Don't be all...

                                 NATHAN
                        I'm getting a little tired of it.

           Mac raises his hands as if to say, 'Alright, alright...'.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Look, Mac.  This isn't easy, but... 
                        After your antics at Melanie's 
                        apartment and with it meaning so 
                        much to her family, the most 
                        diplomatic thing was for me to ask 
                        Mel's brother to be... Best Man.

           Mac stares blankly at Nathan, taking this in.

                                 MAC
                        Melanie's brother?

                                 NATHAN
                        Half-brother.  Teddy. Right there.

           Nathan points inside to a skinny kid, TEDDY, fifteen, doing 
           whippets in the corner with some other PREP SCHOOL KIDS.   
           Mac shrugs, STOIC, trying to appear cool with it.  A beat.  A 
           little rain starts to fall.  Mac holds his hand out to it.

                                 NATHAN (CONT'D)
                        Look, just because your not Best 
                        Man doesn't mean you're not in 
                        charge of the most important thing - 
                        throwing me the world's sickest 
                        bachelor party... Right?

           Nathan friendly-punches Mac awkwardly, chuckling. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 MAC
                        Right, right...  No doubt.

           CLOSE ON Mac, low.

           EXT. PARK AVENUE AND 96TH STREET - LATER

           Night, pouring rain, as Mac futilely tries to hail a cab in 
           front of the building.  One blows by him.  He's drenched.

                                 HILARY (O.S.)
                        Mac!  Wait...  Come under here.

           Mac turns, where Hilary stands beneath the building awning.  
           She holds out an umbrella.  Mac walks over to her.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        I had the doorman call you a car.

                                 MAC
                        Yeah?  Thanks.

           A beat.  Mac can't hide being a little bummed.

                                 HILARY
                        Not enough chicks up there for you?

                                 MAC
                        Closest thing to talent was Nathan's 
                        Aunt Vickie with the trout pout. 
                        Nothing for either of us, huh?

                                 HILARY
                        Suits me.  I think I'm done with 
                        this whole thing.

                                 MAC
                        C'mon...  You had one shit date but 
                        you were pulling the strings.  That's 
                        what matters.

                                 HILARY
                        I'm stag at my best friend's 
                        engagement party, standing in the 
                        rain with someone I don't like very 
                        much.  You haven't exactly turned 
                        things around for me.

                                 MAC
                        By the end of next week you'll have 
                        more dates than a calendar. I promise.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Hilary doesn't look particularly convinced.  A livery cab 
           screeches to the curb, honking.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Seriously.  Let's do it.  From now 
                        on we go balls out swingling.

                                 HILARY
                        Swingling?

                                 MAC
                        Nathan coined it.

           Mac smiles and makes his way to the cab.

                                 HILARY
                        Mac...

           He turns back to Hilary.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        He was a real weenie to not have 
                        picked you for Best Man.

           Make just smiles.  Thank you.  Hilary waves and reenters the 
           building.  Mac climbs into the car and it drives off.  Music 
           kicks in, something cool and fun, leading us to...

           SWINGLES MONTAGE:

           *  Hilary and Mac enter a Whole Foods, where Hilary nudges 
           Mac and points.  Mac follows her finger to... The salad bar, 
           almost completely encircled by PRETTY GIRLS filling plates.  
           Mac smiles wide and nods approvingly at Hilary's idea.

           *  In prime box seats, Mac and Hilary applaud a home run at a 
           Mets game amidst a gaggle of LEHMAN BROTHERS GUYS.  Mac 
           feigns - poorly - a bad stomach, winks at Hilary, and exits 
           frame, leaving Hilary alone with all the men.

           *  Camera pans a long line of women filing into a storefront,  
           ending on Mac and Hilary.  HOT WOMEN wipe frame, eating 
           frozen yogurt, and we see we're in a Pinkberry's, almost 
           always all female.  Mac smiles at a proud Hilary, impressed.

           *  Mac leads a reluctant Hilary into a huge Home Depot.  JUMP 
           CUT to an EMPLOYEE doing a Band Saw demonstration for about 
           twenty MANLY MEN, with Hilary standing right in the middle.

           *  Hilary and Mac at a WNBA game.  Everyone around them is 
           FEMALE and they all stare, flirt, buy beer, etc. for Hilary, 
           who didn't anticipate a mostly gay crowd. Mac rolls his eyes.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           *  At the Chelsea Piers driving range, Mac hits a ball, then 
           hands the club to Hilary who swings, wildly.  The ball hooks 
           sharp and almost hits a group of CUTE GOLF GUYS, who take 
           cover. Mac slips away as a gorgeous man, BEN, strides over, 
           and introduces himself to Hilary, and offers her some tips.

           As Mac stealthily walks off, Hilary looks up and gives him a 
           very down-low thumbs up and smiles wide.  Mac smiles back.

           *  At the Whitney Museum, many ATTRACTIVE WOMEN mill about. 
           Mac stands between Hilary and a gorgeous woman, KAT, in front 
           of an abstract painting. Mac looks baffled by the art but 
           Hilary does a Cyrano-esque whisper into Mac's ear.  Then Mac 
           leans to Kat and repeats whatever Hilary said about the 
           piece.  Kat looks impressed.  Hilary walks off, satisfied.

           END SWINGLES MONTAGE.

           INT. MANHATTAN STRIP CLUB - LATE NIGHT

           Nathan's bach-bash is getting ugly. Melanie's half-brother 
           Teddy zips around shoving dollars into every thong in sight.

           Mac sits on a couch next to a very drunk Nathan, naked save 
           for a feather boa.  They drag on huge cigars and receive 
           private dances from two STRIPPERS.

                                 MAC
                        ... So she feeds me this crap about 
                        Dadaists and Pop Art and this 
                        gorgeous Kat chick is eating it up!

           Nathan just sits, enthralled with his stripper.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        You know, beneath the bitch shield 
                        she's the ultimate wing.  We even 
                        went to Bryant Park for...

                                 NATHAN
                             (overlapping)
                        Woody Allen night?

           Feeling ignored, Mac's stripper dances mightily to get his 
           attention.  Mac gets a bra in the face but doesn't flinch.

                                 MAC
                        Hey, don't go all Brokeback on me.  
                        What works, works, you know?

           The Stripper tries a different tact, smushing her ass right 
           into Mac's oblivious face.  He could give or take it.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        OK!  Thank you very much, Cinnamon.

           Mac sticks a wad of twenties in both strippers g-strings.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        Do some thong-shopping on me.  
                        (Pointing at Nathan)  And I want  
                        you girls to go Romper-Room on this 
                        guy here.  Body shampoo, fluff and 
                        dry, Nathan sandwich, the works...

           Mac stands and makes his way to the bar.  In the background, 
           Teddie reaches out and stupidly grabs a stripper on stage.  
           Five BIG BOUNCERS pounce on him.  Again, Mac could care less.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Another Singapore for last call?

           Mac glances back at the chaos of the bachelor party, everyone 
           blind-drunk and getting drunker.  Mac checks his watch.

                                 MAC
                        Nah...  Got this thing in the 
                        morning.  Gonna call it a night...

           INT. LIMOUSINE - TIME SQUARE - SAME NIGHT

           The LIMO is littered with miscellaneous junk (beer signs, a 
           potted plant)  In a tattered veil, Melanie and six ladies in 
           their early 30's (SASHA, YUKI, etc) yell out the sunroof.

                                 MELANIE
                        Hurry up, Hilary!  Run!

           QUICK TO Hilary, running through Times Square, a guitar in 
           hand, with the NAKED COWBOY chasing her.  She dives into the 
           limo, slamming the door.  The ladies laugh maniacally, drunk.

                                 MELANIE (CONT'D)
                        Holy shit!  Naked Cowboy almost 
                        killed you!  This scavenger hunt 
                        was brilliant, Hil!

                                 YUKI
                        I have to admit, Hilary.  When I 
                        heard you were hosting, I figured 
                        we'd be tucked in bed by ten.

           The other women concur.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 HILARY
                        Well, you mommies better speed-dial 
                        your baby-sitters.  I have a 
                        feeling it's gonna be a long night.

                                 SASHA
                        Are we slowing down?

           Police lights flash and sirens howl.

                                 MELANIE
                        Fuck!   You stole the Naked 
                        Cowboy's guitar, Hilary!

           A COP raps on the door, hard, and Hilary opens it, nervously.

                                 HILARY
                        Hey, Officer... What's going on?

                             (dead serious)
                        You ladies are under arrest...

           The girls look at each other, then to Naked Cowboy's guitar.  
           After a long, tense beat, the cop reaches into his holster 
           and pulls out... a portable CD player and presses play.

                                 COP (CONT’D)
                        For being too goddamn sexy!

           Hilary stifles laughter as the 'Cop' rips off his shirt and 
           starts shaking his ass to the music.  He rips his pants off. 
           The girls scream and hug Hilary as the Cop jumps in the limo.

           INT. HILARY'S CONDO BUILDING HALLWAY - NEXT MORNING

           In improved yoga clothes carrying two skim milk lattes, Mac 
           stands in a plush hallway, pressing the doorbell non-stop.    
           A messy-haired, hung over Hilary opens the door with a grunt.

                                 MAC
                        We're gonna be late.

                        My god, is it nine already?

           Hilary checks her nonexistent watch.

                        We got home at dawn.  Your cop-

                        Dawn?  You?

           Hilary holds her head.

                                 HILARY
                        No yoga for me, Mac, sorry.

           Hilary closes the door but Mac jams it with his foot.

           INT. HILARY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Mac slides in and follows Hilary as she retreats inside.

                                 MAC
                        C'mon. Let's grab breakfast and hit 
                        the noon class.  No pain no gain.

           Hilary grabs one of the lattes and swallows deep.

                                 HILARY
                        Gotta go to the office. And my date 
                        with Ben from the golf range is 
                        tonight. High hopes for this one...

           Hilary holds her stomach and runs out of the room.

                                 MAC
                        Yeah, I gotta gear up my A-game for 
                        that museum chick, Kat.

           Mac glances around for the first time, impressed.  The condo 
           is way swank... It's also so clean it barely looks lived in.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        Golf guru picking you up here?

                        Where else?

           Hilary reenters the room just in time to see Mac grab neatly 
           stacked magazines and books from the bookshelf and dump them 
           all over the coffee table and floor.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?!

                        Making this joint not look like an 
                        upscale mental health clinic.

           Mac continues to make a mess, pulling cabinets open, etc.  In 
           one cabinet he finds stacks and stacks of DVD's.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        These are gold.  Men dig any 
                        pastime a woman has that doesn't 
                        involve talking or shopping.

           Mac dumps an armful on the floor.  From the closet he digs 
           out a tennis racquet, running sneakers, jump rope, etc. and 
           props her bike up in the corner, prominent.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        Nice.  This stuff says you like to 
                        sweat and that your body's hard. 
                        Only thing hotter would be to have 
                        I Dream Of Jenna playing on a loop.

           Hilary, exhausted, just sits there sipping her latte.  
           Continuing, Mac points at FRAMED PHOTOS of Hilary and Aaron - 
           in romantic catalogue-worthy poses - on the mantel.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)

                        No.

           Mac turn all the pictures face down.

                                 MAC
                        These photos suggest otherwise.  
                        Now... the main event.  Wardrobe.

           Mac disappears into her bedroom.  Camera stays on Hilary as 
           her clothing is thrown at her from off-screen.

                                 HILARY

           INT. MAC'S APARTMENT - NOON-ISH

           Hilary walks down the spiral staircase, with Mac right on her 
           heels.  They stand in the middle of his dump living room.

                                 MAC
                        Not bad, right?  A good balance.

                        Of what? Nastiness and Heinousness?

           Hilary picks a giant dust bunny off the floor.

                        So... Dirty dishes everywhere, 
                        bookcases filled with Cliff Notes 
                        and old Ranger Rick magazines...

                                 MAC
                        They're collectors items...

                        Also... You might want to lose the 
                        hundreds of balled up Kleenex from

                        To what?  Masturbating?

           Looking at the garish Tiki bar winking with colored Xmas  
           lights, Hilary can't even find the words.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        This is about as appealing as a 
                        freezer full of body parts.

                        365 since 2003.  It's history.

           Hilary selects a nine-iron from a golf bag in the corner.

                                 HILARY
                        You got that right...

           Hilary swings the club like an axe - taking down a bamboo 
           post and toppling the shanty hut.  Mac screams.
           INT. MAC'S APARTMENT - LATER

           Bar knocked down, apartment a wreck, Mac and Hilary clean.  
           Hilary picks up a folder and flips through glossy pages of 
           colorful, kaleidoscopic graphic design. Mac tries to grab it.

                                 HILARY
                        No, Let me see... I love this stuff.

                        They're from my old portfolio.

                        You're talented, Mac.

           Hilary holds one of the irreverent designs (think Shepard 
           Fairey or David Carson) up to the wall.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        And nothing impresses women like 
                        real talent. Let's get some frames.

           EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - MANHATTAN - AFTERNOON

           Mac and Hilary stride down 6th Avenue, bags in hand.  They 
           laugh, having fun. Mac stops at a ROASTED NUT CART.

                                 MAC
                        You want?  I love these things...

                                 HILARY
                        No way.  Dateline did an expose and 
                        found high levels of urine content 
                        in the cashews.  

                                 MAC
                        Well, what do you think makes them 
                        so darn yummy?

           Hilary grimaces and waits as Mac pays the NUT GUY.  They 
           continue to stride past 'Bed, Bath, and Beyond', when...

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Mac?

           A pretty, thirty year-old girl, BETH ANN, enters frame.  Mac 
           shuffles a little, nervous.

                                 MAC
                        Beth Ann...  Hey.  Uh, How's it...

                        Yeah.  Really, really... Funny.

           Mac just stands there, looking at Beth Ann, silent.

                                 HILARY
                        Hi, I'm Hilary...

           Beth shakes Hilary's hand.  An awkward beat.

                                 BETH ANN
                        How are you, Mac?  I haven't seen

                        else just... really great.

                        married now, I bet, huh?  Kids?

                                 BETH ANN
                        Nope.  None of those things.  Just 
                        having fun, living in SoHo. Working 
                        on a proposal for book number two...

           Beth Ann looks at her ringing cell phone.

                                 BETH ANN (CONT’D)
                        I have to take this. Anyway, it was 
                        nice to run into you, Mac... Bye.

           Beth Ann strides out of frame.  Mac, seemingly shell-shocked, 
           continues down the sidewalk.  Hilary catches up, laughing.

                                 HILARY
                        Oh, man... Can you say awkward?  

           Mac keeps walking, saying nothing, pallid.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        Mac, you okay?  Who was that?

           Mac turns to Hilary.

           Mac walks out of frame.  CLOSE ON Hilary, absolutely stunned.

           EXT. MAC'S APARTMENT - ROOFTOP - LATER

           Mac's rooftop overlooking Lower Manhattan.  Mac and Hilary 
           unwind, sitting in beach chairs with pizza and beers.

                                 MAC
                        ... and we were broke, so we hand 
                        wrote every invitation.  I did 120 
                        different drawings and we joked 
                        about how they would all be worth a 
                        fortune one day.  Like Picasso or 
                        some shit, drawing on napkins.... 

           Hilary chuckles.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        Then one day... No scandal or 
                        anything.  She said she wanted out.  
                        That she was too young, that she 
                        wanted to get to know herself 
                        better...  That was it. Haven't 
                        seen her until today.

                        Man...  I'm sorry, Mac.

           Mac tosses an empty and cracks open a second.

                                 MAC
                        You know the worst thing?  She's 
                        alone.  No boyfriend, no husband... 
                        And she's so happy... I was crazy 
                        for this girl and she preferred to 
                        be alone than be with me.

           A beat.  Hilary laughs a little.  

                                 HILARY
                        It all makes sense now.

                                 MAC

           Mac looks a little uncomfortable with this topic.

                        It means you'd rather have everyone

                        that you're just a...  chicken.

                        Okay, so... (thinking)  Do you like 
                        being a human?

           Hilary laughs.

                        What, you're asking me?

           Hilary holds her head in her hands, frustrated.

                        Sure, why not... Fake date.  Mac,

           A beat.  Mac thinks, kind of seriously.

                                 MAC
                        In five years I want my own design 
                        firm. We'll specialize in web-sites 
                        for indie bands... logos, shirts, 
                        CD covers... I want to be known as 
                        a designer with a a singular vision 
                        whose websites harken back to the 
                        artistry of the great album covers.

           Silence.  Hilary hasn't heard this Mac before.

                                 HILARY
                        But... Why wait five years?

                                 MAC
                        Because I have no clue how to 
                        launch something like that and it's 
                        been a lot easier to want to do it 
                        than to actually do it.

                        You've survived the singles scene

                        business world, too. 

           Mac shrugs, but smiles, grateful.

           Hilary shoots Mac a look.

                                 HILARY
                        No. I'll tell you where I'd like to 
                        be...  I'm addicted to this real 
                        estate website with all these 
                        incredible old Victorians.  I want 
                        to buy one, run a B&B and have 
                        enough land for animals, a big 
                        garden, lots of kids...  And I want 
                        to be with someone who wants me to 
                        have all that, you know?

           Mac looks impressed.  Hilary smiles self-consciously.

                        right?  Too counter-culture?  Like

           A beat.  Hilary looks off a little.

                                 HILARY
                        I don't know if it will ever

                        No, I mean everything else.  A 
                        family... I see it around me 
                        everyday.  Women who have these 
                        powerful lives and careers but 
                        nothing else... they make me sad.

                        How do you know they're sad?

                                 HILARY
                        I don't.  I just know that when I 
                        think of being like them it makes 
                        me sad...  That's what counts.

           Hilary pops open a beer, slugging some down.

                        said it would end in tears.

                        about yourself to sleep with me.  

           Hilary smiles a little at this.

                        But I've been asking myself since, 
                        "Hil, what kind of woman do you want 
                        to be?" I've worked too hard to turn 
                        down a partnership, but I'm afraid of 
                        what I'll be giving up if I take it.

                                 MAC
                        The family stuff?  Husband and kids

                        have all that.  Trust me.

                        Because I know.  I'm sure of it.

           Hilary smiles thankfully at Mac, who smiles back.  The two 
           just look at each other for a long beat, then... Hilary's 
           Blackberry rings an alarm, breaking the mini-moment.

                                 HILARY
                        Shit.  Six o'clock already.  I 
                        haven't even showered.

                                 MAC
                        Kat's coming here in an hour.  You?

                        casual, you know.  Just... low key.  

           They smile at each other for a beat.  Hilary exits frame.

           INT. HILARY'S CONDO - EVENING

           Hardly casual, Hilary wears a sexy black, short, evening 
           dress.  She looks spectacular.  She stands before her mirror 
           and tries to pull her dress down a bit but stops herself.

                                 HILARY
                        Your taste in evening wear better

           Doorbell.  Hilary looks around, her apartment overhauled with 
           the right amount of personality.  Hilary tilts a lamp shade 
           crooked for a final touch.  She opens the door.

           Ben, in a perfect black suit, is ridiculously handsome.  They 
           take each other in for a beat.

           Hilary motions for him to come in.

                        Wow.  You, too.  

           Ben scans the place:  Books, DVD's strewn about.  Mountain 
           bike, crooked lamp, etc.  Ben gives a "how perfect are you" 
           look to Hilary, who smiles wide, proud.  She grabs her bag.

           INT. CAPITALE GRAND BALLROOM - LATER

           A tasteful banner spanning the Grand Venetian Ballroom reads 
           'New York City Women's Bar Association Dinner' and black-tie 
           guests sit at tables around an enormous dance floor.

           Guests file in and Hilary and Ben make their way through the 
           crowd.  Hilary not-so-subtly scans the room as she greets her 
           CO-WORKERS, including Fred Mortimer, and introduces Ben.

           They make their way to their table and women can be seen 
           ogling Ben, who's just that handsome.  Nearing the table, 
           they run into another handsome man, LUKE.

                                 LUKE
                        Ben Noonan.  What's going on?

                        What are you doing at a Bar 
                        Association dinner?

           Ben puts an arm around Hilary.

                        Crazy times indeed.

           They laugh. Hilary scans the room, anxious, and spots... the 
           Gorgeous Blonde from the Old Homestead Steakhouse. Of course, 
           Aaron enters a second later, putting his arm around her.

                        Ben?  Let's get to our table, okay?

           Ben and Luke say goodbye and Hilary guides Ben to their 
           table, directly across the dance floor from where Aaron sits.

           INT. MAC'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           In his transformed apartment, Mac and Kat drink wine and 
           stand before an entire wall of Mac's framed work.  Real 
           literature and art books sit on shelves.  Plants dot the pad.

                        She's a...  a friend.

           Kat scans the pad, brushing her hand across Mac's back.

                        I mentioned how much I adore your

                        We're gonna have to shake it if we 
                        want to make that reservation.  
                        Hilary said it's the best Italian 
                        restaurant in Lower Manhattan.

           Kat kicks off a shoe and smiles, sexy.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        to eat, you know what I mean?

           Mac smiles.  He knows.

           INT. CAPITALE GRAND BALLROOM - LATER

           Mid-dinner.  Ben whispers something to Hilary and she laughs 
           and nestles her head into his shoulder.  Whilst this she 
           peeks out of one eye and sees Aaron squinting in her 
           direction.  Hilary takes this opportunity to kiss Ben hard.

                                 BEN
                        What was that for?

                        Just because.

           They laugh, having fun.  Hilary loving that Aaron might have 
           seen her with this God of a man.  Ben looks across the room.

                                 BEN
                        You mind if I caught up with Luke 
                        for a minute? I'm surprised to bump 
                        into that dude and I just want to 
                        give him some friendly shit about 
                        something.

           Hilary watches Aaron and his date step onto the dance floor.

                                 HILARY
                        No problem.  As long as you promise 
                        me a dance when you get back.

                        Of course.  

           Hilary smiles and watches Ben stride out of frame.

           INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM, CAPITALE BALL ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           Hilary sits on the floor next to a crying, sobbing Ben.  He's 
           beside himself, hysterical. Hilary wipes his tears.

                                 BEN
                        ... And he's so fucking glib!  Like 
                        it wasn't even him who left me!  

                                 HILARY
                        It's alright Ben, really.  He's not 
                        worth it.  

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 BEN
                        And he has the unmitigated... 
                        audacity to look me in the eye and 
                        tell me that I was the one who blew 
                        up the relationship. It's like, who 
                        was it that cheated in our own bed?  
                        Me? No, it was that pretty-boy slut 
                        who couldn't keep his pants on!  

           Ben explodes into another wave of dramatic grief.  Hilary 
           looks to the sky for answers as she holds Ben like a baby.

           INT. MAC'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Kat and Mac are in various stages of undress, making out on 
           the couch.  Mac's iPhone rings. He strains his eyes to see 
           who's calling. Hilary. He pulls away, reaching for the phone.

                                 KAT
                        You're kidding, right?

                        I'm sorry.  It'll just be a minute.

           Kat climbs off Mac and exits frame.  Mac answers the phone.

           INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM, CAPITALE BALL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           In her gown with her hair and makeup mess, a teary Hilary's 
           holed up in a stall, perched atop the toilet.

                        At this fancy dinner I knew Aaron 
                        would be at but I didn't want to tell 
                        you because I was scared you would 
                        say that it was stupid but I went 
                        anyway and I think Aaron knows I'm 
                        here but my hot gay date left because 
                        his boyfriend cheated on him and I 
                        can't be here by myself...

           INT. MAC'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Mac's pacing as Kat returns in her underwear.  She refills 
           Mac's wine glass as he huddles up in the corner.

                                 HILARY (O.S.)
                        Can you come help?

                        code that applies here?

           Mac steals a glance at a nearly naked Kat.

                                 MAC
                        Yes.  It's not fucking up your

           CLOSE ON Mac.
           INT. BATHROOM STALL, CAPITALE - LATER

           A miserable, messy-looking Hilary plays Brick Breaker on her 
           Blackberry.  She freezes as a pair of mens shoes approach the 
           stall. A knock on the door. Hil pushes it open with her foot.

           Looking disarmingly splendid in his black-tie, Mac smiles.  
           CLOSE ON Hilary.  Thank God.

           INT. CAPITALE GRAND BALLROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           The place has kicked it up a notch. Hundreds of tipsy lawyers 
           and their guests dance, eat, laugh, etc.  Mac and Hilary - 
           looking great - take deep breaths and enter the ballroom.

                                 HILARY
                        I really owe you one.

                        I wouldn't miss this.  All the 
                        training, all the work...  You're 
                        climbing into the ring.

                                 HILARY
                        I guess I am.

                        what he let go of. 

           They scan the room.  Hilary spies Aaron making his way over.

                                 HILARY
                        Oh God, he's walking right toward me.

                                 MAC

                        Keeler?  I thought it was you...

                                 HILARY
                        Aaron!  What a surprise!

           Mac nudges her hard to 'take down the enthusiasm a bit'.

                                 AARON
                        Hilary, you look... Beautiful.  No 
                        other word for it.

                                 HILARY
                        Well, thank you, but...

           CONTINUED:

           Aaron's gorgeous blonde enters frame, an arm around Aaron.

                                 AARON
                        ... and this is Stacy Dearborne.  
                        Sweetheart, Hilary Keeler...

                                 STACY
                        Aaron talks about you with such 
                        regard.  In fact, he recommended 
                        your firm to do my company's taxes.

           Hilary's smile is frozen.  Aaron shakes Mac's hand, friendly.

                                 AARON
                        Aaron.  I hope you can get her out on 
                        the dance floor tonight.  She's 
                        looking too pretty to be a wallflower.

           Aaron flashes his smile and he and Stacy rejoin their table 
           on the other side of the dance floor.  Hilary stands there.

                                 HILARY
                        I need to go home right now.  I 
                        have a mountain of work...  

           Hilary pulls Mac towards the exit.  Mac jerks her back.

                                 MAC
                        If you want that mannequin of a man 
                        to spoil another Saturday night for 
                        you, fine.  But I did not turn down 
                        sex, borrow my landlord's tux, and 
                        pay thirty dollars for a cab to 
                        watch you wuss out, understand?

           On that, Mac struts onto the dance floor and does something 
           like dancing, getting down amongst the conservative couples.  
           Mortified, Hilary rushes over and tries to drag Mac away.

                                 HILARY
                        Every partner in my company is 
                        staring, Mac!  Let's go...

           Mac blocks Hilary from leaving the dance floor.

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                        Didn't you hear Aaron?  I can't  
                        dance.  Seriously.    

           The band finishes their song and gets ready to start up 
           again.  Mac turns to the BAND LEADER, shouting up at him.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Hey, this is a ballroom!  Play 
                        something... Ballroomy!

           The Band Leader barks at his band and they begin playing some 
           up-tempo waltz.  Most people leave the dance floor.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        Any girl who ever thought they were 
                        going to marry some Ken doll like 
                        Aaron has practiced dancing a waltz. 

           Hilary looks around, self-conscious, the floor pretty much 
           empty.  Mac reaches to her, putting his hand on her shoulder 
           blade.  Hilary's hands instinctively go on Mac's arms.

                                 MAC (CONT'D)
                        And every man who was ever six 
                        weeks away from walking down the 
                        aisle himself was coerced into 
                        learning it as well, so... 

           Mac and Hilary begin dancing, finding their way into the 
           song.  A fairly simple Box Step.  

                                 HILARY
                        Mac, I really don't want to...

           Mac leads Hilary into a few continuous turns, surprisingly 
           smooth.  Hilary follows along gamely.  Many of the guests 
           look on, now.  Watching this handsome young couple.

           QUICK TO Aaron, holding court at his table, in mid-story.

                                 AARON
                        ... as if it would ever go to trial 
                        in a million fucking years, right?

           Aaron's friend, TIM, interrupts, pointing at the dance floor.

                                 TIM
                        Your ex has got a pair of legs on 
                        her, huh, Ackerman?

           Aaron follows their gaze to... Hilary and Mac, dancing in 
           long, flowing movements, now.  Their dance is causing a stir. 

                                 STACY
                             (to Aaron)
                        I thought you said she was just an 
                        old law school friend?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           Aaron ignores her, taking in Hilary's grace and elegance.  
           QUICK TO Hilary's table, where the firm's partners are 
           standing now, loving Hilary as she does a solo spin.

           BACK TO Mac and Hilary, smiling now, savoring this.

                                 HILARY
                        How do we finish?

           Mac just smiles and leads Hilary into a complicated underarm 
           turn, ending with a flourish.  The congregation applauds. 

                                 HILARY (CONT'D)
                             (through a big smile)
                        Is he watching?

           Mac peeks Over at Aaron, the crowd continuing to applaud.

                                 MAC
                        Of course he is.  Applauding.

           Hilary smiles wide.

                                 HILARY
                        Thanks for not letting me turn tail, 
                        Mac.

           She hugs Mac as the room continues to applaud, and no one's 
           clapping louder than Aaron.  

           INT. MEL AND NATHAN'S APARTMENT, DINING ROOM - DAY

           Complicated seating charts cover the big table, as Melanie 
           and Nathan do some rearranging.

                                 MELANIE
                        So that leaves the dais.  You, me, 
                        parents, in-laws, Maid of Honor...

           Nathan eyes the chart, contemplative.  INSERT:  Your standard 
           wedding setup.  Names are scribbled atop the rectangle dais, 
           with Mac's name scribbled out and Teddy's name in it's place.  

                                 NATHAN
                        He's my best friend.  My boy.

                        Who's been acting like a complete 
                        dickhead about this entire wedding.   

           Nathan nods.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Teddy's mom that Teddy be included.

                                 NATHAN
                        The thought of seeing that snotty

                        Well it's better than someone who 
                        thinks us getting married, anyone 
                        getting married - is so lame.

           Nathan thinks for a second.

                                 NATHAN
                        What would Hilary want?  She has to 
                        dance with the Best Man.  You think 
                        she wants Teddy grabbing her ass?

           Melanie folds her arms, stoic.  Nathan turns to her, sincere.

                        feel different.  Look, I can see 
                        how the new Mac would be annoying 
                        to somebody who never knew the old 
                        Mac.  You just need time with him.  

           Melanie considers.  

           INT. BLUE STAR HMO - AFTERNOON

           Lunchtime.  The office is pretty much empty save for Mac, 
           sitting in his cleaned-up and totally organized cubicle.  He 
           looks good, haircut, put together, and yaps into his headset.

                                 MAC
                        ... so as part of my new business 
                        promo we'll build your band a first-
                        class site, maintain it, and not 
                        charge a dime if you don't dig it.

           As Mac listens, he straightens out a photo of he and Hilary 
           in Roller Derby regalia, with Hilary holding up her trophy.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Cool, then let's do it...  I'll 
                        call you later in the week.

           Mac clicks his phone off and smiles, psyched. 
           INT. MANHATTAN LAW FIRM COMMISSARY - AFTERNOON

           Hilary, glasses on and in total work mode, sits alone, 
           ignoring a sandwich and thumbing through law books.  

                                 FRED MORTIMER (O.S.)
                        Constructive Dividends in Inter-
                        Corporate Transactions, huh?

           Hilary looks up and smiles as Fred enters frame.  

                                 HILARY
                        Some light afternoon reading.

           They chuckle.

                                 FRED MORTIMER
                        That was quite a show you put on at 
                        the WBA Supper.  I've never seen a 
                        partner at this firm move like that.    

                                 HILARY
                        Why didn't I see you out there?  
                        Two ex-wives, you must've learned 
                        to dance the waltz along the way.

           Mortimer snickers.

                                 FRED MORTIMER
                        Very good, Hilary.  The mind of a 
                        lawyer...  Anyway, we'll see each 
                        other soon, I'm sure.  The good 
                        news will come by weeks end, so...

           Fred waves and exits frame.  Hil's Blackberry rings. INSERT: 
           Hilary's Blackberry:  The caller ID reads, 'AARON' and his 
           handsome mug appears.  Hilary just stares at the Blackberry.

           EXT. BRYANT PARK - AFTERNOON

           Mac strides through the park, in a good mood.  His iPhone 
           rings.  He smiles at the Caller ID, answering.

                                 MAC
                        What's up, wing nut?

           INT. HILARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Hilary sits on the floor, on the phone, using her desk as a 
           backrest and looking anxious, nervous, amped up.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        He called, he called...  Holy shit, 
                        I can't believe he called.  It 
                        worked, it actually worked...

                                 MAC (V.O.)
                        Whoa, slow down.  Who called?   

                                 HILARY
                        Aaron called, idiot, who else? He 
                        got a job offer from a competing 
                        firm and wants to meet for a drink 
                        to get my professional advice.

           EXT. BRYANT PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Mac stops in his tracks, his smiles fading a little.

                                 MAC
                        On what, whether he looks better in 
                        boxers or briefs? What a lame line.

           Mac chuckles.  Nothing from Hilary on the other end.

                                 HILARY (V.O.)
                        Mac, I need your help here, what do 
                        I do?  He wants to meet tonight.

           A beat.  Mac holds the phone away from his ear.

                                 MAC
                             (to himself)
                        What the hell, Mac, help her out...  
                        What's wrong with you...

                                 HILARY (V.O.)
                        Mac?  Are you there?!

           Mac shakes off his unfamiliar feelings and dives back in.

                                 MAC
                        Yeah, okay, here we go...  Under no 
                        circumstances do you meet him for a 
                        drink.  No alcohol, understand?

           INT. HILARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Hilary's at her desk, taking notes, on speaker phone.

                                 MAC (V.O.)
                        Meet for coffee and not at one of 
                        those comfy lounges.

                        light out.

           Hilary smiles.  

                                 MAC (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And no dinner.  You're at a tricky 
                        time - six, six-thirty - and it can 
                        easily be segued into an evening.  
                        Resist the temptation.

           EXT. BRYANT PARK - CONTINUOUS

           A HOT WOMAN at a nearby table overhears Mac and chuckles.  

                                 HILARY (V.O.)
                        And what if he asks me when we can 
                        get together again?

                                 MAC
                        You give him a handshake and get 
                        out of there.  No future plans.

           Mac notices the Hot Woman laughing and mugs for her, pointing 
           at the phone as if the person on the other end is nutty.

           INT. HILARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Hilary continues to take notes.

                                 MAC (V.O.)
                        Just make sure you're out of there 
                        by 7:30 at the latest and call me 
                        right after.

                                 HILARY
                        Got it.  Thanks again, Mac.

           Hilary hangs up.  CLOSE ON Hilary, determined, focused. 

           INT. BLUE STAR HMO - EVENING 

           Mac sits at his desk continuing to plant seeds for his new 
           endeavor.  The office lights are low and Mac is the only one 
           left.  He glances at his watch.  INSERT WATCH:  7:00.

           Mac eyes his iPhone seeing if he's missed a call.  Nothing.  
           Mac picks up his empty coffee mug and walks out of frame.
           INT. BLUE STAR HMO BREAK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Mac flicks on the light and sees a lap-top open on the table.  
           Mac looks closer.  INSERT:  Eli's FaceSpace profile: 

           A ridiculously Photoshopped picture of Eli - with muscles and 
           cool-guy movie hair.  Next to Eli's pic there's a scroll of 
           chat with a a girl named 'Melissa'.  Mac laughs.

                                 ELI (O.S.)
                        Who's there?  Don't look at that!

           Eli runs into the room to cover the screen.  Mac hovers.

                                 MAC
                        Your profile says you're 6'3 and 
                        that you were on 'The Deadliest 
                        Catch'... And that isn't even close 
                        to how you spell 'cunnilingus'.

           Eli hangs his head.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        You never even met any of these 
                        women, have you?

           Eli sits and buries his head in his hands.

                        I'm a loser, aren't I? I live in my

                        my friends I met on Second Life... 
                        And I can't even talk to a girl 
                        without breaking out in hives...

           Mac awkwardly pats the kid on the back.

                                 MAC
                        C'mon, you're a bright, tech-hip

                        this place, trust me.  Actually...

           Mac thinks for a beat, then checks his watch.

                        I've got a few minutes on my hand.

           Eli lifts his head and looks up at Mac.  

           EXT. 47TH STREET - RESTAURANT ROW - LATER

           Mac fast walks down the sidewalk, on his iPhone.  He checks 
           his watch simultaneously.

           Nathan, Melanie, and Mac are mid-dinner, small-talking,

                        I'm still stuck on the fact that 
                        she was actually a cheerleader...

           Mac laughs to himself, sipping his beer.  A beat.

                                 NATHAN
                        You know, I'm glad we did this.  I

                        been alone together before.  

           Mac checks his iPhone for a call, a text, an email... 
           Nothing.  Nathan shoots a look to Melanie. 

                                 MELANIE
                        Mac, so...  Who's your plus-one for

                        results of the swimsuit competition?

           Mel and Nathan chuckle.  Mac pockets the iPhone, oblivious.

           Mac's phone rings and he excitedly pulls his phone out again.  
           He looks at the Caller ID:  Kat.  Mac hits ignore, noticeably 
           disappointed.  Mac looks around, then to his watch, antsy.

                        What?!  That's nuts.  You're nuts.

                        They say couples think alike?

                        your non-working time with?

                                 MAC
                        Well, we have this arrangement...

                                 MELANIE
                             (interrupting)
                        Man... You really are completely up 
                        your ass about this aren't you?

           A beat, as Mac contemplates.

                                 MAC
                        What, does she think this about me?

           Melanie shrugs.

                                 MELANIE
                        I don't know. Maybe she's like you...  
                        Focused so much on what she thinks 
                        she wants that she doesn't stop to 
                        think about what it is she needs.  

           A beat, as Mac takes this in. The waiter puts down the check.

           EXT. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS PROMENADE - NIGHT

           11:00 PM.  Mac looks out over the railing, onto Lower 
           Manhattan, lit like a Christmas tree.  Nothing like that 
           view.  Mac pulls his iPhone out and takes a look.  Nothing.

           Mac just stands there, taking in the scenery, contemplative.  
           After a beat, he chuckles to himself.  No way.

           INT. MAC'S APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER

           Mac sits at his new drafting table/desk area, where the 
           'Bamboo Room' used to be.  A miscellany of designs, drawings, 
           fonts, etc., cover the table, the wall.

           Mac taps at his computer, clicking through his iPhotos.  
           INSERT:  Photos of Mac and Hilary, a montage in and of 
           itself:  The Met's game, the driving range, Home Depot...   

           Mac laughs out loud of a photo of Hilary at the WNBA game, 
           surrounded by admiring women.  He clicks through a few more.  

           CLOSE ON Mac, smiling, chuckling.  He glances at his iPhone.  
           INSERT:  His iPhone reads:  12:30.  
           INT. MAC'S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           1:15 AM.  Mac lies in bed, holding his iPhone.  He looks at 
           it for a beat, then grabs his land-line phone and dials his 
           own cell number to make sure it's working.  It is.

           Mac powers down his phone and just lays there, staring at the 
           ceiling. After a beat he flicks his phone on again, checking.  

                                 MAC
                        I can't believe this...  I'm in 
                        love with Hilary Keeler.

           EXT. MAC'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING

           7:00 AM.  Mac bounds down the stairs of his brownstone, 
           upbeat, and hurries out of frame.

           EXT. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS PROMENADE - MOMENTS LATER

           Mac walks the promenade, towards the Brooklyn Bridge, light 
           on his feet.  He passes two ATTRACTIVE WOMEN and strides on, 
           not giving them a second look.  They turn and watch him go.

           INT.  HILARY'S CONDO LOBBY - A LITTLE LATER

           Mac paces nervously in the lobby, two lattes in hand.  The 
           DOORMAN hangs the intercom phone up.

                                 DOORMAN
                        She's coming down.

           Mac nods, exhaling deep, getting his footing.  CLOSE ON Mac, 
           sort of talking to himself.  After a beat...

                                 HILARY (O.S.)
                        Mac...

           Hilary strides out of the elevator.  Mac walks toward her, 
           awkwardly holding out a latte.

                                 MAC
                        I need to tell you something...

                                 HILARY
                        I need to tell you something.

           Hilary takes the latte.

                                 MAC
                        Why didn't you call me last night?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 HILARY
                        I just... I had so much to tell you 
                        and I wanted to see you in person.

           Hilary guides Mac to a couple of chairs in the lobby area.

                                 MAC
                        What's going on?  

                                 HILARY
                        I thought about you all night, and 
                        what you said on the rooftop, about 
                        me.. That I'd have all those things 
                        I was afraid I'd never have, and...

                                 MAC
                        Yeah, and that I was sure of it...

                                 HILARY
                        Exactly... And I thought about it 
                        later and said, "Wait a second.  
                        When Mac was saying that he was 
                        sure of it, was it because..."

                                 MAC
                        Oh, I didn't even think about that!  
                        It all makes sense now.

                                 HILARY
                        I know it does...  That's why last 
                        night, when I was with Aaron, I 
                        decided that I was going to...

                                 MAC
                             (interrupting)
                        Hilary, this might sound insane but  
                        I really think I'm...

           Elevator door opens.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        There you are, Hil...  

           Mac and Hilary look up... Aaron, in shorts and an undershirt, 
           hair mussed, clearly having spent the night.

                                 AARON
                        Where are the coffee filters? I 
                        told you to get one of those k-cup 
                        machines.  Mac...  What's up, bud?

           Mac sits there, stunned.  Aaron puts his hand out.  After a 
           beat, Mac, color draining from his face, shakes Aaron's hand.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 HILARY
                        I keep them in the toaster because I 
                        never use it? Isn't that ridiculous?

           Hilary laughs, giddy and flushed by Aaron's very presence.

                                 AARON
                        Don't leave me hanging up there too 
                        long, okay?  Good to see you, Mac.

           Aaron strides out of frame. Hilary watches him and gets 
           palpably excited as he disappears into the elevator.

                                 HILARY
                        It all worked!  Everything you 
                        taught me!  It all came together! 

           Hilary goes up for a very awkward high-five to Mac, who 
           reciprocates with zero enthusiasm.

                                 HILARY (CONT’D)
                        I can't believe you made this 
                        happen!  You promised to help me 
                        get a new Aaron but you did better 
                        than that! You got me my Aaron!

           Hilary does a celebratory kick in the air and bear hugs Mac, 
           but he's as stiff as a post, embarrassed, hurt.

                                 MAC
                        That was your plan the whole time.

                                 HILARY
                        What?

                                 MAC
                        This entire arrangement.  You just 
                        wanted Aaron back.

           Hilary looks perplexed.  

                                 HILARY
                        Of course I did.  

                                 MAC
                        And you knew he'd be at that dinner 
                        and when your super-hunk date turned 
                        out to be a super-gay date you 
                        brought me in as a second stringer.

                                 HILARY
                        Yeah, so what?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 MAC
                        We were so good that night, dancing, 
                        the whole bit.  It was perfect.

                                 HILARY
                        I know it was perfect and I thanked 
                        you for helping me look good. Isn't 
                        that what swingling is all about?

           Mac's hurt pride and heartache spill into anger.

                                 MAC
                        But I didn't know it was just a 
                        swingle!  I thought we were, you 
                        know, sticking it to pretty-boy up 
                        there and having a goof!

                                 HILARY
                        Dude, you're supposed to be happy for 
                        me.  What's up with the cockblockery?

                                 MAC
                        You're calling me a cockblocker?!  

           Mac throws his hands in the air, angry, and strides out of 
           frame, to the exit.  Hil contemplates, then runs after Mac.

           EXT. CROWDED CHELSEA SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

           Mac, hurt and frustrated, walks down the sidewalk.  Hilary 
           catches up to him. Fast-walking pedestrians dodge them.

                                 HILARY
                        Wait, I see what's going on...

           Mac stops and turns to her.  She does?

                                 HILARY (CONT’D)
                        You think I'm squelching on my end 
                        of the deal and cutting off your sex 
                        pipeline.  Well don't worry.  You're 
                        still getting your game back.

                                 MAC
                        Still getting what?  Oh, my game's 
                        back, baby.  Bigger and better than 
                        ever.  Hell, the only reason we were 
                        keeping this thing alive was for you!

           Hilary and Mac look at each other for a beat.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        You got what you wanted, okay?  But 
                        if he doesn't pan out don't bother 
                        calling me for your next hubby hunt.

           Mac stalks away, out of frame.  CLOSE ON Hilary, at a loss.  

           EXT. MELANIE AND NATHAN APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER

           Melanie opens the door revealing a clearly upset Mac.  Nathan 
           sits on the couch in the background, playing X-Box.

                                 MELANIE
                        Hey, Mac.  Nathan was just about to 
                        call you to...

                                 MAC
                        To humiliate me again?

           Mac walks into the apartment.  

                                 MELANIE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 MAC
                        You know exactly what I'm talking 
                        about.  You don't like me so you 
                        set me up to look like a fool?

                                 MELANIE
                        I have no idea... Nathan?

           Nathan pauses his game and stands.

                                 NATHAN
                        Mac, man...  Don't talk to her like 
                        that.  What's going on?

           Melanie storms out of the room, leaving Mac and Nathan.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Dude... 

                                 MAC
                        I go over to her place this morning 
                        like an idiot to tell her... God, I 
                        can't believe I listened to her.

           Mac points into the other room.

                                 NATHAN
                        Mel didn't tell you to do anything. 
                        All she did wanted to do was...

                        Make me look like an asshole.  It's 
                        classic Best Friend vs. Girlfriend 
                        stuff. Whose side are you on, anyway?

                                 NATHAN
                        I'm on the side of sanity, and 
                        would you keep your voice down?

                                 MAC
                        You're a goddamn friend ditcher.

           Nathan motions for Mac to step out into the hallway.  

           INT. MEL AND NATHAN'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           They enter the hallway and Nathan shuts the door behind them.

                                 NATHAN
                        I'm a friend ditcher?  

                                 MAC
                        Yeah.  And a sellout.  Why'd you 
                        have to go get fucking married?

           Nathan gets angry.

                                 NATHAN
                        I'm not selling out.  What I'm 
                        doing is hard, and real, and I'm 
                        not going to apologize to you 
                        anymore for moving forward and 
                        growing up.

                                 MAC
                        It's the easy way out.  Any old 
                        JoHo can get married.  

                                 NATHAN
                        Bullshit.  You think it's lame 
                        because you tried it and got burned  
                        and you're afraid of it.  You're 
                        the pussy, not me.

           Mac stands there, stoic.  Nathan moves closer to him, angry.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        You think I'm jealous because 
                        you're chasing girls every night?  
                        I'm not jealous of you.  Nobody's 
                        jealous of you.

           Mac hears this and has no retort.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        You know, I was calling you today 
                        to tell you that you were going to 
                        be my Best Man.  

           Nathan and Mac look at each other for a beat.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        I'm glad I didn't.

           On that, Nathan enters his apartment, closing the door on 
           Mac.  CLOSE ON Mac, despondent.  Music of some kind...  

           BEGIN MAC MINI-MONTAGE:

           *  Tourists and locals stroll the promenade, Manhattan 
           standing tall in the background.  Mac runs into frame, a good 
           sweat on, and cools down, stretching.  A couple of HOT WOMEN 
           look at him and then to each other.  Not bad.

           *  Lunchtime again, as the Blue Star office is empty save for 
           Mac, who is at his computer, talking into a headset.  He 
           hangs up and smiles, typing.  INSERT:  Mac adds another 
           band's name to a growing list of clients.

           *  Mac pulls off a pretty respectable pose amidst a fairly 
           large group of mostly ATTRACTIVE WOMEN.  Mac looks focused, 
           not at all affected by the litany of females.

           *  Mac's apartment is unrecognizable, totally enveloped in 
           Mac's designs. He and Eli hover over a monitor and with a few 
           clicks they launch YOURBANDHERE.COM right before our eyes.  

           They smile and laugh, excited.  Mac sneaks a peek at a photo 
           of he and Hilary, taped to the wall above. 

           END MAC MINI-MONTAGE.

           INT. BLUE STAR HMO - MAC'S CUBICLE - LATE NIGHT

           Mac burns the midnight oil again, exhausted.  After a beat, 
           he eyes the photo of he and Nathan on the beach, then takes a 
           look at his computer's datebook: NATHAN'S WEDDING - SATURDAY.

           After a beat, Mr. Exley, once again with grey hair and sans 
           tongue-piercing, leans into Mac's cubicle.  Mac, startled, 
           clumsily clicks out of his new website.

                                 MR. EXLEY
                        Don't even bother, Danko.  

           Exley sits down in Eli's chair.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MR. EXLEY (CONT’D)
                        I made Eli spill the beans. Making a 
                        break for it with your own company, 
                        huh?  Hell, I don't blame you...

           Mac nods, thankful.

                                 MAC
                        It's 1:00 AM, Jerry.  What's your 
                        excuse for being here?

                                 MR. EXLEY
                        An empty house to go home to gets a 
                        guy pretty low after a while.

                                 MAC
                        I hear you...  What happened to the 
                        Colin Farrell look you were rocking? 

                                 MR. EXLEY
                        Eh... The single life isn't for me, 
                        you know what I mean?

                                 MAC
                        I think I do.

                                 MR. EXLEY
                        Gonna try to pull the Mrs. away 
                        from her Life Coach and see if 
                        she'll give me another shot.  

           Exley stands, patting Mac on the shoulder.

                                 MR. EXLEY (CONT’D)
                        I'll see you here in the morning.

           Mac watches as a lonely Exley heads to the elevator.

           INT. HILARY'S OFFICE - DAY

           Hilary's at her desk, looking intently at her computer.  
           INSERT:  Hilary clicks through some Martha's Vineyard Bed & 
           Breakfast's that are for sale.  A knock on the door and Fred 
           Mortimer enters, along with two OLDER PARTNERS in bow-ties.

                                 FRED MORTIMER
                        Hilary?  You have a moment?

           Hilary swallows.  This is it.

                                 HILARY
                        Of course, of course... Please.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Fred waits for the Older Partner's to settle in and then 
           closes the door behind them.  They all sit.

                                 OLDER PARTNER #1
                        I know this has been a long 
                        process, Hilary, and we are all 
                        grateful for you patience...

                                 OLDER PARTNER #2
                        We take partnerships very seriously 
                        here, and as you know we think the 
                        world of you...

           Older Partner #2 looks to Fred, who smiles nervously. 

                                 FRED MORTIMER
                        I guess I'll be the one to tell 
                        you...

           Hilary waits, nervous.  A beat.

                                 FRED MORTIMER (CONT’D)
                        I'm sorry, Hilary...

           Fred continues with the bad news, inaudibly in the 
           background.  Tighter on Hilary.  Her serious look turns into 
           a slight smile of relief as Mortimer babbles on and on. 

           INT. LEXINGTON AVENUE BRIDAL STORE - AFTERNOON

           In her beautiful wedding dress, Melanie stands in front of a 
           mirror while the SHOP GIRL makes last minute adjustments.  
           Hilary sits aside, holding their iced coffees. 

                                 HILARY
                        Mel...  You look absolutely 
                        gorgeous.  Really.

                                 MELANIE
                        Well God Bless the Master Cleanse.  
                        I haven't eaten in four days...

           A Blackberry rings.  Melanie shakes her head at Hilary, 
           disapprovingly.  A nearby SHOPPER, though, answers her phone. 
           Hilary smiles, holding out her empty palms.

                                 HILARY
                        Don't even have it with me today.

                                 MELANIE
                        You're kidding me.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        From now on I'm on associate hours.  
                        Let the big shot partners ruin 
                        their own weekends.

           Melanie turns to Hilary, taking her coffee.

                                 MELANIE
                        You're feeling good, aren't you?

                                 HILARY
                        I am...  

           A beat.  Hilary shifts.

                                 HILARY (CONT’D)
                        Are, uh... Nathan and Mac speaking 
                        yet?

                                 MELANIE
                        Nope.  They really got into it...  
                        It was pretty bad.

                                 HILARY
                        Is he still going to the wedding?

                                 MELANIE
                        He RSVP'd and said he was...

                                 HILARY
                        Plus one?  

                                 MELANIE
                        What do you care?

                                 HILARY
                        I mean... I don't.  Just wondered 
                        if he was taking anyone from when 
                        we were... Swingling.

           Hilary chuckles slightly at the sound of the silly word.

                                 MELANIE
                        He's coming alone.  To the delight 
                        of the six single bridesmaids.  

           A beat, Hilary considers this, then checks her watch.

                                 HILARY
                        Shit, I have to get going.  Dinner 
                        with Aaron and his entire family at 
                        the Penn Club.

                                 HILARY
                        He said it was important that we 
                        all got together before the 
                        weekend. And he wants to get up to 
                        the Vineyard right after the 
                        wedding.  Just the two of us.

           Melanie gives her a look.

                                 MELANIE
                        You don't think...

                                 HILARY
                        His brothers did the same thing: 
                        Dinner at the Penn Club and the very 
                        next weekend they were engaged.  

           The SHOP GIRL looks up at Hilary.

                                 SHOP GIRL
                        Maybe I should take your 
                        measurements while you're here?

           They all laugh.

                                 MELANIE
                        I gotta hand it to you... And Mac.  
                        That 'swingling' nonsense really 
                        worked, huh?

           Hilary smiles, nodding.  Melanie eyes Hilary in the mirror.  
           CLOSE ON Melanie, not particularly convinced.

           EXT. FORT TRYON PARK - AFTERNOON - WEDDING DAY

           A tasteful altar and chairs are set up on the meadow, with a 
           breathtaking view of the Hudson River. 

           Guests arrive, congregating informally and catching up prior 
           to the ceremony.  Hilary and Aaron, both looking spectacular, 
           mingle with WEDDING GUESTS.  A handsome man, SAM, sees them.

                                 SAM
                        Ackerman, Hilary... I at least know 
                        two people here.

           They shake.  Sam kisses Hilary on the cheek.

                        when this thing ends?

           Aaron checks his watch.  Hilary shoots him a little look.

                             (chuckling)
                        Relax.  Hasn't even started yet.

                        Hil and I are going to the Vineyard 
                        after.  Only one flight out of New 
                        York tonight.

                        Vineyard, huh?

           Aaron winks at his friend.  Damn right.

                                 HILARY
                        There's also this Bed & Breakfast 
                        for sale up there that I want to 
                        check out.  Saw it on-line.

           Aaron stares at Hilary blankly.  News to him.

                                 HILARY (CONT’D)
                        I just want to get an idea of what 
                        you get for your money up there, so 
                        maybe someday down the road...

                                 AARON
                             (good-naturedly)
                        Or we could just make runny eggs at 
                        the crack of dawn. Save us a day.

           Aaron and Sam laugh.  CLOSE ON Hilary, forcing a chuckle as 
           Aaron wraps his arm around her.

           INT. NEW LEAF CAFE - FORT TRYON PARK - CONTINUOUS

           In a private lounge Nathan greets and small-talks with a few 
           guests as he preps for the pending ceremony.  Best Man Teddy 
           and a couple of his ANNOYING FRIENDS stand around a little 
           table of snacks, shooting flutes of champagne.

                        Might want to ease up on the booze,

                        thing so why don't you mind you're 
                        own business, shithead.

           Teddy and his pals laugh at Nathan's expense.  A knock on the 
           door. Nathan opens it...  Mac.  The two look at each other.

                                 MAC
                        You mind if I come in?

                                 NATHAN
                        Of course...  You look great.

                                 MAC
                        So do you.  

           The two look at each other for a beat, awkward.  Mac smiles.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        You're getting married...  

                                 NATHAN
                        Don't start, Mac.  Not now.

                                 MAC
                        No, no, no... I don't mean it like 
                        that.  I mean it for real.  I'm 
                        happy for you, I really am.  

                                 NATHAN
                        Thanks... That means a lot.

                                 MAC
                        And I want to apologize. I didn't 
                        consider how you felt about all this, 
                        how excited you were... I was just 
                        thinking about how it affected me... 

           Mac shifts, getting his footing.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        And I acted like a selfish asshole.

                                 NATHAN
                        You really did.

                                 MAC
                        I know.  And I'm sorry.  

           Nathan smiles.  They chuckle.  The moment is broken by Teddy, 
           who throws an empty tray at Nathan and Mac like a frisbee.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 TEDDY
                        When you two are done being all gay 
                        how about getting us some more 
                        jalapeno poppers...

           Nathan looks at Mac for a beat, then back to Teddy.

                                 NATHAN
                        Hey, Teddy?

                                 TEDDY
                        What?

                                 NATHAN
                        This room is only for people in the 
                        wedding, so get you and your pals 
                        out of here before I stuff a tray 
                        of jalapeno poppers up your ass.   

           Nathan's not kidding.  Nathan and Mac watch as Teddy and his 
           friends scramble out.  Nathan looks at Mac.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Looks like I need a Best Man, huh?

           EXT. FORT TRYON PARK - DUSK

           Just music, no dialogue.  The sun sets over the Hudson as 
           Nathan and Hilary exchange vows.  Both Mac and Hilary stand 
           on either side of the bride and groom.

           Mac and Hilary watch as Nathan and Melanie put rings on 
           fingers.  Hilary peeks up at Mac for a second.  Mac does the 
           same and they catch each other for a beat.  Mac mouths a 
           polite 'Hi'.  Hilary mouths one back, with a reserved smile.

           The Bride and Groom kiss.  Applause.  Perfect.

           EXT. RECEPTION TENT - EVENING

           The wedding band plays as the reception guests dance up a 
           storm.  Nathan and Melanie dance in the middle of the fray.  

           On opposite ends of the dais, Mac sits alone as Hilary and 
           Aaron sit amongst RANDOM GUESTS.  CLOSE ON Hilary, stealing a 
           glance at Mac.  HILARY'S POV:  A sexy bride's maid, MARE, 
           clearly asking Mac to dance.  Mac politely declines.

                                 AARON
                        You two going to put on a show like 
                        you did at the WBA Dinner?

           Hilary turns back to Aaron, a little flustered.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 HILARY
                        Oh, uh... No, no, I don't think so.  
                        Not tonight.  

                                 AARON
                        Too bad.  Wouldn't mind seeing you 
                        move like that again.

                                 HILARY
                        Well... Why don't you take me for a 
                        little spin around the floor.

                                 AARON
                        You know that's not my thing, Hil.

           Hilary shrugs as the BAND LEADER steps forward.

                                 BAND LEADER
                        ... Now we'd like the rest of the 
                        wedding party on the dance floor!

           Mac and Hilary glance at each other.  Mac shrugs, stands, and 
           makes his away to the dance floor.  Hilary looks at Aaron...

           INT. RECEPTION TENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Mac and Hilary take their place slow-dancing among the other 
           dancing couples.  Their silent, awkward.  After along beat.

                                 MAC
                        Nice ceremony.

                                 HILARY
                        It really was.

           A beat.  The two dance, nicely.

                                 MAC
                        Looks like you've gotten over your 
                        dance-phobia.

           Hilary can't help but smile.

                                 HILARY
                        Guess I've got you to thank for that.

           Hilary does a fancy little move.  Mac steadies her.

                                 HILARY (CONT’D)
                        I've got to hand it to you, Mac.  
                        All that time with me, I must have 
                        been holding you back.  You're the 
                        buzz of the bridal party.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MAC
                        I doubt it. 

                                 HILARY
                        I'm serious.  And they're all old 
                        enough to remember the first Bush 
                        Administration.

           They chuckle politely.

                                 MAC
                        If it's true I have you to thank for 
                        steering me in the right direction.

                                 HILARY
                        I guess we both got what we wanted, 
                        huh?

                                 MAC
                        Yeah.  We sure did.

           They look at each other, and continue to dance in silence.

           EXT. LAWN OUTSIDE THE TENT - LATER

           Waiters hurry back and forth while a few guests sneak smokes.  
           Mac sits on a crate of dishes with a pen and napkin in hand.  
           He peers into the crowded tent:  MAC'S POV:  At the dais, 
           Hilary and Aaron chatting, looking like an attractive couple.

                                 MELANIE (O.S.)
                        Just pretend they're all in their 
                        socks and underwear.

           Mac turns and finds Melanie behind him.

                                 MELANIE (CONT’D)
                        Nathan said you were back here 
                        writing a speech.

                                 MAC
                        And you're here to make sure I 
                        don't turn it into a Bamboo Room 
                        Retrospective? 

           They chuckle.  

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Mel, I'm really sorry about being 
                        such a dick.  You're super cool and 
                        Nathan's a lucky man.  I mean it.

           Melanie smiles a thank you.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MELANIE
                        I really wasn't trying to make you 
                        look like a jackass with the whole 
                        Hilary thing. I think maybe I wanted 
                        it to be true.  Two best friends 
                        with two best friends, you know? 

           Mac looks into the tent, at Hilary, and smiles. 

                                 MAC
                        Yeah...

           Melanie follows Mac's eyes.

                                 MELANIE
                        Look, without divulging too much... 
                        I think if you feel the way that I 
                        think you feel you might not want 
                        to let this night slip away...

                                 MAC
                        How do you know if the feeling that 
                        you're feeling is the feeling that 
                        you're supposed to... feel?

           Melanie thinks for a beat.

                                 MELANIE
                        That's easy... You know how you 
                        feel when you're with that person?

                                 MAC
                             (a little smile)
                        I do.

                                 MELANIE
                        Now imagine living your whole never 
                        feeling that way.  

           Mac hears this.  Spoons tapping against glasses begin to 
           emanate from the tent.  Melanie looks up.

                                 MELANIE (CONT’D)
                        That's my cue.  See you inside.

           Mac smiles.  Melanie pats Mac on the back, and disappears 
           into the tent.  CLOSE ON Mac.

           INT. RECEPTION TENT - LATER

           All eyes are on Hilary as she stands at her end of the dais, 
           microphone in hand, finishing up her Maid Of Honor speech.  
           She raises her glass to Nathan and Melanie, who smile at her.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 HILARY
                        ... To Nathan and my best, 
                        beautiful friend, Mel...  Endless, 
                        endless laughter and love. Cheers. 

           The gathering raises their glasses.  Mac, distracted by the 
           sight of Hilary, is a little late on raising his.  After some 
           applause, the Band Leader steps forward.

                                 BAND LEADER
                        And now the Best Man... Mac Danko!

           Distracted applause, as the mic is passed down to Mac.  Mac 
           stands, nervous, and flips the mic on.

                                 MAC
                        Um, Hi.  Uh, I'm Mac Danko.  I'm 
                        Nathan's Best Man...

                                 TEDDY
                             (flipping Mac the finger)
                        No one cares, loser!

           Teddy and his drunk friends laugh uproariously.

                                 MAC
                        I'm, uh... probably the last person 
                        who should be up here toasting 
                        Melanie and Nathan on the biggest 
                        day of their lives.

           Nathan and Melanie exchange a look.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        See, Nathan was my Wing Man, and 
                        when he met Melanie I thought he 
                        ditched me... I didn't want him to 
                        get married and I gave him a lot of 
                        shit for it...  

           Nathan nods animatedly, mugging.  Laughter. 

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        For a long time I thought getting 
                        married was what you did when you 
                        were going bald, broke, or because 
                        your ass was starting to get 
                        irreversibly large.  

           Titters emanate from the crowd.  Aaron snickers and nudges 
           Hilary, who looks a little concerned.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        I thought that being single was the 
                        only way to go, and that it was 
                        totally lame that Nathan didn't 
                        want to run around with me anymore.

           Mac steps forward a little, getting his footing.  He glances 
           over at Hilary, making a little eye contact.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        The truth, though, is that from 
                        watching Nathan and Melanie I 
                        learned that all I was doing was 
                        running in circles....  And the 
                        problem with running in circles is 
                        that you never get anywhere.  

           The guests really listen, attentive.  

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        I thought they were settling but I 
                        was the one who was settling.  I 
                        thought real love was a sham, 
                        bullshit, that it didn't really 
                        exist.  I guess that's because I 
                        didn't know what it was.

           Hilary watches Mac intently, starting to feel this.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Nathan once told me that when he 
                        was with Melanie he never felt like 
                        he was missing out on anything.  
                        That's love.  

           Melanie hugs Nathan tight, kissing him hard.  The room nods 
           appreciatively.  Mac looks directly at Hilary.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        And love's about eating a pizza and 
                        drinking a six-pack on your roof, 
                        talking about your future, and 
                        realizing that out of all the dates 
                        you ever had, it's the best date you 
                        never had.

           Tighter on Hilary.  A nearly undetectable wistful smile.  

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        And maybe the reason I didn't want 
                        Nathan to take the plunge was 
                        because I was scared that it would 
                        never happen for me. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           The BRIDESMAIDS collectively sigh at this, even more smitten.  
           Mac raises his glass.  The crowd does the same.

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        To Melanie and Nathan.  I'd be a 
                        lucky man to someday know the same 
                        happiness you know today.

           The crowd applauds, impressed. Teddy makes a jerk-off motion.  
           Hilary sits quietly next to Aaron, moved, contemplative.

           INT. RECEPTION TENT - LATER

           Dessert plates and coffee cups rattle as the party continues, 
           dancing, drinking, etc.  The place is still full, but people 
           are checking their watches. 

           Mac sits at the dais, small talking with a few passers-by.  
           Once again, sexy MARE returns, a little drunker.  

                                 MARE
                        C'mon, Mac... Dance with me.

                                 MAC
                        The wedding's just about over.

           Sexy Bride's Maid bends down, close to Mac's ear.

                                 MARE
                        Just because the wedding is over 
                        doesn't mean the night has to be.

           Mac considers for a beat, then smiles, politely.

                                 MAC
                        Maybe another time...

           Mare, disappointed, exits frame.  Mac looks over at Hilary, 
           mingling, Aaron by her side.  Mac exhales heavy.

           EXT. FORT TRYON PARK - A LITTLE LATER - NIGHT

           Mac stands at a stone wall, alone, looking out over the 
           Hudson.  The George Washington Bridge illuminates the sky.  
           CLOSE ON Mac, contemplative.  

           INT. FORT TRYON PARK - RECEPTION TENT - CONTINUOUS

           Aaron stands, puts his jacket on.  He looks down at Hilary. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 AARON
                        Say your goodbye's, babe. No way 
                        we're missing this flight. Not this 
                        weekend.

           Hilary's eyes dance around the tent for a moment.

                                 HILARY
                        Um, yeah, okay, sure...

           Hilary stands and grabs her jacket. 

           EXT. FORT TRYON PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Mac points his iPhone at the beautiful bridge, snapping a 
           photo.  He eyes the photo for a beat, then flips through some 
           older ones.  He stops, staring at one particular picture.  

           INSERT:  Hilary and her bitch-face.  Something we haven't 
           seen in a while.

           CLOSE ON Mac, chuckling. He looks back at the glowing wedding 
           tent, a good distance away, then back to the photo.   After a 
           long beat...  He scampers out of frame.  Now or never.

           EXT. FORT TRYON PARK - MOMENTS LATER

           Mac runs through the wedding ceremony set-up, dodging chairs 
           and dashing past the altar, toward the tent.

           INT. RECEPTION TENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Aaron slips an arm around Hilary and they head to the exit, 
           reaching the door.  Hilary stops, hesitates, looking back.

                                 AARON
                        You alright, Keeler?  

           Hilary shakes it off and smiles.

                                 HILARY
                        Yeah, Yes, fine...  All set.

                                 AARON
                        Good.  Then let's bounce...

           Hilary gives a final look back, then disappears out the door.

           EXT. FORT TRYON PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Mac breathes heavy, finally reaching the back entrance of the 
           tent, where he was writing the speech.  He stops for a beat, 
           catching his breath, wiping his brow.  Ready.
           INT. RECEPTION TENT - CONTINUOUS

           Mac just stands there, scanning the tent, looking for Hilary.  
           Nowhere to be seen.  Mac steps further into the congregation. 
           He glances to where Hilary and Aaron were sitting.  Empty.

           Mac looks over to the dance floor, where Nathan and Melanie 
           dance.  Melanie makes eye contact with Mac.  Mac gives 
           Melanie a 'Where is she?' look.  

           With great sympathy, Melanie simply mouths, 'She left.  I'm 
           sorry, Mac'.  CLOSE ON Mac, crestfallen, crushed.

           EXT. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS PROMENADE - LATER - 2:00 AM

           Mac, tie undone, strolls the familiar promenade, watching 
           couples hold each other and look out onto Lower Manhattan.  
           Mac stops, gazing out over the harbor as well.

           CLOSE ON Mac, downtrodden.  After a beat he exhales deep and 
           ambles out of frame.

           EXT. MONTAGUE STREET - BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - A LITTLE LATER

           Mac strolls the nearly empty street, past an assortment of 
           various shops and stores.  After a beat Mac's iPhone chirps 
           to life.  A test message.  From Hilary.

           INSERT MESSAGE: 'I really need your help. I've finally got my 
           dream guy where I want him but I don't know how to play it'.

                                 MAC
                             (to himself)
                        You've got to be kidding me...

           Mac continues walking, turning down a street lined with 
           brownstones.   He stops, conflicted.  

                                 MAC (CONT’D)
                        Man, I'm a good sport...

           He begins to type a message back, strolling.  

           INSERT MESSAGE:  'I think you know how to play it, Hilary.  
           Not much left to teach you'.

           Mac chuckles to himself and turns down his street.  After a 
           beat his iPhone chirps again.  Mac, close to his apartment, 
           looks down.  

           INSERT MESSAGE:  'But I think this is the big one. He's right 
           in front of me and I don't want to blow it.'

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Mac smiles and begins walking, typing something back. A beat.

                                 HILARY (O.S.)
                        I told Aaron I needed time to get 
                        my head straight before I could 
                        take our relationship to the next 
                        level.

           Mac stops in his tracks, stunned.  He looks up.  MAC'S POV:  
           Sitting on his stoop in her Maid Of Honor Dress.  Hilary.  

                                 HILARY (CONT’D)
                        I think he knew what that meant.

           Mac stands there, speechless.  Hilary makes her way down the 
           steps, to the sidewalk.

                                 HILARY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        So... How do I play this one?

           Mac watches Hilary walk toward him. 

                                 MAC
                        I don't know... I think your first 
                        move is to let him make the first 
                        move.

           Hilary gets closer.  They're inches apart.

                                 HILARY
                        Are you sure?

           Mac and Hilary wrap their arms around each other, tight.

                                 MAC
                        Yeah.  I'm sure.

           Finally, a long, passionate kiss.  Camera pulls back.

                                           FIN.
