           SECOND DRAFT
           FADE IN:

           A LABRADOR sits on a green lawn, tongue out in the hot sun.

           WIDEN: A YOUNG MAN KNEELS NEXT TO THE DOG, SMILING.  He wears 
           Wayfarers and Topsiders.

           A GIANT THUMB strokes the dog.

           PULL BACK to find we’re in...

           INT. TYLER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           TYLER VANALDEN (20’s) tacks the photo of him and his dog to a 
           bare white wall above a narrow single bed.  

           He picks up A LETTER AND TORN ENVELOPE from a generic desk.  
           It’s the only other furniture in the 19th Century room.

           Tyler stares at the photo.  Then he walks out, turning off 
           the light as he goes.

           The streetlight shines through the blue polyester curtains.  
           The dog smiles out at the empty room.

           EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - NIGHT

           Tyler walks down the largely empty cobblestone street, 
           backpack over his shoulder.

           Old buildings loom, their ornate facades black with soot.  
           Weak light seeps from shuttered windows.

           Here and there, dour Czechoslovakians trudge past.  Tyler 
           tries to smile at an old woman.  She doesn’t smile back.

           EXT. LENNON WALL - NIGHT

           Tyler passes a GRAFFITI-COVERED WALL.  Drawings of John 
           Lennon and Beatles lyrics intertwine in multicolor.

           Halfway down the block, TWO POLICE shove a SCRUFFY YOUNG MAN 
           against the wall.  A CAN OF PAINT lies at his feet.

           On the wall above them, it reads, “I AM THE EGGMA-”

           The police glance at Tyler.  He keeps walking.
                                                Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      2.

           EXT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - NIGHT

           Finally, Tyler reaches AN OLD TAVERN.  

           A wooden sign hangs over the door, featuring a SNARLING BLACK 
           BEAR perforated by ARROWS.

           INT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - NIGHT

           Smoke and sound wash over Tyler as he opens the heavy door.  
           Locals huddle, drinking and talking low. 

           A few people look up at Tyler, unenthused.  

           At the fireplace, A DARK-HAIRED YOUNG WOMAN glances at him.  

           Tyler unbuttons his coat and makes his way to the bar.  The 
           BAR MATRON eyes him, unsmiling.  Tyler smiles anyway.

                                 TYLER
                        Pivo?

           She grunts.

           Tyler glances at a MIDDLE-AGED MAN playing chess alone.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                                 (in Czech)
                        Who’s winning?

           The man moves his rook with a scarred, THREE-FINGERED HAND.

                                 THREE-FINGERED MAN
                                 (not looking up)
                        The other guy.

           The matron thumps down a beer.  

           Tyler eyes A DUSTY BEAR HEAD gazing mournfully from the wall.  

           Below it, AN OLD TV sits on a table, sound off.  On screen, a 
           man in a cheap suit points at a map.

           A FAT MAN and A LITTLE BOY sit in front of the TV.

                                 LITTLE BOY
                        The weather changes because the 
                        weatherman tells it to.

           The fat man ignores him.  The boy looks at Tyler.
                                                Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      3.

                                 LITTLE BOY (CONT’D)
                        It is so, right?

                                 TYLER
                        It is so.

           The boy smiles, vindicated.

                                 JARMILA (O.S.)
                                 (in English)
                        Do you always lie to children?

           Tyler turns.  THE DARK-HAIRED YOUNG WOMAN (JARMILA, 20’s) 
           stands next to him at the bar.

                                 TYLER
                        Um, no.  Sometimes I lie to adults.

                                 JARMILA
                        Are you lying to me now?

                                 TYLER
                                 (in Czech)
                        I only lie in English.

           She smiles, her eyes flashing.  She’s beautiful.

                                 JARMILA
                        Me, too.

           He glances at her empty wine glass.

                                 TYLER
                        Can I buy you another of those?

           She looks at the dregs in her glass.

                                 JARMILA
                        This was not very good.

           He sees her eyes are rimmed with red, as if she’s been 
           crying.

                                 TYLER
                        Then I’ll buy you something better.

           He raises his hand to the matron.

                                 ED MARSHALL (O.S.)
                        What made you suspicious?
                                                Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      4.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, ED MARSHALL’S OFFICE - DAY

           ED MARSHALL leans back in his chair behind a big desk.  

           A picture of Ronald Reagan hangs behind him.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        You’re a good-looking guy.  It 
                        could have been real.

           Tyler sits across the desk in a blue suit, a RED I.D. BADGE 
           clipped to his lapel. 

                                 TYLER
                        I’ve been going to that bar for 
                        three weeks.  The reception hasn’t 
                        exactly been warm.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                                 (shrugging)
                        It’s Czechoslovakia.

                                 JARMILA (O.S.)
                        You are from U.S.A.?

           INT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - NIGHT

           Tyler and Jarmila now sit at a table near the fire.

                                 TYLER
                        Massachusetts.

           For a moment, she looks perplexed.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        That’s in the U.S.

           She smiles a touch tightly.

                                 JARMILA
                        We are told many things about your 
                        country.
                                 (almost embarrassed)
                        Strange things.

                                 TYLER
                        Strange how?

                                 JARMILA
                        That everything is made of plastic.  
                        Even your food.
                                                Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      5.

                                 TYLER
                        It depends on the restaurant.

           Charmed, she leans forward.

                                 JARMILA
                        Why are you here?

                                 TYLER
                        It’s my assignment.  
                                 (mock pompous)
                        You’re speaking to the Third 
                        Secretary to the Assistant U.S. 
                        Counsellor for Public Affairs, 
                        Czechoslovakia. 

                                 JARMILA
                        That sounds like a good job.

                                 TYLER
                        It almost doesn’t matter.
                                 (draining his beer)
                        It’s sort of the family business.  

                                 JARMILA
                        My father was a doctor.
                                 (beat)
                        He died before I was born.  Run 
                        over by a tank.

                                 ED MARSHALL (O.S.)
                        That’s a little much, don’t you 
                        think?

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, ED MARSHALL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Tyler shrugs.

                                 TYLER
                        It’s theoretically possible.  I was 
                        very sympathetic.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Aw.

           INT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - NIGHT

           Tyler gently touches her hand on the table.

                                 TYLER
                        I’m sorry.

           She shakes her head, but doesn’t remove her hand.

                                 JARMILA
                        That was a long time ago.  In a 
                        different Prague.

                                 TYLER
                        Still, that’s a hard thing to deal 
                        with.

                                 JARMILA
                        It is the past.  

           She glances up as the Three-Fingered Man walks by, chessboard 
           under his arm.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        And that’s a luxury we can’t 
                        afford.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, ED MARSHALL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Marshall smiles at her drama.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        How drunk did you get?

                                 TYLER 
                        Enough to guarantee my honesty.

           INT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - NIGHT

           Tyler meets Jarmila’s eyes over the top of his glass.

                                 JARMILA
                        Candy Land?

                                 TYLER
                        It’s a children’s game.

           He takes A LONG PULL FROM HIS BEER.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        I just mean, maybe you shouldn’t be 
                        so impressed with America.  It’s 
                        not that perfect.  We’re barely 
                        even an actual democracy by this 
                        point.

           At the next table, a GROUP OF MEN laugh loudly at each other.  
           Jarmila moves her chair closer to Tyler’s.
                                                Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      7.

                                 JARMILA
                        You will forgive me for saying, but 
                        I don’t think you know what “not a 
                        democracy” really means.

           His eyes flicker over her, so close.

                                 TYLER
                        I would forgive you for saying just 
                        about anything.

           She blushes, looking down.

                                 JARMILA
                        You are so nice.  And good.
                                 (looking up at him)
                        And I very much need something 
                        good.

           Their eyes meet.

                                 TYLER
                        You are the most beautiful girl I 
                        think I have ever seen in my whole 
                        life.

           She stares at him, struck.

                                 ED MARSHALL (O.S.)
                        Nice.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, ED MARSHALL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Ed Marshall makes a note on a pad.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Was that true?

                                 TYLER
                        She’s cute.  A lot of them are 
                        here.  But, no.

           INT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - NIGHT

           Tyler stares at Jarmila, taken.

                                 TYLER
                        I can help you.  Let me help you.

           She sips her wine and then, impulsively, kisses him.

           CLOSE ON: THEIR LIPS.

           Her lips move to his ear, whispering.

                                 JARMILA
                        I want to leave this place.

                                 TYLER
                                 (caught off guard)
                        Uh, um-

           Suddenly, she pulls away.

                                 JARMILA
                        What time it is?

           She pushes up his sleeve and checks his watch.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        Dear god, I’m so late.  He will be 
                        home now, he will know, he will ask- 

           She stands, grabbing her coat.  Tyler moves to get up.

                                 TYLER
                        Hang on.

                                 JARMILA
                        Don’t.  It is not safe.

           Her eyes well up and she flees the bar.  Bar patrons look 
           from her to Tyler, curious, suspicious.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, ED MARSHALL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Marshall nods, knowing.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        And so you boiled with desire.

                                 TYLER
                        And felt conspicuous.  And got 
                        stuck with the tab.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        The guy always pays, Ty.

           INT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - NIGHT

           Tyler drops back into his chair, stunned.
                                                Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      9.

                                 ED MARSHALL (O.S.)
                        Still, you feel she owes you.  And 
                        she’s in danger.

           Tyler sees the Czechs looking at him.  He digs in his pocket 
           and leaves a pile of crowns on the table.

                                 ED MARSHALL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        And you want her.  It’s the 
                        trifecta.

           He makes for the door.

           EXT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - NIGHT

           Tyler runs outside, hoping.  He looks around, but the streets 
           stand empty.

           He drags his hands through his hair.  He runs to the corner.  
           He pants, his drunken breath steaming in the chill.

                                 TYLER
                        Goddamnit!

           His words echo against the ancient buildings.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, ED MARSHALL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Tyler sits back in his chair.

                                 TYLER
                        I even managed to forget my bag.  

                                                                     SMASH CUT:

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           Tyler’s bag lies on a table.

                                 TYLER (O.S.)
                        Unclassified Politburo profiles.

           FLASH.  Someone photographs Tyler’s documents.

                                 TYLER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        A letter from my Mom.

           FLASH.  Someone photographs Tyler’s letter.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      10.

                                 TYLER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Nothing of value.  But, still, 
                        shows real discipline problems.

           Hands replace the documents in Tyler’s bag.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, ED MARSHALL’S OFFICE - DAY

           THE BAG rests next to Tyler’s chair.

                                 TYLER
                        It was back in the bar by morning.

           Ed Marshall looks the younger man over, smiling.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        This could be a big get if it turns 
                        out to be real.

                                 TYLER
                        How could it not be real?

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Sad as it may seem to men in our 
                        profession, pretty girls do 
                        occasionally get drunk and come on 
                        to guys in bars without any 
                        ulterior motive whatsoever.

           Tyler thinks on this, then shakes his head.

                                 TYLER
                        I don’t buy it.  She’s working me.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        You’re pretty confident for someone 
                        who’s been at this station for two 
                        months.  

                                 TYLER
                        I think I’ve read the situation 
                        correctly.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        And if you have, we’ll act on it.  
                        StB, KGB, whoever she is.

           Tyler rises from his chair.

                                 TYLER
                        I’ll make myself available for 
                        their overture.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      11.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        You sound like your dad.

                                 TYLER
                        I doubt that.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Well, I’ve probably spent more time 
                        with him than you have.

           He holds out a LARGE RED ENVELOPE.

                                 TYLER
                        What’s this?

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        It’s from him.  Came in the pouch 
                        from Moscow Station.  

           Tyler takes the envelope hesitantly.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, C.I.A. SECTION - DAY

           TWELVE MODERN DESKS sit in a once-grand, 17th Century room.

           Agents tap at bulky computers at eleven of the desks.

           Tyler sits at the twelfth, studying the envelope: “SECRET AND 
           CONFIDENTIAL.  VANALDEN TO VANALDEN.  YOUR EYES ONLY.”

           Tyler tears off the security strip and breaks the seal.  He 
           upends the envelope and shakes out...another envelope.

           He pulls out A GREETING CARD SHAPED LIKE A LITTLE BOY HOLDING 
           A BASEBALL BAT.

           He opens it.  In looping script, it reads, “Ty.  Welcome to 
           the Big Leagues.  Watch your Ass.  Dad.”

           Tyler just stares.  Then...

                                 HERSCH MEYER (O.S.)
                        Is it your birthday, Vanalden?

           Tyler looks up to see HERSCH MEYER (40’s).

                                 TYLER
                        No, Hersch.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      12.

                                 HERSCH MEYER
                        Then I can’t quite figure out why 
                        you’re not working on the Ten A.M. 
                        Reports.

           He points to the clock on the wall.

                                 HERSCH MEYER (CONT’D)
                        In an hour, they’ll be late.

           Tyler swallows his irritation.

                                 TYLER
                        Then you’ll have them in forty-
                        five.

           Hersch looks unimpressed.  He walks away.

           Tyler sighs.  He props the card on his desk and swivels to 
           his computer.  He types a moment, then stops.

           The baseball player smiles at him.

           Tyler feeds his father’s card into the shredder.  Colored 
           strips of baseball player land in the receptacle.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, C.I.A. SECTION - NIGHT

           Tyler leaves for the night.  He signs out and hands over his 
           RED I.D. BADGE to a Marine at the checkpoint.

           EXT. U.S. EMBASSY - NIGHT

           Tyler walks out the front door, pulling his coat around him.

           INT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - NIGHT

           Tyler hangs up his coat.  He glances around, casual.  

           No Jarmila.  

           He orders a beer, then leans against the bar, waiting.

           Down the bar, THE THREE-FINGERED MAN studies his chessboard.

           INT. TYLER’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Tyler pushes open the curtains.  Between buildings, he can 
           just make out the sun’s glare on the Vltava.

           EXT. TYLER’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Tyler steps out the front door and climbs the hill to work. 

           He sneaks a peek behind him, HOPING TO BE FOLLOWED.  Nothing.

           INT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - NIGHT

           The Three-Fingered Man opens his chessboard.  Tyler watches 
           him lay out the pieces.

           THE DOOR OPENS.  Tyler looks a little too quickly:

           A plain-looking woman enters.  She finds her husband in the 
           corner.  They laugh together.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, C.I.A. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Tyler sits in a department meeting.

           Marshall talks, gesturing behind him to a CORKBOARD labeled, 
           “CZECH INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY - StB COMMAND AND CONTROL.”

           PHOTOGRAPHS hang thumbtacked, connected by descending arrows.  

           They feature men we’ll come to know: ZDENEK RYCHTAR, JOHNNY 
           1950, VLADIMIR RUZICKA.

           INT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - NIGHT

           Later in the week, the Three-Fingered man (KAREL) again sits 
           at his board. 

                                 TYLER (O.S.)
                        Would you like to play?

           Tyler stands next to him, holding two beers.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Because I’d play with you.

                                 KAREL
                        I speak English.

           Tyler holds out a beer.

                                 TYLER
                        I said I’d play with you.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      14.

           The man looks up, studying the young American.  After a 
           moment, he takes the beer.

                                 KAREL
                        Then play.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, C.I.A. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Still in the meeting, Tyler studies the StB corkboard.

           His eyes rove over the pictures.  A last arrow descends from 
           Johnny 1950’s photo, pointing to nothing.

           Tyler stares at the blank space.

           INT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - NIGHT

           On another night, Karel takes one of Tyler’s pawns.  Tyler 
           tries not to eye the mangled hand.

                                 KAREL
                        You know, Kafka lived there.

                                 TYLER
                        In the Embassy?

                                 KAREL
                        That building is older than your 
                        country.  

                                 TYLER
                        Everything here is.

                                 KAREL
                        But the rooms were cold.  Kafka got 
                        tuberculosis.  He moved.

           They play.  A moment passes.

                                 TYLER
                        I thought he died of tuberculosis.

                                 KAREL
                        He did.

                                 TYLER
                        Guess he didn’t move far enough.

           Karel looks up from the board.  He smiles.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      15.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, C.I.A. SECTION - DAY

           Tyler types a report: “Project DAMSEL.  Day 13.  No contact.” 

           He pulls the sheet from the typewriter and puts it in a 
           binder with A DOZEN OTHER NEARLY BLANK PAGES.

           INT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - NIGHT

           The next week, Karel studies the board.  His good hand hovers 
           over his queen.  

           He notices Tyler glancing at his SOOTY FINGERS.

                                 KAREL
                        Pardon me.

           Karel pulls out a rag and wipes his hands.

                                 KAREL (CONT’D)
                        I came from work.

                                 TYLER
                        I thought you were a professor.

                                 KAREL
                        Who told you that?

           Tyler glances at the matron.

                                 TYLER
                        People.

                                 KAREL
                        I work at the hotel now.  I stoke 
                        the furnace. 

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, C.I.A. SECTION - NIGHT

           Tyler walks through the now empty office, coat over his arm.

                                 TYLER (O.S.)
                        Isn’t there another job you could 
                        do?

           Tyler eyes the wall of filing cabinets, the rows of binders.  

                                 KAREL (O.S.)
                        Not anymore.

           Tyler sighs.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      16.

           INT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - NIGHT

           Karel’s eyes droop with sleep and alcohol. 

           Tyler glances at the door.

                                 KAREL
                        I knew you were not here just to 
                        talk to me.

           Tyler turns back to find Karel smiling at him.

                                 TYLER
                        You’ll do in a pinch.

                                 KAREL
                        She is Czech?

           Tyler pauses.  He nods.

                                 KAREL (CONT’D)
                        Then do not worry.  She’ll come.

                                 TYLER
                        How do you know?

           Karel drains his beer.

                                 KAREL
                        You’re too fucking handsome not to.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, C.I.A. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

           On his way out, Tyler stares at the faces on the corkboard.

           Then he glances out the window at the lights of the Old City.

           INT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - NIGHT

           Karel waves a blurry good night as he heads into the snow.

           Tyler looks around the nearly empty bar.  He drains his beer.

           After a moment, someone rests A PAIR OF GLOVES on his table.

           He looks up to see Jarmila.

           They stare at each other a long, pregnant moment.

                                 TYLER
                        Good evening.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      17.

                                 JARMILA
                        Good evening.

           She slides in beside him. 

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        I am glad you are here.

           He shifts in his seat.

                                 TYLER
                        I just got here, actually. 

                                 JARMILA
                        I tried to come.  I did-

                                 TYLER
                                 (to the matron)
                        Pivo, prosim.
                                 (to Jarmila)
                        Did you want something?

                                 JARMILA
                                 (seeing his irritation)
                        You cannot imagine how much I 
                        wanted to see you.  

                                 TYLER
                        You’re right. 

           The matron puts down his beer.  She glances at Jarmila, 
           resentful.

           Tyler notices.  He slides closer to Jarmila, protective.  She 
           smiles shyly.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        I suppose you want me to say I came 
                        here every night for the last two 
                        weeks hoping you’d show up.

                                 JARMILA
                        Did you?

                                 TYLER
                        No.
                                 (beat)
                        Last Thursday, they were closed.  
                        The pipes froze.

           Under the table, she squeezes his thigh, whispering.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      18.

                                 JARMILA
                        Thank you, Tyler.  Thank you for 
                        being who I thought you were. 

                                                                      TIME CUT:

           The matron spreads the coals out in the fireplace.

           Tyler and Jarmila stare at each other.  Under the table, 
           their hands meet.

           They move closer.  Suddenly, Jarmila pulls her hand away.

                                 TYLER
                        What is it?

                                 JARMILA
                        There is someone.

                                 TYLER
                        It doesn’t matter.
                                 (sipping his beer.)
                        Who?

                                 JARMILA
                        Radek.

           He responds by brushing her face.  She stiffens.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        It is too dangerous.  I should not 
                        have come.  
                                 (standing hurriedly)
                        I’m sorry, Tyler.  

           She dashes out of the bar.

           Tyler sits for a moment.  He rolls his eyes.

           EXT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - NIGHT

           Tyler runs after Jarmila as a light snow falls.  He turns her 
           around and kisses her.  She kisses back.

                                 JARMILA
                        No.  Not here.

           Tyler looks around.  He grabs her by the arm.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      19.

           EXT. PRAGUE ALLEY - NIGHT

           Tyler yanks Jarmila into the alley.  He presses her against a 
           wall.  His hands are everywhere.  

           She practically climbs him.  Finally, she breaks away.

                                 JARMILA
                        But Radek-

                                 TYLER
                        Fuck Radek.

                                 JARMILA
                        If you knew, you would not say 
                        that.

                                 TYLER
                        Knew what?

                                 JARMILA
                        He is powerful.  Radek works for-

                                 ED MARSHALL (O.S.)
                        StB?  Please say StB.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, STAIRWELL - DAY

           Marshall takes the stairs two at a time.  Tyler keeps pace.

                                 TYLER
                        StB.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        I’m almost disappointed.

           EXT. PRAGUE ALLEY - NIGHT

           Jarmila looks out at the street, worried.

                                 JARMILA
                        He watches me.  All the time, I 
                        never know when.  He does not trust 
                        me.   

                                 TYLER
                        I trust you.

           He kisses her.  She stares into his eyes, as if an idea had 
           just occurred to her.  Then she turns away.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      20.

                                 JARMILA
                        No, it is too much.

                                 TYLER
                        What is it?

                                 JARMILA
                        It is too dangerous for you.

                                 TYLER
                        Whatever you want.  If I can help, 
                        I will.

           She struggles to ask.  Finally:

                                 JARMILA
                        If you could...bring me something?  
                        From your work?  

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, C.I.A. SECTION - DAY

           Marshall and Tyler head for the conference room.

                                 TYLER
                        She said it didn’t have to be 
                        anything important.  A box of 
                        pencils or something.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        I am absolutely authorized to give 
                        her pencils.  

           Marshall pushes open the door.

           EXT. PRAGUE ALLEY - NIGHT

           Jarmila presses into Tyler, her hips grinding against him.

                                 JARMILA
                        Forget I said something.  It was 
                        wrong to ask.  Please.  Do not put 
                        yourself in danger.

                                 TYLER
                        Come home with me.

                                 JARMILA
                        I can’t.

           They kiss some more.  She weakens.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      21.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        My friend has an apartment.

                                 TYLER
                        Fine by me.

                                 JARMILA
                        I must talk to her first.  

           Her hands drift over his hips.  He tries to control himself.

                                 TYLER
                        We could talk to her now.

                                 JARMILA
                        Monday.  Meet me Monday.

           She writes on A SCRAP OF PAPER and presses it into his hand.  

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        Okay, Tyler.

           She hurries down the alley, disappearing into the night.

           Tyler stares after her, snow collecting on his shoulders.  He 
           runs his hand over his face.  He unfolds the paper.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, C.I.A. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           CLOSE ON THE NOTE: “MALE NAMESTI 11, 4TH FLOOR, 18:00.”

           Ed Marshall looks from Jarmila’s note to Tyler.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Tyler here’s reeled in a mackerel.

           He hands the paper to VAL EVANS (40’s).  She examines it and 
           hands it to HERSCH MEYER.

           Hersch frowns across the table at Marshall and Tyler.  All of 
           them wear RED I.D. BADGES.

                                 HERSCH MEYER
                        He just got here.

                                 VAL EVANS
                        Which is why it might make sense to 
                        do it.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        You got something else cooking on 
                        the stove?

                                 HERSCH MEYER
                        I’m trying to take things off the 
                        stove, Ed.

           He nods at the board, which reads, “DISSIDENTS AND AGITATORS - 
           CHARTER 77.”  PICTURES OF VACLAV HAVEL AND OTHERS HANG BELOW.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        You’re betting on Havel?  He writes 
                        plays.  Community theater’s not 
                        bringing down the Kremlin.

                                 HERSCH MEYER
                        I talked to him one time.  He’s a 
                        very persuasive guy.  Plus, he’s 
                        really into Frank Zappa.

                                 VAL EVANS
                        Now Moscow’s scared.

                                 HERSCH MEYER
                        What’s the upside of an extra op 
                        right now?

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        We’ve got a direct line to an StB 
                        agent who doesn’t know we know.   
                        That’s an exploitable asset.
                                 (smiling)
                        Granted, I don’t a hundred percent 
                        know what to do with her yet.  But 
                        I have confidence I’ll be able to 
                        come up with something.

           Hersch runs a hand over his bald spot.  He eyes Tyler.

                                 HERSCH MEYER
                        She buys your story?

                                 TYLER
                        You don’t think I’m a spy.  What 
                        makes you think she does?

                                 HERSCH MEYER
                        This isn’t Ottawa, junior.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Where exactly was your first post, 
                        Hersch?

                                 TYLER
                        Treacherous.

                                 HERSCH MEYER
                        If your name’s Herschel Eli Meyer, 
                        it is.

                                 VAL EVANS
                        So what does our young man give 
                        their young lady to get past third 
                        base?

                                 TYLER
                        Nothing important.  Just enough to 
                        bait the hook.

           Marshall turns to Hersch.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        How about we start with your 
                        medical records?

                                 HERSCH MEYER
                        Come on.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Your prostate’s not a state secret, 
                        Hersch.

           He turns to Val.

                                 ED MARSHALL (CONT’D)
                        Firm up Tyler’s backstory.  More 
                        fratboy than traitor.

           Marshall signals the meeting is over.  As everyone pushes 
           their chairs back, he catches Tyler by the elbow.

                                 ED MARSHALL (CONT’D)
                        Normally, this early, we could wire 
                        you.  But that doesn’t seem...

                                 TYLER
                        No, it doesn’t.

           Marshall eyes Tyler.  Finally, he slaps him on the back.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        All right.  See the nurse before 
                        Monday.  She’ll give you your 
                        shots.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      24.

           EXT. MALE NAMESTI 11 - NIGHT

           An old apartment building stands on a quiet street.

           Tyler approaches and goes inside.

           Through the glass, we can see him check the names on a series 
           of WOODEN CUBBYHOLES.

           INT. MALE NAMESTI 11, STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           From above, we see Tyler climb the winding staircase.  His 
           shoes click on the marble.

           He looks up with anticipation.

           INT. MALE NAMESTI 11, HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Tyler stands before door 402.  He breathes.  

           Then he raises his hand to knock...BUT THE DOOR OPENS.

           Jarmila stands before him.  A candle flickers behind her.

                                 JARMILA
                        I heard you on the stairs.

                                 TYLER
                        New shoes.

           INT. MALE NAMESTI 11, APT. 402 - NIGHT

           Tyler stands in the bare loft.  Through the windows, the 
           roofs and towers of Old Prague glow in the moonlight.

           A freshly made-up bed sits in the center of the room.

           Jarmila locks the door and leans against it, staring at him.

           He lets his eyes wander over the room.  In the corner, 
           conspicuous, stands an old, upright piano.

                                 TYLER
                        Do you play?

                                 JARMILA
                        This is Klara’s apartment.  She is 
                        my friend.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      25.

                                 TYLER
                                 (moving toward her)
                        Where is she now?

                                 JARMILA
                        Moravia.

           He takes her in his arms.  They kiss.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        Her grandmother is dying.

           Tyler buries his face in her hair.

                                 TYLER
                        That’s very sad.

                                 JARMILA
                                 (smiling)
                        She has been dying for many years.

           He pulls AN ENVELOPE from his inside pocket.

                                 TYLER
                        This is for you.

                                 JARMILA
                        No.  I do not want it.  You’ll get 
                        into trouble.  We both will.

                                 TYLER
                        I’ve already done it.  
                                 (kissing her again)
                        And you’ll only get in trouble if 
                        you don’t.

           He presses the envelope into her hands.  She looks down at 
           it, suppressing a smile.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        So it’s done.

           She stares into his eyes.  She lets the envelope drop.

           CLOSE ON: THE ENVELOPE as she walks past it, nudging off her 
           flats.  Candlelight flickers on the State Dept. insignia.

                                                                      TIME CUT:

           A cassette plays in a tape deck, the Beatles in Czech.

           Naked, Tyler kisses Jarmila’s shoulder.  She sighs, content, 
           running her hand along the small of his back.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      26.

           He playfully bites her arm.  She squeals and pinches his ass.  
           He yelps.  They roll over in the bed, laughing.

           They stare at each other, likely with the same thought:

           This is more fun than I thought it would be.

           Tyler kisses her.  They make love.  Again.

                                                                      TIME CUT:

           From under the covers, Jarmila reaches out for the envelope.  

           She glances at Tyler, who seems to sleep.  

           She opens the envelope.  Her face goes from pleased...to 
           confused...to angry.

           She looks back at Tyler.  His eyes are now open.

           HE WATCHES HER EXPRESSION SOFTEN.

                                 JARMILA
                        My brave boy.

           She snuggles back under the quilt.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        How did you get such a thing?

                                 TYLER
                        They think they’ve got that place 
                        locked down tight.  But that’s only 
                        true if you’re coming at them from 
                        the outside.

           He strokes her bare arm.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Once you’re inside, sitting at your 
                        desk, they don’t see you at all.  
                        You’re invisible.

                                 JARMILA
                        I see you.

           She kisses his chest.

                                 TYLER
                        It’s just a Xerox.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      27.

           As she pulls him down, Tyler eyes the document.

                                                                      TIME CUT:

           Dawn.  Tyler ties his tie, staring in the mirror, thinking.

           Behind him, Jarmila sleeps.  

           When he turns, her eyes are open.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        I should go before the street gets 
                        busy.

           He sits on the bed, putting his arms around her.  They kiss.  
           She whispers into his shoulder.

                                 JARMILA
                        Thank you.

                                 TYLER
                        Be careful. 

           She nods.  With a last kiss, he pushes himself off the bed  
           and leaves the room.

           SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE: IN GRAINY BLACK & WHITE, Jarmila 
           remains in bed.  

           The door clicks shut.

           For a moment, she lies there, emotionless.

           Then she stands, naked.  She walks toward the camera.

           She reaches past the lens.  We hear a creak, then a click.  

           THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Jarmila walks through a drab office, hair pulled back, no 
           make-up.

           Agents work under fluorescent lights.  A phone rings, 
           unanswered.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, RYCHTAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS OF TYLER: Tyler at a bar.  Tyler looking 
           over his shoulder.  Tyler at a hockey game.  Tyler jogging.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      28.

           Jarmila sits patiently as THREE PEOPLE go over her report:

           ZDENEK RYCHTAR (60’s) reads, stoic.  A once-powerful man, his 
           beard now gray, two cigarettes going in his ashtray. 

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Is there anything you would like to 
                        add?

                                 JARMILA
                        No, sir.  The boy is as we thought 
                        he was. 

           JOHNNY 1950 (40’s) sips tea from a Toronto Maple Leafs mug.  
           He eyes Jarmila encouragingly.

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                        Maybe the Assistant Director would 
                        like you to be more specific?

                                 JARMILA
                        The American seems eager to please.

           She glances at MARKETA (20’s), who smiles encouragingly.

           Rychtar looks disappointed.  He levels Johnny with a look.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        When I agreed to your operation, I 
                        was expecting more.

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                        And there will be.  It is a rich 
                        opportunity.

           Rychtar glances at a videotape labelled, “VANALDEN/HRBEK.”

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        For you, perhaps.

           He picks up TYLER’S STOLEN DOCUMENT, studying it.

           Jarmila straightens, professional.

                                 JARMILA
                        I feel it’s a good start.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Was I speaking to you?

           Jarmila reddens.  She nearly responds, but silences herself.

           Rychtar tosses the document down.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      29.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR (CONT’D)
                        Ten years ago this “good start” 
                        would’ve been considered a complete 
                        failure.

           Marketa lays a comforting hand on Jarmila’s arm.  Jarmila 
           politely but firmly pulls it away.

                                 MARKETA
                        Sir, this is Agent Hrbek’s first 
                        assignment...of this sort.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Of any sort.

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                        We can certainly reconsider the 
                        operation, Assistant Director.
                                 (beat)
                        Of course, with the apartment and 
                        the recording devices, the 
                        department would be forced to 
                        absorb certain costs...

           Rychtar sighs.  He swivels to Jarmila.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        When can we expect more?

                                 JARMILA
                        I see him next week.

           Johnny 1950 smiles, satisfied.  He slides JARMILA’S VIDEOTAPE 
           into his briefcase.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Bring us something real, Agent.  
                        This department’s budget is not 
                        limitless.

           Rychtar rises, meeting over.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR (CONT’D)
                        And believe it or not, you are more 
                        expensive than a prostitute.

           Jarmila nods, small in her chair.

           EXT. STB HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           Jarmila exits a nondescript building.  A SOLDIER nods 
           goodnight.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      30.

           INT. METRO TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

           Jarmila sits in a crowded train car.  A man with a thick 
           mustache smiles at her, a tooth missing.

           INT. PRAGUE METRO STATION - NIGHT

           Jarmila walks down a long underground corridor.

           EXT. PRAGUE METRO STATION, OPATOV - NIGHT

           Jarmila climbs the steps, emerging in suburban Prague.  Wide 
           fields separate her from GRAY TOWERS in the distance.

           EXT. JARMILA’S APARTMENT BLOCK - NIGHT

           A GNARLED OLD WOMAN sits in a folding chair beside a basket 
           of flowers.

                                 MRS. VARADIOVA
                        There she is.

           She peers at the girl.

                                 MRS. VARADIOVA (CONT’D)
                        Is everything all right?

                                 JARMILA
                        I’m just tired, Mrs. Varadiova.  

           Jarmila halfheartedly looks through the old woman’s basket.

                                 MRS. VARADIOVA
                        A lovely girl shouldn’t buy her own 
                        flowers.

           Jarmila shrugs.

                                 MRS. VARADIOVA (CONT’D)
                        When I was young like you - never 
                        so pretty but still - I could make 
                        a boy buy me roses with one smile.

           Jarmila chooses A YELLOW ROSE and hands her a crown.

                                 JARMILA
                        Maybe I don’t want to have to make 
                        him.

                                 MRS. VARADIOVA
                        Holcicko, if you don’t tell men 
                        what to do, they won’t do anything 
                        at all.

           Jarmila just smiles tightly.

           INT. JARMILA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Fluorescent lights flicker.  Jarmila enters the tiny 
           apartment.  

           She switches on the TV.  Czech Communist blares.  She frowns 
           and turns it off.

           She takes down a glass and fills it with water.  She puts in 
           the flower and sets it on the table.

           The light buzzes.  The flower looks bleached.

           She stares at it sadly.

           INT. MALE NAMESTI 11, APT. 402 - NIGHT

           Jarmila and Tyler SLAM against the wall, locked together.  
           She wraps her legs around him.

           He grasps the wall for balance, knocking a picture askew.

                                                                      TIME CUT:

           Tyler and Jarmila lie on the bed, naked.  

           Tyler’s stomach growls.  She giggles.

                                 TYLER
                        Klara doesn’t keep any food here, 
                        does she?  Maybe some crackers.  Or 
                        a gallon of butterscotch ice cream.

                                 JARMILA
                        No kitchen.  Anyway, I do not cook.

                                 TYLER
                        Not even at home for Radek?

                                 JARMILA
                        For Radek, I warm.  Cook?  Never.  

           Tyler smiles.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      32.

           Jarmila rolls over, eyeing A CONFIDENTIAL STATE DEPARTMENT 
           FOLDER on the floor.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        Where do I tell him I get these 
                        things?

           Tyler takes in her lie.  He lies, himself.

                                 TYLER
                        What did you say the first time?

           Jarmila continues her lie.

                                 JARMILA
                        I said Klara gave it to me.

           Tyler continues his.

                                 TYLER
                        And Radek believed that?

           Jarmila turns to him.  She stares.

                                 JARMILA
                        Why wouldn’t he?

           Tyler tries to keep it all straight in his head.  He rolls 
           over and stares at the ceiling.

                                 VAL EVANS (O.S.)
                        She’s testing you.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, C.I.A. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Val and Hersch eye Tyler from across the table.

                                 TYLER
                        Yeah, but I’m trying to figure out 
                        why.

                                 HERSCH MEYER
                        Any schmo who’d betray his country 
                        for a handjob might not be a schmo 
                        you can count on.

                                 TYLER
                        So I show her I know how to lie.

           Val shakes her head.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      33.

                                 VAL EVANS
                        It’s not a lie if you believe it.

           INT. MALE NAMESTI 11, APT. 402 - DAY

           The next week, Tyler and Jarmila go over her story.

                                 TYLER
                        Klara’s lover is a junior political 
                        officer.  You’ve never met him, but 
                        from what she says, you guess that 
                        he’s from the south.  Like Texas or 
                        Georgia.

                                 JARMILA
                        Yee haw.

           He smiles.

                                 TYLER
                        He’s married, so they don’t see 
                        each other a lot, but when they do, 
                        he comes from work and sometimes he 
                        has papers.

                                 JARMILA
                        He’s taking a great risk in doing 
                        that, don’t you think?

           She stares at him.  He takes it in.

                                 TYLER
                        Sure.  But he’s crazy about her.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, C.I.A. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Tyler sips a coke, doubtful.

                                 TYLER
                        And why is Tyler Vanalden, Third 
                        Secretary whatever for Public 
                        Affairs such a great liar?

           Val finishes a sandwich.  She raises a finger.  I’ve got an 
           idea.

                                 JARMILA (O.S.)
                        Your sister was an actress?
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      34.

           INT. MALE NAMESTI 11, APT. 402 - DAY

           Jarmila sits on the edge of the bed.  Tyler nods genuinely.

                                 TYLER
                        We just practice your lines over 
                        and over until you’ve memorized 
                        your part.

           Jarmila thinks about it.

                                 JARMILA
                        Was she famous?

                                 TYLER
                        Sort of.  She was on “Search for 
                        Tomorrow” before it was cancelled.

                                 HERSCH MEYER (O.S.)
                        They cancelled “Search for 
                        Tomorrow?”

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, C.I.A. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Hersch Meyer looks up from his file, saddened.

                                 VAL EVANS
                        Two years ago.

                                 HERSCH MEYER
                        God damn, I’m missing everything 
                        over here.

                                 TYLER
                        Guys?

           INT. MALE NAMESTI 11, APT. 402 - DAY

           Jarmila stares in the mirror.  Tyler watches her carefully.

                                 JARMILA
                        I saw Klara again today.

                                 TYLER
                                 (as Radek)
                        What did she want? 

                                 JARMILA
                        Lower.

                                 TYLER
                        What?

                                 JARMILA
                        Radek’s voice is lower.

                                 TYLER
                                 (as Radek, but lower)
                        What did she want?

           She giggles.

                                 JARMILA
                        She had another package. 

                                 TYLER
                        Watch your eyebrow.

           She rolls her eyes up, following his instructions literally.

                                 JARMILA
                        She had another package. 

                                 TYLER
                        Are you going to be serious?

           She makes a serious face.  Then she sticks her tongue out.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        I will bite that off.

           She sucks it back in, mock-scared.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                                 (as Radek)
                        You said there was a package.

                                 JARMILA
                        Yes.

                                 TYLER
                                 (as Radek)
                        Give it.  

           She hands Tyler the folder.  He flips through the pages.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                                 (as Radek)
                        What is this man’s name?  

                                 JARMILA
                        I don’t know.  She doesn’t tell me.

           Tyler looks at her in the mirror.

                                 TYLER
                                 (as Radek)
                        Is he attractive?  

                                 JARMILA
                        For an American.

                                 TYLER
                                 (as Radek)
                        Klara should watch herself.  
                        Americans think of nothing but 
                        perversion.

           She turns from the mirror and looks at Tyler.  

                                 JARMILA
                        Is that right?

                                 TYLER
                        Constantly.

           They kiss.  He pulls back and looks at her proudly.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        You’re a very good liar.

                                 JARMILA
                        So are you.

           THUNDERBIRD...TO A BUFFALO SABRES MUG.  

           A hand picks up the mug and we follow it to...

           Johnny 1950’s lips.  Blue television light bathes his rapt 
           face.  He watches a monitor, but we don’t see what’s on it.

           There’s a knock at the door.  He sighs and presses PAUSE.

                        Enter.

           Jarmila opens the door.

                                 JARMILA
                        You wanted to see me-

           She sees the frozen image on the monitor: IN BLACK & WHITE, 
           SHE BENDS OVER ON THE BED.  TYLER KNEELS BEHIND HER.

           She forces herself to look at Johnny.

           Johnny fixes his receding hair.  He smiles nervously.

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                        Hello.

                        This will not take long.  Please...

           He nods at a chair.  She sits.

                        Tea?

           She shakes her head.  He pours himself more from a pot on his 
           desk.  He turns it nearly white with milk.

                                 JOHNNY 1950 (CONT’D)
                        I have been reading your latest 
                        reports.  

           He nods to a GREEN FOLDER on the desk.

                                 JOHNNY 1950 (CONT'D)
                        Congratulations.  Very promising.

                                 JARMILA
                        Your standards are not as high as 
                        mine. 

           Johnny raises an eyebrow.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        You’ve seen what Prep School’s

                        I have faith in your abilities.  

           Jarmila doesn’t smile back.  His smile drops.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      38.

                                 JOHNNY 1950 (CONT’D)
                        In fact, I assured the Assistant 
                        Director we would have something 
                        actionable by the end of the month.

                                 JARMILA
                        What?

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                                 (nodding at the TV)
                        It did not strike me as a problem.

                                 JARMILA
                        I can’t rush it.

           She frowns at the TV and TYLER’S PIXILATED, ECSTATIC FACE.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        He may be a big man in that room.  
                        But outside, he’s a coward.

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                        Then you need to make him braver.

                                 JARMILA
                        And how would I do that?

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                                 (his mouth dry)
                        Promise him things.

           She just stares at him.  Johnny taps his desk nervously.

                                 JOHNNY 1950 (CONT’D)
                        After all, we would not want him to 
                        lose interest.

           JARMILA SLOWLY REACHES ACROSS HIS DESK, her bare arm nearly 
           brushing Johnny’s face.

           She presses the button on the VCR remote.

           THE TAPE UNPAUSES.  TYLER AND JARMILA SPRING BACK TO LIFE.  
           TYLER SEEMS VERY ENGAGED.

           Jarmila leans back in her chair, watching herself have sex 
           behind Johnny 1950’s head.

           She looks back at Johnny.

                                 JARMILA
                        Does he seem disinterested to you?
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      39.

           Johnny stiffens uncomfortably.

           EXT. LETNA PARK - DAY

           YELLOW FLOWERS DOT A HILLTOP PARK.  Czechs walk their dogs.

                                 JARMILA (O.S.)
                        What was his name?

                                 TYLER (O.S.)
                        Vic.

           Jarmila and Tyler come into view, strolling along a path.

                                 JARMILA
                        And you loved him.

                                 TYLER
                        Yeah, well, I...he loved me.

                                 JARMILA
                        Sometimes that is all it takes.

           A sheepdog sniffs them.  Tyler scratches its head.

                                 TYLER
                        He understood me.  More than my 
                        family did.

                                 JARMILA
                        Dogs are better than we are.

                                 TYLER
                        Except for the thumbs.

                                 JARMILA
                                 (charmed)
                        Yes, except for the thumbs.

           They sit down on a bench.  He watches her close her eyes, 
           basking in the sunlight.

                                 TYLER
                        I like seeing you in the daytime.

                                 JARMILA
                        More than in the dark?

           He smiles.  A nice, genuine moment.

           THEN THE SUN FLASHES OFF SOMETHING NEAR A DISTANT TREE.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      40.

           Tyler realizes they’re being watched.  His smile becomes 
           fixed.

           CAMERA P.O.V.: Tyler glances away from the tree, then back.  

           A SHUTTER CLICKS.

           Through A MUFFLED MICROPHONE, we hear...

                                 JARMILA (MIC) (CONT’D)
                        This is so nice.

                                 TYLER (MIC)
                                 (souring)
                        It is, isn’t it?

           REVERSE TO FIND: MILOS (StB TECH) crouched in a stand of 
           trees, a long-lensed camera around his neck.

           Click.  Click.  Click.

           REVERSE BACK: Jarmila runs her fingers over Tyler’s hand.

                                 JARMILA
                        Radek’s out of town this weekend.

           Tyler withdraws, a bit cold.

                                 TYLER
                        Really?

                                 JARMILA 
                        I can stay all night.

           He stares off into the trees a moment.  She notices his 
           glazed look.  She’s about to say something when...

                                 TYLER
                        Then let’s go.
                                 (standing)
                        No sense in wasting time.

           He holds out his hand, a sense of urgency about him.  

                                 JARMILA
                        Is something wrong?

                                 TYLER
                                 (tightly)
                        What could possibly be wrong?

           She studies him a moment, slightly taken aback.   Finally, 
           she takes his hand.  He pulls her up.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      41.

           MILOS’ P.O.V.: the two of them walk away.

           Milos tries to follow, but a man and his German Shepherd 
           approach.  Milos ducks into the brush.

           He focuses the camera on Tyler and Jarmila as they walk out 
           of range.  STATIC GARBLES THEIR CONVERSATION.

           Milos is about to move closer when...

           A GIANT TONGUE FILLS THE FRAME.  The German Shepherd licks 
           Milos’ camera.

           EXT. LETNA PARK, LOOKOUT - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler stands on the remnants of A MASSIVE STONE PLINTH.  The 
           vantage point looks out over the entire city.

                                 TYLER
                        What was this?

                                 JARMILA (O.S.)
                        What?

           Jarmila joins him on the plinth.

                                 TYLER
                        Something used to be here.

                                 JARMILA
                        Stalin.  In marble.  Five stories 
                        straight up.

           They both stare up at where the statue used to be.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        The sculptor felt so guilty, he 
                        killed himself before they even 
                        took down the scaffolding.

                                 TYLER
                        The good old days.

           Jarmila glances back to see MILOS IN THE DISTANT BUSHES, 
           WIPING OFF HIS CAMERA. 

                                 JARMILA
                        My mother said it was like having 
                        God peeking in your window.

                                 TYLER
                        So where’d God go?
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      42.

                                 JARMILA
                        Khrushchev blew him to bits with 
                        800 kilograms of dynamite.

                                 TYLER
                        What a lovely story.

           She eyes him, annoyed.

                                 JARMILA
                        I’m sorry I don’t have any stories 
                        about fucking baseball or Mount 
                        Rushmore.

           Tyler sees he’s touched a nerve.  He softens.

                                 TYLER
                        I didn’t mean anything.

           Jarmila realizes she’s let something show.  She softens.

                                 JARMILA
                        Nevermind.

           A moment passes.  They stare out at Prague.

                                 TYLER
                        It’s a good story.

                                 JARMILA
                        It isn’t good or not good.  It’s 
                        just Prague.

           She looks at him, eyes meeting his.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        Things happen.  But if you wait 
                        around long enough...

           She pulls his hand close and kisses it.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        So will the opposite.

           HE STARES INTO HER EYES, QUESTIONING.  Could she be talking 
           about the two of them?

           EXT. U.S. EMBASSY - DAY

           Two Marines raise the flag outside the Embassy.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      43.

                                 HERSCH MEYER (O.S.)
                        You’ve gone to all the trouble to 
                        make her an asset...

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, C.I.A. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler watches the Marines from the window.  He sips coffee.

                                 HERSCH MEYER (O.S.)
                        I’m just saying let’s exploit her 
                        already.

                                 VAL EVANS (O.S.)
                        You don’t think it’s a little 
                        early?  Something like this could 
                        spook her.

           The Marines tie off the flag and step back.

                                 HERSCH MEYER (O.S.)
                        She’s not going to keep putting out 
                        for D grade intel.  I don’t care 
                        how dreamy Vanalden’s eyes are.

           Tyler turns to see Marshall, Val and Hersch gathered around 
           the conference table.

                                 TYLER
                        I didn’t think you noticed.

                                 HERSCH MEYER
                        I’m only human.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        What do you think, Ty?  Time to 
                        send some Drano down the pipe?

                                 TYLER
                        She’s ready to go. 

           Marshall considers this.  He looks to Hersch.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Got something in mind?

           Hersch slides out A SURVEILLANCE PHOTO of A THIN MAN WITH A 
           RED BEARD.

                                 ED MARSHALL (CONT’D)
                        Ruzicka?
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      44.

                                 HERSCH MEYER
                        It would alleviate some of the pain 
                        in my ass.

           Marshall turns to Val.  Val shrugs.

                                 VAL EVANS
                        We can sell it...if you’re sure 
                        they’re buying.

                                 TYLER
                        I think she’s pretty happy with 
                        what she’s gotten so far.

           Marshall taps the table, decision made.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Work up a file on Ruzicka.  
                        Contacts going back a year.  He 
                        approached us, gave us intel, 
                        including that Romanian scientist-

                                 VAL EVANS
                        Dodrescu.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Right.  Ty, drop it next week, then 
                        we’ll see how it goes.
                                 (eyeing Hersch)
                        Sound good?

                                 HERSCH MEYER
                        Yep-pers.
                                 (to Tyler)
                        Do it to it, Wonderboy.

           Hersch leaves.  TYLER FLIPS HIM OFF.

                                 VAL EVANS
                        You know there are cameras in here, 
                        right?

                                 TYLER
                        Yes, I do.

           INT. MALE NAMESTI 11, APT. 402 - NIGHT

           A FAT MANILA ENVELOPE sits next to a vase of YELLOW FLOWERS.  

           Move past the vase, through the apartment, to where steam 
           drifts from the crack in the bathroom door.  
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      45.

           We hear the sounds of Tyler and Jarmila in the shower.

                                                                      TIME CUT:

           Tyler lies under the covers, asleep.

           PAN TO the table, where the yellow flowers now sit alone.

           INT. MALE NAMESTI 11, APT. 402, BATHROOM - NIGHT

           The manila envelope lies open on the sink.

           Jarmila sits on the closed toilet, flipping through a State 
           Department file. 

           After a moment, she grins with satisfaction.  Her toes curl.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR (O.S.)
                        Ruzicka?

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, RYCHTAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           CLOSE ON: a framed photo on the wall - Zdenek Rychtar as a 
           younger man, wearing a fur hat.

                                 JOHNNY 1950 (O.S.)
                        I am as surprised as you are.

           He stands in the snow beside another man...a young, red-
           bearded VLADIMIR RUZIKA.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR (O.S.)
                        No, you’re as gullible as she is.

           Jarmila and Johnny 1950 watch Rychtar examine THE FORGED 
           DOCUMENTS.  

                                 JARMILA
                        Sir?

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Vladimir Ruzicka has served the 
                        Party with distinction for twenty-
                        two years.  I personally worked 
                        with him in Poland.  

           He tosses down the packet.  

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR (CONT’D)
                        This is inconclusive.  And it’s 
                        insulting.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      46.

                                 JARMILA
                        Sir, I beg to differ.  It’s all 
                        there.  Names, dates, locations.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        I’ve read the file, Agent.

           Jarmila barely hides her disgust.

                                 JARMILA
                        So, you’re just choosing to ignore 
                        the facts-

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Enough.

           Johnny 1950 leans forward, appeasing.

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                        Assistant Director, if Agent Hrbek 
                        is wrong, we lose very little.  But 
                        if she is right, and we do nothing-

                                 JARMILA
                        Then the treason is not his alone.

           Rychtar whips to Jarmila.  She meets his eyes.

           RYCHTAR GLARES, DECIDING...

           INT. CAFE SLOVAK - DAY

           A RED-BEARDED MAN (VLADIMIR RUZICKA) sits by the window in a 
           dingy cafe.  He drinks a flat orange soda.

           A FAT WOMAN wipes down the counter.

           Brakes squeak outside.  

           EXT. CAFE SLOVAK - DAY

           TWO MEN IN OVERCOATS climb out of the car and enter the cafe.

           THROUGH THE WINDOW, we see them approach Ruzicka.  They talk, 
           but we don’t hear.

           Ruzicka stands up, outraged.

           The men grab him by the arms and march him out.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      47.

           INT. CAFE SLOVAK - DAY

           The fat woman watches placidly as they bundle Ruzicka into 
           the black sedan.

           It pulls away with a squeak.

           She goes back to wiping the counter.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           Marketa hurries down the hall.  She raises her hand.

                                 MARKETA
                        Hey, you.

           At the front door, Jarmila turns.  Marketa catches up.  She 
           gives Jarmila’s arm a playful squeeze.

                                 MARKETA (CONT’D)
                        I hear you pulled off a big one.

           EXT. STB HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Jarmila and Marketa walk past the soldier on guard.  Jarmila 
           wraps a GREEN SCARF around her neck.

                                 JARMILA
                        Please.  I was handed a big one.

                                 MARKETA
                        I bet you were.

           Jarmila plays mock shocked.  Marketa nudges her as they walk.

                                 MARKETA (CONT’D)
                        Seriously.  It’s great.  Careers 
                        are built on these things.

           Jarmila allows herself a proud smile.

                                 JARMILA
                        All right, if you insist.

                                 MARKETA
                        We should celebrate.  Let me cook 
                        you dinner.  I’ll invite my 
                        brother...

           Marketa smiles mischievously.  
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      48.

           Jarmila finally shakes her head.

                                 JARMILA
                        I have work to do at home.

                                 MARKETA
                                 (pouting)
                        Heart breaker.   

           Marketa heads home.  Jarmila watches her go.

           INT. METRO TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

           Jarmila steps into the crowded train car, looking for a seat.

           She spies the man with the missing tooth.  He moves aside his 
           bag of laundry, clearing a spot.

           He smiles at her, hopeful.

           Jarmila just stares.

           EXT. U.S. EMBASSY - NIGHT

           Tyler says good night to the Marines at the door.  He heads 
           up the block.  He stops.

           THERE, ON THE CORNER, STANDS JARMILA.  

           SHE SMILES AT HIM, HOPEFUL.

           HE SMILES BACK, SURPRISED AND HAPPY.

           CUE MUSIC: ELVIS COSTELLO, “THE ONLY FLAME IN TOWN.”

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, INTERROGATION CELL - NIGHT

           Vladimir Ruzicka sits in a chair, hands cuffed behind him.  

           The door opens, shafting light onto the chained man.

           INT. MARKET - NIGHT

           Tyler buys a loaf of bread.  Jarmila picks out apples, a 
           wedge of cheese, some wine.

           THE OLD MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER smiles at the young couple.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      49.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, INTERROGATION CELL - NIGHT

           WHAP!  Vladimir Ruzicka’s head snaps back. 

           A THICK, YOUNG MAN WITH BLACK GLOVES BEATS HIM.

           Ruzicka’s cuffed hands clank against the metal chair.

           EXT. MUSIC STAND - NIGHT

           A SCRUFFY MAN sells bootleg cassettes on the street. 

           Jarmila peruses them.  She picks one.  Elvis Costello, 
           “Goodbye Cruel World.”

           Tyler makes the so-so gesture.  She buys it anyway.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, INTERROGATION CELL - NIGHT

           Ruzicka bends over, choking, exhausted.

           ZDENEK RYCHTAR STANDS IN THE DOORWAY TO THE TINY ROOM.

           The thick young man looks at him, breathing heavily.  He 
           shakes his head.

           Rychtar stares a long time at VLADIMIR, HIS FORMER COMRADE.  

           Then he reaches into his pocket and tosses the thug a pair of 
           WIRE CUTTERS.

           The thick young man pins down Ruzicka’s hand.  

           HE BENDS UP HIS PINKIE FINGER AND UNHINGES THE CLIPPERS.

           INT. MALE NAMESTI 11, APT. 402 - DAWN

           JARMILA’S TAPE DECK clicks off at the end of the tape.

           Tyler and Jarmila lie side by side in the morning sun.

                                 JARMILA
                        They seem made up.  Like mermaids.

                                 TYLER
                        They’re real.  If you’re lucky, you 
                        can see them right from the beach.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      50.

                                 JARMILA
                        There are no whales where I am 
                        from.  If you are lucky, you see a 
                        dog.

                                 TYLER
                        Is it a big dog?

                                 JARMILA
                        Not very.

           He smiles.  She kisses him.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        Why did you leave?

                                 TYLER
                        The U.S.?

                                 JARMILA
                        Home.

           He hesitates.

                                 TYLER
                        Because it stopped being that.

           He glances into her eyes, probing.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Could you ever leave?

           She smiles.

                                 JARMILA
                        I left home a long time ago.  Now I 
                        just live here.

           She points at her temple.

           Tyler takes her hand from her head and holds it.  

           She looks at the watch on his wrist.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        You will be late.

                                 TYLER
                        I’ll leave in a minute.

           She shoves him playfully out of bed.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      51.

                                 JARMILA
                        Get going.  The embassy will fall 
                        down without you.

           He picks up his pants and pulls them on.  He looks back at 
           her for a moment.

                                 TYLER
                        Can I bring you anything from work?

                                 JARMILA
                        No.  

           She hunkers back down under the covers

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        Not today.

           Tyler reaches for his shirt, thinking, a half smile playing 
           on his face.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, COMMISSARY - DAY

           Tyler follows Marshall, pushing his tray down the line with 
           other embassy workers.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        You sampled any of the local fare 
                        since you’ve gotten here? 
                                 (beat)
                        Other than the obvious?

                                 TYLER
                        I’ve had the odd dumpling.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        I’ll bet.

           Marshall chooses a hamburger.  Tyler picks out a salad.

                                 ED MARSHALL (CONT’D)
                        Christ, you probably use the gym, 
                        too.

           They carry their trays to a table.

                                 ED MARSHALL (CONT’D)
                        Looks like Ruzicka got called back 
                        to corporate. 

                                 TYLER
                        Performance review?
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      52.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        No corner office for Vladimir.

           Tyler smiles to himself.  

                                 ED MARSHALL (CONT’D)
                        I hate to blow smoke, but you’re 
                        approaching old block territory, 
                        Chip.

                                 TYLER
                        I think that’s a compliment.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        You’ve done good work. 

           Marshall dips a fry.

                                 ED MARSHALL (CONT’D)
                        Which is why we’re gonna back you 
                        off.

                                 TYLER
                        What?  Why?

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Because if we keep feeding them, 
                        they’re going to get full.  

           Tyler starts to object, then backs down.  

           Marshall takes this in.

                                 ED MARSHALL (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 TYLER
                        Nothing.  

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        I’m not taking away the honey pot 
                        for good, Ty.

           They meet eyes.  Marshall probes.  Tyler covers.

                                 TYLER
                        I’m just worried about letting the 
                        operation stall out.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Sure, you are.

           After a beat, Tyler fills his mouth with salad.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      53.

                                 ED MARSHALL (CONT’D)
                        Don’t see her for a few weeks.  
                        Give them a chance to miss you.  
                        Then, when they’re good and hungry, 
                        we’ll feed ‘em a whopper.  
                                 (biting his burger)
                        With fries.

           Tyler looks torn.

           INT. NEW TOWN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Jarmila sits in a dark booth, looking concerned.

                                 JARMILA
                        What’s wrong?

           Tyler sits across from her, staring at A ROAST DUCK waiting 
           untouched between them.

                                 TYLER
                        Hmm?

                                 JARMILA
                        Do you want me to ask if they have 
                        butterscotch ice cream?

           He looks up, surprised at her recall.  He smiles sadly.

                                 TYLER
                        No, it’s fine.

           He starts to cut into the duck, then stops.  He looks up.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        They’re asking questions at work.  

                                 JARMILA
                        Who is?

                                 TYLER
                        Guys from upstairs.  Spooks.
                                 (beat)
                        You know the man I gave to you to 
                        give to Radek?

           She nods.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Well, it seems they can’t find him 
                        now and they’re pretty upset.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      54.

           Jarmila sips her wine, worried.

                                 JARMILA
                        What did you say?

                                 TYLER
                        I told them Everett from Records 
                        takes really long lunches.  They’ll 
                        probably follow him for weeks.

                                 JARMILA
                        So...we are okay?

                                 TYLER
                        I think so.

           Jarmila nods, relieved.  Tyler still seems pensive.  

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Does Radek tell you anything about 
                        his job?

                                 JARMILA
                        No.  Never.

           He puts his fork down.

                                 TYLER
                        How about what they did to that 
                        guy? 

                                 JARMILA
                        That man was a traitor to his 
                        country.

                                 TYLER
                        Then what does that make me?

           She studies him.

                                 JARMILA
                        I think you are brave.

           He drinks his wine.

                                 TYLER
                        I wish I felt like how you see me.

                                 JARMILA
                        But I love that you do not.

           As she takes his hand...
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      55.

           PAN AWAY, down the row of booths, to WHERE MILOS SITS, FINGER 
           TO HIS EAR.

                                 JARMILA (MIC) (CONT’D)
                        I do not want a cowboy.

           EXT. NEW TOWN - NIGHT

           Tyler and Jarmila walk.  The wind blows.  She cuddles close, 
           but he seems stiff.

                                 JARMILA
                        My worried boy.

                                 TYLER
                        I’m fine.

                                 JARMILA
                        Fine?
                                 (kissing him)
                        Fine is for the old married couple.  
                        For the gloomy teenager.

           She slides her hands inside his coat.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        I can make you feel better than 
                        fine.

           He closes his eyes, nearly giving in.

                                 TYLER
                        I know.

           He starts walking again.  Her hands slide out of his coat.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        But maybe I shouldn’t.

           For a moment, she just stands there.

           EXT. METRO STOP - NIGHT

           Jarmila catches up to Tyler near the steps of the Metro.

                                 JARMILA
                        Where are you going?

           He nods at the blue-lit METRO STOP.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      56.

                                 TYLER 
                        This will get me home.

                                 JARMILA
                        Don’t be stupid.  Come back with me 
                        to the apartment.
                                 (nuzzling his neck)
                        I don’t want to be alone tonight.

                                 TYLER
                        You have Radek.

           She pulls back, stung.

                                 JARMILA
                        You are being mean.

                                 TYLER
                        I’m just telling the truth.

           He brushes her hair from her face.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        So that neither of us is confused.

                                 JARMILA 
                                 (hurt)
                        I am not confused.

           He kisses her forehead. 

                                 TYLER
                        Well, I am.

           FROM A DISTANCE: we see him hold her in the yellow cone of 
           the streetlight.

           Finally, he lets go and descends into the Metro.

           CLOSE AGAIN: she watches him go, then sighs, annoyed.  She 
           looks across the square to where...

           MILOS watches from a doorway.  He shrugs, “What can you do?”

           INT. METRO STATION - NIGHT

           Tyler waits on the platform.  Orange tiles line the tunnel.

           The train whooshes in.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      57.

           INT. METRO TRAIN - NIGHT

           A MIDDLE-AGED MAN in coveralls wakes as Tyler gets on.

           He eyes Tyler, then turns to the Czech book in his hands.

           Tyler sits in the middle of the otherwise empty car.  He 
           watches the man’s eyes droop, then close.

           Tyler looks at his reflection in the window, conflicted.

           The train pulls into a station.  Tyler checks his watch.  He 
           makes a decision.

                                 TYLER
                        Fuck it.

           He rises to go, but...

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN (O.S.)
                        It’s probably too late for that.

           Tyler turns to see A MAN IN HIS LATE 50’S (SPALDING 
           VANALDEN), sitting two rows behind him.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN (CONT’D)
                        She’s gone home by now.  And I’m 
                        assuming you don’t actually know 
                        where that is.

           Tyler blinks, surprised.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN (CONT’D)
                        Hi, Ty.

                                 TYLER
                        Hi, Dad.

           Spalding taps the seat next to him.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Sit down.

           Tyler does.  The train pulls out of the station.  For a 
           moment, they ride in silence.

                                 TYLER
                        So what are you-

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Had a little business in Leipzig.  
                        Thought I’d drop by.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      58.

                                 TYLER
                        It’s nice to see you.

           Spalding reaches into a bag at his feet.  He hands Tyler a 
           WRAPPED PRESENT.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Happy birthday.

                                 TYLER
                        It’s not for another two months.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        World’s spinning pretty fast these 
                        days.  Got to grab your windows.

                                 TYLER
                        Thanks.

           Tyler stares at the silvery patterned wrapping paper.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        How do you know I don’t know where 
                        she lives?

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Because you’re an honest spy.

                                 TYLER
                        You sure about that?

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Yeah.  I am.

           A moment passes.

                                 TYLER
                        But you’d know, wouldn’t you?  
                        Where she lives.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Oh, sure.

           The train pulls into another station.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN (CONT’D)
                        Want to walk?

                                 TYLER
                        Okay.

           They move to the door.  The workman wakes and watches them.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      59.

           Spalding leans to read the cover of his book.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                                 (in perfect Czech)
                        That’s a good one.

           EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - NIGHT

           Tyler and Spalding walk down the street.

                                 TYLER
                        I got a letter from Mom.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        She’s good about that.  
                        Correspondence.

                                 TYLER
                        She told me about Vic.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Vic?

                                 TYLER
                        Our dog.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Oh, sure.  Tough old trooper.

                                 TYLER
                        He’s dead.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Even tougher.

           They pass AN ANCIENT CHURCH.  A blackened STATUE OF A SAINT 
           raises its hand in blessing.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN (CONT’D)
                        So.  How’s work?

                                 TYLER
                        The operation’s going very well.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        So I hear.

           Tyler eyes his father.

                                 TYLER
                        You checking up on me?  
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      60.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Just water cooler stuff.

           They walk.  Tyler waits for his father to say more...but he 
           doesn’t.

                                 TYLER
                        It’s small time so far-

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Do you remember when I was detailed 
                        to the Philippines?

                                 TYLER
                        No.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        I would have told you I had to go 
                        Santa Fe to visit the job site.  
                        You were young.

                                 TYLER
                        Then, yes.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        I did a little diving there.  
                        Boracay.  The water’s like air, you 
                        can barely see it.

                                 TYLER
                        Sounds nice.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Actually, it gets boring after a 
                        while. 

           A couple approaches.  Spalding stops talking until they pass.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN (CONT’D)
                        Point is, you dive so deep and swim 
                        so long, it starts to feel natural.  
                        Like you could stay in the water 
                        forever.  Or - and this is weird, 
                        but it really occurred to me -  
                        maybe the fish would follow you out 
                        of the water when you left.
                                 (beat)
                        Thing is, either way, one of you’s 
                        going to wind up dead.

                                 TYLER
                        She’s not a fish.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        I know.
                                 (beat)
                        She’s much better looking.

           Tyler stops, forcing his father to turn.

                                 TYLER
                        I’m good on this, Dad.  I’m 
                        watching from six miles up.

           Spalding studies his son.  Then he starts walking again.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Not that you shouldn’t enjoy 
                        yourself.  I certainly miss the 
                        Philippines.  There isn’t anything 
                        to do in Moscow but drink and 
                        listen to Russians try to take a 
                        shit.
                                 (beat)
                        Why do they bug the bathrooms?

           EXT. PRAGUE STREETS, TYLER’S BLOCK - NIGHT

           Tyler and Spalding round the corner onto Tyler’s block.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Hey, how’s that roommate of yours?

                                 TYLER
                        Craig?

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        The one with all the hair.  What’s 
                        he doing now?

                                 TYLER
                        Investment banker.  Lives in 
                        Hartford.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        That’s a nice life, there.  Private 
                        sector.  

                                 TYLER
                        This one’s going okay.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        For now.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN (CONT'D)
                        We’ve got a tap on a guy in the 
                        KGB.  Fifth Chief Directorate, real 
                        hardliner.  You know the only thing 
                        his daughter wants for Christmas?

                                 TYLER
                        Peace on Earth?

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        MTV.  And sooner or later, he’s 
                        going to find a way to give it to 
                        her.

           They wait for a streetcar to pass.  Then they walk.

                                 TYLER
                        Someone’s got to do our job.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        And they will.  They’ll just get 
                        paid better.

           He stops.  He smiles for a moment at his son.  Then he 
           squeezes Tyler’s shoulder.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN (CONT’D)
                        A house.  In Brookline, maybe.  
                        Near enough to the supermarket that 
                        it won’t kill your whole Sunday if 
                        you run out of charcoal.

                                 TYLER
                        Mom got a gas grill last summer.

           Spalding nods down a cross street.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        This is where I get off.

           Tyler nods toward his apartment.

                                 TYLER
                        I can take the couch.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Marshall would know, and then he’d 
                        get pissed I didn’t call him to 
                        play tennis.

           Tyler raises up the present.

                                 TYLER
                        Thanks for this.

           A car rounds the corner down the street, heading their way.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Take care, Ty.

                                 TYLER
                        See you, Dad.

           Spalding Vanalden walks away.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Dad.

           Spalding turns.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        They weren’t fish, were they?

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Some of them were.

           He waves, then steps into an alley, disappearing entirely.

           Tyler stands on the corner of an empty street, holding a 
           wrapped present.

           INT. TYLER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Tyler sits down at his desk, contemplating the gift.

           Finally, he tears off the paper and opens the box.

           A WOODEN PUPPET lies on a bed of tissue paper.  He wears a 
           red hat and a toothy grin.

           Tyler picks it up by its strings.  It hangs in the air, 
           gesticulating.

           INT. TYLER’S APARTMENT - DAY

           THE PUPPET hangs on the wall in place of the dog picture.

           PAN TO THE WINDOW.  Down below, Tyler walks to work.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR (O.S.)
                        I’m taking you off Source Prep 
                        School.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, RYCHTAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Jarmila stares at Rychtar, shocked.  Johnny 1950 hovers.

                                 JARMILA
                        What?

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        You have not filed a report in over 
                        a month.  If your skills are no 
                        longer sufficient to maintain his 
                        interest, then it’s time to change 
                        the approach.

                                 JARMILA
                        He has been busy.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        He has been hiding.
                                 (to Johnny 1950)
                        Move Broucek in.

           Johnny 1950 reaches for the phone.

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                                 (into phone)
                        Connect me to Broucek.

                                 JARMILA
                        You have a man on him already?

           She shoots him a look, then turns to Rychtar.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        This won’t work.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Agent Broucek will present Vanalden 
                        with a sample of our evidence 
                        against him.  He will make it clear 
                        that a lack of cooperation will 
                        result in the delivery of that 
                        evidence to his ambassador.

           Jarmila scowls.

                                 JARMILA
                        If you want more, I can get more, 
                        but Tyler will not respond well to 
                        blackmail.  
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      65.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        A man can become compliant when 
                        presented with a photograph of his 
                        own weakness.

                                 JARMILA
                        You don’t know him like I do.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        You are correct, agent.  My 
                        knowledge of counter-espionage 
                        extends beyond the bedroom.  
                                 (to Johnny)
                        Does Broucek have him in sight?

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                        He’s about to make contact.

           Jarmila checks the INDUSTRIAL CLOCK over Rychtar’s head.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Where?

           Johnny opens his mouth to speak but...

                                 JARMILA
                        Ujzed Street.  Walking up the hill.

           Johnny blinks.

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                                 (surprised)
                        That’s right.

                                 JARMILA
                        Tell Broucek to stop.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Agent, this is no longer your 
                        operation.

                                 JARMILA
                        You’ll have better opportunities if 
                        you wait.  Don’t take him on a 
                        street that his colleagues walk on 
                        their way to the Embassy.

           Rychtar glares, but begrudgingly NODS to Johnny 1950.

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                                 (into phone)
                        Pull back.  
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      66.

                                 JARMILA
                        Let me talk to Broucek.

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                        What for?

                                 JARMILA
                        Do you want this to go easily or 
                        not?  I told you, I know this boy.

           Johnny 1950 looks to Rychtar.  Rychtar warily acquiesces.

           Johnny pushes the SPEAKERPHONE.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        The subject’s overcoat.  Is he 
                        wearing it, or does he have it over 
                        his shoulder?

                                 AGENT BROUCEK (O.S.)
                        Over his shoulder.

                                 JARMILA
                        Then you can back off.  He’s going 
                        the long way.  
                                 (to the room)
                        If it’s warm and he has time, he’ll 
                        take Trziste.

           They all wait.  Finally:

                                 AGENT BROUCEK (O.S.)
                        He’s turning.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Where?

                                 AGENT BROUCEK (O.S.)
                        Looks like Trziste.

           Johnny looks at Jarmila.  She shrugs.

           EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAY

           Tyler turns onto a crowded street.  A FARMERS MARKET bunches 
           people together, making it hard to navigate. 

           AGENT BROUCEK follows, a small radio in his lapel.

                                 JOHNNY 1950 (O.S.)
                        Where is he now?

                                 AGENT BROUCEK
                        He’s crossing the street.

           Tyler enters the crowd, disappearing into the mass of bodies.

                                 AGENT BROUCEK (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, RYCHTAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Rychtar looms over the phone.

                                 AGENT BROUCEK (O.S.)
                        I lost him.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Then find him.

                                 AGENT BROUCEK (O.S.)
                        It’s crowded.

           Johnny looks to Jarmila.  She remains calm.

                                 JARMILA
                        Agent.  Do you see the red awning 
                        down the street?

                                 AGENT BROUCEK (O.S.)
                        Yes.

                                 JARMILA
                        Try there.  And be discreet.

           EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAY

           Broucek sidles up to the window and peers in.

           IT’S A PET STORE.  Inside, Tyler stands at a row of cages, 
           OFFERING HIS FINGER TO A GNAWING PUPPY. 

                                 AGENT BROUCEK 
                        I have him.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR (O.S.)
                        What’s he doing?

                                 AGENT BROUCEK
                        Petting a puppy, sir.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, RYCHTAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Rychtar looks at Jarmila, puzzled.

                                 JARMILA
                        His dog died.  It’s in my report.

                                 AGENT BROUCEK (O.S.)
                        He’s moving.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Stay with him.

           EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAY

           Tyler walks.  Broucek follows, waiting for his opportunity.

           Tyler approaches a statue surrounded by a FLOWER BED.  He 
           looks around, furtive...then picks two yellow tulips.

                                 JOHNNY 1950 (O.S.)
                        What’s he doing now?

                                 AGENT BROUCEK
                        Stealing city property.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, RYCHTAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Jarmila blinks.  Rychtar leans toward the phone.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Repeat?

                                 AGENT BROUCEK (O.S.)
                        He picked some flowers.

           Jarmila thinks for a moment.  Then she realizes...

                                 JARMILA
                        Are they yellow?

                                 AGENT BROUCEK (O.S.)
                        Yes.

           She blinks, momentarily stunned.

           Johnny and Rychtar look at her curiously.     
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      69.

           EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAY

           Carrying the flowers, Tyler rounds a corner onto an empty 
           street.  Broucek follows.

                                 AGENT BROUCEK
                        He’s on Jalovcova Street.  He’s 
                        alone.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR (O.S.)
                        Enough of this.  Take him.

                                 JARMILA (O.S.)
                        Wait.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR (O.S.)
                        Why?

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, RYCHTAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Jarmila stares Rychtar down.

                                 JARMILA
                        Because he’s about to turn.

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                        And how would you know that?

                                 JARMILA
                        Do you even read my reports?

                                 AGENT BROUCEK (O.S.)
                        He’s turning.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Where?

                                 JARMILA
                        Male Namesti.

           EXT. MALE NAMESTI 11 - DAY 

           Tyler stands outside Number 11, looking up.

           Broucek waits behind a dumpster.

           After a moment, Tyler opens the door and enters.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      70.

           INT. MALE NAMESTI 11, FOYER - DAY

           Tyler stands before the row of wooden cubbyholes.

           Through the door, we can see Broucek in the street.

           Tyler finds the box for 402.  HE LAYS THE FLOWERS INSIDE.

           EXT. MALE NAMESTI 11 - DAY

           Broucek watches.  He speaks into his microphone.  We don’t 
           hear what he says.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, RYCHTAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Johnny and Rychtar listen to the speakerphone.  We don’t hear 
           what they hear.

           But Jarmila allows herself a small, vulnerable smile.

           EXT. MALE NAMESTI 11 - DAY

           Tyler leaves the building.

                                 AGENT BROUCEK
                        He’s leaving.  I can get to him 
                        now.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, RYCHTAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Rychtar opens his mouth to speak but stops.  

           He looks at Jarmila.

           Jarmila stares back.

           Rychtar scowls, but he leans toward the phone.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Hold off.  Let him go.

           EXT. MALE NAMESTI 11 - DAY

           Broucek turns back.  Tyler walks in the other direction.

           FOLLOW TYLER.  He looks into a STORE WINDOW...

           AND WATCHES BROUCEK WALK AWAY.  TYLER SMILES.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      71.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, C.I.A. SECTION - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON: A BLACK & WHITE SURVEILLANCE PHOTO of Jarmila. 

           Tyler stares at it in an open file: “OPERATION DAMSEL.”

           A staple perforates her hair, slightly tearing the photo.

           Tyler carefully pries off the staple with a letter opener.

           He eases the picture loose, then gently presses the staple 
           holes closed, smoothing her hair.

           Val Evans walks by.

                                 VAL EVANS
                        Working late, Tyler?

           Tyler closes the folder and glances at the clock.

                                 TYLER
                        Guess so.

                                 VAL EVANS
                        You’re a great American.

           INT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - NIGHT

           THE OLD TV plays footage of a Soviet parade.  Missile 
           launchers roll past a reviewing stand.

                                 KAREL (O.S.)
                        We were coming together at night.  
                        Professors, doctors, writers... 

           PULL BACK: Tyler and Karel drink beer over a chessboard.

                                 KAREL (CONT’D)
                        We gave lectures.  Talked.   
                        Derrida came once.  

                                 TYLER
                        I read him in college.  I didn’t 
                        get it.

                                 KAREL
                        That’s because he’s full of shit.

                                 TYLER
                        Ah.

           Karel tilts back his beer with his three-fingered hand.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      72.

                                 KAREL
                        It didn’t take long for StB to hear 
                        about it.

           He knocks over a chess piece but doesn’t notice.

                                 KAREL (CONT’D)
                        They watched us.  Taped us.   
                        Followed us home.  Some nights, not 
                        everyone would make the meeting.  
                        We knew where they were instead.

                                 TYLER
                        You were just talking.

           Karel gives him a look, then nods at the Soviets on TV.

                                 KAREL
                        And that’s just a parade.

           Karel sees the fallen chess piece.  He stands it back up.

                                 KAREL (CONT’D)
                        When StB finally picked me up, I 
                        told them to piss in the wind.  
                        They sent me to Plzen.  They wanted 
                        names.  I said I forgot.

           He indicates his hand.

                                 KAREL (CONT’D)
                        They brought out their tool box.  I 
                        began to remember.

                                 TYLER
                        How long were you there?

                                 KAREL
                        Until I ran out of names.

           He looks at Tyler, bleary, drunk.

                                 KAREL (CONT’D)
                        And the world was robbed of a great 
                        pianist.

           Tyler blinks.

                                 TYLER
                        Really, did you...

           Then Karel starts to laugh.  Tyler smiles.

           EXT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - NIGHT

           Tyler and Karel step out of the bar.  They button their coats 
           and prepare to head their separate ways.

                                 KAREL
                        You are seeing your friend tonight?

                                 TYLER
                        Who?

           Karel gives him a look.  Tyler shakes his head.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        No.  Not tonight.

           He watches Karel sway a little.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        You need any help getting home?

                                 KAREL
                        Fuck you...
                                 (smiling)
                        You are a good boy, Tyler.

                                 TYLER
                        Thank you.

                                 KAREL
                        You don’t say much.  But you 
                        listen.  And you buy the drinks.

           He stares at Tyler a bit too long.

                                 KAREL (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes I wonder why.

                                 TYLER
                                 (shrugging)
                        I need to practice my English.

                                 KAREL
                        Not much chance to do that at the 
                        United States Embassy, I suppose.

           Tyler just smiles.  A moment passes.

                                 TYLER
                        Good night, Karel.

           Karel nods and shuffles off.  Tyler watches him go.

           EXT. TYLER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Tyler walks up to his building, slightly drunk.

           Then he stops, noticing A FOLDED NOTE taped to his door.

           He glances around, then unfolds the note and reads it.

           INT. MALE NAMESTI 11, STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Tyler runs up the stairs, excited.

           INT. MALE NAMESTI 11, HALLWAY - NIGHT

           He knocks with one hand, turning the knob with the other, not 
           waiting for an answer.

           INT. MALE NAMESTI 11, APT. 402 - NIGHT

           The apartment lies dark.  Tyler steps inside.

                                 TYLER
                        Jarmila?

           Light seeps from below the bathroom door.  It opens slowly.  
           She stands there, backlit.

                                 JARMILA
                                 (weak, teary)
                        Tyler...

           He reaches for the wall switch.  

           Jarmila turns her head at the sudden light, but she can’t 
           hide her UGLY, PURPLE BLACK EYE.

           SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE: Tyler seems to twitch at the sight of 
           her injury.  He rushes to her.

           She tries to hide it, but he gently turns her face.

                                 TYLER
                        What happened?

                                 JARMILA
                        Radek was angry.

                                 TYLER
                        Why?
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      75.

                                 JARMILA
                        Because I have had nothing for him.

           Tyler’s jaw tightens.  She sees him grow angry.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        When he drinks, he is not himself-

                                 TYLER
                        Don’t.

           He raises his thumb to just touch the bruise.  She winces.

                                 JARMILA
                        I’m sorry, Tyler.  I know you said 
                        to stay away.

           She looks right at him, her eyes red from crying.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        I did not know who else to tell.

           SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE: Tyler takes a step back, shaking his 
           head, frustrated, angry.  He turns toward the wall.

           Tyler throws a punch at the wall.  Right before it connects, 
           we...

                                                                     SMASH CUT:

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, INFIRMARY - NIGHT

           Tyler sits on an exam table.  A NURSE ices his swollen hand.

                                 NURSE
                        You get in a fight?

                                 TYLER
                        I slipped on the stairs.

           INT. MALE NAMESTI 11, APT. 402 - NIGHT

           SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE: Tyler smashes his fist into the wall.

           POP.  Tyler reels back, gripping his wrist.

                                 TYLER
                        Ow.  Fuck.

           Jarmila rushes to him.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      76.

                                 JARMILA
                        What are you doing?

           Tyler looks up at her, tears of pain in his eyes.

                                 TYLER
                        You can’t let him do that to you.

           She studies his face.

                                 JARMILA
                        I didn’t let him do anything.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, JOHNNY 1950’S OFFICE - DAY

           Johnny 1950 looks at us, considering.

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                        All right.  But it must look real.

           REVERSE: Jarmila waits.

                                 JARMILA
                        No.

           She brushes her hair back, exposing her full, delicate face.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        It must be real.

           Johnny hesitates.  He steps out from behind his desk. 

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        Do it.

           He grimaces, then, almost spastically, SLAPS HER.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                                 (sighing)
                        Am I to have gotten in a fight on 
                        the playground?

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                        I don’t think-

                                 JARMILA
                        Is Radek a schoolgirl?

           Annoyed, Johnny hits her again, harder.  It snaps her head to 
           the side.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      77.

           She opens her eyes to find herself staring at a videotape on 
           his desk.  

           The label reads, “1 KAMERA: VANALDEN: 19.00-23.00.”  In his 
           childish scrawl, Johnny has rated it FOUR STARS.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        You degenerate.

           She turns back toward him.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        You pathetic...

           She steps forward.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        Little...

           She gets in his face.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        Faggot.

           Red-faced, Johnny cocks his fist and PUNCHES.

                                                                     SMASH CUT:

           INT. MALE NAMESTI 11, APT. 402 - NIGHT

           Silence.  

           Tyler and Jarmila hold each other on the bed, fully dressed.

           With his good hand, he strokes her hair.  She kisses his 
           wounded wrist.

           SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE: Tyler gently kisses Jarmila’s face.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, INFIRMARY - NIGHT

           The nurse finishes bandaging Tyler’s hand.

                                 NURSE
                        I slipped once at Thanksgiving.  
                        Dropped a whole dish of marshmallow 
                        squash.  Everybody had a big laugh.

           She hands him two painkillers and a paper cup of water.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      78.

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        You’re lucky no one was watching 
                        you.

           He takes the pills and washes them down.  

                                 TYLER
                        Someone’s always watching.

           He tries to moves his wrist.  He winces.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

           Jarmila stands at the mirror, staring at her black eye.

           She takes out a make-up kit.  Slowly and methodically, she 
           begins to re-cover the bruise.

           ANOTHER WOMAN comes in to wash her hands.  As she does, she 
           looks up and notices Jarmila’s bruise.

           They meet eyes in the mirror.  After a moment...

                                 WOMAN
                        Men.

           Jarmila looks from the woman back to her own, impassive face.

                                 JARMILA
                        Do you not have a job to do?

           The woman reacts, stung.

           EXT. STB HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           FROM ACROSS THE STREET: Jarmila exits StB HQ.  Pulling her 
           knit hat down against the cold, she sets off up the street.

           From a dark doorway, TYLER WATCHES.

           INT. METRO STATION - NIGHT

           From the platform, we see Jarmila sitting in the subway car.

           The doors shut.  The train passes us, allowing us to see...

           Tyler in the next car, following.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      79.

           EXT. PRAGUE METRO STATION, OPATOV - NIGHT

           Jarmila climbs the steps, emerging in suburban Prague. 

           After a long moment, so does Tyler.

           EXT. JARMILA’S APARTMENT BLOCK - NIGHT

           From a distance, we see Jarmila stop to talk to Mrs. 
           Varadiova.

           Jarmila keeps her hat low, covering her eye.  She buys yellow 
           roses and heads for the door.

           Across the concrete courtyard, Tyler watches her go inside.

           His eyes scan the tower block.  Identical windows stare back.

           Finally, a light goes on on the second floor.

           He can see Jarmila take off her coat and hat.

           The light in the kitchen goes on.  Tyler can see Jarmila at 
           the refrigerator.  She takes out a jar of pickles...

           And holds it to her eye.

           Tyler rests his head against a brick wall, watching.  He 
           absently cradles his bandaged wrist.

           She goes into the other room.  After a moment, blue TV light 
           flickers.

           She wraps herself in a blanket and sits.  

           Tyler squints, but he can’t see what she’s watching.

           INT. JARMILA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           FROM JARMILA’S WINDOW, we see Tyler staring up.

           PAN TO Jarmila sitting on the couch.  She holds the pickles 
           gingerly to her eye.

           She raises a remote control.  She presses a button.

           A TAPE rewinds.

           PAN TO THE TV.  On the screen, grainy SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE 
           shows Tyler standing in Apt. 402.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      80.

           He goes to her, strokes her face, steps away...

           And punches the wall.

           The image pauses.  Jarmila studies Tyler’s face, contorted in 
           anger.

           She presses rewind.  Tyler steps back from the wall and 
           returns to touching her face.

           She presses play.  Tyler’s face is all gentle concern.

           Then something happens.  She speaks, he reacts...and punches 
           the wall.

           Pause.  Rewind.  Punch.

           Pause.

           Jarmila lowers the jar and stares at Tyler, something like 
           wonder in her eyes.

           INT. TYLER’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Tyler lies in bed.  He holds his hand out above him, slowly 
           unwinding the bandage...

                                 TYLER (O.S.)
                        I need to see you...

           He slowly winds it again.

                                 TYLER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        No, not at the apartment...I’ll 
                        pick you up... 

           After a moment, he stands.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, GARAGE - DAY

           Tyler signs a clipboard and hands it to THE GARAGE ATTENDANT.  

                                 TYLER (O.S.)
                        I have something.  A package...  
                        It’s got to be now...

           The attendant hands over a set of keys.

                                 TYLER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Later’s no good... 
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      81.

           EXT. MALE NAMESTI 11 - DAY

           Jarmila waits on the cobblestones in front of the building.

                                 MARKETA (O.S.)
                        At least let Milos put a wire on 
                        you.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Marketa stands in the doorway as Jarmila changes clothes.  
           Jarmila turns, wearing just her bra and panties.

                                 JARMILA
                        And where exactly would you like 
                        him to put it?

           EXT. MALE NAMESTI 11 - DAY

           At the sound of an engine, Jarmila turns.  A BMW pulls up.

           She leans to the open window.  Tyler smiles at the wheel.

                                 TYLER
                        Hop in.  I borrowed my parents’ 
                        car.

           She gets in.  The car pulls away.

           After a moment, A BLACK SKODA follows, MILOS at the wheel.

           INT. BMW - DAY

           Jarmila gives Tyler a kiss on the cheek. 

                                 JARMILA
                        Some big mystery.

                                 TYLER
                        I thought it might be nice to get 
                        out of Dodge.

           She peeks out the side mirror.

           ANGLE ON MIRROR: Milos and the Skoda follow.

                                 JARMILA
                        I don’t know what that means.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      82.

           INT./EXT. BMW/SKODA/PRAGUE STREETS - DAY

           Tyler drives along the Vltava at a leisurely pace.

           Milos keeps up, 30 meters behind.

           Jarmila tenses as Tyler glances in the rearview mirror.

                                 JARMILA
                        Where are we going?

                                 TYLER
                        Right now, we’re just going.

           He hits the turn signal.  Click-click.  Click-click.

           Behind them, Milos watches Tyler slowly change lanes.  He 
           does the same.

           Tyler checks the mirror again.

                                 JARMILA
                        Are you all right?

                                 TYLER
                        Fine.
                                 (beat)
                        You?

           She stares straight out at the road.

                                 JARMILA
                        I am good.

           Tyler comes to a red light.  He idles.

           Milos has no choice.  He pulls up directly behind Tyler.  

           In her mirror, Jarmila can see Milos trying to look 
           inconspicuous.  She presses her fingers to her eyes.

           The light...takes...forever.

           Tyler deliberately adjusts the rearview mirror.  

           Jarmila cracks.  She turns on the radio.  

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        May we listen to something?

           KAREL GOTT’S “LADY CARNIVAL” plays over the rest of the

           The light turns green.

           Tyler presses the gas.  So does Milos, following the BMW onto 
           the highway.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        Have you ever been out of the city 
                        before?

                                 TYLER
                        Not this city.

           He touches her leg.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, I’ve got maps.

           She checks the side mirror.  Milos still follows closely.

           Ahead, TWO TRUCKS slowly chug in a row down the highway.  The 
           rear one signals to pass.

           Tyler suddenly accelerates, passing both trucks.  

           Milos downshifts, but he loses ground.

           The second truck pulls up.

           Now Tyler’s got one truck on his right and one behind him.

           Karel Gott sings.

           Stuck behind the two trucks, Milos can no longer see the BMW.

           Jarmila checks the mirror.  All she can see is the truck’s 
           grill.  

           Tyler slows.  He motors along with the lumbering trucks.

                                 JARMILA
                        You seemed to be going somewhere 
                        for a moment there.

                                 TYLER
                        Did I?

           TYLER STEERS ONTO AN OFF-RAMP.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        I guess I did.

           HE DRIVES OFF AS THE TWO TRUCKS SPEED UP.  MILOS FOLLOWS THE 
           TRUCKS.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      84.

           In the rearview, Jarmila spies the Skoda speeding away.  She 
           turns to the window and rolls her eyes.

           EXT. CESKY KRUMLOV - DAY

           The BMW sits parked on the side of the road.

           EXT. CESKY KRUMLOV, WOODS - DAY

           Tyler leads Jarmila on a hike through the woods.  He carries 
           his backpack slung over his shoulder.

           Jarmila looks back.  The path twists and turns into the 
           undergrowth.

                                 TYLER
                        You coming?

           She turns toward him, pulling her hair back.

                                 JARMILA
                        Of course.

           EXT. CESKY KRUMLOV, FIELDS - DAY

           Tyler leads them across a green field.  

           Jarmila picks up a handful of pebbles.  She tosses them at 
           the back of his head, one at a time.

           He ignores it.  Again.  And again.

           Finally, he turns around.

           She smiles.

           EXT. CESKY KRUMLOV, MEADOW - DAY

           Tyler and Jarmila lie on a blanket at the edge of the woods.

           In the distance, a castle dominates a red-roofed town.

           Tyler opens A BOTTLE OF WINE.

                                 TYLER
                        The French ambassador gave it to 
                        our ambassador.  
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      85.

                                 JARMILA
                        And she gave it to you?

           Tyler looks at her, dead serious.

                                 TYLER
                        Yes.

           She smiles.

                                                                      TIME CUT:

           Tyler and Jarmila lie on their sides, sipping wine.

                                 JARMILA
                        Tomas was two years older.  We were 
                        in his father’s apartment after 
                        school.  It passed by in a few 
                        seconds.

                                 TYLER
                        I bet you were pretty as a girl.

                                 JARMILA
                        Boys looked at me.  

                                 TYLER
                        I would have looked.

                                 JARMILA
                        I didn’t want them to.

           Tyler says nothing.  She eyes him.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        You’re a boy.  You know what boys 
                        think.

                                 TYLER
                        I apologize.

                                                                      TIME CUT:

           Tyler and Jarmila lie on their backs, the wine bottle empty.

                                 JARMILA
                        How many bedrooms?

                                 TYLER
                        At least three.  And then a den on 
                        the first floor with a foldaway.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      86.

                                 JARMILA
                        I want a nice kitchen.

           He looks up, surprised.

                                 TYLER
                        You don’t cook.

                                 JARMILA
                        But I would still want one.

                                 TYLER
                        Okay.  Done.  Amana Radarange, the 
                        whole thing.

           She smiles.  She tests out the word.

                                 JARMILA
                        Massachusetts.

                                                                      TIME CUT:

           Tyler and Jarmila stare up at the darkening clouds.

                                 TYLER
                        I lied to you.

           She looks at the sky, waiting.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        The ambassador didn’t give me the 
                        wine.

           She smiles.  

                                 JARMILA
                        It’s okay.

           A long moment passes.

                                 TYLER
                        That’s not the only lie I’ve told 
                        you.

           She thinks.

                                 JARMILA
                        It’s okay.

           He stares intently at the clouds.  Then:

                                 TYLER
                        Have you ever lied to me?
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      87.

           She takes a long moment to decide.  Without looking at him, 
           she takes his hand.

                                 JARMILA
                        Yes.

           Tyler thinks about this as the first rain drop falls.

                                 TYLER
                        I would do anything for you, you 
                        know.

           She closes her eyes, the rain landing lightly on her skin.

                                 JARMILA
                        I know.

                                                                      TIME CUT:

           Tyler and Jarmila make love.  They’re tender and slow, most 
           of their clothes still on.

           The rain falls in fat, wet drops.

           INT. BMW - NIGHT

           The wipers squeak against the glass as Tyler heads back to 
           the city.

           Jarmila reclines in the passenger seat, eyes closed, her hand 
           entwined with Tyler’s.

           EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - NIGHT

           Tyler drives back along the Vltava.  He stops at a red light.

           Ahead of him, the lights of an apartment building blaze.  All 
           eight windows teem with people.

           Suddenly, he hears a noise.  He rolls down his window, and 
           hears it again: CHEERING.

           He taps Jarmila on the leg.  She stirs.

           EXT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - NIGHT

           People crowd the street.  Cars sit in the road.

           Tyler leads Jarmila to the front door of the Wounded Bear.  
           Dozens of people pack the bar.  
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      88.

           Karel and a handful of others peer through the window at the 
           television inside.

           Tyler grabs Karel.

                                 TYLER
                        What’s going on?  

           Karel only now sees Tyler and Jarmila. 

                                 KAREL
                        Where have you been?  

           He points back to the TV, astonished.

                                 KAREL (CONT’D)
                        They just tore down the Berlin 
                        Wall.

           Jarmila steps next to Karel to get a better look at the TV.  

           ON SCREEN: BY THE GLARE OF WORK LIGHTS, A BULLDOZER RAMS INTO 
           THE BERLIN WALL.  A SECTION OF IT TOPPLES.  GERMANS CHEER.

           The crowd in the bar screams.  

           THE BAR MATRON pushes her way outside, carrying a tray of 
           beer.

           Karel and the other men take theirs, leaving two steins.

           The matron looks at Tyler and Jarmila, who stand there, 
           stunned.

                                 BAR MATRON
                        Well?

           They take the last two beers, somehow reluctant. 

           Karel thrusts his mug into the air.

                                 KAREL
                        To justice! 
                                 (the men toast)
                        To patience!
                                 (they toast again)
                        Fuck it, who can wait, here’s to 
                        justice again!

           The men send up a cheer.  Karel gulps his beer.  

           Tyler and Jarmila just sip theirs.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      89.

                        What is wrong with you two?  Drink!

                        The future has cracked wide open.  
                        You’re free.  

           TYLER AND JARMILA JUST STAND THERE, LOOKING LOST.

                        It was at ten o’clock that the East 
                        German military brought in their 
                        heavy equipment.  But the wall had 
                        been up for twenty-nine years, and 
                        it took some force to bring down.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Jarmila walks down a hallway, only to see...

           MARKETA hurrying past in a coat, carrying a box of files.

                                 BBC REPORTER (O.S.)
                        This is the middle of the 
                        checkpoint.  

           Jarmila turns to talk to her, but Marketa just backs out the 
           door, worried.

                                 BBC REPORTER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        The gates have been opened. 

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           Jarmila enters to chaos.  Agents man the phones, jabbering in 
           Czech, Russian, Romanian.

                                 BBC REPORTER (O.S.)
                        The police are making no attempt to 
                        stop people as they go through and 
                        come back.

           Clerks rush past.  Maps chart road closures across the city.

           Johnny 1950 stands in the middle of the room, frazzled.

                                 BBC REPORTER (O.S.) (CONT’D)

           In his office, Zdenek Rychtar yells at someone on the phone.  
           He looks up and sees Jarmila.  He scowls.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, C.I.A. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

                                 MARGARET THATCHER (ON TV)
                        I watched the scenes on television 
                        last night, and again this morning.  
                        You see the joy on people’s faces 
                        and you see what freedom means to 
                        them.  It makes you realize that 
                        you can’t stifle or suppress 
                        people’s desire for liberty.

                                 HERSCH MEYER (O.S.)
                        Shit.

           PULL BACK to see Hersch, Val and Tyler glumly watching TV.

                                 HERSCH MEYER (CONT’D)
                        I’m out of a job.

           ED MARSHALL ENTERS.  He switches off the TV.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Team, we just got our two minute 
                        warning.  Even the hawks at State 
                        think this is it.

                        There’s no chance Moscow might try 
                        a good, old-fashioned crackdown?

                        The dam’s broken.  We got word out 
                        of Sofia ten minutes ago.  Zhivkov 
                        was just ousted by his Politburo. 

                                 TYLER
                        What’s next?

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        State figures the Czechs are going 
                        to jump to the head of the line.  

                                 VAL EVANS
                        So it’s Havel?

                                 HERSCH MEYER
                        Or one of his friends.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      91.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Look, our primary job now is to 
                        sift the fallout for gold.  If the 
                        Communists bail, there are going to 
                        be a lot of spooks in the wind, and 
                        not all of them want to go house 
                        hunting in Moscow.

           Tyler straightens.

                                 TYLER
                        So we can bring our sources in?

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Depends on what they’re offering.  
                        We can’t just take anybody looking 
                        for a free pass on fifty years of 
                        being a dick.  As of now, any 
                        contact looking to defect has to 
                        grade out at A or above.

                                 TYLER
                        That’s a little stiff.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        It’s always standing room only on 
                        the last helicopter out.

                                 VAL EVANS
                                 (shrugging)
                        I got a couple.

                                 HERSCH MEYER
                        Me, too.

           They all look at Tyler.  He says nothing.  

           EXT. STB HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           A CIRCLE OF CIVILIANS stands in the street, singing.

           On the other side of a barricade, ARMED SOLDIERS stare.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, RYCHTAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           From outside, we hear the singing.

           A BLANK SPOT marks where Ruzicka’s picture once hung.

           PAN ACROSS THE REMAINING PHOTOS: Rychtar with Leonid 
           Brezhnev, Rychtar with Czechoslovak President Gustáv Husák, 
           Rychtar in full dress uniform.

           TV LIGHT flickers across the framed glass.

                                 TYLER (ON TV)
                        They’re real.  If you’re lucky, you 
                        can see them right from the beach.

           SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE OF TYLER AND JARMILA PLAYS ON A TV.

           Zdenek Rychtar barely notices.  HE RIFLES THROUGH FILES 
           STACKED ON HIS DESK.

                                 JARMILA (ON TV)
                        There are no whales where I am 
                        from.  If you are lucky, you see a 
                        dog.

           Rychtar dumps a box out on the floor, unable to find what 
           he’s looking for.

                                 TYLER (ON TV)
                        Is it a big dog?

                                 JARMILA (ON TV)
                        Not very.

           They laugh.  Rychtar glares.  He mutes the TV.  

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Jarmila sorts her files.  Around her, other agents do the 
           same.  

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR (O.S.)
                        Agent Hrbek.

           She turns.  Rychtar stands in his office door.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, RYCHTAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Jarmila closes the door behind her.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Each agent was asked to turn over 
                        their source files.

                                 JARMILA
                        I did.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      93.

                        Where is the file on Source Prep 
                        School?

                                 JARMILA
                        That’s an ongoing operation.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        I didn’t ask you to discriminate.  

           She hesitates.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR (CONT’D)
                        Your operation is no different than 
                        any other.  Or did you think it 
                        was?

           Her eyes glance over at the TV screen.  She and Tyler whisper 
           to each other in grainy black and white.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR (CONT’D)
                        Prague is not Berlin. 

                                 JARMILA
                        I know that.

           He gestures to the crowd outside the window.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        So you believe all of this will 
                        amount to nothing.  

           She eyes the files scattered across the floor.

                                 JARMILA
                        I wonder if you do, Assistant 
                        Director.

           He steps out from behind his desk.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        What do you think is the 
                        alternative?  That the fraternity 
                        boy is going to take you home to 
                        Connect-icut?

                                 JARMILA
                        It’s Massachusetts.

           Rychtar smiles, smug.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        How would the conversation go?  
                        “Mother, I would like you to meet 
                        Jarmila.  She made love with me in 
                        exchange for state secrets.”

           She opens the door.  

                                 JARMILA
                        I will get you the file.

           He grabs her arm.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        You are a joke he will tell at 
                        country club parties.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Jarmila sits at her desk, flustered.  She opens a drawer, 
           pushing aside sheaves of carbon paper.  

           Hidden underneath lies a thick file.

           Jarmila flips it open.  

           A SURVEILLANCE SHOT of Tyler stares up at her.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, C.I.A. SECTION - DAY

           Tyler catches Ed Marshall as he heads for the elevator.

                                 TYLER
                        Ed.

           Marshall waves Tyler to walk with him.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        I’ve got a call with Langley in 
                        five minutes.

                                 TYLER
                        It’s about my op.

           Jarmila steps out of the gray building.

                                 ED MARSHALL (O.S.)
                        Get your licks in while you can, 
                        kid.

           Across the street, two girls glue up Student Strike posters.

                                 ED MARSHALL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I can’t imagine StB’s going to keep 
                        that one running much longer.

           Jarmila stares impassively at the image on the poster: A 
           NOBLE YOUNG MAN WAVING A CZECH FLAG.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, C.I.A. SECTION - DAY

           The elevator opens.  Marshall and Tyler get on.

                                 TYLER
                        What if I could bring her in?

           Marshall looks at him skeptically.  The doors close.

           EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAY

           Jarmila walks, preoccupied.

                                 TYLER (O.S.)
                        She has intel.  She knows things.

           A teenager paints on the Lennon wall, “EVERYBODY’S GOT 
           SOMETHING TO HIDE CEPT FOR ME AND MY MONKEY.”

                                 ED MARSHALL (O.S.)
                        Except for the fact you’ve been 
                        lying to her for a year.

           Across the street, two cops look at him...but do nothing.

           Tyler and Marshall ride the small elevator.

                        She hasn’t exactly been straight 
                        with me.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        You want her to bite into an apple

           Jarmila rounds the corner...

                                 ED MARSHALL (O.S.)
                        This girl thinks she’s a hero.

           AND SEES TYLER SITTING ON THE FRONT STOOP OF THE APARTMENT.

                                 ED MARSHALL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        How’s she going to feel when she 
                        finds out you made her a traitor?

           They stare at each other.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler looks at Marshall, frustrated.

                        What’s going to happen to her?

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        She’ll deal, Ty.  She’s a pro.

           The elevator doors open.  Marshall steps out.  He takes one 
           last look at his protege.

                                 ED MARSHALL (CONT’D)
                        And so are you.

           Tyler stays on the elevator.  The doors close.

           EXT. MALE NAMESTI 11 - DAY

           Tyler and Jarmila hold each other.  They look up as a few 
           Czechs trickle down the street, toting flags.

           Tyler turns to Jarmila.

                                 TYLER
                        Do you want to go upstairs?

           The trickle becomes a crowd, streaming past.  A few students 
           carry posters of VACLAV HAVEL’S FACE.

           The chant of the crowd drifts in:

                                 CROWD
                        Freedom.  Truth.  Freedom.  Truth.

           Jarmila stares into Tyler’s eyes...and shakes her head.

           EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAY

           Tyler and Jarmila walk next to each other, isolated in a sea 
           of celebrating Czechoslovakians.  

           A BEARDED MAN climbs halfway up a light pole.

                                 BEARDED MAN
                        Kick them out!  Send them home to 
                        Moscow!

           The crowd cheers.

           Tyler glances at Jarmila, who stares worriedly at the man on 
           the pole.

                                                                      TIME CUT:

           The crowd chants.

                        BORDERS, OPEN MINDS!

           Tyler and Jarmila watch, the only ones not chanting.

           EXT. WENCESLAS SQUARE - DAY

           The marchers round a corner onto the boulevard, where...

           A MASSIVE CROWD spreads out like a sea.  CZECH TRICOLOR FLAGS 
           wave throughout the throng.  

                                                                      TIME CUT:

           RIOT POLICE block a side street.  They hold plexiglas shields 
           and look nervous.

           PROTESTERS stand before them, flowers in their hands.

                                 CROWD
                        We have clean hands!  We have clean 
                        hands!

           Someone gives Tyler a flower.  He doesn’t know what to do 
           with it. 

                                                                      TIME CUT:

           Jarmila watches a group of teenagers tug on a RED STAR 
           attached to a balcony’s railing.  

           It breaks free...turning over in the air as it falls...

           SMASH.  It shatters on the pavement.  The crowd whoops, 
           crunching the red glass under their feet. 

                                                                      TIME CUT:

           The crowd flows toward the impressive MUSEUM at the far end 
           of the square.  

           Tyler and Jarmila are pulled along. 

           They get thrown together.  Her face brushes his.  She looks 
           like she could almost cry.

           Then, softly, so we can barely hear her:

                                 JARMILA
                        I want to see the whales.

           HE HEARS HER.  He blinks.  

                                 TYLER
                        What?

           JUST THEN, A GROUP OF CELEBRANTS PRESS THROUGH, WAVING A 
           LARGE FLAG AND BLOWING TRUMPETS.

           Tyler and Jarmila look at each other as THE REVELLERS FORCE 
           THEM APART.  

           FADE SOUND TO SILENCE.

           The waving flag breaks their view: 

           Her face, questioning...FLAG...

           His face, confused...FLAG...

           Her face, frowning...FLAG...

           His face, resigned...

           THE FLAG WAVES.  THE CROWD SURGES.

                                                                      TIME CUT:

           FADE SOUND UP.  The crowd chants and sings.
                                               Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      99.

           They press toward THE EQUESTRIAN STATUE in front of the 
           museum.

           SAINT WENCESLAS stares down at them, impassive.

           It cleaves the crowd.

           Tyler looks to find Jarmila being moved in the other 
           direction.

           She meets his eyes, but has to turn away to keep on her feet.

           The crowd moves Tyler.  He turns away, too.  

           The crowd chants.

                                 CROWD
                        Freedom by Christmas!  Freedom by 
                        Christmas!

           We see both of them grow smaller in the crowd...

           Until they’re lost in the picture of history.

           INT. MALE NAMESTI 11, APT. 402 - DAY

           SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE: THE APARTMENT STANDS EMPTY AND STILL. 

           EXT. MOST LEGII - NIGHT

           Zdenek Rychtar walks across A BRIDGE, his hands thrust deep 
           into his overcoat.  Behind him, the National Theater looms.

           Carloads of students pass, shouting for joy.

           EXT. STRELECKY OSTROV - NIGHT

           AN ISLAND in the middle of the Vltava.

           Rychtar makes his way down a flight of stairs.  

           In the light of a street lamp, ED MARSHALL waits.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Dobry vecer.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Good evening.

           Marshall leads the StB Assistant Director to a bench.
                                              Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      100.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR (CONT’D)
                        I’ve seen you once before.  Warsaw. 
                        1980.  You were thinner then.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        I used to jog.  Then I slipped a 
                        disc and...phht. 

           They watch the Vltava slip by in front of them.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Is there a policy?

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        A new one every day.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        I cannot stay here.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        I can see where it would be 
                        awkward.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        My work on behalf of the state will 
                        undoubtedly be...

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Misconstrued.

           Rychtar nods.

                                 ED MARSHALL (CONT’D)
                        For the right people with the right 
                        knowledge, our light is always on.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        What is the procedure?

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        You open up your mouth and 
                        something interesting comes out.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                                 (offended)
                        Right here.  Now?

           Marshall stares at him.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Your country’s about to be taken 
                        over by poets and playwrights.  
                                              Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      101.

                                 ED MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                        Nice people, but I bet they can 
                        still hold a hell of a grudge.  You 
                        want out, the price is steep.

           Rychtar burns a bit, but nods.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Your Public Affairs office.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Yes?

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        One of your junior officers.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Which one?

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Tyler Vanalden.

           Marshall nods, poker-faced.  Rychtar hands him A DOCUMENT 
           CLIPPED TO A SURVEILLANCE PHOTO OF TYLER.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR (CONT’D)
                        For nearly a year, he has been 
                        passing intelligence to one of our 
                        female agents.  They meet in a safe 
                        house we control.  We have hours of 
                        footage.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        You’d be willing to turn that over?

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        I assume it is part of the ticket 
                        price.

           Now Ed Marshall stares out at the dark river.  Lights from 
           the bridge sparkle and dance.  

           Marshall hands back the document.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        That’s it?

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                                 (frustrated)
                        I am giving you our most successful 
                        operation.  This is how we learned 
                        about Ruzicka.
                                              Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      102.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Ruzicka was bullshit.  We never met 
                        the guy. 

           RYCHTAR GOES PALE.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        But Vanalden-

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        We’ve known Vanalden was 
                        questionable since he came on at 
                        State.  When he got assigned to 
                        Prague, we just laid him in your 
                        lap.  Everything you learned, we 
                        let you learn.

           Rychtar stares at the Vltava, his last ticket out of Prague 
           drifting soggy down the river.

                                 ED MARSHALL (CONT’D)
                        I know you were pals with Ruzicka  
                        back in Poland.  If it makes you 
                        feel better, he wasn’t your mole, 
                        but you did have one.

           Rychtar thinks a moment.  Then he realizes:

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        The girl.
                                 (beat)
                        You’re a liar.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Doesn’t mean you don’t believe me.

           Rychtar seethes...because he does believe it.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        She was monitored.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                                 (deadpan)
                        No.  Really?

           Rychtar coughs, trying to control himself.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        What could she possibly have given 
                        you?
                                              Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      103.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Peace of mind.
                                 (beat)
                        We’re looking forward to getting 
                        her stateside.

           Rychtar stands.  He looks down at Marshall, still sitting.

           Marshall shrugs.

           Rychtar tightens his hat on his head and walks into the 
           darkness of the trees.

           Marshall stands.  He breathes the night air.

                                 TYLER (O.S.)
                        He’s gonna kill her.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, ED MARSHALL’S OFFICE - DAY

           CLOSE ON: A FRAMED PHOTO OF GEORGE H. W. BUSH.

                                 ED MARSHALL (O.S.)
                        I guess that’s a possibility.  

           Tyler paces in front of Ed Marshall’s desk.

                                 TYLER
                        Since when do you guess?

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        If he’s not coming with us and he’s 
                        not staying here, then Rychtar’s 
                        only play is Moscow.  KGB’s going 
                        to want a tight resume.  No leaks, 
                        no squeaks, no traitors.  So, yes, 
                        killing her’s a thing that might 
                        happen.

                                 TYLER
                        Which means you killed her.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Well, no, Ty.  I compromised an 
                        enemy agent.  I’m not sure that’s 
                        gonna keep my head off the pillow.

                                 TYLER
                        Shit.
                                              Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      104.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Listen, this whole democracy thing 
                        doesn’t come with a money back 
                        guarantee.  If we want a return on 
                        our investment, then StB can’t get 
                        back on its feet.  Anything we can 
                        do to put it down, we have to try.

           Tyler stares at his boss, angry.

                                 TYLER
                        No matter who it fucks.  At any 
                        cost.  

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Damn near.

           Tyler tries to hold it together.

                                 ED MARSHALL (CONT’D)
                        Prague’s been a big win for you, 
                        son.  Big win.  I’ve already put 
                        you in for an Intelligence Medal.    
                        Once you come back up from the 
                        basement, you’ll probably have your 
                        pick of stations.

           Tyler stares out the window.  He pauses.

                                 TYLER
                        What do you mean, “basement?”

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        As of last night, StB and every 
                        other spy shop in Europe thinks 
                        you’re a traitor to your country.  
                        We’ve got to keep up appearances.

           Marshall lays a hand across Tyler’s shoulder.

                                 ED MARSHALL (CONT’D)
                        I’m afraid you’re a little bit 
                        under arrest.

           Tyler carries A BOX OF HIS PERSONAL BELONGINGS as Marshall 
           leads him past the other desks of the section.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        You’ll be flown to D.C. for a 
                        routine indictment.

           Hersch Meyer gives him a half-hearted thumbs up as he passes.

                                 ED MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                        Then you’ll be fired and we’ll 
                        probably threaten you with some 
                        sort of incarceration.  It’ll take 
                        three months or so.  We’ll pay for 
                        the lawyer.

           Val Evans looks up from the library.  She smiles, then goes 
           back to her reading.

                                 ED MARSHALL (CONT’D)
                        Once all that percolates, we’ll 
                        quietly drop the charges and figure 
                        out your next station.

           They reach the door.  MARSHALL PLUCKS OFF TYLER’S RED ID 
           BADGE AND TOSSES IT INTO HIS BOX. 

                                 ED MARSHALL (CONT’D)
                        I’m not saying The Bahamas, but I’m 
                        not not.

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, STAIRWELL - DAY

           Marshall leads Tyler down the stairway.  

           At the bottom, TWO MARINE GUARDS look up at them.

                                 TYLER
                        You’re kidding me.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        We gotta sell it, Ty.  Smile.  The 
                        whole world is watching.

           THE RED-HEADED MARINE pulls out a pair of HANDCUFFS.  
           Marshall shakes his head.

                                 ED MARSHALL (CONT’D)
                        Your plane leaves in three hours.  
                        The officers will escort you to 
                        your apartment and help you pack.  

                                 TYLER
                        Jesus, Ed.

           Marshall slaps him on the shoulder and heads up the stairs.

                                 ED MARSHALL
                        Bright side, my friend.  We won.

                                 TYLER
                        We did?

                                 ED MARSHALL 
                        Sure.  Wait a couple years and 
                        check the history books.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           SLIVERS OF PAPER drain endlessly from A SHREDDER.

           Jarmila feeds documents into the machine.  Milos brings in 
           another box of files.

                                 MILOS
                        What year is that?

                                 JARMILA

           THEY BOTH WATCH REAMS OF HISTORY BEING SLICED TO RIBBONS.

                        Jarmila.

           Johnny 1950 stands in the doorway.

           Jarmila feeds in the rest of the thick file all at once.  The 
           shredder whines...and jams.  

           Jarmila gives him a deadpan look.

                                 JARMILA
                        Is it too late to ask Moscow for 
                        another one?

           INT. U.S. EMBASSY, GARAGE - DAY

           The heels of the Marine guards click on the concrete as they 
           lead Tyler toward a waiting MERCEDES.

                                 TYLER
                        Guys.  I really don’t need this.  I 
                        can pack my own fucking underwear.

                                 RED-HEADED MARINE
                        Sorry, sir.  This is S.O.P. when 
                        they send one of you home.

           He opens the door.

           EXT. U.S. EMBASSY - DAY

           The Mercedes pulls out of the back alley.  

           Tyler stares out the window, worried.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, JOHNNY 1950’S OFFICE - DAY

           Johnny nervously holds a pair of scissors, opening and 
           closing them with a dry rasp.

           Finally, he puts the scissors down on a distinct GREEN FILE.  

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                                 (re. the file)
                        Do you know what this is?

                                 JARMILA
                        A file from the Assistant 
                        Director’s office.

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                        It was waiting for me this morning.

           He studies Jarmila, who reveals nothing.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, RYCHTAR’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Zdenek Rychtar sits at his desk, typing.

                                 JOHNNY 1950 (O.S.)
                        Assistant Director Rychtar has had 
                        contact with the Americans.

           Rychtar drinks from a bottle, then puts it down on top of a 
           GREEN FILE FOLDER.

                                 JOHNNY 1950 (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        He gave up Source Prep School.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, JOHNNY 1950’S OFFICE - DAY

           Jarmila’s faces freezes.  She stares at Johnny.

                                 JARMILA
                        For what possible gain?

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                        To win their blessed favor.

           Jarmila considers this.

                                 JARMILA
                        And did he?

           Johnny shakes his head.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, RYCHTAR’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Rychtar pulls the paper out of the typewriter and slides it 
           into the green folder. 

                                 JOHNNY 1950 (O.S.)
                        They said they knew about Prep 
                        School all along. 

           Then he moves the folder to reveal...the photo of him and his 
           friend, Vladimir Ruzicka, smiling.

                                 JOHNNY 1950 (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        They were simply using him to pass 
                        information to their own agent 
                        within our ranks.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, JOHNNY 1950’S OFFICE - DAY

           Jarmila’s mind races.

                                 JARMILA
                        What?

           Johnny looks at her, almost hurt.

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                        They said that agent was you.

           She pales.

                                 JOHNNY 1950 (CONT’D)
                                 (with rising anger)
                        Trips to the country without 
                        surveillance.  Documents passed 
                        under bedsheets.  Secrets whispered 
                        while you fucked-

           Jarmila yanks the file from under his hand.  The scissors 
           clatter to the floor.

                                 JARMILA
                        Are you so starving for approval 
                        from the Americans that you would 
                        eat whatever garbage they feed you?

                        The Assistant Director has ordered 
                        your arrest...and your vigorous 
                        interrogation.

           He and Jarmila stare at each other for a long moment.

                                 JARMILA
                        And has the interrogation started?

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, RYCHTAR’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Rychtar opens a drawer.  Inside lie a toothbrush, deodorant, 
           and other toiletries.

                                 JOHNNY 1950 (O.S.)
                        I informed him that, as of today, 
                        we no longer have anyone available 
                        who can implement his request.

           Rychtar rummages deeper and pulls out a STRAIGHT RAZOR.

                                 JOHNNY 1950 (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        He was not pleased.

           INT. STB HEADQUARTERS, JOHNNY 1950’S OFFICE - DAY

           Jarmila flares, defiant.

                                 JARMILA
                        I am not working for the Americans.

                        Even if you were...
                                 (shrugging)
                        Yesterday, you would have been a 
                        traitor to the Czech people.  
                        Tomorrow, you may be a hero of the

                                 JARMILA
                        And today?

                        Today is the day that falls between 
                        the cracks.

           She stares at him, unsure.

                                 JOHNNY 1950 (CONT’D)
                        If you leave now, it will be hours 
                        before anyone knows you’re gone.

                                 JARMILA
                        Why?

           He smiles, genuine and shy.

                                 JOHNNY 1950
                        You know why.

           A long moment passes.  She stands and leans over the desk.

           She puts her hands on his, trapping him.

           He swallows.

           She kisses his dry, flaky lips.

           Finally, she pulls away.

                                 JOHNNY 1950 (CONT’D)
                        You should get going.  It isn’t 
                        safe for you here.

           He picks up his scissors, nervous.  He looks at the file.

                                 JOHNNY 1950 (CONT’D)
                        A pity about the shredder.

                        Must be nice to get out of the

           A CROWD OF PROTESTORS mills across the street from StB HQ.  

           When Jarmila steps outside, they eye her with suspicion.

           She hurries toward the Metro stairs.

           Tyler slouches down as they pass the bar.

           The Marines exchange a look, but say nothing.

           After they round the corner, Tyler straightens up.  He checks 
           his watch.

                                 TYLER
                        Could you stop the car a second?

           Jarmila hurries toward her tower block.

           WE WATCH HER FROM A DISTANCE.

           Jarmila rushes past Mrs. Varadiova into the building.

           AS WE DID BEFORE, PAN UP to find JARMILA’S WINDOW.

           Through the window, we see her enter her apartment.  She 
           throws off her coat.  She races to the closet...

                        What kind of plane do I get?  You 
                        know, is it a chartered deal, or...

                        Commercial, sir.  Lufthansa.

           Tyler glances in the rearview mirror.  A TRUCK FOLLOWS THEM.

           Tyler tumbles awkwardly. 

           THE MERCEDES STOPS SHORT.  THE TRUCK CRUNCHES INTO THE BACK 
           BUMPER.

           Tyler barely looks back before he races up the hill.

           INT. JARMILA’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Jarmila dumps underwear into a suitcase on her bed.

           FOLLOW her to the bathroom.  She gathers up her toiletries.

           FOLLOW her to the bedroom, where she throws them in her 
           suitcase.

           FOLLOW her to the kitchen.  She roots around the freezer, but 
           can’t find what she’s looking for.

           She grabs a cheap, RED-HANDLED KNIFE from the counter, and 
           starts chipping away at the ice.

           Finally, she pulls free A PLASTIC BAG OF MONEY.

           She closes the freezer, then stops, face to face with...

           TYLER’S DOG PICTURE, magneted to the door.

           Jarmila stares, furious and betrayed.

           EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAY

           Tyler reaches the top of the hill, running hard.  He looks 
           over his shoulder.  

           The Red-Haired Marine kicks open his damaged door.  He takes 
           off after Tyler.

           INT. JARMILA’S BUILDING, STAIRWELL - DAY 

           Jarmila bolts out of her apartment, leaving the door ajar.

           She hurries downstairs, suitcase banging against the rail.

           At the bottom, she opens the door, and-

           SLAM.  A FIST SMASHES INTO HER NOSE, throwing her back into 
           the stairwell.

           Jarmila looks up, woozy.  

           There, standing outside the door is...

           ZDENEK RYCHTAR.

           The Assistant Director’s BEARD HAS BEEN SHAVED.  His hair 
           gleams, DYED JET BLACK.  He blinks, eyes slightly glassy.

           He pulls a small, automatic pistol from his coat.

           He takes a step toward her. 

           JARMILA SWINGS HER SUITCASE, bashing his shin, sending 
           Rychtar off-balance.

           EXT. JARMILA’S APARTMENT BLOCK - DAY

           Jarmila runs between the buildings, blood dripping from her 
           nostril.

           Rychtar lumbers after her.

           EXT. METRO ENTRANCE - DAY

           TYLER GASPS.  He races down the Metro steps.

           A moment later, the Red-Headed Marine follows.
                                              Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      114.

           EXT. JARMILA’S APARTMENT BLOCK - DAY

           Jarmila stumbles, skidding face first in the grass.

           Rychtar raises his gun, but can’t aim.

           Jarmila scrambles around the back of the building.

           EXT. JARMILA’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Jarmila throws herself against the back door.  It’s locked.

           A LITTLE BOY looks down from a second-floor balcony.  He 
           holds A SCRUFFY DOG on a leash.

                                 LITTLE BOY
                        It’s locked.

           Jarmila runs on.

           Seconds later, Rychtar rounds the corner.  

           THE DOG BARKS ITS HEAD OFF AT HIM, FANGS GNASHING.

           INT. METRO STATION - DAY

           Tyler SPRINTS past the ticket windows... 

           The Marine gains ground.

           EXT. JARMILA’S APARTMENT BLOCK - DAY

           Rychtar lurches around to THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING.  He 
           wheezes, hand on his knee.   

           MRS. VARADIOVA SITS CLIPPING FLOWERS.

           He points the gun at her, but can barely catch his breath.

                                 ZDENEK RYCHTAR
                        Where...did she go?

           The old woman stares at the small gun.

           Then she sadly points at the front door.

           RYCHTAR LURCHES INSIDE THE BUILDING.  

           Mrs. Varadiova looks down at the rose in her old hands.
                                              Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      115.

           SOMEONE CRIES OUT.  SHOES SCRAPE ON CONCRETE.

           THE DOOR SLAMS BACK OPEN.

           Mrs. Varadiova looks up as...

           RYCHTAR STAGGERS OUT, CLUTCHING HIS STOMACH, HANDS RED WITH 
           BLOOD.

           EXT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - DAY

           Tyler races up the steps, now just yards from...

           THE WOUNDED BEAR.

           KAREL stands outside, smoking.

           Tyler runs up and WRAPS HIM IN A BEAR HUG.

           Karel resists, but Tyler holds him...RASPING IN HIS EAR.

           EXT. JARMILA’S APARTMENT BLOCK - DAY

           KAREL STEPS OUT THE FRONT DOOR OF JARMILA’S BUILDING.

                                 TYLER (O.S.)
                        Please.  

           HE HOLDS TIGHT TO JARMILA’S KITCHEN KNIFE, HIS THREE FINGERS 
           GRIPPING THE RED HANDLE.

                                 TYLER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I need you to do something for me.

           Rychtar collapses, gasping for breath.  Then he stops 
           gasping.

           Karel stares down at Rychtar’s body. 

           He drops the knife.

           EXT. THE WOUNDED BEAR - DAY

           The Red-Haired Marine yanks Tyler away from Karel.

           Tyler locks eyes with Karel.

           KAREL NODS.
                                              Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      116.

           EXT. JARMILA’S APARTMENT BLOCK - DAY

           Karel turns as Jarmila steps through the door, pale.  He 
           gives her a weak smile.

           He holds out TYLER’S RED I.D. BADGE.

                                 KAREL
                        Our American friend had to catch a 
                        plane.

           She takes the badge.  

           CLOSE ON THE INSIGNIA: “CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY.”

           She looks up at Karel, awed and overwhelmed.

           Karel bows slightly, then walks quickly away.

           Jarmila looks down at Rychtar’s body on the concrete.

           Then she looks up at Mrs. Varadiova.  The old woman meets her 
           eyes...and smiles. 

           Footsteps crunch to Jarmila’s left.  She snatches up the 
           knife.

           The boy and his dog step around the corner.

           The dogs sniffs at Rychtar’s body.

           Jarmila touches the dog’s head.

                                 JARMILA
                        Good boy.

           BLEED IN THE SOUND OF AN AIRPLANE ENGINE...

           INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

           Tyler sits at a window seat in a commercial plane, his coat 
           laid over his lap.  

           The Red-Headed Marine stows his bag overhead.

           Around them, Europeans find their seats.

           The Marine moves Tyler’s coat, unlocks HIS HANDCUFFS and re-
           locks him to the seat. 

                                 TYLER
                        Where am I going to go?
                                              Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      117.

                                 RED-HEADED MARINE
                        With all due respect, sir, you’re 
                        lucky you’re not in the baggage 
                        compartment.
                                 (straightening up)
                        I’m hitting the head.

           Tyler sighs.  The flight attendant blares instructions in 
           German.

           Tyler stares out the window at the baggage handlers.

           Then someone sits down next to him.  Tyler turns to find...

           HIS FATHER IN THE SEAT BESIDE HIM.

           For a moment, Tyler just stares.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Did you want the aisle?

           Tyler jerks his head at the window.

                                 TYLER
                        No.  I like seeing the ground drop 
                        out from under me.

           Spalding takes out the emergency card and starts reading.

           Tyler stares straight ahead.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Happy with yourself?

                                 TYLER
                        Reasonably.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Not exactly the play we were 
                        expecting.

           Tyler smiles.

                                 TYLER
                        Consider it my resignation. 

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        Company’s losing a good man.

                                 TYLER
                        That’s the idea.

           Spalding nods, putting the emergency card away.
                                              Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      118.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN
                        I almost forgot.  

           He pulls a manila envelope from the overhead bin.

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN (CONT’D)
                        Early Christmas present.

           Tyler opens the envelope.  A book slides out:

           “TRUMP, by Donald Trump.”

                                 SPALDING VANALDEN (CONT’D)
                        Welcome to the private sector.

           Tyler just stares at Trump’s glossy head.

                                                                 FADE TO BLACK.

           “Six Months Later.”

           EXT. LETNA PARK - DAY

           The MASSIVE STONE PEDESTAL juts out from the hilltop.

           After a moment, we hear WHEELS ROLLING ON PAVEMENT.

           Two teenage skateboarders zip by.  One jumps a curb, grinding 
           on the concrete. 

           The other tries and falls, skidding on his knees.  He rises 
           with a pained grin.

           PULL DOWN the hill, across the river...

           TO A HOTEL on the opposite bank.

           INT. INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL, LOBBY - DAY

           American and European businessmen smoke outside the ballroom.  
           A SIGN reads, in English and Czech: 

           “ECONOMIC REDEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE, PRAGUE.”
                                              Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      119.

           INT. INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL, BALLROOM - DAY

           MOVE THROUGH THE CONVENTION: past booths featuring displays 
           from dozens of Western companies...

                                 TYLER (O.S.)
                        In our last two election cycles, we 
                        went 11 for 14.  Including Governor 
                        of New Hampshire.

           Through throngs of future Czech franchisees, sipping free 
           drinks and listening politely...

                                 EARNEST YOUNG CZECH (O.S.)
                        Is that good?

           And finally to TYLER talking to an EARNEST YOUNG CZECH.  

           Tanned, his hair longer than before, Tyler wears a khaki suit 
           and pink shirt.  His nametag reads, “VIC PHILLIPS.”

                                 TYLER
                        It’s not bad.

                                 EARNEST YOUNG CZECH
                        We have many reforms that need 
                        making.

                                 TYLER
                        Are you the man to make them?

                                 EARNEST YOUNG CZECH
                        I hope I am.

                                 TYLER
                        No.  You know you are.  There’s 
                        plenty of time for hope after 
                        you’re elected.

           He glances at THE CLOCK on the wall.

                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        That’s where I come in. 

           Tyler flags down a waitress.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Could we get a couple whisky sours?

           INT. INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL, BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT

           DOZENS OF WHITE CARDS fan out on a host table.
                                              Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      120.

           THE YOUNG WOMAN handing out seat assignments scans the cards.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Phillips, Phillips, I was sure you 
                        here somewhere...

           Tyler looks over her shoulder.

                                 TYLER
                        There’s me.  Table 6.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Ah, yes.  That’s right.  You were a 
                        last minute change.

                                 TYLER
                        Story of my life.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        I’m sorry?

           He smiles.

                                 TYLER
                        It’s nothing.

           Tyler weaves between the tables of the bustling banquet room.   
           In the corner on a riser, A THREE-PIECE BAND plays softly.

           In the middle of the room, Tyler stops.  

           A WOMAN in a sharp, black suit stands talking to the Earnest 
           Young Czech.

           Tyler swallows.  For a moment, he seems alone in the crowd.

           The woman turns and, in profile, we see it’s JARMILA.

           Her hair is short and stylish.  She wears horn-rimmed 
           glasses, listening intently.

           Tyler smiles, taking her in.

           Then the Earnest Young Czech notices him...and points.

           Jarmila turns and looks at Tyler.

           Their eyes meet.  She smiles, not shocked.

           A moment passes.

           The Czech waves Tyler over.  Tyler breaks his freeze and 
           approaches.
                                              Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      121.

                                 EARNEST YOUNG CZECH
                        Mr. Phillips.  Where are you 
                        sitting?

                                 TYLER
                        Right here, I think.

                                 EARNEST YOUNG CZECH
                        How splendid for us.  Please, have 
                        you met Miss Hrbek?  

           Tyler never takes his eyes off Jarmila.

                                 TYLER
                        Ms. Hrbek?  No, we’ve never met.

           She smiles, offering her hand and reading his name tag.

                                 JARMILA
                        Hello...  
                                 (smiling)
                        Vic.

           Tyler takes her hand.

                                 EARNEST YOUNG CZECH
                        Miss Hrbek is also running for 
                        Parliament, but not against me, 
                        thank heavens.  I would never win.  

           She shakes her head.

                                 JARMILA
                        You exaggerate.

                                 EARNEST YOUNG CZECH
                        I am an economist.  You are a hero.  

                                 TYLER
                                 (to Jarmila)
                        Are you?

                                 JARMILA
                        Some say.

                                 TYLER
                        But you don’t.

           She meets his eyes.

                                 JARMILA
                        Heroes save lives.  I did the 
                        opposite.
                                              Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      122.

           The Czech scoffs, pulling out her chair.  

                                 EARNEST YOUNG CZECH
                        Miss Hrbek took some great risks 
                        for the revolution.

           He leans toward Tyler, stage whispering.

                                 EARNEST YOUNG CZECH (CONT’D)
                        She was a spy.

           Tyler sits next to her.

                                 TYLER
                        Oh?  For which side?

                                 JARMILA
                        Both.

                                 TYLER
                        That must have been dangerous.

           The Czech is only too eager to share what he knows.

                                 EARNEST YOUNG CZECH
                        Miss Hrbek helped undermine our 
                        secret police.  From the inside.  
                        She even exposed an American spy.

                                 TYLER
                        Really?

                                 JARMILA
                        I merely did what anyone would have 
                        in my circumstances.

           Tyler takes his napkin and rests it on his lap.

                                 TYLER
                        Under the right circumstances, 
                        people are capable of extraordinary 
                        things.

                                 JARMILA
                        Perhaps.

           A WAITER dips between them, pouring wine.

                                 JARMILA (CONT’D)
                        Tell me, Mr. Phillips, are you in 
                        Prague long?

           Tyler tastes his wine.
                                              Markus & McFeely   5-14-09      123.

                                 TYLER
                                 (in Czech)
                        That depends on work.  You see, I’m  
                        consulting with the government.

           The Earnest Young Czech looks surprised at Tyler’s fluency.

           Jarmila smiles.

                                 JARMILA
                        What a coup.  How did you land such 
                        a thing?

                                 TYLER
                        They called me.  Someone must have 
                        put in a good word.

           She puts her napkin in her lap.

           UNDER THE TABLE SHE REACHES OUT AND TAKES HIS HAND.

                                 JARMILA
                        Imagine.

           Tyler smiles.

           PULL BACK through the banquet room, leaving Tyler and Jarmila 
           isolated in their own little bubble.

           The Earnest Young Czech sees he’s shut out of the 
           conversation.  He turns his chair to listen to the band...

           Which plays David Bowie’s Young Americans.  In Czech.

                                                                      FADE OUT.
