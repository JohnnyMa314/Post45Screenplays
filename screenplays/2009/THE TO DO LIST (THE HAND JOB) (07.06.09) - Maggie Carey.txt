           INT. BOISE STATE UNIVERSITY AQUATIC CENTER - DAY  

           Title card: Boise, Idaho 1991. 

           A modest collegiate swim center. Clusters of SWIMMERS dot 
           the pool deck. A sign reads LIFEGUARD TRYOUTS.

           BRANDY CLARK (16), cute, smart, type-A, does push-ups in 
           the corner, psyching herself up. CAMERON MITCHELL (17), 
           lanky body in need of a protein shake, watches Brandy 
           whisper her self-mantra. 

                                 BRANDY
                        You can do it. You can do it.

                                 CAMERON
                        You sound like a Nike commercial.

           A WHISTLE BLOWS. SWIMMERS line up.

           PAN ACROSS a row of developed bodies in their prime. 
           Plump breasts, fit pecks. End on Brandy, flat-chested in 
           her Speedo. Brandy rolls her eyes at a HOT GIRL. 

                                 BRANDY
                                 (to Cameron)
                        Check out this fart-knocker. First 
                        dive in the pool and that 
                        bandini’s coming right off.

                                 CAMERON
                        Excellent.

                                 BRANDY
                        Pervert.

                                 RUSTY (O.S.)
                        Brandy Clark, you’re up.

           Brandy looks up at RUSTY WATERS (20), the smoking-hot 
           lifeguard instructor. He’s tan, ripped and awesome. 

           A little string of drool escapes Brandy’s mouth. Cameron 
           nudges her. She wipes her chin.

           INT. POOL - LATER

           Brandy treads water while holding a brick above her head. 

                                 RUSTY
                        Time!

           Swimmers drop their bricks. Brandy keeps treading.

                                 RUSTY (CONT’D)
                        I said time. You passed. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BRANDY
                        Going for a personal best, sir.

           INT. POOL DECK - LATER

           Brandy performs CPR chest compressions.

                                 BRANDY
                        And one and two and three...don’t 
                        you die on me! Not after the shit 
                        we’ve been through!

                                 CAMERON
                                 (whispers)
                        It’s a dummy, Brandy.

           Brandy SLAPS the armless torso, really getting into it.

           INT. POOL - LATER

           Brandy braces the neck of a SWIMMER with her arms, 
           guiding her on a backboard, instructing those around her.  

                                 BRANDY
                        Nice and easy, kids. We want this 
                        girl going to the prom in a limo, 
                        not a wheelchair.

           Rusty shakes his head and checks a box on his clipboard.

           INT. POOL DECK - LATER

           Brandy works on a written test. She raises her hand.

                                 BRANDY
                        What if I have a better solution? 
                        May I write in my answer?

                                 RUSTY
                        For the last time, it’s multiple-
                        choice. Just pick a letter and be 
                        done with it.

                                 BRANDY
                        I’m gonna write it in anyways. 
                        Count it wrong if you want, but 
                        it’s the right thing to do. For 
                        swimmers and non-swimmers 
                        everywhere.

                                 RUSTY
                                 (annoyed)
                        Knock yourself out.
           INT. POOL DECK - LATER

           Swimmers mill about, waiting for the test results. A 
           COLLEGE GUY (20) turns to Brandy.

                                 COLLEGE GUY
                        Hey, buzz kill. You wanna grab a 
                        beer to celebrate?

                                 BRANDY
                        Let’s make sure we pass before we 
                        toot our own horn, m’kay?

           Rusty walks up.

                                 RUSTY
                        Listen up, everyone. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Yeah, show some respect!

                                 RUSTY
                        Easy, showboat. Okay, the 
                        following individuals are now 
                        Boise Parks and Rec Lifeguards.  
                                 (reads list)
                        Aaron Davis, Cameron Mitchell...

                                 CAMERON
                        BOO YA!

                                 BRANDY
                        Quiet!
                                 (whispers)
                        You can do it. You can do it...

           Brandy panics. Her chest POUNDS. Her breath QUICKENS. 
           Rusty’s voice turns into a loud BUZZ as he comes to the 
           end of his list.

                                 RUSTY
                        ...and...Brandy Clark.

           Overjoyed, Brandy steps back...and falls into the pool. 
           Rusty squats down in front of her.

                                 RUSTY (CONT’D)
                        You okay, kid?

           Brandy nods. Smiling. Staring straight at his crotch.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. GYMNASIUM - BOISE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY   

           Last day of school. Annual awards ceremony in the gym. 
           Students sit in bleachers, bored by the presentation.

           ANGLE ON STAGE

                                 PRINCIPAL
                                 (into microphone)
                        A round of applause for our 1991 
                        Academic Honor Roll. 

           Brandy beams, proud. Next to her is a GIRL WITH A BACK 
           BRACE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE STUDENTS, NERDY GUYS.

           Uninvited, Brandy steps up to the podium. 

                                 BRANDY
                                 (into microphone)
                        As Abraham Lincoln once said, ‘You 
                        have to do your own growing no 
                        matter how tall your grandfather 
                        was.’
                                 (under breath, reads 
                                 off note card)
                        Wait for applause.

           Brandy waits for applause. It doesn’t come. The principal 
           ushers Brandy along.

           INT. BLEACHERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Brandy sits between FIONA (17), cute, big boobs, social 
           butterfly and WENDY (17), athletic in an obsessed way. 
           The threesome is known as THE GIRLS. 

                                 FIONA
                        Nice speech, spaz.

                                 BRANDY
                        Really? I almost went with a 
                        Gloria Steinem quote--

                                 WENDY
                        Of course you did.

           Fiona and Wendy LAUGH.

                                 BRANDY
                        Why are you laughing?

           Fiona and Wendy look at each other and shrug.

           The lights dim. The BAND gives a drum roll. A spotlight 
           follows the SENIOR CLASS PRESIDENT on stage.

                        And now, what we’ve all been 
                        waiting for...The Senior Awards!

           The CROWD CHEERS. Fiona and Wendy perk up. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Where was this enthusiasm for the 
                        perfect attendance honorees? Ick. 
                        The Senior Awards are a stupid 
                        popularity contest. Nothing to do 
                        with merit.

                            FIONA
                                                         WENDY
           Exactly.
                                              Exactly.

                                 SENIOR CLASS PRESIDENT
                                 (into microphone)
                        In the category of Best Dressed. 
                        Your winners are: Scott Stetler 
                        and Amber Clark.

           SCOTT (18), dressed like Vanilla Ice, walks on stage with 
           AMBER CLARK (18), Brandy’s developed, older sister. Her 
           hair, makeup and chest are perfect.

                                 BRANDY
                        Best dressed? Since when is a tube-
                        top high fashion? 

                                 FIONA
                        Someone’s jealous of her sister.

                                 BRANDY
                        Whatever.

                        Best Personality: Ryan Darmody 
                        and...Amber Clark.

           The CROWD CHEERS. Amber walks on stage again, blushing.

                                 BRANDY
                        Barf. She is so fake. Why do 
                        people like her?

                                 FIONA
                        Word on the street? Ryan has the 
                        biggest dick in the entire school.

                                 WENDY
                        Duh. He’s totally sporting a 
                        softie under those Hammer pants.

                                 BRANDY
                        Softie? Gross. I’m never going to 
                        Dairy Queen again.

                        Most Likely to Succeed: John 
                        Murray and...Amber Clark!

           Amber, now holding several awards, goes back on stage.

                                 BRANDY
                        Most Likely to Succeed? More like 
                        Most Likely to Get an STD. 

                                 FIONA
                        No, John wears condoms. He keeps 
                        them in his Trapper Keeper.

                                 BRANDY
                        Not John. Amber. Look at her, she 
                        has major THO. 

           CLOSE ON Amber, nipping out.

                                 FIONA
                        Poor Pancake.  

           Fiona pokes Brandy in her flat chest. Wendy LAUGHS.

                                 BRANDY
                        Shut it. The only reason you have 
                        a chest is from the bench press.

           Wendy looks down, flexes her pecks. Brandy has a point.

           INT. JUNIOR HALL - BOISE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY   

           STUDENTS mill around, cleaning out lockers. The Girls sit 
           on the floor, signing yearbooks. 

                                 BRANDY
                        I have nothing to write. It was 
                        another totally uneventful year.

                                 WENDY
                        Go with a classic. ‘Don’t party 
                        too hard without me this summer.’

           Brandy writes this and hands Fiona the yearbook.

                                 FIONA
                        That was my yearbook? You suck.

           A FOOTBALL PLAYER walks up, staring at Fiona’s cleavage.

                                 FOOTBALL PLAYER
                        Hey, Fiona. You wanna hit Amber’s

                        Your tits, beeotch. Well, one of 
                        them. But the other one can tag 
                        along too.

                        Hey fuck chop, try playing a sport 
                        that requires athleticism, not fat 
                        rolls. 

           Football player looks down at his body, walks off.

                        Amber can’t have a party. Our 
                        parents are out of town. They said 
                        we couldn’t have friends over.

                                 AMBER (O.S.)
                        God, stop being such a priss.

           Brandy looks up. Amber looks down at her.

                        Congrats on all the awards, Amber. 
                        That’s huge.

                                 AMBER
                        I know. Thanks.

                        Love your blue mascara. It’s hot.

                                 AMBER
                        Yeah. Got it at a modeling gig.

                        Please tell me you didn’t wear 
                        that during the trig final. It’s 
                        totally unhygienic.

                        Thanks a lot, Amber. Don’t you 
                        have a dick to suck or something? 

                                 AMBER

           INT. STATION WAGON - BOISE HIGH PARKING LOT - LATER

           A 1970’s Brady Bunch station wagon, fondly nicknamed “The 
           Hell Bitch.” Amber, in the driver’s seat, jams to a Phish 
           bootleg. Brandy glares at the low-rider truck parked in 
           front of them. A COUPLE sits on the hood, making out. 

                                 BRANDY
                        I told you we should have parked 
                        on the street.

                                 AMBER
                        It’s not my fault the stupid Hell 
                        Bitch doesn’t have reverse. Blame 
                        the P’s. Too cheap to buy a car 
                        that works.
                                 (points to couple)
                        Have to wait for them to pull out.

                                 BRANDY
                        That’s gonna take awhile, seeing 
                        as he just put it in.

           The dude sticks his tongue down his girlfriend’s throat. 

           A TEEN walks by, waves to Amber.

                                 TEEN
                        See ya at the party tonight.

           Cool.
                                              Right on.

           Amber turns to Brandy.

                                 AMBER
                        You are not coming to my party.

                                 BRANDY
                        It’s my house, too!

                                 AMBER
                        It’s a college party. 

                                 BRANDY
                        You’re like one-hour out of high 
                        school, Amber!

                                 AMBER
                        If you and your little hoochies 
                        show up you’re dead, butt munch.

           Pissed, Brandy lays on the HORN and yells at the couple.

           INT. POOL OFFICE - LATER

           A bare bones, cinder block building with concrete floors. 

           Brandy, the only guard dressed in uniform, stands in the 
           corner. She stares at Rusty as he bull-shits with KIMBALL 
           (18), a bleached-blond stoner.  

                                 KIMBALL
                        So how’s Boise State?

                        It’s chill. My frat just threw 
                        this killer party. Check it--

           Rusty flexes his biceps. Brandy about craps herself.

                                 RUSTY (CONT’D)
                        --we all tattooed our letters in 
                        our own arms. Hurt like a mofo.

           Cameron enters and heads for Brandy.

                                 CAMERON
                        Dude, I ran into Coach Pancratz 
                        after school and he wants me to 
                        try out for football next fall. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Football? That sport’s for chumps. 
                        And aren’t you a little skinny?

                                 CAMERON
                                 (hurt)
                        No. At least, not to play kicker. 
                        Anyway, if I bulk up this summer I 
                        might do it.

                                 BRANDY
                        What about soccer?

                                 CAMERON
                        You mean the sport no one cares 
                        about? 

                                 BRANDY
                        I wouldn’t go around Europe saying 
                        something like that.

           WILLY ANDERSON (30s), the laid-back pool manager, enters. 
           He chest bumps Rusty, high-fives Kimball.

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)

           Cameron gives a quick wave.

                                 CAMERON
                        Uh, hey. Cameron.

           Brandy stands.

                                 BRANDY
                        Hello. I’m Brandy Clark. Really 
                        excited to be here, Mr. Anderson.

                        Call me Willy. So, dudes, pool 
                        opens Monday. I’ll put up the 
                        sched mañana. Guards with 
                        seniority get first dibs on va-

                        adjourned.

           The guards start talking again. Brandy raises her hand. 

                                 BRANDY
                        What about the orientation?

                                 WILLY
                        You just had it.

                                 BRANDY
                        How about showing us the first aid 
                        kit? Or the back board? Heat 
                        stroke procedure? I mean, come on.

           Brandy looks to Rusty for support. She doesn’t get it.

                                 WILLY
                        Brandy, was it? Good idea. Why 
                        don’t you tap that, while I...

           Willy opens a mini-fridge and pulls out a Pabsts.

                        ...tap this.

           Rusty hits the boombox, BLUES TRAVELER plays through the 
           P.A. system. Kimball rolls a joint. Willy chugs his beer 
           and lets out a giant BURP.

                        Welcome to my pool, Newbie.
           EXT. POOL - LATER 

           Brandy sits in the stand, life preserver on her lap. 

           Kimball wheels a kid’s BMX bike onto the pool deck. Rusty 
           and Willy duct tape towels around him for padding. 
           Cameron floats on a kick board, sipping a beer.

                                 CAMERON
                        I had no idea it was gonna be like 
                        this. Kind of awesome.

                                 BRANDY
                        Awesome? Try irresponsible. You 
                        shouldn’t drink on duty.

                                 CAMERON
                        We’re not exactly on duty, Brandy.

                        Well, one of us should stay sober.

           Kimball carries the bike up the high dive. 

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                        What is he doing?

           Kimball mounts the bike and peddles off the high dive. He 
           SCREAMS in pain as he hits the water.

                                 KIMBALL
                        Mother fucker! My nuts!

           The guards LAUGH. Brandy shakes her head.

           EXT. POOL OFFICE - EVENING

           Brandy sits on the steps, watching Rusty as he swings his 
           muscular leg over his Kawasaki Ninja sport bike.  

                                 BRANDY
                                 (smitten)
                        He really should wear a helmet.

                                 CAMERON
                        Why? His flip-flops are so safe.

           Willy pulls out in a beat-up, 1980 Datsun. Kimball rides 
           shotgun. He rolls down the window to Rusty.

                                 KIMBALL
                        Wanna hit a party later? This 
                        chick Amber’s throwing a rager.

                                 RUSTY
                        No thanks. Kind of over the high

                        Clever.

                        Amber is such a skank. She forgot

                                 CAMERON
                        Hop on. I’ll give you a ride. 

           EXT. STREET - SUNSET

           Brandy sits on the bike seat, Cameron pedals. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Dude, we haven’t done this since 
                        like fifth grade.

                                 CAMERON
                                 (breathing hard)
                        Yeah. You’ve put on some weight. 

           Brandy looks at Cameron’s calves. They’re kind of nice 
           for a bean pole. Cameron puts his feet down.

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        Switch?

           CONTINUED:

                                 BRANDY
                        Again? Don’t you need to bulk up?

                                 CAMERON
                        I’m sucking air here, Princess.

           Brandy takes a turn pedaling.

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        So, party’s at your place tonight?

                                 BRANDY
                        Yeah. Stupid Amber invited like 
                        the entire senior class. 

           Cameron can’t help but check out Brandy’s ass. Not bad.

                                 CAMERON
                        What time should the dudes and I 
                        hit it?

                                 BRANDY
                        Don’t. Amber doesn’t want a bunch 
                        of high school kids there. 

                                 CAMERON
                                 (hurt)
                        It’s all good. I hear ya.

           They pull into Brandy’s driveway.

                                 BRANDY
                        Thanks for the ride. Even if it 
                        was really slow.

                                 CAMERON
                        Sure thing. I enjoyed looking at 
                        your back sweat.

                                 BRANDY
                        Later, dick breath.

                                 CAMERON
                        See ya, fuckwit.

           Brandy walks in the house. Cameron pedals away.

           EXT. BRANDY’S HOUSE - NIGHT  

           The street is packed with cars, but only the Hell Bitch 
           is in the driveway. The front of the house is dark.

           EXT. BRANDY’S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Way too many TEENAGERS jump on the trampoline. A COUPLE 
           makes out in the hammock. STONERS lay in the neighbor’s 
           pasture.  A HEREFORD BULL keeps a suspicious eye on them. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

           FOOTBALL PLAYERS carry a fresh keg into the garage.

           INT. BRANDY’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           TEENAGERS cheer as the keg arrives. Music BLARES from a 
           ghetto blaster. A couple of FRIENDS high-five as a GIRL 
           empties a beer bong down her throat. 

           INT. BRANDY’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           An intense game of quarters at the kitchen table. A TEEN 
           steps on the carpet of the taped-off living room.

                                 AMBER
                        Hey, Tool! No one in the front 
                        room. Want me to get busted?

           The teen steps back into the kitchen.

                                 TEEN
                        My bad, Amber.

           Back to the sweet hostess, Amber raises her keg cup.

                                 AMBER
                        Cheers! Fucking class of ‘91!

           Teens CHEER. Wendy sneaks by in the background.

           INT. BRANDY AND AMBER’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Amber’s side of the room is messy. Phish and Grateful 
           Dead posters hang over her bed. Brandy’s side of the room 
           is neat and orderly with a tropical fish theme. 

           Wendy rushes in, pulling hidden beers from her jeans. 

                                 BRANDY
                        What the fuck? I thought you were 
                        getting snacks.

                                 WENDY
                        Better. I stole their beer.

           Wendy cracks a beer. She plugs her nose and chugs.

                                 WENDY (CONT’D)
                        Ick. I wish they had Boones.

                                 BRANDY
                        Dude, Amber will kill me! We’re 
                        not even suppose to be here.

           A trap door in the floor opens. Fiona’s head pops out 
           from the laundry chute.

           Wendy and Brandy pull Fiona up into the room.

                                 BRANDY
                        Why don’t you use the door like a 
                        normal person?

                                 FIONA
                        There’s no way I was walking 
                        through the party wearing this.

           Fiona wears a Big Bun Drive-Inn T-shirt and visor. 

                                 FIONA (CONT’D)
                        Snuck in through the laundry room. 
                        I get enough shit for my rack. I 
                        don’t need to hear about my ass.

                                 WENDY
                        Dude, you have to quit working 
                        there. Burgers and fries are the 
                        worst. My mom’s been feeding me 
                        nothing but ground turkey for two 
                        weeks and I already see more 
                        muscle definition.

           Wendy flexes her quads. It’s weird.

                                 FIONA
                        I can’t quit. It’s my dad’s 
                        business. He’d freak.

                                 BRANDY
                        Besides, nothing attracts guys 
                        like the scent of free fries. 

                                 WENDY
                        She has boobs. Boobs beat fries 
                        anyday.

           Fiona strips off her T-shirt and puts on sexy top.

                                 BRANDY
                        Nice hoochie shirt.

                                 FIONA
                        Thanks. I stole it from my Aunt. 
                        She’s divorced, so. Brought one 
                        for everyone.

           Wendy rifles through Fiona’s bag, pulling out tops.

                                 BRANDY
                        You guys, I don’t know. Amber will 
                        have a hernia if we go down there.

                                 FIONA
                        Chillax, Pancake. You just need 
                        some liquid courage.

           Fiona pulls out a bottle of lime-green Pucker. 

                                 BRANDY
                        What’s this?

                                 FIONA
                        Try it, light-weight.

           Brandy takes a tentative sip. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Not bad. Is it alcohol?

           INT. CAMERON’S GARAGE – NIGHT

           Cameron bench presses the bar. DUFFY (17), total meathead 
           and SWAN (17), sci-fi geek, spot him. They have their 
           shirts off. Lotta pale skin and boney ribs in this room.

                                 DUFFY
                        Come on, dude. Dig deep!

           Cameron drops the bar, exhausted. Duffy takes his turn. 

                                 DUFFY
                        Did you see Amber’s tits at the 
                        assembly? You could cut glass with 
                        those things. 

                                 SWAN
                        Gotta love air-conditioning. 
                                 (to Cameron)
                        You know, when Brandy fills out 
                        she’s gonna be hot, too. 

                                 CAMERON
                        You think? Guess her ass is okay.

                                 SWAN
                        You should hit that shit early. 
                        Before she’s outta your league.

                                 DUFFY
                        Totes. Camster, what if we just 
                        cruise by the party? If it’s 
                        packed, no one’s gonna give a 
                        rat’s ass. Know what I mean? 

                                 CAMERON
                        Maybe...

           The door opens. MRS. MITCHELL (40s) enters with snacks.

           Duffy and Swan go for the food.

                                 CAMERON
                        We need protein, Mom. I asked for 
                        steak.

                        I’m not cooking a steak at eleven 
                        PM, Cameron. Have a glass of milk.

           INT. BRANDY AND AMBER’S BEDROOM - LATER

           The Girls wear skanky tops a size too big. Fiona puts 
           make-up on Brandy. Wendy rubs mousse in her bangs.

                                 FIONA
                        You look hot, Pancake. Too bad no

                        stuck up here playing Anne Frank.

           Brandy takes a final swig from the Pucker. Tipsy, she 
           drops the bottle on the ground.

                                 WENDY
                        Oh my God. Did you drink that 
                        whole thing?

                        Yeah. Why?

           Fiona and Wendy share a look. 

           A motorcycle REVS outside. The Girls rush to the window.

                        Dude! Crusty Rusty!

                        What up, Killer!

           Rusty heads for the kitchen. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Oh my God I love him.

                                 AMBER (O.C.)
                        Hey! Shithead! I told you you’re 
                        not invited!

           Brandy turns to see Amber, glaring up at her.

                                 BRANDY
                        You’re not the boss of me, Amber.  

           Brandy heads down the stairs, pushing past Amber. The 
           Girls look at each other.

                                 WENDY
                        I like this side of her.

                        Yeah, it’s like she totally forgot 
                        about the stick up her ass.

           Amber stares down Fiona and Wendy.

                                 AMBER
                        If she embarrasses me, I’m holding

           MONTAGE

           GUYS CHANT as Brandy does a keg stand. Rusty winks at 
           her. She tries not to gag, happy.

           Drunk, Brandy starts a dance party in the garage. A total 
           spaz. She sees Rusty across the room and dances harder.

           Drunker, Brandy on the trampoline, showing off with 
           flips. She waves to Rusty. A show-off, she won’t let 
           anyone else jump with her.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT   

           Cameron and the dudes ride bikes down the quiet street. 
           Cameron takes a swig from a bottle and passes it on.

                        Follow me!

           Cameron pedals towards the pasture, drops his bike and 
           jumps the barb wire fence. The dudes follow.

           Football players work on a beer can pyramid. Brandy, 
           super obnoxious, takes the last can.

                                 BRANDY
                        Lemme top you off.

           A TEEN runs in the kitchen.

           A cramped, four by four foot chute with a mound of dirty 
           clothes. Brandy piles on top of Wendy and Fiona.

           INT. FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Amber, super calm, opens the door to two POLICE OFFICERS.

                                 AMBER
                        Good evening. How may I help you?

                                 OFFICER #1
                        You mean good morning. Your 
                        neighbor called about a party.

           Officer #1 tries to step inside. Amber steps outside and 
           closes the door before he can see in.

                                 AMBER
                        That’s right. My dad, Judge Clark, 
                        said I could have friends over.

                                 OFFICER #1
                        Judge Clark? He lives here?

                                 AMBER
                        Yes, I’m his daughter. I just 
                        graduated and Judge Clark wanted 
                        us to celebrate at home. Where 
                        we’d be safe from drunk drivers.

                                 OFFICER #2
                        So Judge Clark knows about this?

                                 AMBER
                        Of course. He’s upstairs. Asleep. 
                        Do you want me to wake him?

                        Well...no. But if we get another

           Brandy is passed out in Wendy’s lap.

           INT. LAUNDRY CHUTE - EARLY MORNING

           Brandy, snuggled under dirty laundry, opens her eyes. 
           Disoriented, she jumps and smacks her head.

           Brandy peeks out from the trap door. Her eyes go wide:

           AMBER AND RUSTY SPOON TOGETHER IN BRANDY’S BED.

                                 BRANDY

                        Get out, freak.

           Brandy’s dumbfounded. Pissed. Speechless.

           Amber pulls Pee Wee from under her hip. The string gets 
           caught and retracts.

                        Get out!

                                 (yelling after her)
                        Sorry, can’t understand you. I 
                        don’t speak slut!

           Brandy stares at the condom. So that’s what they look 
           like.

           INT. BIG BUN DRIVE INN - NEXT DAY

           A 1950s drive-thru burger shack. Fiona works the window.

                                 FIONA
                                 (into intercom)
                        Welcome to Big Bun. May I take 
                        your order?

                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                                 (into intercom)
                        My sister is a total whore!

           WORKERS stare at Fiona. Fiona looks out the window. 
           Brandy and Wendy are on their bicycles in the drive-thru.

                                 FIONA
                                 (into intercom)
                        Um, that’s not on the menu.
           EXT. BIG BUN DRIVE INN - MOMENTS LATER

           The Girls sit at a picnic table in the parking lot.

                                 BRANDY
                        Amber cannot keep her legs shut!

                        You’re over-reacting, Pancake.

                        So they hooked up. Big deal. Rusty 
                        has like the worst rep of Class of 
                        ‘89.

                                 BRANDY
                        It is a big deal! You don’t just 
                        fuck someone for the fun of it!

           Wendy and Fiona shrug.

                                 FIONA
                        Okay. We’re not saying you need to 
                        be a total slut, but...

                                 WENDY
                        ...you are like the biggest prude

                        Okay. Maybe I have been a bit of a 
                        prude. But not anymore. Wendy, do 
                        you still have the condoms we 
                        stole from the school nurse?

                                 FIONA
                        Easy, Pancake. You can’t expect to 
                        hit a home run when you’ve never 
                        been up to bat. Baby steps.

           Brandy takes The List and gets on her bike.

           INT. BRANDY’S ROOM - EVENING

           Brandy sits at her desk, surrounded by glitter pens and 
           puffy paint. She copies Fiona’s greasy list onto her best  
           “Save the Manatee” stationary.

           INT. STATION WAGON - NEXT DAY

           Brandy SLAMS the Hell Bitch door. She flips Amber off as 
           she drives away. Cameron pedals over.

           INT. GUARD ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A dark, windowless room with lockers. Brandy and Cameron 
           enter. Rusty and Kimball sit on a bench, GIGGLING.

           Brandy intentionally ignores Rusty. He doesn’t notice.

           Brandy opens her locker and GASPS. The inside is 
           decorated with naked men from Playgirl.

           Grade school kids, aka POOL RATS, wait on the steps. 
           Willy turns the sign to OPEN. The Pool Rats CHEER.

           MONTAGE:

           Kids wiggle into goggles and swim masks.

           Moms rub suncreen on squirming toddlers.

           Kids rush the pool, jumping and falling over each other.

           SLOW MOTION SHOT: BRANDY STRUTS TOWARD THE GUARD STAND 
           LIKE A MODEL ON THE CATWALK. LOWERS HER RAY BANS. TWIRLS 
           HER WHISTLE. IT SMACKS HER IN THE FACE. SHE RECOVERS. 

           Brandy climbs the guard stand. She has arrived.

           EXT. POOL - LATER   

           The pool is a mess of screaming, bratty kids. Brandy 
           BLOWS her whistle, frustrated and exhausted. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Hey, guy! Off the rope.

                        Mayonnaise in my sunscreen bottle? 
                        Oh, come on! I’m not that pale! 

           INT. POOL OFFICE - DAY   

           Kids SCREAM as a piece of poop floats in the shallow end. 
           Willy hands Brandy a skimmer. 

                                 WILLY
                        Newbie’s on poop patrol.

                                 BRANDY
                        Ha ha. Very funny. How very 
                        Caddyshack of you.

           Brandy heads for the shallow end.

                                 WILLY
                        What does she mean by Caddyshack?

           Rusty shrugs. They turn to watch.

           ANGLE ON SHALLOW END

                                 KIDS 
                        Poop! Poop!

                                 BRANDY
                        Relax, dudes. It’s not poop. I’m 
                        getting hazed. 

           Brandy reaches for the floater with the skimmer.

           ANGLE ON OFFICE

                                 WILLY
                        Oh no. She’s not gonna--

                                 RUSTY
                        Dude. She’s gonna.

           Brandy takes a giant bite of the poop. She immediately 
           spits it out. 

           ANGLE ON SHALLOW END

                             GIRL

                                              Poop breathe!

           Brandy GAGS then PUKES in the pool. Mortified, she looks 
           up. Rusty and the guards LAUGHS at her. 

           EXT. POOL – LATE AFTERNOON

           The pool is closed. Kimball hands Brandy a scrub brush.

                                 RUSTY
                        Camster already started on the

                        help him, Cutie?

                                 BRANDY

                        My name is Brandy. Go objectify 
                        someone your own size. 

           Brandy takes the bucket and heads for the locker room.

                                 WILLY
                        What are you dip-shits up to now?

           INT. MEN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           An open dressing room. Cameron showers, NAKED. Brandy 
           enters. Stares at Cameron’s backside. 

           Cameron rinses his hair, letting the soapy water run over 
           his face. Eyes closed. He turns, facing Brandy.

                                 BRANDY
                        Whoa. You’re not circumcised.

           Cameron opens his eyes. Sees Brandy. Covers himself.

                                 CAMERON
                        What the fuck!

                        Get the fuck out!

           EXT. POOL - CONTINUOUS

           Brandy stumbles out, dazed.

                                 KIMBALL
                        Gotcha, Newbie!

                                 RUSTY
                        How was the view, Cutie?

                                 BRANDY
                        The view? 
                                 (realizing)
                        Jerk-offs! I should sue all of you 
                        for sexual harassment!

           Kimball and Rusty enter the men’s room, laughing.

                                 CAMERON (O.S.)
                        You guys are dicks!

                                 RUSTY (O.S.)
                        Yes. Yes we are.

           EXT. PARKING LOT – LATER

           Brandy sits on the steps. Waiting for Amber. Cameron 
           exits. He unlocks his bike, not making eye contact.

                                 CAMERON
                        Get on.

           EXT. STREET - SUNSET

           Cameron peddles Brandy home in awkward silence.

           INT. BRANDY’S ROOM - NIGHT   

           Amber’s side of the room is now empty. MRS. CLARK (40s), 
           dressed in her nurse uniform, helps Brandy move her bed.

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        Wasn’t that nice of Amber to give 
                        you your own room? You’re lucky 
                        you have such a kind older sister.   

                                 BRANDY
                                 (sarcastic)
                        Yes. I’m incredibly blessed.

                        Hey, Mom why are some guys not 
                        circumcised?

           Mrs. Clark sits at Brandy’s desk. She takes a sea horse 
           pencil and draws a penis on a whale note pad.

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        Most boys are circumcised as 
                        newborns. 
                                 (draws foreskin)
                        The doctor removes the foreskin 
                        from the penis. Some do it for 
                        religious reasons, others because 
                        it’s thought to be more hygienic. 
                        In the olden days, some doctors 
                        saw it as a way of preventing 
                        masturbation.

                                 BRANDY
                        Wait...preventing masturbation?

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        The foreskin is extremely 
                        sensitive. If you remove it, some 
                        argue you reduce the male’s sexual 
                        pleasure. 

                                 BRANDY
                        That’s terrible. Does it hurt?

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        Good question. George?

           JUDGE CLARK (40s) pokes his head in Brandy’s room.

                                 JUDGE CLARK
                        Yeah, hon?

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        Do you remember your circumcision?

           Judge Clark looks at Brandy and frowns.

                                 JUDGE CLARK
                        That’s private.

           EXT. BRANDY’S ROOM - LATER

           Brandy opens her desk. Inside is the new and improved To-
           Do List, protected with a plastic report cover. Next to 
           it is the condom in a Ziploc baggie. She tucks Mrs. 
           Clark’s penis illustration inside and closes her desk. 

           EXT. POOL - DAY   

           Brandy’s on the stand. The Girls lay-out on towels. They 
           stare at Cameron on the opposite stand.

                        Kind of like...a turtleneck.

                        Circumcised guys last longer. 
                        Because they’re not as sensitive. 

                                 FIONA
                        Yeah. But guys who aren’t 
                        circumcised come really hard. 

           Pool Rats, hiding on the inside edge of the pool, 
           eavesdrop on The Girls. Fascinated. 

                                 BRANDY (O.C.)
                        And they have to make sure they 
                        wash after sex. Otherwise germs 
                        collect and they get syphilis.

                        Loosen up, Cameron. It’s summer.
                                 (beat)
                        So where are the P’s?

                                 CAMERON
                        At the lake. They left fifty bones 
                        for food. Figured I’d spend it on 
                        alcohol. 

           Cameron stares at Brandy’s legs. They look hot in her 
           short skirt.

                                 BRANDY
                        What?

                                 CAMERON
                        It’s just...you’re...tan.

                                 BRANDY
                        Got tired of being called 
                        Mayonnaise. 

           Brandy punches him playfully in the arm. It’s firm.

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                        Weird. Have you been working out?

                                 CAMERON
                        Uh, yeah. Sort of. 

           Brandy looks at the fridge, covered in family photos.

                                 BRANDY
                        Man, our parents have known each 
                        other through some really bad 
                        fashion trends. Check-out your 
                        dad’s bell-bottoms.

                                 CAMERON
                        And your mom’s beehive.

           They both spot the same picture and LAUGH.

           CLOSE ON BRANDY AND CAMERON AS KIDS ROASTING HOTDOGS.

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        I still have a scar on my finger 
                        from when you dared me to pick up 
                        that flaming hotdog.

           BRANDY’S POV ON CAMERON’S SPARKLING, CLEAN HANDS.

           Brandy leans in...and kisses Cameron.

           INT. DEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Brandy and Cameron kiss on the couch. Cameron caresses 
           Brandy’s face. Brandy guides his hand down. He caresses 
           her midriff. Then caresses her face again.

                                 CAMERON
                        Do you know how pretty you are?

                                 BRANDY
                        Uh huh.

           Brandy moves his hands down, AGAIN. He rubs her back. 
           Brandy makes a face. This guy cannot take a hint.

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                                 (whispers)
                        I’m so wet. Touch me.

                                 CAMERON
                                 (awkward)
                        Uh...okay.

           Cameron, tentative, reaches up Brandy’s skirt. She helps 
           him. Brandy’s eyes go wide. She stops kissing him, 
           focused on what’s happening down below.

           The lights come on. 

                                 DUFFY (O.S.)
                        Out of beer, Camster. We’re taking 
                        donations.

           REVEAL Duffy standing over them, holding out his hand. 
           Cameron slowly pulls his hand from Brandy’s panties. He 
           reaches into his pocket and pulls out a five.

                                 DUFFY (CONT’D)
                        Thanks, dude. ‘Sup, Brandy?

           HOLD on Brandy’s face.

           EXT. BRANDY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Brandy stands on the front porch, skimming a movie review 
           of Backdraft. Fiona’s truck pulls away in the background. 

           INT. BRANDY’S HOUSE – NIGHT

           Mrs. Clark reads in the living room. Brandy enters. 

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        Hi, sweetie. How was the movie?

                                 BRANDY
                                 (lying)
                        The movie was...good. We saw 
                        Backdraft. Two brothers battled 
                        blazes in the Windy City.

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        I heard William Baldwin is cute.

                                 BRANDY
                        Yes. A winning performance.
                                 (beat)
                        Mom, can I ask you something?

           Mrs. Clark takes a bridge pad and pencil from the end 
           table, ready for another one of Brandy’s questions.

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        Ask away.

                                 BRANDY
                        It might make you uncomfortable.

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        Brandy, I’m a nurse. You can ask 
                        me anything. 

                                 BRANDY
                        When a guy fingers you--

                                 MRS. CLARK
                                 (cutting her off)
                        Okay. Good night.
                                 (to self)
                        I thought Backdraft was PG-13. 
                        Shame on you, Ron Howard.

           Mrs. Clark heads for the stairs. Brandy watches her go.
           INT. BRANDY’S ROOM - LATER

           Brandy sits at her desk with The List. She shakes an 
           outliner pen and in perfect silver lettering she writes 
           “Cameron” next to “Finger Bang.”

           INT. POOL OFFICE – DAY

           Brandy rings up a swimmer at the register. Cameron checks 
           bags. They avoid eye contact. Willy, hung-over, enters.

                                 BRANDY
                        You look like shit, Mr. Anderson.

                                 WILLY
                        Nothing a little hair of the dog 
                        won’t cure.

           Willy grabs a beer from the mini-fridge.

                                 WILLY (CONT’D)
                        If anyone needs me, I’ll be in the 
                        guard room catching some Zs. 

           Willy exits as The Girls enter. 

                                 WENDY
                        Friends swim for free, right, 
                        Pancake?

                                 BRANDY
                        Wrong. Dollar fifty. Each.

                        Bun!

                                 BRANDY
                        Just following the rules.

                                 FIONA
                        Tight-ass.
                                 (to Cameron)
                        What’s up, Turtleneck?

           Brandy shoots Fiona a look. Cameron stares at Fiona 
           blankly. Then it hits him.

                                 CAMERON
                                 (to Brandy)
                        You told them?

                                 BRANDY
                        Don’t get mad. My mom said your 
                        foreskin will make sex more 
                        pleasurable--

                                 CAMERON
                        You told your mom!?!

                        Is it true you can’t help jerking 
                        off all the time?

           Suddenly, four HILLCREST LIFEGUARDS sprint through the 
           office, wearing nothing but their sneakers. 

                                 WENDY
                        Does everyone just get naked at 
                        this pool? 

           EXT. POOL - CONTINUOUS

                                 HILLCREST LIFEGUARDS
                        Cannonball run, motherfuckers!

           KIDS and MOMS SCREAM as the naked guards bomb the water.  
           Willy runs out of the guard room.

                                 WILLY
                        What the hell?

                                 RUSTY
                        It’s the Hillcrest guards! 

                                 WILLY
                        Same shit every summer. Get ‘em!

           Kimball and Rusty dive into the pool, attacking the naked 
           guards.  

                                 FIONA
                        I wonder if they have any idea how 
                        gay they look, wrestling around 
                        like that.

           ANGLE ON THE POOL

           GUARD #1 NAILS Kimball in the nose. GUARD #2 KNEES Rusty 
           in the balls.

                                 KIMBALL
                                 (holding bloody nose)
                        Fucking pricks!

                        Dude, my right ballsack...

           The streakers scramble out. Willy chases after them with 
           the power sprayer, soaking everyone in his path.

           NICOLE (30s), tall and pretty, walks up the pool steps. 
           The Hillcrest guards push past. Willy charges on.

           Willy stops. He shuts off the hose. 

                                 NICOLE (CONT’D)
                        We need to talk. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Willy and Nicole argue in the parking lot. The Girls 
           eavesdrop through the chain-link fence.

                                 NICOLE
                        That’s all you have to say?

                        You can start by not calling me 
                        dude! This is serious, Willy.

                        Bet he cheated on her. Look at her 
                        body language. No, wait, maybe she 
                        found his grow lamps. Oh! Bet he 
                        tried to put it in the back door--

                                 BRANDY
                        You really love gossip, don’t you?

                        Oh yeah. He totally cheated. 

           Nicole gets in her car and backs out.

                        Nicole, can you at least--

                        Don’t even think about asking me

                        Nicole on the rag, or what?

           Willy ignores him. He keeps walking, straight into the 
           deep end, fully clothed. The Girls look to Brandy.

                                 FIONA
                        Pancake, your job is whack.

           EXT. POOL - EVENING

           The pool is closed. Brandy exits the guard room. Willy 
           sits on the low-dive, staring into the water.

           Willy looks up. Brandy, sitting on the high-dive, throws 
           him a beer. She cracks one open for herself. 

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                        So are you in total hot water with 
                        your girlfriend or what?

                                 WILLY

                        old sucks. 

           Willy slides back in the pool, sinking to the bottom. The 
           sun sets behind Brandy as she polishes off her beer.

           INT. BRANDY’S ROOM – NIGHT

           Brandy plops down on her bed. A shoe box of sex-ed 
           paraphernalia is on the night stand: condoms, spermicide, 
           a children’s book on where babies come from.

                                 BRANDY
                        Oh Mom. Come on.  

           Brandy pulls a J Crew Catalog from under her bed. 

           Slowly turning the pages, her hand moves down. Brandy 
           masturbates.

           BRANDY’S FANTASY MONTAGE

           Brandy gazes at the male models. They morph into Rusty.

           Rusty and Brandy in monogrammed pajamas by the fire. 

           Rusty and Brandy in rugby shirts in a pile of leaves. 

           Rusty lowering the strap of Brandy’s J Crew tankini.

                                 RUSTY
                                 (fantasy voice)
                        SPF 45?

                                 BRANDY
                        Yes, please...

           Sound of a MOTORCYCLE. Brandy, about to climax, stops. 

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                        What the--

           She creeps to the window. 

           BRANDY POV ON RUSTY AND AMBER MAKING OUT IN THE DRIVEWAY. 

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                        Get a room, skank.

           Brandy goes back to the J Crew catalog. She flips a page 
           and then throws it on the ground. No longer in the mood.

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                        Ugh. She ruins everything.

           EXT. POOL – MORNING

           The guards stare in silence. The stands are gone.

                                 WILLY
                        God damn it.

                                 BRANDY

                        Hillcrest pricks. Guess their 
                        Naked Cannonball Run was just a 
                        scout for the real prank.  

                                 KIMBALL
                        We should chop down their stupid 
                        water slide.

                                 WILLY
                        No one is chopping down anything. 
                        I have bigger things to worry 
                        about than some stupid prank.

                        But where do we sit?

                                 WILLY
                        Where you always sit! On your ass! 

           Willy walks off, kicking a stack of kick boards.

           EXT. POOL PARKING LOT - EVENING

           Fiona pulls up in her pick-up. Brandy hops in the cab. A 
           BABY in a car seat looks up at her.

                                 BRANDY
                        You’re baby-sitting? I thought we 
                        were going to Wendy’s?

                                 FIONA
                        We are. My niece is just a prop. 

           EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - EVENING

           Fiona pulls into the gas station. She unbuckles the baby.

                                 FIONA
                        No one’s gonna card me with a 
                        baby. 

           INT. CONVENIENCE STORE – MOMENTS LATER

           The CLERK watches Fiona, baby on her hip, set a pack of 
           Zima and half-rack of Keystone Ice on the counter. 

                                 FIONA

           The baby tugs on Fiona’s shirt, showing off her cleavage. 

                                 CLERK
                                 (staring at breasts)
                        Still breast feeding?

                        Yeah. My baby must be hungry.

           Fiona exits. Nicole, Willy’s girlfriend, holds the door 
           for her.

           INT. FIONA’S PICK-UP - MOMENTS LATER

           Fiona enters, bubbling. 

                                 FIONA
                                 (points to Nicole)
                        Check it. That’s Willy’s 
                        girlfriend right? Well, even she 
                        thought I was a mom. But that’s 
                        not the best part. She’s pregnant 
                        and asked for advice!

                                 BRANDY
                        Wait. Pregnant?

                                 FIONA
                        Yeah! Holy shit! Gossip gold mine! 
                        I told her to suck on lemons to 
                        help with morning sickness. That’s 
                        what my Aunt did...

           Brandy looks at Nicole through the store window. 

           EXT. WENDY’S HOUSE - NIGHT   

           Wendy shoots hoops in the driveway. She wears Strength-
           Shoes, high-tops with platforms under the front of the 
           foot. Fiona and Brandy pull up in the truck.  

                                 WENDY
                        What the fuck, bitches? I only 
                        have three hours before my parents 
                        get back from the baseball game!

                                 FIONA
                        Chill. We stopped for supplies.

                        What the fuck’s on your feet?

                                 WENDY
                        Strength-shoes. My mom said 
                        they’ll increase my vertical.

           Fiona and Brandy shrug. They head inside.

                                 WENDY (CONT’D)
                                 (screaming)
                        Take off your shoes! And do not 
                        enter the formal living room. If 
                        there are footprints on the carpet 
                        my mom will totally kick my ass!
           INT. WENDY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Fiona argues on the phone. The Girls watch.

                                 (into phone)

                        coming? As if!

           She SLAMS the phone down.

                        Dick. Chad and his hot cousins 
                        totally bailed on us.

           INT. WENDY’S FAMILY ROOM – MINUTES LATER

           The Girls sit on one couch. Cameron, Duffy, and Swan sit 
           on the opposite couch. Boyz in the Hood plays in the VCR. 
           The guys sip beer. The Girls sip Zima. It’s awkward.

           Brandy makes a face at Cameron. He makes a face back, 
           picking his nose. Brandy BURPS. Cameron FARTS.

                                 FIONA
                        Disgusting!

           Brandy and Cameron crack up.

                                 BRANDY
                        Wendy, can I grab a snack?

                                 CAMERON
                        I’ll join you.

                                 WENDY
                        Only take a string cheese or 
                        grapes! That’s what’s on the menu! 

                                 CAMERON
                        Menu?

           Brandy taps the detailed menu taped to the refrigerator.

                                 CAMERON
                        I can’t believe her mom plans 
                        every meal for the month.

                                 BRANDY
                        Yeah, total control freak. She 
                        won’t even let Wendy make her own 
                        bed. Thinks she’ll do it wrong. 

           Brandy opens the fridge. 

                                 CAMERON
                        I dare you to take a pudding cup.

                                 BRANDY
                        And get Wendy grounded? Done.

           INT. WENDY’S FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Brandy and Cameron enter. Total make-out fest. Wendy and 
           Duffy on the couch. Fiona and Swan on a Lazy-Boy.

           On the TV, a heart wrenching scene from Boyz in the Hood.

           INT. WENDY’S FORMAL LIVING ROOM – MOMENTS LATER

           Brandy and Cameron dry hump across the meticulously 
           vacuumed carpet. Really working it through their clothes. 
           They make their way full-circle around the coffee table.

                                 BRANDY
                                 (whispers)
                        I wanna jerk you off.

           Cameron GROANS. His body relaxes. He came already.

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t even touch you.

                                 CAMERON
                        It’s the thought that counts?

                        No. The thought doesn’t count. 

           Wendy walks in.

           Brandy waves goodbye to Cameron and closes the door. 

           INT. BRANDY’S ROOM – NIGHT

           Brandy writes “Cameron” by “Dry Hump” on The List.  She 
           looks at “Hand Job” and shakes her head, disappointed.

           EXT. POOL OFFICE - MORNING

           The guards drink coffee and eat donuts. Willy enters.

                                 BRANDY
                        Just heading out.

           Willy grabs a beer from the mini-fridge.

                        Nice. Drinking before noon.

                                 WILLY
                        That’s what happens when you move 
                        in with your mother. Don’t know 
                        how much longer I can do it.

           Brandy takes off her sweats, wearing her bathing suit.

           zips it back up.

                        your neck.

                                 CAMERON
                        Jesus. You did a number on me.

                                 BRANDY
                        Me? I’m the one with the bruises!

           Cameron wraps his arms around her waist.

                                 CAMERON
                        Guess we need to be more gentle 
                        next time.

                        to be a next time?

           EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - BOISE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY   

           Boise High Class of 1991 High School Graduation. A no 
           frills, outdoor ceremony behind the high school. 

           Brandy sits with her parents. Next to them are Cameron 
           and his parents, MR. AND MRS. MITCHELL. They watch the 
           ceremony from the 50-yard-line. 

           ON STAGE

                        There’s our beautiful girl!

           Amber walks on stage. A masking-tape Grateful Dead logo 
           on top of her graduation cap.

                                 JUDGE CLARK
                        Now why did she do that?

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        Oh, George. She wants to stand out 
                        in the crowd.

                        Don’t spend it all in one place.

                                 AMBER
                        I won’t. Thank you so much! 

           Brandy unrolls Amber’s diploma. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Hey, this is just a blank sheet of 
                        paper.

           Amber grabs the paper from Brandy.

                                 AMBER
                        Mind your own beeswax.

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        It’s nothing to be ashamed of. 
                        Amber has to take algebra again in 
                        summer school. She’ll pass and 
                        still be able to start University 
                        of Idaho next fall, won’t you 
                        sweetheart?

                                 BRANDY
                        Oh my God! You flunked Algebra? I 
                        took that in like ninth grade. I’m 
                        in AP Calculus next year. You 
                        really are an airhead!

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        Be nice. This is Amber’s day.

                                 BRANDY
                        But she didn’t graduate!

                                 JUDGE CLARK
                        Brandy. Enough. 

           In the background, Rusty pulls up on his motorcycle. 
           Amber and Brandy turn at the same time. 

                                 AMBER
                        I’m gonna go. I have that all-
                        night graduation party to get to. 

                                 BRANDY
                        I bet you do.
           EXT. CAMERON’S BACKYARD – EVENING

           Brandy and Cameron sit at the patio table with their 
           parents. Brandy stares as:

           Judge Clark pulls a big, thick pickle from a jar.

                                 JUDGE CLARK
                        Slippery little devil!

           Mrs. Mitchell JERKS a ketchup bottle up and down.

                                 MRS. MITCHELL 
                        Come on, I know you’re in there!

           Mrs. Clark SQUEEZES liquid butter on her corn on the cob. 

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        Mmmm. Oh that’s good.

           Brandy looks at Cameron. She pushes her plate away.

                                 BRANDY
                        Well, I’m stuffed. Cameron, don’t 
                        you have a new CD to show me?

           INT. CAMERON’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Brandy pulls Cameron onto the waterbed. Waves ripple 
           through the mattress, jiggling them.

           Brandy kisses Cameron. Long and hard. Like in the movies. 
           Cameron opens his eyes. Brandy finally lets go. 

                                 CAMERON
                        Um, let me put on some music. So 
                        our parents don’t think 
                        we’re...you know...

           Cameron reaches over to the boombox and hits play.

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        Have you heard Pearl Jam? Rusty 
                        gave it to me-

           Brandy takes off her shirt. 

                                 BRANDY
                        I don’t want to talk about Rusty. 

           Brandy starts to undo Cameron’s belt. 

                                 CAMERON
                        Copy that. 

           Turned on, Cameron kisses Brandy. She looks down. He’s 
           hard! She grins. Puts her hand on his crotch. He YELPS.

                        Sorry. My bad. I’m cool. I’m cool.

           Cameron puts her hand back on his crotch.

           OVER CAMERON’S SHOULDER, WE SEE BRANDY PULL HIS BOXERS 
           DOWN. SHE MOVES HER ARM, GIVING HIM A HAND JOB. 

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                                 (moaning)
                        Oh wow. 

           Brandy’s face lights up. She works harder. Concentrating.

                        How’s this?

                        Oh wowwy. Oh Brandy. Oh wow...

           Brandy’s hand CRAMPS! She switches hands, determined.

                        Oh God, I love you. I love you!

           Brandy’s eyes go wide.

           BRANDY’S POV ON CAMERON’S JIZZ ON HER BELLY.

           Brandy is freaked out. Cameron holds her. 

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        You’re amazing.

           Brandy slips away, trying not to get the jizz everywhere.

           INT. CAMERON’S BATHROOM – CONTINUOUS

           Brandy looks at the jizz on her stomach. AMAZED.

                        Everything okay?

           Brandy wipes the jizz off with a Star Wars hand towel. 
           She opens the door.

           wrapping her arms around his waist. They ride off.

           Amber shoves a crumpled bill through the window. Brandy 
           unlocks the door. Amber enters, SLAMS the door shut.

           Brandy watches Cameron on the opposite stand. He squirts 
           sunscreen on his stomach. It looks just like the jizz. He 
           waves, she looks away, blushing hard.

                                 THE GIRLS
                        Ten!

                                 FIONA
                        Once I threw up a little. I have 
                        an easy gag reflex.

           ANGLE ON DIVING BOARD

           Pool Rat #1 and #2 look at each other, grossed out.

                                 POOL RAT #1
                        They barf on your pecker?

           INT. GUARD ROOM - EVENING

           The pool is closed. Cameron and Brandy grab their bags.

                                 CAMERON
                        Wanna ride home? I think I can 
                        pedal the whole way now.

           Brandy stares at the Playgirl pictures in her locker. 

                                 BRANDY
                                 (avoids eye contact)
                        Um, I’m good. I’ll wait for Amber. 

                                 CAMERON
                        Are you okay? I mean, you’re cool 
                        with everything, right?

                                 BRANDY
                        You mean about...yeah, yeah. 
                        Totally. It’s all good.

                                 CAMERON
                                 (relieved)
                        Okay. Cool. Well, see ya tomorrow.

           Awkward, Cameron gives Brandy a quick peck on the cheek 
           and exits, blushing.

                                 BRANDY
                                 (confused)
                        What’s that suppose to mean?
           EXT. POOL - EVENING

           Brandy rides an inflatable dolphin, Willy floats on an 
           inflatable whale. They sip beers.

                                 BRANDY
                        So how long have you and Nicole 
                        been together?

                                 WILLY
                        Would have been three years this 
                        August.

                                 BRANDY
                        You broke up? I thought you would 
                        get married.

                                 WILLY
                                 (taken aback)
                        Why would you think that?

                                 BRANDY
                                 (covering)
                        No reason. Just, you know, you 
                        live together and stuff. 

                                 WILLY
                        Did. That was a disaster. So, you 
                        and Cameron an item now?

           Brandy blushes.

                                 BRANDY
                        What? No. We’re just friends.

           Willy gives her a look, not believing her.

                                 WILLY
                        My advice? Play the field while 
                        you’re young. No reason to tie 
                        yourself down.
                                 (beat)
                        God, I’d give anything to be 
                        eighteen again.

                                 BRANDY
                        I’m sixteen.

                                 WILLY
                        Fuck. I’m old. 

           EXT. STREET – EVENING

           Willy drives Brandy home. They pass the sewage plant. 

                                 WILLY
                        Son of a bitch. 

           Brandy follows Willy’s look.

           THE LIFEGUARD STANDS SIT NEXT TO A SEWAGE CESSPOOL.

           EXT. BRANDY’S BACKYARD – FOURTH OF JULY

           Backyard Fourth of July party. Picnic table covered with 
           potluck food. ADULTS mingle around a kiddie pool filled 
           with ice and beer. KIDS run around throwing pop-its.  

           Judge Clark SWEARS at his charcoal grill. 

                                 JUDGE CLARK
                        Good Christ! Jeannie, the charcoal 
                        won’t light!

                                 MR. MITCHELL
                        I told you gas is better, George!

           Cameron hands Mrs. Clark an apple pie.

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        Cameron Mitchell’s famous apple 
                        pie! Oh, Brandy’s going to be 
                        disappointed. 

                                 CAMERON
                        She’s not here?

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        Oh no, sweetie. She went to the 
                        lake with Wendy’s family. 

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY   

           Fiona’s truck putters along, climbing into the foothills. 

                                 BRANDY
                        I love how easy it was to lie to 
                        my parents.

                                 WENDY
                        We didn’t lie. My parents are 
                        camping. We’re just not with them.

                                 BRANDY
                        And you are with me, just not at 
                        my parent’s party.

           The back of the truck is filled with camping gear...and 
           cans of pineapple juice.

           EXT. CAMPSITE - LUCKY PEAK RESERVOIR – EVENING

           A shitty reservoir in the high desert. The truck turns 
           into a campsite.  It’s filled with TEENAGERS, partying.  
           EXT. DOCK - LUCKY PEAK RESERVOIR - SUNSET

           Dressed in bikinis, The Girls hold hands and run off the 
           dock into the water, SCREAMING.  

           INT. WATER - CONTINUOUS

           The Girls surface, giggling.

                                 BRANDY
                        We should skinny dip! 

           The Girls throw their bikinis on the dock. Brandy’s top 
           hits JEROME (17), a cute black guy in Hammer pants. He 
           stands with his three friends.

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                        Oops. 

           Jerome turns to MACE (17), Vanilla-Ice flat top.

                                 JEROME
                        Hit it.

           Mace hits the boombox on his shoulder. COLOR ME BADD’S “I 
           Wanna Sex You Up” blares. The foursome, aka COLOR ME 
           GOOD, a lip sync/dance crew, perform a choreographed 
           routine for The Girls on the dock.

                        And this is what I’ll do...

                        Is this for real?

                                 FIONA
                        The black guy looks like Bobby 
                        Brown. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Yeah. He’s cute.

                                 FIONA
                        I call Vanilla Ice.

           EXT. CAMPFIRE - LUCKY PEAK RESERVOIR - NIGHT   

           The Girls and Color Me Good crowd around a campfire. 
           Color Me Good drinks pineapple juice. 

                                 JEROME
                                 (to Brandy)
                        Thanks for the juice. All that 
                        ‘syncin’ and dancin’ makes a man 
                        thirsty.

                                 BRANDY
                        I bet it does.

                                 MACE
                                 (takes a swig)
                        A lot of people would think a 
                        dance crew like Color Me Good 
                        would party hard but we’re 
                        Straight Edge. 

           The Girls, nonchalant, toss their beers into the dark.

                                 JEROME
                        Touring takes a toll on the bod. 
                        We hit Boise Towne Square Mall 
                        yesterday, tomorrow we’re off to 
                        Pocatello for the Eastern Idaho 
                        Fair, after that we have a car 
                        dealership opening in Twin Falls.

                                 MACE
                        Man, the shit’s crazy.

                                 JEROME
                        Hit it. 

           Mace hits the boombox. Naughty By Nature’s “O.P.P.” 
           blasts. Color Me Good ‘syncs and dances again. The Girls 
           join in. Jerome and Brandy grind a la Club MTV.

           INT. TENT - LUCKY PEAK RESERVOIR - LATER

           Brandy and Jerome get it on. Lots of heavy petting. The 
           sound of friction against the nylon sleeping bags.

                                 BRANDY
                                 (whispers)
                        Want me to, um, suck your dick?

                                 JEROME
                        Mmmm.

           Brandy has no idea what that means. 

                                 BRANDY
                                 (louder)
                        Excuse me, Jerome? Would you like 
                        me to give you fellatio?

                        Do it, girl.

           Jerome pulls down his pants. Brandy sees his erection 
           under his boxers. Her eyes go wide. She sweats, nervous.

                                 BRANDY
                                 (working up courage)
                        I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna suck 
                        your dick.

                                 JEROME
                        Yeah, baby.

                                 (not sexy)
                        Really gonna do it. Gonna put my 
                        mouth...on your cock. 

           Jerome runs his hands through her hair, gyrates his hips 
           closer to her face. Brandy lowers herself.

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                        Yep. Here we go.

           Brandy pulls down his boxers. CLOSE ON Jerome’s face.

                                 BRANDY  (O.C.)(CONT’D)

                        You are one sexy talker. Oh YEAH.

           EXT. BRANDY’S BACKYARD - NIGHT   

           A Piccolo Peat fountain SCREAMS as Judge Clark puts on 
           his fireworks show. Cameron is his reluctant assistant. A 
           few polite CLAPS from the PARTY GUESTS.

                                 JUDGE CLARK
                        Oh, the crowd liked that one. And 
                        now, for the grand finale...PUNK!

           Cameron hands Judge Clark the punk.

                                 JUDGE CLARK (CONT’D)
                                 (lights fountain)
                        Hit the deck, Cameron!

           Cameron lowers himself to the ground. Judge Clark rolls 
           next to him.

                                 JUDGE CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Ta da! The ever popular, Christmas-
                        in-July fountain!

           A pathetic shower of red and green sparks.
           EXT. TENT - LUCKY PEAK RESERVOIR - NIGHT   

           KABOOM! Fireworks explode across the water, lighting up 
           Brandy’s tent. 

           SILHOUETTE OF BRANDY GIVING JEROME A BLOW JOB.

                                 (groan)

           Brandy lifts her head. Mouth closed. Lips sealed.

                        Girl. You know it’s true.

           Brandy nods. Happy.

           EXT. TENT - LUCKY PEAK RESERVOIR - CONTINUOUS

           The tent UNZIPS. Brandy sticks her head out. She SPITS. 
           GASPS for air. Wipes her mouth. 

           KABOOM! She watches another firework light up the sky.

           EXT. CAMPSITE - LUCKY PEAK RESERVOIR - NEXT MORNING

           The Girls pack up their tents. Brandy takes a pull from a 
           giant Sunny Delight jug.

                        I know! I think I got like five 
                        minutes of sleep.  Did you get 
                        bonus?

                        He tried. But I’m saving myself 
                        for Duffy.

                                 BRANDY
                        Tank Top? Why?

                                 WENDY
                        I like him. We can both bench 
                        press our own body weight.

                        Why does everyone think we’re

                        Okay, I do like Cameron. But we’re 
                        too young to be serious. Besides, 
                        guys don’t want girlfriends in the 
                        summer. Look what happened to 
                        Amber and Rusty. And Willy and 
                        Nicole. I don’t want to be that 
                        cliché girl that gets all attached 
                        and then gets dumped.

           EXT. POOL - DAY

           Brandy sits on the stand, watching Willy and Rusty bolt 
           the opposite stand into the cement. 

                                 RUSTY
                        This is bullshit. We need revenge.

                        Forget it. Hand me the wrench.

           Brandy SIGHS as Rusty lifts the heavy tool box, muscles 
           flexing. Cameron hoses off the pool deck next to her.

                                 BRANDY
                        Hey, Cam. Cover for me? I really

           Cameron keeps hosing the deck.

                                 BRANDY
                        Dude, what is your prob?

                        Why weren’t you at your parents’

                        Oh, I’m well aware of that.

           Cameron starts to walk away.

                        a BJ.

           Brandy opens the back door, waves The Girls in.

           EXT. BRANDY’S HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Mrs. Clark and Judge Clark stand at the front door. 
           Cameron is on the doorstep.

                                 JUDGE CLARK
                        Hey, there. Cameron. 
                                 (looks outside)
                        Is that...vehicle...yours?

           Judge Clark points to a shitty, used van in the driveway.

                                 CAMERON
                                 (proud)
                        Yep. Bought it today. Needs a new 
                        paint job but it runs pretty good.

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        Well, I think the airbrushed deer 
                        mural is wonderful.

                                 JUDGE CLARK
                        Those are elk, hon.

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        Even better. Very masculine.

                                 CAMERON
                        Thanks. So, is Brandy here?

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        She’s not. She and The Girls went 
                        to the Mormon dance.

                                 CAMERON
                        The Mormon dance? Yeah, that 
                        sounds like Brandy.
                                 (beat)
                        We were suppose to go to the drive-
                        inn. 

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        Oh dear. She must have forgotten. 
                        She’s just been a social butterfly 
                        this summer. It’s good for her. 
                        She’s so serious during the school 
                        year. Maybe you can go tomorrow?

                        Nope. Tonight’s the last night. 
                        Then they’re closing. Forever.

           Cameron turns and walks out to his van, depressed.

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        George, he looks so sad...

           INT. CACTUS BAR - LATER

           The Screaming Trees, a grunge band, play on a small 
           stage. The Girls dance up front. Brandy FLIRTS hard with 
           the LEAD SINGER. He flirts back.

                                 FIONA
                        Oh my God. He loves you.

                                 BRANDY
                        I know.

           LEAD SINGER’S POV ON CROWD: THE GIRLS ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE 
           UNDER FIFTY. 

           A GIANT BANNER HANGS ON THE WALL BEHIND THE GIRLS: 
           “WELCOME BACK BOISE HIGH CLASS OF 1965.”

           EXT. PARKING LOT - POOL - NIGHT   

           The Screaming Trees tour van pulls into the parking lot. 
           The Girls stumble out, giggling. Brandy leads the way. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Follow me!

           Brandy scales the chain link fence like a pro. The 
           Screaming Trees follow, giving The Girls a boost.

           EXT. POOL - MOMENTS LATER

           Brandy strips down to her bra and underwear. She climbs 
           the high-dive. Her panties read “Friday”.

           EXT. DRIVE-INN MOVIE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

           Cameron, depressed, sits in the driver’s seat watching a 
           couple make-out in the car next to them. SMACKING SOUNDS.

           REVEAL Judge Clark chewing candy from the passenger seat.

                                 JUDGE CLARK

           Cameron SIGHS.

           Cameron takes a handful. He turns back to Jaws, playing 
           on the screen. 

                                 ROY SCHEIDER

           EXT. POOL - LATER

           Fiona and the BASS PLAYER make out in a life guard stand. 
           Wendy and the DRUMMER flirt in the shallow end. 

                                 DRUMMER
                        So, you got a boyfriend?

                                 WENDY
                        No. But I have a total crush on 
                        this guy, Duffy. His arms are 
                        huge...

           Drummer SIGHS as Wendy continues.

           ANGLE ON DIVING BOARD

           The Lead Singer, with bright purple hair, sits in a lawn 
           chair, watching Brandy do a back-flip into the pool.

           Brandy surfaces, flips her hair like a Sports Illustrated 
           model and climbs out, trying really hard to look sexy.

                                 BRANDY
                        Dare you to get in.

                                 LEAD SINGER
                        Can’t. Died my hair this morning. 
                        Have to wait forty-eight hours. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Oh. That’s too bad. 

           Brandy unhooks her bra and drops it to the ground.

           INT. WOMEN’S DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Brandy and the Lead Singer make out under the hot shower. 
           Purple hair die runs down their bodies.

                                 LEAD SINGER
                        You’re so amorous. You’re energy, 
                        it’s so...inspiring.

                        bucked off into another town. I

                        Northwest would be so...onerous.

                        and start kissing.

           EXT. POOL - CONTINUOUS

           The Bass Player and Drummer have Fiona and Wendy on their 
           shoulders. They chicken fight in the pool. The Girls 
           SCREAM in delight.

           INT. POOL OFFICE - NIGHT

           Willy, asleep on a cot, he sits up. 

                                 WILLY
                        What the--

           EXT. POOL - CONTINUOUS

           The pool lights turn on. Wendy and Fiona SCREAM and run 
           for their clothes. Willy sees the half-naked, underage 
           girls and immediately turns his back.

           Brandy runs out of the women’s dressing room. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Be quiet you guys--

           Willy stares at Brandy’s half-naked, purple body.

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                                 (covering self)

                        Explain with your clothes on. 

           The Lead Singer, also covered in purple hair die, comes 
           out of the women’s dressing room.

                                 WILLY (CONT’D)

                        Judge? We’re home. 

           Judge Clark SNORES. Cameron gently shakes him. Judge 
           Clark sits up. He gathers himself, opens the door. 

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        Is it cool if I leave Brandy a

           Groggy, Judge Clark nods.

           Cameron enters Brandy’s room. He picks up the sea-horse 
           pencil and looks around for paper. He opens the desk 
           drawer. His eyes go wide as he sees THE LIST.

           INT. POOL OFFICE - NIGHT   

           The Girls, now dressed, stand in front of Willy.

                        Willy, I’m so sorry. It was so

                        I could give a rat’s ass about 
                        sneaking into the pool! Those guys 
                        are at least ten years older than 
                        you! Do you have any idea what

                        Oh fuck.

           INT. AMBER’S BASEMENT ROOM – NIGHT

           Brandy walks back in, heading for the window.

                                 AMBER
                        WTF! I need to concentrate, spaz!

           INT. CAMERON’S ROOM - NIGHT   

           Cameron lays in bed, crying and making a mix tape labeled 
           “Sad Songs”. The Indigo Girls play on his boombox. 

           WHACK. Cameron looks out the window. Brandy’s down below.

           EXT. CAMERON’S YARD - NIGHT

           Cameron, in plaid pajamas, stands in the grass glaring at 
           Brandy. They argue in whispers.

                                 CAMERON
                        You cheated on me!

                                 BRANDY
                        Cheated? It’s not like we’re 
                        together, Cameron. 

                                 CAMERON
                        Not anymore we aren’t.

                                 BRANDY
                        Wait, did you think, we were like 
                        together-together? 

                                 CAMERON
                        Uh, yeah.

                                 BRANDY
                        Why would you think that?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 CAMERON
                        Oh, I don’t know, maybe because I 
                        “fingered” you, we “dry humped,” 
                        you “jerked me off”. 

                                 BRANDY
                        I’m too young to be tied down to 
                        one guy, Cameron. 

                                 CAMERON
                        Yeah, I can see that from the 
                        other name you wrote on your 
                        stupid list...in PUFFY PAINT!

                                 BRANDY
                        You’re overreacting--

                                 CAMERON
                        Over-reacting?
                                 (choking up)
                        You...you gave me a hand job, 
                        Brandy. A hand job! It might not 
                        mean anything to you...but it sure 
                        meant something to me. 

           Cameron SOBS.

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        I’m so stupid. I thought I was 
                        special. I’ve never felt this way--

                                 BRANDY
                        Cameron, don’t cry. I’m really 
                        sorry.

                                 CAMERON
                                 (totally crying)
                        I’m not crying! 
                                 (points at Brandy’s 
                                 neck)
                        Oh my God! Is that a hickey? 

           Brandy covers her neck, BUSTED. Cameron storms off. As he 
           reaches the porch he turns a nozzle. 

           The sprinklers turn on, SOAKING Brandy.

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        I hope you get AIDS!

           Brandy shivers as the sprinkler hits her in the face.

           INT. AMBER’S BASEMENT ROOM – NIGHT

           Brandy crawls in the window. Amber, fully dressed, sleeps 
           on her bed. Her unfinished math homework is next to her.

           Brandy SIGHS. She takes the homework and sits down at the 
           desk to finish it.
           INT. BIG BUN DRIVE INN - DAY  

           Fiona works the window. 

                                 FIONA
                                 (intercom)
                        Welcome to Big Bun. May I take 
                        your order?

                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                                 (intercom)
                        He wants me to die of AIDS!

           Fiona looks out at Brandy, sobbing on her bicycle. 
           Wendy’s next to her, trying to console her.

           EXT. BIG BUN DRIVE INN - MOMENTS LATER

           Fiona feeds Brandy a sundae at the picnic table.

                                 FIONA
                        Come on, take a bite. You’ll feel 
                        better.

           Brandy takes a bite. It helps.

                                 BRANDY
                        I don’t get it. Guys screw around 
                        all the time and girls just have 
                        to put up with it.

                                 WENDY
                        Cameron’s acting like a little 
                        bitch. If he really liked you he 
                        would have asked you to go out -- 
                        he wouldn’t have just hooked up.

                                 BRANDY
                        Exactly! Why are boys such idiots?

           Fiona and Wendy shake their heads. 

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                        It’s such a double-standard! Look 
                        at Willy. Gets his girlfriend 
                        pregnant and dumps her. I 
                        shouldn’t be punished for doing 
                        what guys do everyday!

                                 FIONA
                        Totally! My Aunt always says a 
                        lady has to look out for herself. 
                        Did you know the average woman is 
                        sexually active for three years 
                        before a guy can make them orgasm?

                        wait for the guys to figure their

                        need.

           EXT. DOLLAR MOVIE THEATRE - DAY  

           The marquee reads “ALL MOVIES $1. NOW PLAYING - BEACHES.” 
           The Girls stand at the ticket booth.

                                 FIONA
                        Three tickets for Beaches please.

                        My Aunt said I have to take my 
                        best friends to this movie. And I 
                        think today is the perfect day.

                        you’ll ever get!

           EXT. POOL – DAY

           Cameron sits on the stand. Duffy and Swan look up at him 
           in disbelief. Pool Rats eavesdrop as usual.

                                 SWAN
                        She made a list?

                        think she just wanted to jerk me 
                        off, blow me, heck, probably even 
                        screw me without ever committing.

                                 DUFFY
                        That’s...terrible. 

           INT. BRANDY’S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON   

           Brandy lays on her bed, listening to the Beaches 
           soundtrack. She reads Susan Faludi’s Backlash.

                                 MRS. CLARK (O.C.)
                        Brandy, telephone.

           Brandy picks up the phone.

                                 BRANDY
                                 (into phone)
                        Hello?

           INT. DUFFY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Duffy hangs upside down on a pull-up bar, doing crunches 
           as he talks on the phone. Intercut call as necessary.

                                 DUFFY
                                 (into phone)
                        Hey, Brandy. It’s Duffy. 

                                 BRANDY
                                 (into phone)
                        What’s up, Tank Top.

                                 DUFFY
                        Um, do you wanna go to Shakespeare 
                        in the Park? 
                                 (grunts)
                        You like that kind of shit, right?

                                 BRANDY
                        Um, yeah...but you don’t.

                                 DUFFY
                        Sure I do. They speak with British 
                        accents and crap. 
                                 (grunts)
                        You wanna go or not? My treat.

           Brandy pulls The List from her desk. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Yes.
           EXT. PARK – EVENING

           A small, outdoor amphitheater. On stage, a local 
           production of Twelfth Night. ROMANTIC COUPLES lay on 
           blankets, picnicking. Brandy and Duffy sit on a Green Bay 
           Packers sleeping bag.

           Brandy wears Amber’s Wonder Bra. She checks herself out.

                                 BRANDY
                                 (to self)
                        Why didn’t I steal this sooner?

           Duffy opens a Big Bun fast-food bag.

                                 DUFFY
                        You’re suppose to bring Brie and 
                        wine and shit but I thought I’d do 
                        us one better. Cheeseburger?

           EXT. PARK - LATER

           Brandy watches the play, intent. Duffy yawns, bored.

                                 VIOLA
                                 (on stage)
                        Oh Time, thou must untangle this, 
                        not I / It is too hard a knot for 
                        me t' untie!

           The lights come up. The audience CLAPS. Brandy stands, 
           stretching her legs. Duffy packs up the blanket.

                                 DUFFY
                        Wow. Great play. Should we have a 
                        night cap at my place? My parent’s 
                        are asleep.

                                 BRANDY
                        It’s intermission.

                                 DUFFY
                        Right. I knew that. 

           Brandy looks at the snuggling couples around them.

                                 BRANDY
                        Forget it. I’m bored too.

           INT. BACKSEAT - DUFFY’S CAR – CONTINUOUS

           Brandy’s on top of Duffy, shirt off, Wonder Bra on. She 
           leans over his crotch, trying to titty-fuck him.

                                 DUFFY
                        Um, actually, it might work better 
                        if I’m on top.

                                 DUFFY
                        I think so. Or, at least that’s 
                        what they do on Cinemax.

           They flip positions. Duffy, on top, works his hips. 

           CLOSE ON BRANDY AS SHE’S JIGGLED UP AND DOWN.

                                 DUFFY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, that’s dope.

                                 DUFFY
                        Really good. Really, REALLY--

                                 BRANDY
                        Wait...my sister’s...don’t want to 
                        get it messy...

           Brandy unhooks her bra, slipping it off.

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                        OK. Here we go.

           Duffy starts moving again. He frowns.

                                 DUFFY
                        Um, could you maybe squeeze them 
                        together? Can’t really feel...

           INT. DUFFY’S CAR – MOMENTS LATER

           Duffy drives. Brandy sulks in the passenger seat.

                                 DUFFY
                        You just haven’t filled out yet. 
                        When you’re nineteen you’re gonna 
                        be hot. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Nineteen? Just drive.

           INT. BLOCKBUSTER - EVENING

           Swan, wearing a Blockbuster apron, stacks videos. Duffy 
           stands next to him. 

                                 SWAN
                        So you titty-fucked? What’s next 
                        on the list? 
           INT. SWAN’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Brandy’s under the sheet, shoulder’s bare. There’s a 
           moving lump between her legs. It’s Swan.

                                 BRANDY
                        Sure you know what you’re doing?

                                 SWAN
                                 (muffled under 
                                 sheets)
                        I think so. I’ve been reading 
                        Penthouse. Just looking for your 
                        clit--

                                 BRANDY
                                 (moans)
                        You found it...Oh, you lost it...
                                 (moans)
                        ...found it--

                                 GRANDPA (O.S.)
                        Jason, the remote’s not working.

           Brandy looks up. Swan’s GRANDPA (80s) stands in the 
           doorway, staring back at her. She SQUEEZES her legs 
           together, immobilizing Swan under the sheets.

                                 SWAN
                                 (from under sheet)
                        Is the TV on channel 3?

                                 GRANDPA
                                 (staring at Brandy)
                        Yes.

                                 SWAN
                        Did you hit input?

                                 GRANDPA
                        Yes.

                                 SWAN
                        Make sure it’s set to cable. 

                                 GRANDPA
                        Forgot that one. Thanks.

           Grandpa turns to leave.

                                 SWAN
                        No problem, Grandpa. 

           Brandy yanks Swan up, smacking him repeatedly.

                                 SWAN (CONT’D)
                        What? Don’t worry. He’s mostly 
                        blind and half-deaf. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BRANDY
                        Then why did he give me the thumbs 
                        up sign when he left?

                                 SWAN
                        Oh shit. Was he wearing his 
                        glasses?

           Brandy pushes Swan away and grabs her clothes.

           EXT. POOL OFFICE - EVENING

           The pool is closed. Willy installs a new phone in the 
           wall. Brandy sits in a chair, staring at the clock.

                                 BRANDY
                        Once again my ride is late. 

                                 WILLY
                        Well, we both know I have nowhere 
                        to be.

                                 BRANDY
                        Sorry about the other night. I was 
                        kind of a jerk.

                                 WILLY
                        Forget it. I did the same shit 
                        when I was your age.

           EXT. POOL - LATER

           Brandy and Willy sit in the lifeguard stands on opposite 
           sides of the pool, sipping beers. 

                                 BRANDY
                        So what are you going to do?

                                 WILLY
                        What? Can’t hear you.

           Brandy picks up the megaphone on the stand. 

                                 BRANDY
                                 (into megaphone)
                        What are you going to do about 
                        your pregnant girlfriend?

                                 WILLY
                                 (to self)
                        Wow. Newbie doesn’t beat around 
                        the bush.
                                 (into megaphone)
                        I’m fucked. 

           They continue their discussion through the megaphones.

                                 BRANDY
                        Babies are expensive.
                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WILLY
                        I’m aware of that.

                                 BRANDY
                        Are you gonna get a real job?

           Willy lets this sink in.

                                 WILLY
                        I don’t know how.

           INT. POOL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Brandy flips through a Boise State University course 
           catalog.  She adds another class to a list.

                                 WILLY
                        Wow. When you write it all down 
                        like that I feel like I’ve 
                        accomplished something. 

                                 BRANDY
                                 (to self)
                        Yes. Lists are good for that.
                                 (to Willy)
                        Well, you’ve gone to college part-
                        time for seven years...with all of 
                        your credits in English, history, 
                        philosophy and...Forestry? 
                                 (gives him a look)
                        I think you can get a liberal arts 
                        degree and finish your teaching 
                        certificate in a year.

                                 WILLY
                        Teaching certificate?

                                 BRANDY
                        You need a real job, Willy. 
                        Besides, you know what they say.  
                        Those that can’t...teach.

                                 WILLY
                        Smart ass.

           Willy picks up the phone.

                                 BRANDY
                        Registration starts next week.

                                 WILLY
                        I’m calling Nicole.

           Brandy watches him. He gives her a look. 

                                 BRANDY
                                 (getting hint)
                        I’ll wait outside.
           EXT. POOL OFFICE – DAY

           Brandy sits on the steps. The HILLCREST GUARDS pull up. 

           INT. POOL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Willy’s on the phone. Brandy rushes in.

                                 BRANDY
                        They’re back--

                                 WILLY
                                 (into phone)
                        Nicole, please. Can we at least 
                        talk? I want to be there for you. 
                        For both of you...Nicole? Nicole?

           Willy puts down the phone. Defeated. 

           SLAM! Something rocks the office door. 

           EXT. POOL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           A pile of manure covers the pool steps.

                                 BRANDY
                        Oh wow. That reeks!

                                 WILLY
                        Shit. More GOD DAMN SHIT.
                                 (beat)
                        Call the guards.

           EXT. HILLCREST POOL – NIGHT

           Cameron’s van idles in the parking lot, lights off. 
           Inside the van, Willy passes bottles of laundry detergent 
           to Rusty and Kimball. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Hey, aren’t you forgetting 
                        someone?

                                 WILLY
                        Cameron’s our getaway. He’s gotta 
                        wait with the van.

                                 BRANDY
                        I meant me. 

           Cameron rolls his eyes.

                                 WILLY
                                 (reluctant)
                        Fine.
           EXT. CHAINLINK FENCE - HILLCREST POOL - MOMENTS LATER

           Brandy scales the fence like a pro. 

                                 RUSTY
                        You look like you’ve done this 
                        before.

                                 BRANDY
                        I have.

           Rusty follows. Willy and Kimball are not so skilled. 

                                 KIMBALL
                        My toe’s stuck...

                                 WILLY
                        I cut my hand...

           Kimball lets go, falling onto Willy.

                                 KIMBALL
                                 (giggling)
                        Dude, I’m blazed.

           They sit in a heap, worthless.

                                 BRANDY
                        You guys suck. Throw us your ammo. 
                        We’ll take it from here.

                                 WILLY
                        Sure thing, Rambo.

           They chuck the detergent over the fence. Fully loaded, 
           Brandy and Rusty head for the Hydro-Tube, a large, spiral 
           water slide overlooking a landing pool. 

           EXT. HYDRO-TUBE - MOMENTS LATER

           Brandy and Rusty climb the metal stairs. A security light 
           turns on. They freeze.

                                 RUSTY
                        Oh shit!

                                 BRANDY
                        Chill. They’re motion detectors. 
                        They’ll go off in a second.

           They wait. The lights go off. 

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                                 (mocking)
                        See, nothing to be afraid of.

                                 RUSTY
                        Watch it, Cutie. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           They reach the top of the slide. Brandy and Rusty unscrew 
           the detergent bottles. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Cheers.

           They tap bottles and pour the blue liquid down the slide.

                                 RUSTY
                        Let’s jet before we get busted.

                                 BRANDY
                        Wait. We can’t leave without 
                        seeing the fruits of our labor.

           EXT. HILLCREST POOL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Brandy and Rusty sneak along the wall. Voices can be 
           heard from inside the office. They peak in the window. 

           LIFEGUARDS sit in the office, drinking and hanging.

                                 LIFEGUARD #1
                        I wish I could see the look on 
                        their faces when they open the 
                        door tomorrow. 

                                 LIFEGUARD #2
                        I’ve never seen so much cow shit 
                        in my life. They’ll track it into 
                        the pool for days.

           Brandy motions for Rusty to follow her to the pump room.

           INT. CAMERON’S VAN – NIGHT

           Cameron, Willy and Kimball wait in the van.

                                 WILLY
                        What is taking so long? They 
                        should’ve been back by now. 

                                 CAMERON
                        Brandy’s probably trying to get in 
                        Rusty’s pants. 

                                 WILLY
                        Easy. Brandy’s not that kind of 
                        girl.

                                 CAMERON
                        Oh yeah? Then why did she make a 
                        check-list of all the dirty deeds 
                        she wants to do with guys this 
                        summer?

                                 WILLY
                        That’s insane. Brandy wouldn’t do 
                        that. How would you know anyways?

           CONTINUED:

                                 CAMERON
                        Let’s just say my name is on her 
                        list...several times.

                                 KIMBALL
                        Any girls on the list?

           Willy smacks Kimball in the head. 

           EXT. HILLCREST PUMP ROOM - NIGHT   

           Brandy turns the handle. It’s locked.

                                 BRANDY
                        Shit.

                                 RUSTY
                        Step aside, Cutie.

           Rusty pulls a credit card from his wallet and slides it 
           between the door. The door opens. 

                                 BRANDY
                        You look like you’ve done this 
                        before.

                                 RUSTY
                        I have.

           INT. HILLCREST PUMP ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Rusty and Brandy grope around in the dark. They find what 
           they’re looking for. 

                                 BRANDY
                                 (pulls lever)
                        One...two...three!

           The sound of RUSHING WATER. The Hydro-Tube comes to life. 

           EXT. HILLCREST POOL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Brandy and Rusty rush by the office, running for the 
           fence. The door opens. They duck behind the pool cover.

                                 LIFEGUARD #1
                        What the fuck?

           The lifeguards run for the Hydro-Tube. Giant suds rush 
           into the pool.

                                 LIFEGUARD #2
                        Mother fucker! This is war!

                                 LIFEGUARD #
                        Hey! There’s their car! Come on, 
                        let’s get ‘em!
                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Brandy and Rusty huddle close behind the pool cover.

                                 BRANDY
                                 (whispers)
                        We have to warn them!

                                 RUSTY
                                 (whispers)
                        Don’t move. They’ll see us.

           Rusty wraps his arms around Brandy. She checks out his 
           ripped biceps. Admires his Beta-Theta-Pi tatoo.

           EXT. CAMERON’S VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Cameron watches as the office doors swing open and 
           Hillcrest Guards run out. 

                                 CAMERON
                        Oh shit! We’re busted! 

           Cameron starts his engine and hits the gas.

                                 WILLY
                        What about Rusty and Brandy?

                                 CAMERON
                        Screw ‘em.

           EXT. HILLCREST POOL FENCE - CONTINUOUS

           Brandy and Rusty watch Cameron drive away.

                                 RUSTY
                        What the fuck! They just left us?

                                 BRANDY
                        No. Cameron left me.

                                 RUSTY
                        What?

                                 BRANDY
                        Nothing. 
                                 (beat)
                        Well, we’ve got the place to 
                        ourselves. Might as well hit the 
                        slide before our long walk home.

           Brandy runs up the stairs of the slide. Rusty follows.

           INT. HYDRO-TUBE - CONTINUOUS

           Fully-clothed, Brandy sits at the top of the slide.

                                 BRANDY
                        You coming?
                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 RUSTY
                        Hells yeah.

           Rusty wraps his legs around Brandy. They rush down the 
           slide, like two happy kids at a water park. 

           EXT. HYDRO-TUBE - CONTINUOUS

           The slide shoots Brandy and Rusty out into the sudsy 
           pool. They laugh and splash in the giant bubble bath.

           Brandy grabs some bubbles and works Rusty’s hair into a 
           Mohawk. Rusty gives her a bubble beard. 

                                 BRANDY
                        You look hot for a punk-rocker.

                                 RUSTY
                        You make a good bearded lady.

           Rusty slowly wipes the bubbles from her chin. 

                                 RUSTY (CONT’D)
                        You are something else, Cutie. 

           Rusty leans in to kiss her. For the first time, Brandy 
           plays hard to get. She leans back, coy.

                                 BRANDY
                        Seriously, Rusty. You have to stop 
                        calling me that. I have a name.

           Rusty looks at her. Shakes his head and LAUGHS.

                                 RUSTY
                        Is it loser? 

           Rusty dunks her head under water and takes off.

                                 RUSTY (CONT’D)
                        Race you to the top!

           EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - LATER   

           Brandy and Rusty, soaking wet, walk down the road.

                                 RUSTY
                        I’m gonna kick Cameron’s ass for 
                        leaving us.

                                 BRANDY
                        What? Can’t handle a three mile 
                        walk?

           Rusty TICKLES Brandy, flirting. 

                                 RUSTY
                        Come on, let’s Yahoo some beer.

           CONTINUED:

                                 BRANDY
                        What’s that?

           INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT   

           Rusty and Brandy head for the beer cooler. The CLERK 
           watches them, suspicious in their wet clothes.

                                 RUSTY
                                 (whispers)
                        I don’t have my fake ID so this is 
                        the next best thing. Grab a case 
                        and follow my lead.

           Rusty grabs a case of Keystone Ice. Brandy does the same. 
           They set it on the counter. 

                                 CLERK
                        I’m gonna need to see some ID--

           Rusty slaps forty bucks on the counter.

                                 RUSTY
                        Yahoo!

           Rusty grabs the beer and runs. Brandy hesitates.

                                 RUSTY (CONT’D)
                        Cutie, let’s jet!

           Rusty grabs Brandy’s arm and YANKS her out the door.

                                 BRANDY
                        Yahoo?

           EXT. BORAH POOL - NIGHT   

           Willy paces the pool office. Kimball rolls a joint. 
           Cameron sips a grape soda.

                                 WILLY
                        Maybe we should go back. I feel 
                        bad for bailing. 

                                 CAMERON
                        I don’t. Brandy only cares about 
                        herself anyway.

           Suddenly, Brandy and Rusty rush inside the office.

                                 BRANDY
                        Mission accomplished!

           Everyone CHEERS but Cameron.
           EXT. ROOF - POOL OFFICE - LATER

           The guards sit on the roof in lawn chairs, drinking 
           beers. Brandy fills water balloons with a hose.  

                                 WILLY
                        Dudes, it’s almost sun up. If they 
                        haven’t retaliated by now they’re 
                        not gonna do it tonight.

                                 BRANDY
                        You can never be too prepared. 
                        Man, you should have seen it. The 
                        pool is filled with bubbles!

                                 RUSTY
                        We rode the slide like five times.

                                 CAMERON
                                 (sarcastic)
                        I bet you did.

                                 BRANDY
                        What’s that suppose to mean?

           Cameron shrugs. A car pulls into the parking lot. 

                                 WILLY
                        Everyone quiet! They’re here!

           A DARK FIGURE heads for the office. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Fire!

           The guards pound the figure with water balloons. 

                                 WILLY
                        Take that you bastards!

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                                 (screams)
                        What the fuck! Willy?

                                 WILLY
                                 (realizing)
                        Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

           Willy beams his flashlight...on Nicole. Soaking wet.

                                 WILLY (CONT’D)
                        Nicole?

                                 NICOLE
                                 (pissed)
                        Willy.

                                 WILLY
                        I can explain.

           CONTINUED:

                                 NICOLE
                        Forget it. I can’t believe I came 
                        down here to talk to you. Fuck! I 
                        am so stupid! To think you could 
                        ever change. When are you going to 
                        grow up, Willy?

                                 WILLY
                        Nicole, wait! Wait!

           Willy shimmies down the roof. He loses his grip and falls 
           into the darkness. THUMP.

                                 KIMBALL
                        That did not sound good.

           Brandy shines the flashlight on Willy. He lays in the 
           pile of shit.

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT   

           Cameron and Brandy sit in the waiting room. 

                                 CAMERON
                        You should go. I’ll drive him 
                        home.

                                 BRANDY
                        I’ll stay. If it weren’t for me he 
                        wouldn’t be in this mess.

           Cameron and Brandy sit in silence. Brandy can’t take it.

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                        Cameron, about the whole list 
                        thing, I really am sorry. I didn’t 
                        mean to hurt you. 

           Cameron stares straight ahead.

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                        This whole hooking-up thing just 
                        confused me. I mean, we’ve been 
                        friends forever. I didn’t know-- 
                                 (takes a breath)
                        I like you Cameron. Like, like-
                        like you. 

                                 CAMERON
                        If you like-like me so damn much 
                        then why did you hook up with my 
                        two best friends? I mean, come on!

           INT. BRANDY’S HOUSE – DAY

           Mrs. Clark packs her tennis racquet. Judge Clark carries 
           suitcases out the door. Brandy sits at the table.

                        You’re sure you don’t mind? We 
                        don’t have to go.

                                 BRANDY
                        No, Mom. Your tennis team made it 
                        to Regionals. How often do you get 
                        to go to scenic Reno?

                                 JUDGE CLARK
                        Not often enough. Why couldn’t you 
                        win the year it’s in Vegas? 

                                 MRS. CLARK

                        to watch a movie or something. You 
                        can have a slumber party.

                        Give it up! You’re too stupid to

                        Really? Read it and weep.

           Amber shoves a summer school transcript in Brandy’s face.

           Brandy pulls the Hell Bitch into the gas station. Fiona 
           and Wendy are with her, looking scared.

                        Amber shut me down, you couldn’t 
                        kidnap your niece, and we’ve been 
                        denied at four other stores. We 
                        don’t have a choice.

           Wendy reluctantly grabs a third case. The Girls walk to 
           the counter.

           The Hell Bitch skids across a flower bed. Dirt and mums

           Brandy SLAMS on the brakes. Fiona FLASHES her boobs at

                                 AMBER
                        Cameron, let’s make a phone call. 

           INT. PHONE BOOTH - CACTUS BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Amber and Cameron squeeze inside the phone booth.

                                 AMBER
                                 (into phone)
                        Hello, Boise Police? Yes, I’d like 
                        to complain about a party--

           INT. BRANDY’S HOUSE - NIGHT   

           MIKEY (17), a total douche, hits on Brandy. 

                                 MIKEY
                        I have a present for you...in my 
                        pants.

                                 BRANDY
                        You’re disgusting.

           Brandy pushes past him.

                                 MIKEY
                        Does that mean I won’t make The 
                        List?

           Suddenly, COPS walk in the front door. 

                                 MIKEY (CONT’D)
                        Cops!

           TEENAGERS freak out and run out of the house.

                                 BRANDY
                        Laundry chute!

           INT. LAUNDRY CHUTE - CONTINUOUS

           Brandy hides in the laundry chute. Alone. KNOCK. KNOCK.

           Brandy opens the door. Two COPS stare back at her. 
           INT. BRANDY’S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Brandy, a blubbering mess, stands in front of the cops. 

                                 BRANDY
                        But it’s my birthday. And my dad’s 
                        a Judge. You can’t give me a 
                        drinking ticket. He’s Judge Clark. 

                                 OFFICER #1
                        Yes. Your father is Judge Clark. 
                        You’ve mentioned that. 

           INT. BRANDY’S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The house is a wreck. Brandy picks up beer cans. She 
           enters the living room. A COUPLE makes out on the couch.

                                 BRANDY
                        Party’s over, dudes. Party’s over.

           INT. FRONT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Brandy ushers the couple through the front door. She 
           closes it behind them, leans on the door and SIGHS.

           DING DONG.

           Annoyed, Brandy opens the door.

                                 BRANDY
                        What?

           Rusty stands in front of her.

                                 RUSTY
                        ‘Sup, Cutie.

           INT. KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING   

           Brandy sits at the table. Rusty stands over the stove. 

                                 RUSTY
                        Nothing like Mac ‘n cheese at two 
                        in the morning to solve your 
                        problems.

           He sets a bowl down in front of her.

                                 BRANDY
                        Overall, this has been a pretty 
                        shitty birthday.

                                 RUSTY
                        That reminds me.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Rusty sets a sparkler in the Mac ‘n cheese and lights it.

                                 BRANDY
                        Maybe it just got a teensy bit 
                        better.

           Rusty leans in...and kisses her.

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                        A tad bit better...

                                 RUSTY
                        Just a tad?

           INT. BRANDY’S ROOM - SUNRISE

           Brandy and Rusty make out in her bed. She catches a 
           glimpse of herself in the mirror above her dresser and 
           smiles. She can’t believe it. It’s gonna happen.

           Rusty catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror and 
           flexes. Checking himself out.

           Rusty gently pulls Brandy’s shirt over her head. She 
           pulls his T-shirt off his hot body.

                                 BRANDY
                        Holy shit you are ripped.

                                 RUSTY
                        You’re not so bad yourself.

           Rusty touches Brandy underneath her panties.

                                 BRANDY
                                 (moans)
                        Oh, finally. A man who knows what 
                        he’s doing.

           Brandy undoes his pants. Completely confident. Excited. 
           Enjoying herself. Totally turned on. 

                                 RUSTY
                                 (whispers)
                        Lemme get a condom.

           Brandy reaches into the sex-ed box.

                                 BRANDY
                        I’m one step ahead of you.

           Brandy, a little nervous, takes a deep breath while he 
           puts on the condom. 

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                                 (to self)
                        You can do it. You can do it.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 RUSTY
                        What’s that?

                                 BRANDY
                        Let’s do it.

           Arms around her waist, Rusty lowers her down on the bed. 

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                        Wait. Rusty...I...

                                 RUSTY
                        It’s okay. I know you’re a virgin. 
                        We don’t have to do anything you 
                        don’t want to.

                                 BRANDY
                        No. Not that. I mean, yes, I’m a 
                        virgin. But...I want to be on top. 
                        It’ll increase my chance of 
                        orgasm. I read that in Glamour.

           Rusty stifles a laugh.

                                 RUSTY
                        Sure thing, Cutie -- Brandy.

           They shift positions. With Brandy on top, she guides him 
           inside her. 

                                 RUSTY (CONT’D)
                        Is that okay?

                                 BRANDY
                        I think so.

           They start to move. Gentle at first, then picking up the 
           pace. Suddenly, Rusty shivers.

                                 RUSTY
                                 (moans)
                        Ohhhh.

           He collapses back. Brandy looks at the clock. 

                                 BRANDY
                        It hasn’t even been two minutes.

                                 RUSTY
                        Sorry, Cutie...

           Rusty drifts off to sleep. Brandy rolls off of him.

                                 BRANDY
                        My name is Brandy.
           EXT. BRANDY’S HOUSE – MORNING

           Amber pulls the Hell Bitch into the driveway. She sees 
           Rusty’s motorcycle. 

                                 AMBER
                        What the--

           INT. BRANDY’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Amber BUSTS into the room. Brandy sits up.

                                 BRANDY
                        Amber! Wait! I can explain!

           Amber RUSHES over to the bed. Brandy DUCKS behind a 
           pillow, protecting herself. Amber ATTACKS Rusty. 

                                 RUSTY
                        Take it easy!

           Brandy lowers the pillow. Surprised she’s not the one on 
           the receiving end of the blows. 

                                 AMBER
                        You stupid prick! Taking advantage 
                        of my little sister! 

                                 BRANDY
                        Amber, get off of him! He didn’t 
                        do anything!

                                 AMBER
                        Brandy, he’s using you. He knows 
                        about The List.

                                 BRANDY
                        What?

                                 AMBER
                        The List. He knows. 

                                 BRANDY
                                 (to Rusty)
                        Is that true?

           Rusty shrugs, sheepish. 

                                 RUSTY
                        Cameron might have mentioned it--

           Brandy lets this sink in. Suddenly, she lets loose, 
           KICKING and SLAPPING him. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Stupid prick! Get the fuck out!

           Amber picks up his clothes and throws them out the door.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 RUSTY
                        Chill! You’re acting like a bunch 
                        of little girls!

                            BRANDY
                                                         AMBER
           We are not little girls!
                                              We are not little girls!

           Rusty exits. Amber walks over to the bed.

                                 AMBER
                        Sorry, Brandy. If I had known he 
                        would do that I would have said 
                        something earlier.

                                 BRANDY
                        Earlier?

                                 AMBER
                        Cameron told me last night. That’s 
                        why we called the cops on you.

                                 BRANDY
                        You called the cops?

                                 AMBER
                                 (meek)
                        Happy birthday?

                                 BRANDY
                        Get out.

                                 AMBER
                        Hey. I really am sorry.

                                 BRANDY
                        Just get out, Amber. 

           EXT. POOL - DAY

           Brandy sits on the stand. A Pool Rat taps her foot. 

                                 POOL RAT #1
                        Brian wants to know if you wanna 
                        do-it behind the pump house. He 
                        wants to be on your list.

           Brandy turns to the pump house. Pool Rat #2 winks at her.

                                 POOL RAT #1 (CONT’D)
                        He’s circumscribed. And he’s been 
                        drinking pineapple juice for three 
                        days straight.

                                 BRANDY
                        Beat it.

           Brandy turns back. From the other stand, Rusty gives her 
           a weak wave. She ignores him. This time, he notices.
           EXT. POOL PARKING LOT - EVENING

           Brandy sits on the steps, waiting for her ride. Cameron 
           unlocks his bike and rides off. He doesn’t even look at 
           her. Brandy SIGHS.

           INT. STATION WAGON - EVENING

           Amber drives. Brandy slumps down in the passenger seat.

                                 BRANDY
                        Mom and Dad home?

           Amber nods. They pull into the driveway. A cop car is 
           parked next to her parent’s car.

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck me.

                                 AMBER
                        Rusty already did.

           Brandy smacks Amber in the shoulder.

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        Too soon?

           INT. COURT ROOM – DAY

           JUDGE WITHERS looks down at Brandy with menacing eyes.

                                 JUDGE WITHERS
                        The court hereby orders you to pay 
                        the maximum fine of one thousand 
                        dollars--

                                 BRANDY
                        A grand? That’s what I made the 
                        whole summer--

                                 JUDGE WITHERS
                        ...and your drivers license is 
                        revoked for one year.

                                 BRANDY
                        But I was just about to inherit 
                        the Hell Bitch...

                                 JUDGE WITHERS 
                        Excuse me? Should we get a second 
                        opinion? I’m sure if we asked your 
                        father, Judge Clark, he would 
                        suggest community service...

           JUVENILE DELINQUENTS snicker from the gallery.

           INT. JUDGE CLARK’S CHAMBERS - LATER

           Brandy sits in a chair in front of Judge Clark. Mrs. 
           Clark sits in the corner, arms crossed. 

                                 JUDGE CLARK
                        Do you have any idea how 
                        embarrassing this is for me?

           EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE – NEXT WEEK

           Fiona pulls into the gas station. Wendy rides shot-gun.

                                 WENDY
                        Oh great. Look who it is.

           Fiona turns. Brandy plants mums in the flower bed. 

           EXT. GAS PUMP - MOMENTS LATER

           Fiona puts gas in the truck. Wendy climbs out.

                                 WENDY
                        Uh oh. Here she comes.

           Brandy approaches. Fiona and Wendy turn their backs.

                                 BRANDY
                        Fiona?

                                 FIONA
                        Can’t talk. Trying to keep my fat 
                        mouth shut. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Wendy--

                                 WENDY
                        Let me buy my corn nuts in peace. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Since when do you eat corn nuts?

                                 FIONA
                        She’s been binge eating since you 
                        stole Duffy from her.  

           A car pulls into the gas station. Bette Midler’s “Wind 
           Beneath My Wings” blares from the stereo.

                                 BETTE MIDLER
                                 (on radio)
                        It must have been cold there in my

           CONTINUED:

           The DRIVER, an effeminate man, exits the car, SINGING 
           loudly, leaving the engine running, the stereo on.

                                 BRANDY
                        Wendy, the corn nuts can wait. 
                        Fiona, release the lever.

           The Girls do as they’re told.

                                 (very serious)
                        Wendy, I was so caught up with The 
                        List that I forgot you liked 
                        Duffy. I promise I’ll never stand 
                        in between his tank-tops and your 
                        ridiculously toned quads again.
                                 (beat)
                        Fiona, you don’t have a fat mouth. 
                        In fact, you have a very pretty 
                        mouth even if all the guys we know 
                        never look at it because they’re 
                        staring at your chest. But even 
                        then they’re missing the best 
                        part. Your personality.

                                 BETTE MIDLER
                                 (from radio)
                        Did you ever know that you’re my 
                        hero? And everything I would like 
                        to be. I can fly higher than an 
                        eagle... 

                                 BRANDY
                                 (singing and crying)
                        You are the wind beneath my wings.

           Fiona and Wendy, also crying, look at each other.

                                 FIONA
                        You are the gayest fag I know, 
                        Pancake.

                                 WENDY
                        I should really kick your ass for 
                        making me cry. 

           EXT. FLOWER BED - CONVENIENCE STORE - MOMENTS LATER

           Fiona and Wendy help Brandy plant flowers. The mums spell 
           the words “CHEAP GAS. COLD BEER.”

           EXT. POOL – DAY

           Last day of summer. Nicole, with a little pregnant belly, 
           lays out next to the pool. Willy dotes on her.  
           INT. POOL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Willy enters the office, grabbing some fruit from the 
           fridge. Brandy’s packs up kick boards and swim fins.

                                 RUSTY
                        Fruit? What happened to the beer?

                                 WILLY
                        I’m on the wagon. 
                                 (beat)
                        At least while I still have 
                        painkillers. 

           Willy taps his cast with his crutch.

                                 WILLY (CONT’D)
                        Just joshing. But my mom-to-be 
                        needs her fruit salad.
                                 (looking at Nicole)
                        Isn’t she beautiful?

                                 RUSTY
                        Yeah. Her boobs got huge.

                                 WILLY
                        I know. I did that.

           Kimball walks in. Willy pulls a green bong from the desk.

                                 WILLY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, buddy. Jalapeño Popper is all 
                        yours.
                                 (hands Rusty a bag of 
                                 weed)
                        And I want you to have my Mauwie 
                        Wauwie.

                                 KIMBALL
                        It’s like the Gift of the Magi.

           Willy and Rusty share a look.

                                 RUSTY
                        No. No it’s not.

                                 KIMBALL
                        Wait, why are you giving away all 
                        your stuff? You’re not gonna jump 
                        off a bridge are you? 

                                 WILLY
                        Nope. Just retiring from the pool.

                                 KIMBALL
                        But your thirty-five!

                                 WILLY
                        Exactly. Going back to school.  
                        Gonna be a teacher.

           Rusty and Kimball exit.

                        Never thought I would say this, 
                        Newbie, but...I owe you one.

                                 BRANDY
                        For breaking your ankle?

                                 WILLY
                        Well, not exactly. When Nicole 
                        heard she came over to yell at me. 
                        But when she saw the course book 
                        and I told her your plan...well, 
                        she agreed to let me “date” her 
                        again.

                        You’re good with lists, Newbie. 
                        Why don’t you make a Boise Pool 
                        manual? That way whoever takes 
                        over next summer won’t fuck it up. 

                                 BRANDY
                        I’m on it. Have you seen Cameron?

                        Didn’t he tell you? 
                                 (off Brandy’s look)
                        Sorry. Camster is at football 
                        practice. He made the team.

           INT. BRANDY’S ROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Brandy hands Amber the condom in the Ziploc baggie.

                                 BRANDY
                        You can have this back.

                                 AMBER
                        You kept this all summer? That’s 
                        kind of gross, Brandy.

           Brandy nods. Amber drops the condom in the trash.

                        You know Rusty dumped me when I 
                        wouldn’t sleep with him.

                                 BRANDY
                        What? But the condom--

                        As soon as he put it on that night 
                        I told him to stop. I wasn’t gonna 
                        lose my virginity wasted.

                        Technically, yes. But he came in

                        it’s not gonna count until I 
                        orgasm during sex. The whole thing 
                        is so one-sided. Why can men come

                        I mean, he was your ex and all.

                                 AMBER
                        Yeah, but, I was kind of a shitty 
                        older sister. I should’ve been 
                        looking out for you. Should’ve 
                        warned you.

                                 BRANDY
                        I wouldn’t have listened even if 
                        you did. Some things you have to 
                        learn for yourself.

           Brandy pulls the Pee Wee Herman string.

                                 PEE WEE HERMAN DOLL
                                 (recording)
                        I know you are but what am I.

                                 AMBER
                        You gonna throw that away, too?

                                 BRANDY
                        Why?

                                 AMBER
                        He got caught jerking off in a 
                        porn theater. 

                                 BRANDY
                        Exactly. It’s a collector’s item.

                                 AMBER
                        You are one weird chick, Brandy. 
           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Brandy enters the kitchen, holding the sex-ed box. Mrs. 
           Clark packs a cooler. Judge Clark carries a heavy 
           suitcase from the basement, Amber follows.

                                 JUDGE CLARK
                        Good Christ, Amber, did you pack 
                        enough stuff?

                                 AMBER
                        Nope.
                                 (to Brandy)
                        Can’t wait to get to college. Just 
                        a six-hour drive and I’m FREE!

                                 BRANDY
                        Rub it in. I still have six weeks 
                        left of being grounded.

                         JUDGE CLARK
                                                       MRS. CLARK
           Darn right, young lady.
                                              You certainly do, missy.

           Judge Clark and Amber exit through the front door. 

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        Brandy, you father and I discussed 
                        it and you’ll be staying with the 
                        Mitchell’s while we’re taking 
                        Amber to school.

                                 BRANDY
                        The Mitchell’s? Are you sure?

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        Very.

                                 BRANDY
                        Got it. Hey mom...

           Brandy hands Mrs. Clark the sex-ed box.

                                 BRANDY (CONT’D)
                        ...I don’t need this. I’m not 
                        ready for it yet. 

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        Oh thank God.

                                 BRANDY
                        Give it to Amber. She’ll probably 
                        need it for college.

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        Oh Lord.

           EXT. BRANDY’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Amber and Brandy hug goodbye on the porch.
                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 AMBER
                        Take care, fuck chop.

                                 BRANDY
                        See ya, fart knocker.

           INT. JUDGE CLARK’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Judge Clark HONKS the horn, impatient. Mrs. Clark nudges 
           him from the passenger seat. 

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        Let them be, George. We’ve never 
                        seen them get along before.

           EXT. BRANDY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Brandy stands on the front porch and waves goodbye.

           Judge Clark pulls out of the driveway. Mrs. Clark turns 
           to Amber in the backseat and hands her the sex-ed box.

                                 MRS. CLARK
                        We have quite a drive ahead of us. 
                        Thought this would be a good time 
                        to discuss safe intercourse.

           Judge Clark turns up NPR on the stereo. Amber turns back 
           to the window and flips Brandy off.

           INT. CAMERON’S DEN – NIGHT

           Brandy and Cameron sit on the couch. The Mitchell’s sit 
           between them. The Sound of Music plays on the TV. The 
           credits roll and the Mitchell’s stand.

                                 MRS. MITCHELL
                        We’re off to bed. Don’t stay up 
                        too late, you two.

           Left alone, Brandy and Cameron stare straight ahead. The 
           tape in the VCR rewinds. A long moment. 

           They both turn to each other. They have crazy chemistry.

                                 BRANDY
                        I’m gonna hit the sack.

                                 CAMERON
                        Me too.

           Brandy and Cameron stand, heading for separate bedrooms.

                                                                FADE OUT.
