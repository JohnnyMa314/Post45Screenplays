           HEAVY BREATHING. An ELECTRIC WHIR fills the air...

                                 A RUSSIAN MAN (V.O.)
                             (thick Russian accent)
                        I came to this country seeking a 
                        name. Money. Power. All that comes 
                        with it...

           ZZZAAAPPP!!! An agony-filled FEMALE SCREAM!

           INT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY (2001)

                                 JIMMY
                        NOOOOOO!

           CU - JIMMY MARINO (33). Usually a clean-cut, All American 
           guy, but here he’s badly beaten, bound tightly to a chair.

                                 A RUSSIAN MAN (O.S.)
                        A man like me will give everything, 
                        do anything in pursuit of that 
                        name. To protect his name.

           Jimmy’s eyes are locked on his wife, CATHY MARINO (30). Dark 
           hair. Bright blue eyes. Under normal circumstances, a 
           stunner, but not today. She’s crying. Her face is stained 
           with blood. This woman is being tortured.

           Towering over her is a bear of a Russian. Thick black beard, 
           long flowing hair and a twenty-two inch neck. Meet IVAN 
           ROMANOVSKI (37), “THE WOLF.”

           In Ivan’s hands, a CATTLE PROD, which he eagerly jabs into 
           Cathy’s stomach. ZAP!!! She vomits, then loses consciousness. 

                                 JIMMY
                        It’s me you want.

           --WHAP! Another attacker steps from the shadows and SMACKS 
           JIMMY IN THE KIDNEY with a DIRT-FILLED SOCK! The pain is so 
           intense that he almost swallows his tongue.

           And finally, we meet his tormenter -- also Russian, smaller 
           in stature than the Wolf, but no less terrifying. This is 
           VITALE ROMANOVSKI (40), “THE GHOST.” He’s been the one 
           talking all along.

                                 VITALE
                        These things mean nothing to you. 
                        For you, life is about...family. 
                        And family is a haven in this 
                        heartless world, Detective. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 VITALE (CONT'D)
                        Family is pure. Family is forever. 
                        Family is the reason a man seeks a 
                        name in the first place...

           Blood pours from Jimmy’s pant-leg onto the floor. Our hero is 
           pissing blood. Still, he summons whatever energy he has left 
           to remain conscious.

                                 JIMMY
                        This is between you and me. Just 
                        let her go. 

           Ivan subtly cranks up the power on his cattle-prod. It HUMS 
           cruelly. Vitale leans in close and whispers into his ear.

                                 VITALE
                        This is how the game works, James. 
                        You’ve soiled my name. You’ve taken 
                        from me. And when you take from 
                        me... I take from YOU!

           Vitale snatches the cattle prod from Ivan’s hands, then 
           without warning -- he digs the prod into Cathy’s chest!

                                 JIMMY
                        NOOOOOOOOOO!

           ZAAAAAAP! Suddenly--

           GUNFIRE from outside! BANG! BANG! FRANTIC SHOUTING! RAT-A-TAT-
           TAT! RETURN FIRE! Ivan and Vitale turn to see--

           A well-armed LAPD STRIKE TEAM burst through the door! CARL 
           MORRIS (mid 30s) leads HOWARD BANKS (30s, black) and CHESTER 
           GRIMES (30s, a pretty boy surfer-type) inside.

           Ivan reaches for a weapon. BOOM! Carl fires!

           Ivan takes one in the chest! He crumbles to the ground, 
           ROARING in agony!

           Vitale FIRES back at the Strike Team! BOOM! BOOM! As the 
           officers DIVE for cover, he grabs hold of Ivan and starts 
           dragging him toward the back door.

                                 IVAN (IN RUSSIAN)
                        Brother...save yourself.

                                 VITALE
                        NO!

           Ivan locks eyes with Vitale, imploring.
                                 IVAN (IN RUSSIAN)
                        Please... Go.

           Vitale is crushed, but he has no other choice. He shares one 
           final look with his brother, then sprints off.

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Banks and Grimes shoot at him at him and 
           miss. Vitale disappears out the back door.

           Banks and Grimes take off after the Russian. Carl hurries 
           over to Jimmy and unties him.

           Jimmy crawls over to his wife. He turns Cathy over. She’s 
           unconscious, not breathing. He’s panicking. 

                                 JIMMY 
                        CATHY?! WAKE UP, BABY!

           Jimmy administers CPR on Cathy, but it appears to be futile. 
           He’s crying, shaking. It’s a terrible sight. Carl is having a 
           hard time watching.

                                 CARL
                        She’s gone, Jim...

           But Jimmy’s still fighting to bring her back...

                                 JIMMY 
                        COME ON, BABY! COME ON!!!

           AGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD: THE GHOST AND THE WOLF

           EXT. PORT OF LOS ANGELES - NIGHT (EIGHT YEARS LATER)

           An LAPD HELICOPTER hovers over a Chinese OCEAN LINER. Its 
           CREW is gathered at the rails, staring apprehensively down at 
           the FORCE of LAPD OFFICERS waiting at the GATE.

           AT THE GATE

           Two young Detectives run the show. DELIO RAMIREZ, (32, 
           Latino) and SAMANTHA HARRIS (30, don’t let her looks fool 
           you, she’s a pit bull).

           An imposing RAZOR-WIRE FENCE and a livid ATF Agent, JASPAR 
           GONDOLI stands between them and the Ocean Liner.

                                 HARRIS
                        Get the hell out of our way, G-man! 

                                 GONDOLI
                        Honey, as much as I’d like to spank 
                        you myself, your Captain’ll be here 
                        any minute. I’ll leave that to him.
           Harris lunges at Gondoli. As Ramirez struggles to restrain 
           her, we move through the crowd of Officers and settle on--

           A crusty-looking MAN (40s). The sort of guy with a five 
           o’clock shadow at 2pm. He’s vagrant in a trash-bin dirty.

           We should recognize him from the opening flashback, even 
           though the past eight years have been unkind to JIMMY MARINO.

           Jimmy clearly doesn’t like the way the wind’s blowing here. 
           His mind is racing. He then notices--

           A BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CAR pulls up. And out steps another 
           player from the opening flashback: CAPTAIN CARL MORRIS (40s 
           now), pajama-clad, looking tired and hungover.

           Jimmy ducks behind a couple of Officers, careful that Carl 
           doesn’t see him. Carl gets between Gondoli and Harris.

                                 CARL
                        Why in the hell is ATF yanking me 
                        outta bed at 2AM?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Sir, we have a tip from a CI, says 
                        that ship is carrying a crate full 
                        of Russian illegals. Known 
                        criminals.

                                 HARRIS
                        Mr. Ninety-nine dollar suit over 
                        here wants credit for the bust.

                                 GONDOLI
                        We’ve been sitting on this shipping 
                        line for a year now, Carl. Drugs. 
                        Human trafficking. Distribution 
                        networks. Whole case is gonna go up 
                        in smoke because your God damn 
                        children didn’t do their homework.

                                 CARL
                        You assholes didn’t check the 
                        Federal database?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        CI said we only had an hour to act.

           Carl shakes his head, turns to his guys.

                                 CARL 
                        God damn it. Everybody pack it up, 
                        get on outta here.
           WITH JIMMY

           He watches as the LAPD OFFICERS pack in and roll out. Looks 
           like the jig is up. Jimmy’s starting to look desperate here. 
           His window of opportunity is closing.

           He eyes dart frantically around the shipyard. Maybe looking 
           for a way in? He finally spots A SEMI TRUCK.

           BACK WITH CARL

           He’s still laying into Harris and Ramirez.

                                 CARL
                        Who’s the CI?

                                 HARRIS
                        Guy’s been feeding us tips for a 
                        month now. They’ve all been solid.

                                 CARL
                        What’s his name?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Local PI. Jimmy Marino. 

                                 CARL
                             (bites his lip)
                        And who’d he say is on that ship?

                                 HARRIS
                        Some guy named Vitale Romanovski.

           Carl is instantly livid. He scans the scene.

                                 CARL
                        Where the fuck is he?

           INT. SEMI TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Jimmy’s fiddling under the dash, attempting to hot-wire the 
           truck. Suddenly: VROOM! The engine ROARS to life.

           Jimmy pulls a Russian-made AK-47 from a duffle bag and yanks 
           the bolt back. Locked and loaded. 

           He looks up at the massive RAZOR-WIRE FENCE standing between 
           him and the ship, then throws the truck into gear and stomps 
           on the gas.

           BACK WITH CARL

           Detective ROGERS (bald, overweight) approaches.
                                 ROGERS
                        Sir?

           Carl ignores him, now looming over Ramirez and Harris.

                                 CARL
                        When I’m done with your asses 
                        traffic duty is gonna seem like--

                                 ROGERS
                        --SIR?!

                                 CARL
                        WHAT, GOD DAMN IT?!

           Carl whips around to face Rogers and sees--

           A SEMI TRUCK BARRELLING towards them. Jimmy’s behind the 
           wheel, laying into the horn. HOOOONK! HOOOONK!

           Carl and his Officers are forced to DIVE out of the way.

           The Semi CRASHES through the razor-wire fence. Steel twisting 
           and turning. Sparks shooting into the air.

           He drives the truck straight up the RAMP, destined for the 
           deck of the Ocean Liner. A couple of CHINESE CREWMEN are 
           forced to leap into the water.

           The truck finally CRASHES into a stack of SHIPPING CRATES. 
           The AIR BAG deploys.

           Jimmy leaps out of the cab, head bleeding, surprisingly 
           unfazed. He tears across the deck, AK-47 in-tow.

           Gondoli’s head looks like it’s going to explode. Carl shakes 
           his head.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Get after his ass...

           EXT. OCEAN LINER - DECK - DAY

           As Jimmy heads for another stack of SHIPPING CRATES, more 
           Chinese Crewmen run for cover.

           Jimmy moves from crate to crate, checking their serial 
           numbers against one he has written on a piece of paper.

           EXT. OCEAN LINER - RAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Dozens of LAPD Officers flood the ship and spread out, 
           looking for Jimmy. Carl is last to step aboard. He looks 
           almost like a concerned parent...concerned and pissed.
           EXT. OCEAN LINER - DECK - DAY

           Jimmy finally finds the crate he’s looking for. He rips the 
           door open and finds--

           BINGO! A half-dozen or so terrified RUSSIAN MEN AND WOMEN 
           hiding among the CARGO. Jimmy raises his weapon.

                                 JIMMY
                        Out! Now!

           The Russians shuffle out, their hands in the air. Jimmy 
           inspects each of their faces, looking for someone in 
           particular. Jimmy grabs hold of a WOMAN.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Where is he?! WHERE IS ROMANOVSKI?!

           The woman looks confused, terrified. Just then, the LAPD 
           Officers catch up to Jimmy. They approach him cautiously, 
           guns raised.

                                 ROGERS
                        Hands behind your head! Down on the 
                        ground!

           Jimmy doesn’t have a play here. All he can to is comply.

           Carl finally rounds the corner to see Jimmy being handcuffed. 
           The old friends lock eyes. Carl is stern, judgemental. Jimmy 
           is defiant, unapologetic. As Rogers drags him away--

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Sir?

           Carl turns to see Ramirez and Harris hovering over a barrel, 
           sifting through the cargo in the crate. Harris cuts a PACKAGE 
           open and tastes the WHITE POWDER inside.

                                 HARRIS
                        Heroin...

           Ramirez pulls brick after brick of tar heroine from the 
           barrel. Gondoli steps up next to Carl, livid.

                                 GONDOLI
                        Congrats, Morris. You just traded a 
                        hundred plus arrests, tens of 
                        millions in assets, the dismantling 
                        of an entire syndicate...all for a 
                        crate full of illegals and a couple 
                        barrels of heroin. State’s 
                        Attorney’s gonna have your ass...
           EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAWN (A FEW DAYS LATER)

           As the sun rises over the Pacific, the ROAR of the world’s 
           most powerful V-12 engine slowly fades into prominence. After 
           a beat, we see it--

           A 2006 FERRARI ENZO blazes by at 150mph.

           INT. FERRARI ENZO - CONTINUOUS

           Behind the wheel of this million-dollar automobile is GARO 
           NAZARIAN (37), Armenian party-boy. European HOUSE BEATS 
           explode from his high-end speakers.

           As Garo wipes the WHITE POWDER from his nose, a suspicious 
           smile pours over his face.

           Garo, you see, is getting road head. And he’s loving every 
           second of it. As he grabs a handful of silky dark hair, we 
           finally see...it’s not a woman down there--

           Garo is getting blown by A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD ASIAN BOY.

           The SLURPING quickens. Garo MOANS in ORGASMIC ECSTASY. Just 
           as he’s about to explode--

           EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           CRASH! The Enzo smashes into a tree. The engine FLIES out 
           onto the street!

           No one stirs inside. No man, no beast could have survived 
           that. Somehow, though, the stereo lives on and--

           EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - MORNING

           The sun has crept a bit higher in the sky. The place swarms 
           with COPS. POLICE CARS, FIRE TRUCKS, the works. 

           Those HOUSE BEATS still pour from the wreckage. Detective 
           Ramirez tinkers inside.

           Harris looks over at the destroyed Enzo and shouts (loudly to 
           compensate for the music)--

                                 HARRIS
                        My ears are bleeding here...

           Ramirez finally manages to cut the music. He takes a bow 
           while everyone APPLAUDS. Harris rolls her eyes.

           Just then, Carl’s Lincoln Town car pulls up. He walks with 
           purpose toward the busted Enzo. Harris and Ramirez follow at 
           his heels, eager to please.
                                 RAMIREZ
                        Garo Nazarian. Product of Yerevan. 
                        Did a stretch in Lancaster for 
                        selling weapons to the Armenian 
                        mob.

                                 HARRIS
                        Fuckface is screamin’ down the PCH, 
                        doin’ 150, 160 and he wraps his 
                        whip around the tree there. 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Shame, too. Only four hundred of 
                        those Enzos ever made.

                                 HARRIS
                        Uni’s roll up and find a gang of 
                        party favors in the trunk.

           Harris hands Carl an EVIDENCE BAG. Inside is an UZI. 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        We should head up to the house, 
                        Captain. I hear they got a cache--

                                 CARL
                        --Nah. Stay put. You assholes ain’t 
                        outta the doghouse yet.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        But sir, we’re done here.

                                 CARL
                        Well...Sweep the road or some shit.

           EXT. GARO NAZARIAN’S HOUSE - DAY

           A garish blue MANSION sits atop a hill on Franklin Ave., 
           overlooking the dilapidated apartment buildings that make up 
           Little Armenia. A stark dichotomy. Rich vs. poor. 

           INT. GARO NAZARIAN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Every nook and cranny of the mansion is being searched by 
           OFFICERS. Boxes are piled up in virtually every room, the 
           furniture is covered in plastic.

           Carl enters with Rogers. He’s very impressed with the spread.

                                 CARL
                        Looks like business was good.
                                 ROGERS
                        Arms dealing is recession-proof. 
                        Guns are piled up in the garage. 
                        There’s a fleet of new Beamers 
                        sittin’ out back. And Lt. Banks is 
                        going through a bunch of boxes in 
                        the bedroom--

                                 CARL
                             (tenses up)
                        --Banks is here?

           INT. GARO NAZARIAN’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

           Carl enters to see another man from the opening flashback--

           LIEUTENANT HOWARD BANKS (40s now, laid back and affable). He 
           sits on the bed, meticulously sifting through documents. 

                                 CARL (O.S.)
                        Didn’t know the Cop of the Year 
                        still got his hands dirty. 

           The tension between these two is immediately evident.

                                 BANKS
                        Helps morale to see us old-timers 
                        rolling up our sleeves. Where’re 
                        the kids?

                                 CARL
                        Sweepin’ glass off the PCH.

                                 BANKS
                        You’re too hard on those two.

                                 CARL
                        Well, State’s Attorney’s being too 
                        hard on me.

                                 BANKS
                        And shit rolls downhill...

                                 CARL
                        You find anything?

                                 BANKS 
                        Nazarian was still moving in. 
                        Nothing worth a damn inside. Garage 
                        is your gold mine.

           Rogers enters holding a SMALL WOODEN BOX.
                                 ROGERS
                        Uni found this in the wall safe.

           He hands the box over to Banks. Inside are thin STRIPS OF RED 
           PAPER, almost like you’d find in a Chinese fortune cookie, 
           only the writing on them is typed in YELLOW CYRILLIC LETTERS.

                                 CARL
                        What do you make of ’em?

                                 BANKS
                        Guy eats a lot of Chinese? 
                             (to Rogers)
                        Have division send over a 
                        translator.

                                 ROGERS
                        And Captain...ATF just rolled up.

           Banks smiles. Carl sighs indignantly.

                                 CARL
                        Motherfuckers...

           INT. GARO’S GARAGE - DAY 

           Carl enters to find a frightening stockpile of weapons. 
           CRATES full of AK-47s. Soviet RPGs. RPKs. Uzis...

           ATF Agent Jaspar Gondoli is back in action, looking over his 
           SUBORDINATES as they inventory the weapons. He sees Carl 
           approaching and knows he’s in for a fight. 

                                 GONDOLI
                        Looks like the Armenians are 
                        gearing up for a little party.

                                 CARL
                        This is my bust, Gondoli. 

                                 GONDOLI
                        Your guys fucked us big time, Carl. 
                        Figured I’d give you a chance to 
                        make things right. Maybe give us 
                        the lead on this thing.

                                 CARL
                        Maybe I’d have thought about it, if 
                        you hadn’t thrown my ass under the 
                        bus. Now pack up and get the fuck 
                        outta here.

           Gondoli reluctantly turns to his men.
                                 GONDOLI
                        Alright guys. You heard him.

           The ATF Agents start to pack up. Gondoli turns back to Carl.

                                 GONDOLI (CONT’D)
                        Guess you need this a helluva lot 
                        more than I do... Don’t forget to 
                        smile for the cameras.

           After a laugh at Carl’s expense, the ATF Guys follow Gondoli 
           out. Carl shakes off the slight and steps out of the garage 
           to find...a MEDIA CIRCUS.

           EXT. MARINA - DAY

           A busy Marina. FISHERMEN unload the morning’s catch. YUPPIES 
           load picnic baskets onto their yachts. Amid all this is a 
           dilapidated BOAT. The paint is peeling. The motor rusting. It 
           looks far from sea-worthy.

           Banks approaches. He steps aboard, careful to avoid the jaws 
           of the MASSIVE BEAR TRAP laid out on the deck.

           INT. BOAT - CONTINUOUS

           Pigsty would be a compliment. Empty STOLI BOTTLES and STEEL 
           RESERVE CANS litter the floor. An entire Russian library is 
           strewn about. Books, magazines, even porn.

           As Banks enters, his face tells us this place smells even 
           worse than it looks. Suddenly, his eyes flood with fear-- 

           A table is flipped over. There are BLOODY HAND PRINTS all 
           over the far wall. A trail of blood leads into the bathroom.

                                 BANKS
                        Jim?!

           Nothing. Banks draws his weapon and tip-toes into the--

           BATHROOM

           Banks cautiously enters, fearing the worst, only to find--

           JIMMY, soaking in the tub, reading a skin mag, sucking on a 
           fifth of Stoli. His nose is bleeding. His muscular body is 
           badly bruised. Looks like he took a beating last night.

                                 JIMMY
                        Gimme five minutes, huh? I was 
                        about to rub one out.
           INT. HOUSE BOAT - LATER

           Jimmy, now dressed, cracks a small egg into a highball glass. 
           He then drowns it with some ice cold vodka and a shot of 
           sake. Banks reels back in disgust.

                                 BANKS
                        Russians got you drinkin’ some 
                        repugnant-ass shit.

           Banks finally gets a good look at Jimmy here. Cuts. Bruises.

                                 BANKS (CONT’D)
                        What happened to you last night?

                                 JIMMY
                        Your mom crossed her legs.

                                 BANKS
                        And what’s with the booby trap on 
                        the deck there?

                                 JIMMY
                        You like that? Brought it back from 
                        Vyborg. Georgians use it to catch 
                        bears. They yank out their teeth, 
                        make them fight dogs. Bet major 
                        coin on it.
                             (points to the TV)
                        Big day for you guys.

           ON SCREEN: A news report. Carl is in front of the cameras. 
           Talking up the weapons bust. He’s comfortable, charismatic.

                                 BANKS
                        What’s the word on the street?

           Jimmy shrugs. Info isn’t free. Banks grudgingly forks over a 
           couple of twenties.

                                 JIMMY
                        You carted off three and half 
                        million dollars of Armenian heroin 
                        the other night. Armos paid the 
                        Russians to bring it in.

                                 BANKS
                        They’re fighting over who pays the 
                        bill?

                                 JIMMY
                        Exactly. Russians see this shit on 
                        TV. Nazarian’s little gun show and-- 
                                 BANKS
                        --They figure the Armos are gearing 
                        up for war.

                                 JIMMY
                        Only the Armos are saying Nazarian 
                        cut ties with them months ago, that 
                        he’s supplying someone else now.

                                 BANKS
                        They expect the Ruskis to believe 
                        that? I got a bridge to sell ’em, 
                        then. Some money the crown Prince 
                        of Nigeria needs moved.

                                 JIMMY
                        Nobody knows what to believe. So 
                        everybody’s looking over their 
                        shoulder.

           Banks nods, makes sense. A quiet beat passes. 

                                 BANKS
                        You seen Grimes lately?

                                 JIMMY
                        No, but I ran into Deb last night. 

                                 BANKS
                        Girlfriend?

                                 JIMMY
                        Sort of. Streetwalker he hooked up 
                        with. They got a house, a dog...

                                 BANKS
                        Guy thinks he’s Ward Cleaver now? 

                                 JIMMY
                        I guess. She ain’t seen him in a 
                        week. She’s worried. 

                                 BANKS
                        That makes two of us. You bump into 
                        him, have him get with me.

           Just then, the alarm on Jimmy’s digital watch SOUNDS. He 
           drops down and starts doing pushups. Banks raises an eyebrow.

                                 BANKS (CONT’D)
                        The fuck are you doing now?
                                 JIMMY
                        I try to do eight hundred a day. 
                        Fifty, every hour on the hour.

                                 BANKS
                        You training for the Olympics or 
                        something?

           Banks looks a little closer and gets his answer--

           Jimmy’s desk has been converted into a COMMAND CENTER. A 
           physical record of years spent hunting for Vitale Romanovski.

           Photographs and articles from Russian newspapers are 
           meticulously noted. A map of the world has dozens of PUSH 
           PINS marking countries where Jimmy’s tracked Vitale. 

           Banks takes all this in. Jimmy is simply obsessed...

                        God damn it, Jim. Vitale is dead. 
                        You need to knock this shit off.

           Jimmy ignores him, but Banks isn’t stopping.

                                 BANKS (CONT’D)
                        Ruining your own career is one 
                        thing, but you torpedoed a major 
                        Federal case and stuck Ramirez and 
                        Harris with the bill. They’re good 
                        cops, man. And you played them.

                                 JIMMY
                        I couldn’t get on that ship without 
                        them. Even if I did, the Chinks 
                        would have strung me up on deck.

                                 BANKS
                        Yeah? Was it worth setting their 
                        careers back a couple of years?

                                 JIMMY
                        That girl’s daddy is the Deputy 
                        Chief of Police. They’ll land on 
                        their feet. Anyway, fuck those 
                        guys. And fuck you too.

                                 BANKS 
                        That’s right, Jimmy. Fuck everyone. 
                        All that matters is this lunatic 
                        suicide mission of yours. You’re 
                        pushin’ away the last two guys who 
                        still give a shit. Me and Carl are--
                                 JIMMY
                        --Carl never did shit for me.

                                 BANKS
                        Who you think kept you outta jail 
                        the other night? It sure as shit 
                        wasn’t me. Fuck, I told him to let 
                        your ass rot. 

           Just then, a small, awkward man, BILL (20s, blonde hair, blue 
           eyes), steps onto the boat. Jimmy and Banks don’t see him.

                                 BANKS (CONT’D)
                        So pull your head outta your ass 
                        and think about somebody else for a 
                        change, you selfish piece of--

           Bill clears his throat. Jimmy and Banks finally notice him.

                                 BANKS (CONT’D)
                        Shit, man. You ain’t worth it.

           Banks storms out and a livid Jimmy turns toward Bill.

                                 BILL
                        You Jimmy Marino?

                                 JIMMY
                        Who’s askin’?

                                 BILL 
                        I’m looking to hire a PI. I need to 
                        find someone...
                             (gets a whiff of him)
                        Are you drunk?

                                 JIMMY
                        Not yet.

           Jimmy grabs what’s left of his Stoli and downs it.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        You got cash?

                                 BILL
                        At my apartment.

                                 JIMMY
                        Then off we go. You’re driving.
           INT. BILL’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           The room is sparse. Some furniture, but no television. No 
           computer. Jimmy sits on the couch, inspecting a PHOTO of a 
           beautiful Russian woman (we’ll come to know her as ILEANA).

           Bill’s counting some money.

                                 BILL
                        So, I’ve got about two thousand 
                        here. It’s all I have left. But--

                                 JIMMY
                        --Let me guess, she disappears and 
                        the big ticket items go with her. 

           Bill reluctantly nods. Jimmy sighs, it’s so obvious to him. 

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        I see it all the time. Half of 
                        these mail order brides are mobbed-
                        up. They come in and take you for 
                        all they can. Before a missing 
                        persons report’s filed, they’re on 
                        a plane to Moscow, or back with 
                        whoever whored them out. I could 
                        really use a paycheck, but I don’t 
                        want to waste your time. Keep your 
                        money. Try again.

                                 BILL 
                        No way. Not Ileana. She loved me.

           There’s purity in Bill’s words, he’s emotional, teary. He 
           eyes the WEDDING RING, still on Jimmy’s finger.

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        I sit in front of a computer screen 
                        eighty hours a week. The only thing 
                        that gets me through the day is 
                        knowing I get to come home to her. 
                        You’re married, Jimmy. You must 
                        understand.

           They lock eyes. Jimmy’s genuinely affected. He looks back 
           down to the picture. Dark hair. Blue eyes. She really 
           resembles Cathy. It almost makes him shiver.

                                 JIMMY
                        This is a recent picture?

                                 BILL
                        Very. Dark hair. Blue eyes. And her 
                        laugh. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        You’ll know it when you hear it. 
                        Jimmy, I’ve asked around. You know 
                        the world. They say you’re the only 
                        one who can help me...

           INT. UPSCALE HOTEL SUITE - EVENING

           Suitcases are strewn about, half-unpacked. Take-out food 
           containers spill out of the garbage can. By the looks of 
           things, somebody has been living here for quite a while.

           We find Carl, standing in front of a full-length mirror, 
           putting the finishing touches on his immaculate black tuxedo. 
           He smiles proudly. Damn he looks good.

           He finally turns and eyes the HOT NAKED WOMAN (29) sleeping 
           in the bed. He nudges her awake.

                                 CARL
                        Hey... Dana...

           The Naked Woman stirs, annoyed.

                                 NAKED WOMAN
                        My name’s Jennifer...

                                 CARL
                        Yeah. Uh. Listen... I gotta split.

                                 NAKED WOMAN
                        Cool. I’ll grab a shower, show 
                        myself out.

                                 CARL
                        Nah, I need you out now.

           She stares back at him. Are you serious? He clearly is. She 
           rips up in a huff and starts throwing her clothes on.

           A KNOCK at the door. Carl hurries over.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        What part of Por favor de no 
                        molestar don’t you understand?

           Carl rips the door open, expecting to find the Cleaning Lady. 
           Instead he finds...a VENICE MEATHEAD (30).

                                 VENICE MEATHEAD
                        You Carl Morris?

           Carl sinks. He knows what this is about. He nods. The Venice 
           Meathead hands him a LARGE YELLOW ENVELOPE.
                                 VENICE MEATHEAD (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been served, bro.

           The Meathead saunters off. Just then, the now-clothed Woman 
           (Jennifer) pushes past Carl and stomps out of the room.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Fucking dickhead!

           Salt in the wound. Carl closes the door and slumps down on 
           the bed. He eyes the Yellow Envelope with a heavy heart.

           EXT. ALL AMERICAN TEXTILES - NIGHT

           A dirty old warehouse. The sign is written in both English 
           and Cyrillic. A giant American flag waves majestically above 
           the door. Jimmy heads inside.

           INT. ALL AMERICAN TEXTILES - CONTINUOUS

           A DOZEN GEORGIAN WOMEN sit at sewing machines, working their 
           fingers to the bone. A stern RUSSIAN MAN supervises, walking 
           the aisles, peeking over their shoulders.

           Jimmy approaches the GIANT RUSSIAN guarding a rusty iron door 
           on the back wall. The behemoth grips an AK-47 and sports a 
           Kevlar flack jacket with a red “C.C.C.P.” logo on the front. 

           He pats Jimmy down, checking for weapons.

           INT. YURI’S BACKROOM CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           A house-music mix of Cher’s Believe pulls Jimmy through a 
           dark, narrow hallway and into the spirited drunken melee that 
           is YURI’S BACK ROOM CLUB.

           In one section, STRIPPERS work the poles and suck up dollar 
           bills. In another, a sea of grizzled old RUSSIAN MEN rot at 
           card tables, chewing on cigars and downing cheap vodka.

           As Jimmy approaches the bar, heads turn. Most all of the 
           patrons are eye-fucking him. Jimmy tries to play it cool.

           The Russian bartender, ALEXEI (30) approaches, SHOTGUN 
           hanging from a strap around his neck.

                                 JIMMY
                        Lotta new firepower...

           Now, Alexei's eye-fucking him. Jimmy just can’t win.

                                 ALEXEI
                        Armos are stockpiling weapons. When 
                        they come, we’ll be ready.
                                 JIMMY
                        Where’s Yuri?

           Alexei points to the rather raucous crowd spilling out of a 
           BACK ROOM. Jimmy smiles knowingly.

           BACK ROOM

           Jimmy enters. A crazy-eyed Russian, YURI (40s), is working 
           the crowd. He’s short, but absolutely ripped. It looks like 
           he was carved out of stone. He’s covered in tattoos. Stars on 
           his knees. Spades on his chest. A giant cobweb on his back. 

                                 YURI
                        Who’s next?!

           The biggest and baddest RUSSIAN in the room steps forward and 
           ponies up a hundred dollar bill.

           He and Yuri hold their arms up and press them together, so 
           they are joined from wrist to elbow. After a beat, another 
           RUSSIAN approaches. He takes the HUGE LIT CIGAR from his 
           mouth and drops it into the crevice between their two arms.

           The two men sit there, the cigarette burning the flesh from 
           their arms. Yuri smiles. He’s enjoying the pain. The same 
           cannot be said for his competitor. Eventually, the pain is 
           overwhelming and he rips his arm away.

           Yuri’s won this game of chicken. He throws his arms up in 
           victory and pockets the man’s money. The crowd goes berserk.

                                 YURI (CONT’D)
                        When will you boys learn?! Ice 
                        water runs through these veins!!!

           Yuri finally notices Jimmy. The crowd goes completely silent. 

                                 YURI (CONT’D)
                        You got balls of steel, rolling in 
                        here after that shit you pulled.

           Jimmy rolls his eyes.

                                 YURI (CONT’D)
                        Don’t roll your eyes at me. That 
                        was three and a half million in 
                        product. Armos greenlit you. You’re 
                        lucky one’a these ghouls doesn’t 
                        take a shot at you. Shit, you’re 
                        lucky I don’t take a shot at you.

           Jimmy looks around. A lot of mean looking Russian guys want a 
           piece of him. Maybe this wasn’t the best idea...
                                 JIMMY
                        I need a favor. Some info.

                                 YURI
                             (scoffs)
                        Of course you do. But you’ve used 
                        up your freebies. You want a favor, 
                        you gotta beat me.

           Jimmy didn’t expect this. The crowd watches him intently, 
           hoping he agrees to the challenge. A beat. And then--

           Fuck it. Jimmy rolls up his sleeves! The crowd goes WILD!

           Jimmy and Yuri hold their arms up and press them together. 
           That same RUSSIAN drops another GIANT LIT CIGAR into the 
           crevice between their arms and...

           The two men stand, the cigar charring their arms. But neither 
           budges. Neither shows any sign that they are in any pain at 
           all. This could go on for a while... 

           INT. YURI’S BACK ROOM CLUB - OFFICE - LATER

           Jimmy and Yuri tend to their burns, grimacing.

                                 JIMMY
                        You know who came at me last night?

                                 YURI
                        Some Armo who lost product? Some 
                        Russian made to pay the bill? Maybe 
                        some nigger or chink with nothing 
                        to sell? But you’re still in one 
                        piece. Systema lessons worked, huh? 
                        You fight like a Russian now.

           Jimmy hands over the picture of Ileana that Bill gave him.

                                 JIMMY
                        Where can I find her?

                                 YURI
                        Ha! The new girl! My cousin, he 
                        says she screams like banshee.

                                 JIMMY
                        A week ago she was some mope’s mail 
                        order bride.

                                 YURI
                        For ten grand I can get him new 
                        girl. A better girl. Virgin maybe.
                                 JIMMY
                        Yeah, well... He loves her. 

                                 YURI
                        You Americans and your love. You 
                        are dogs to your women.

                                 JIMMY
                        Go fuck yourself, Yuri.

           Yuri shakes his head, pathetic.

                                 YURI
                        She works at the Sputnik. But I 
                        wouldn’t walk in there if I were 
                        you...

           Jimmy bites his lip. This is gonna be difficult...

                                 JIMMY
                        You can’t make a call?

                                 YURI
                        What’s Romeo paying you?

                                 JIMMY
                        A grand.

           Remember Bill paid him TWO thousand. Yuri smirks.

                                 YURI
                        I want half.

           Jimmy GROANS, then reluctantly throws a $500 down on the 
           desk. Yuri counts it with a devilish smile.

                                 YURI (CONT’D)
                        Big to-do tonight. A lot of angry, 
                        powerful people gettin’ together. 
                        New fans of yours. Watch your back.
                             (a beat)
                        I’ll be there later. Maybe we get 
                        ourselves a coupl’a girls, see if 
                        you can fuck like a Russian too.

           INT. BANQUET HALL - NIGHT

           The place is packed with distinguished Angelenos dressed to 
           the nines. A banner reads: Los Angeles Police Association’s 
           Man of the Year.

           We find Carl sitting across from the BARTENDER, downing a 
           glass of scotch. He stares intently across the room, watching 
           a strong and sexy Latina, ROSA (40s), work the room.
                                 BARTENDER
                        Another one?

                                 CARL
                        Shit’s free, ain’t it?

           The Bartender pours. Carl drops a ten into the tip jar. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Who’s the broad?

                                 CARL
                        My wife.

                                 BARTENDER
                             (takes another look)
                        He know that?

           Carl turns back around to see Banks whispering in Rosa’s ear. 
           She laughs and then tenderly rests a hand on his shoulder. A 
           nice, intimate gesture. It turns Carl’s stomach. He downs his 
           scotch and slams the glass back down on the bar.

                                 CARL
                        Pour.

           EXT. THE SPUTNIK - NIGHT

           New ethnic neighborhood. New hole-in-the-wall bar. Support 
           our Troops! ribbons are proudly displayed in the window. 

           As Jimmy enters, we pan across the street to reveal--

           A SHADOWY FIGURE, wearing an OXYGEN MASK, intently watches 
           him from the safety of a BMW Seven Series.

           INT. THE SPUTNIK - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The RUSSIAN DOORMAN pats Jimmy down and waves him in.

           INT. THE SPUTNIK - BAR - NIGHT

           A party is in full swing. Businessmen and Russian mobster 
           types frolic with scantily-clad, beaten-down young girls. 
           N’SYNC’s Bye, Bye Bye blares over the speakers.

           A MAN watches, wide-eyed as the HOOKER on his lap exposes her 
           breast and plays with her extremely long nipple. Two RUSSIAN 
           JOHNS laugh their asses off, taking turns slapping another 
           HOOKER’s plump ass.

           Jimmy enters and again, all eyes fall upon him. Stares of 
           death. Against his better judgement, he heads for the bar.
           The scarfaced bartender, NIKOLAY (35), approaches.

                                 JIMMY 
                        Budweiser.

           Jimmy scans the crowd, recognizing most all of his admirers.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Yuri wasn’t joking. Lotta players 
                        in here. What’s the occasion?

                                 NIKOLAY
                             (handing the beer over)
                        We don’t ask questions here. We 
                        just like party.

           Just then, a creepy RUSSIAN BOY with a ponytail and a HAIR-
           LIP, enters. He makes a bee-line for the bar.

           The Boy hands Nikolay a thin strip of red paper (one of the 
           same fortune cookie-like strips the police found in Garo’s 
           home) and then quickly exits the building.

           Nikolay heads into the BACK OFFICE and uses a RUSSIAN 
           CHILDREN’S DECODER RING to translate the message on the strip 
           of paper.

           Jimmy watches this closely (through a crack in the door) 
           until something distracts him. A BOISTEROUS FEMALE LAUGH--

           It’s ILEANA (30). Bill’s girl. The rest of these women look 
           like they’ve been rode hard and put away wet, but not Ileana. 
           She just glows. And man does she look like Cathy...

                                 NIKOLAY (CONT’D)
                        You want girl?

           Jimmy turns to see Nikolay. He’s back, holding the red strip 
           of paper to a LIGHTER’S FLAME.

           He drops the singed remnant into an ASHTRAY on the bar...an 
           ashtray full of singed remnants.

                                 NIKOLAY (CONT’D)
                        You come for fuck, no?

                                 JIMMY
                        I want her.

           Jimmy points to Ileana. Nikolay waves her over.

                                 NIKOLAY 
                        Four hundred.
           Jimmy reluctantly hands the $400 over. And Nikolay slips him 
           a small, colorful RUSSIAN TOKEN.

           INT. THE SPUTNIK - UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

           Ileana drags Jimmy (beer-in-hand) up the stairs. Sounds of 
           coital ecstasy pour from the hallway.

           The MADAME approaches and holds out her hand.

                                 MADAME (RUSSIAN ACCENT)
                        Your token?

           Jimmy hands over the colorful Russian TOKEN the Bartender 
           gave him.

                                 MADAME (CONT’D)
                        Room seven.

           INT. THE SPUTNIK - UPSTAIRS - ROOM 7 - MOMENTS LATER

           Lit CANDLES create a romantic mood. Jimmy opens his mouth to 
           speak, but Ileana jams her tongue in it. He fights her at 
           first, but she’s too good a kisser. He quickly surrenders.

           She yanks his shirt off and his pants down. She pulls a 
           condom and pops it in her mouth. Girl’s a real pro...

           As she heads in, Jimmy chugs his beer. She’s down there 
           working for a good couple of beats, but nothing’s happening. 
           She finally looks up, frustrated and confused.

                                 ILEANA
                        You need the Viagra?

                                 JIMMY
                        Shit, I can’t do this.

           Jimmy staggers to his feet, pulls his tighty-whiteys up.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        I’m a private investigator. Your 
                        husband sent me to bring you back.

                                 ILEANA
                             (confused)
                        Husband?

           Suddenly -- RAT-A-TAT-TAT! A Machine Gun ROARS from the 
           hallway. A woman SCREAMS! 

           Ileana is terrified, starting to panic. Jimmy sobers 
           instantly. He puts his finger over his lips, Shhh...
                                 JIMMY
                        Get down. They’re here for me.

           RAT-A-TAT-TAT! More shots. More screams. Closer now--

           Ileana finally snaps. She sprints out into the hallway, 
           destined for an exit door. Jimmy lunges for her, to no avail. 

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Ileana! NO!!! 

           RAT-A-TAT-TAT! She is cut to pieces right in front of him. 
           Jimmy is devastated.

           He takes a beat to pull himself back together, then he 
           cautiously peeks his head into the hallway.

           HALLWAY

           Jimmy’s POV: TWO MASKED GUNMEN move to cut down a pack of 
           JOHNS in the hallway. RAT-A-TAT-TAT!

           OTHERS go room to room, kicking open doors, unloading their 
           AK-47s on anything that moves. RAT-A-TAT-TAT!

           ROOM 7

           Jimmy spins back inside. They’ll be here soon! His eyes dart 
           frantically around the room, searching for a weapon, but 
           nothing seems to fit the bill.

           RAT-A-TAT-TAT! More SCREAMING! Glass breaking!

           Jimmy, still wearing only his tighty-whiteys, picks his BELT 
           up off of the ground...

           HALLWAY

           The Gunman methodically moves on to Room 7. The door is 
           already open here. It doesn’t appear to be occupied. Just to 
           be sure, he steps inside--

           ROOM 7

           --WHAM!!!! Jimmy HAMMERS the Gunman with his bare foot. The 
           AK-47 flies from his hand.

           In an instant, Jimmy’s behind the Gunman, his belt wrapped 
           around the man’s neck, choking him.

           WHAM! WHAM! The Gunman drives his elbows into Jimmy’s ribs, 
           but it just makes him angrier, stronger. Seconds away from 
           unconsciousness, the Gunman is barely able to speak--
                                 GUNMAN
                             (in Russian)
                        Fool. Your days are numbered.

           Suddenly, TWO MORE GUNMEN charge into the room. One of them 
           clubs Jimmy in the back with his rifle.

           Jimmy loses hold of the belt and the original Gunman crashes 
           to the ground, gasping for air.

           The two new Gunmen set upon Jimmy and start kicking and 
           punching, but he’s able to fight them off. Yuri was right. 
           He’s become quite the SYSTEMA (Russian Martial art) master. 
           Amid the chaos, the candles get knocked over and THE BED 
           CATCHES FIRE.

           The third Gunman finally joins the melee and Jimmy is 
           overpowered. They yank him from the room, just as the fire 
           starts to climb up the curtains.

           INT. UPSTAIRS APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Jimmy is dragged out into the hallway, dazed and confused. A 
           HACKING COUGH steals his attention. He looks up to see--

           An OLDER GENTLEMAN in a white suit almost floating down the 
           hallway. He approaches the dead one-by-one and puts a bullet 
           between their eyes. Just to make sure they stay that way...

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Then he launches into another violent 
           coughing fit, spitting blood into a handkerchief.

           The Older Man finally looks up at our hero with a pair of 
           PIERCING BLUE EYES.

           Jimmy is completely disarmed. He pales. His jaw drops. His 
           legs go numb. All he can do is stare. He blinks once. Twice. 
           The face is different. But...those eyes. It’s THE GHOST!!!

           Vitale approaches methodically, looks Jimmy dead in the eye.

                                 VITALE
                        Hello again, James. I’ve waited a 
                        long time for this. 

           Vitale raises his weapon and presses it to Jimmy’s forehead.

           Just then, the SPRINKLERS overhead start GUSHING WATER! It 
           distracts Vitale and his goons for just a second, but that’s 
           all Jimmy needs.

           He kicks the gun from Vitale’s hand. He decks one Gunman, 
           then the other. 
           The third Gunmen turns and opens fire on him: RAT-A-TAT-TAT!

           Jimmy dives back into room 7, narrowly escaping bloody death.

           ROOM 7

           The fire is simply out of control. But Jimmy can hear 
           footsteps nearing. He can feel the Gunmen closing in.

           He only has a second or two to react. Screw it. In the blink 
           of an eye, he’s running full-speed into the fire! 

           The Gunmen round the corner and open up: RAT-A-TAT-TAT!

           Jimmy LEAPS THROUGH THE FUCKING WINDOW!!! 

           EXT. THE SPUTNIK - NIGHT

           Jimmy CRASHES to the pavement, just as an LAPD SQUAD CAR 
           SCREECHES to a halt outside the club...

           He lays there, half-naked...amid a heap of broken glass, 
           burnt, bleeding, wheezing. This guy is in terrible shape.

           UNIFORMED OFFICERS approach, guns drawn. But once they see 
           the state Jimmy’s in, they lower their weapons.

                                 UNIFORMED OFFICER
                        Call an ambulance...

           INT. BANQUET HALL - NIGHT

           Rosa takes the podium to address the crowd.

                                 ROSA
                        When Lt. Howard Banks and I founded 
                        the Wilshire District Reserve 
                        Officer program, my goal was 
                        simple: reduce gang activity in my 
                        district. But Howard's plan was 
                        brilliant: Deputize and train 
                        concerned, law-abiding citizens in 
                        high risk areas. Work together with 
                        the community to combat the plague.

           A round of applause.

                                 ROSA (CONT’D)
                        Lt. Banks didn’t just hand these 
                        citizens a badge and an idle 
                        promise. He handed them 
                        empowerment, the means to take back 
                        what’s theirs.
           Another roar from the crowd.

                                 ROSA (CONT’D)
                        Here he is, the Los Angeles Police 
                        Association’s Man of the Year...Lt. 
                        Howard Banks.

           Banks takes the stage. Everyone is clapping, going crazy. 
           Everyone except for--

           CARL. He’s drunk. The only thing his hands are doing is 
           bringing another glass of scotch to his lips. Detective 
           Rogers approaches.

                                 ROGERS
                        Sir, the station’s called 
                        twice...they say it’s urgent.

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Ramirez peers into an EXAMINATION ROOM where a DOCTOR slams 
           Jimmy’s shoulder back into socket. It’s a borderline gruesome 
           sight, but it doesn’t seem to bother Harris. She’s ready to 
           march right in, ready to tear Jimmy apart, but--

           A NURSE (60s, stern) blocks her path. 

                                 NURSE
                        The Doctor doesn’t think he’s up to 
                        it just yet. He needs rest.

                                 HARRIS
                        Listen, Grandma. We got a massacre 
                        on our hands. That douchebag’s the 
                        only one who walked outta that 
                        brothel alive. He’s not getting a 
                        fucking nap. Tell the doctor to rub 
                        some dirt on that shit and get 
                        outta my way.

           The red-faced Nurse stomps into the examination room. Ramirez 
           shakes his head, pensive. 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        We should wait for the Captain...

           INT. HOSPITAL - EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Jimmy looks awful. His face battered. His hospital gown 
           stained with blood. He winces as the Doctor patches up his 
           broken ribs. Ramirez and Harris are not sympathetic.
                                 HARRIS
                        What the fuck were you doing in 
                        that brothel, Marino?

                                 JIMMY
                        I wanted a hand job. And you had 
                        your phone turned off.

                                 HARRIS
                        Shit. Your flaccid-ass ain’t had 
                        wood since Clinton was is office.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        You’re not gonna fuck us over 
                        again. We’re still paying the bill 
                        for that nonsense down at the port.

                                 HARRIS
                        Traffic duty. Desk work. Things 
                        heat up, the Captain sits us in a 
                        corner with a dunce cap on.

                                 JIMMY
                        Yeah? Well, give Daddy a call. I’m 
                        sure he’ll set things straight.

           Jimmy’s touched a nerve here. Harris almost smacks him in the 
           face. Ramirez has to hold her back.

           The Doctor finishes up. Jimmy pulls him close.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Can I get a little Vicodin?

           The Doctor shakes his head and reluctantly writes a 
           prescription. Harris gets up in Jimmy’s face.

                                 HARRIS
                        Look, this was big time. Some major 
                        Ruski honchos ate lead tonight.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Word is the Armos were going to 
                        give them a chance to make things 
                        right. What changed?

                                 JIMMY
                        The gunmen weren’t Armenian.

                                 HARRIS
                        Bullshit. Why where you in that 
                        brothel, Jimmy? What aren’t you 
                        telling us?
           Just then, Carl enters. He’s livid. Ramirez tightens up. 
           Harris rolls her eyes. She knows this interrogation is over. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Carl with Ramirez and Harris.

                                 HARRIS
                        He should be in jail. Scumbag PI. 
                        Wash-out cop. Why do you and the 
                        Lieutenant insist on holding his 
                        fucking hand?

           Carl gets in Harris’ face.

                                 CARL
                        --You gonna question me, Detective?

                                 HARRIS
                        No, sir. I just--

                                 CARL
                        --You’re too young. You don’t know. 
                        And I don’t have the time or 
                        inclination to explain it to you. 
                        All you need to know is as long as 
                        I’m in charge, he’s off limits.

           Harris reluctantly relents.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        We’re just trying to get to the 
                        bottom of this thing, sir. We want 
                        back in the game.

                                 CARL 
                        Yeah. Well, trust me. Marino’s a 
                        dead end. You want off the leash? 
                        Then get out there and shake some 
                        trees. Armenians hit the Russians. 
                        Sure as shit the Russians are gonna 
                        hit back. Let’s see if we can cool 
                        things down a bit.

           Ramirez and Harris head off. Carl looks back into the 
           examination room and sees Jimmy preparing to leave.

           INT. HOSPITAL - EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Jimmy, his arm now in a sling, is struggling to get a coat 
           on. Carl enters and tries to help him out. Jimmy pulls away.

                                 JIMMY
                        I don’t need your help.
           Jimmy finally just throws the jacket across the room.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t need you and Banks hiding 
                        around corners, pulling strings 
                        every time I get into a little 
                        trouble.

                                 CARL
                        A little trouble?

                                 JIMMY
                        You heard me. I’m no charity case.

                                 CARL
                        That was a God damn massacre. And 
                        you were thrown out a window, half 
                        naked.

                                 JIMMY
                        Thrown?! Fuck that. I jumped.

                                 CARL
                        Either way, it sounds like BIG 
                        trouble to me. Sounds like you need 
                        all the charity you can get.
                             (a beat)
                        What the hell you still doin’ in 
                        the middle of this Russian/Armenian 
                        bullshit anyway? You’re gonna get 
                        yourself killed.

                                 JIMMY
                        I told Cagney and Lacey. Gunmen 
                        weren’t Armos. Guy spoke to me in 
                        perfect Russian.

                                 CARL
                        Guys were using Nazarian’s weapons. 
                        Same shit we seized this morning.

                                 JIMMY
                        Word around the campfire is Garo 
                        ain’t supplying the Armenians no 
                        more. He’s dealing to someone else.

           Carl rolls his eyes, skeptical.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Romanovski’s here, Carl. I saw him 
                        with my own eyes. He put a gun to 
                        my head.
                                 CARL
                        Jesus, man. You’re fucking 
                        certifiable. Pension entitles you 
                        to psychiatric help. Do us all a 
                        favor and go get some.

                                 JIMMY
                        Just hear me out--

                                 CARL
                        --Vitale is dead, Jimmy. Three 
                        Agencies confirmed it.

                                 JIMMY
                        I went to Lensk. There was no body.

                                 CARL
                        Man, you’ve been seein’ Ghosts, 
                        crying Wolf for too damn long. I’m 
                        done listening.

                                 JIMMY
                        You quit listening a long time ago. 
                        To anything outside of what your 
                        wife tells you, anyway.

           Carl’s eyes flash with anger. He gets up in Jimmy’s face. 
           Jimmy doesn’t even flinch. Carl’s had it.

                                 CARL
                        I’m done with you.

           Carl heads for the door.

                                 JIMMY
                        The writing is on the wall here. 
                        Romanovski’s back and this is only 
                        the beginning.

           INT. ALL AMERICAN TEXTILES - NIGHT

           The sewing operation has shut down for the night. Jimmy walks 
           through the eerily quiet factory floor.

           He approaches the iron door on the back wall. No guard...

           INT. YURI’S BACK ROOM CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           No music this time around. No whores. No scumbags. Just Yuri 
           and his GOONS (including Alexei) gearing up for war. 

           Yuri takes a KEVLAR VEST out of a U.S.S.R-labeled CRATE and 
           puts it on. Jimmy limps around the room, right on his heels.
                                 JIMMY
                        I was at the Sputnik, Yuri. Those 
                        guys were Russian, not Armenian. 

           Yuri racks the barrel of his shotgun.

                                 YURI
                        My cousin is dead, Jimmy. And if 
                        they’d come an hour later, I’d be 
                        dead too. Those men were not 
                        Russian. Believe me. 

                                 JIMMY
                        It was Romanovski. I saw him.

           Alexei laughs out loud. The other Goons follow suit. Jimmy is 
           nothing more than a bad joke to them. It embarrasses Yuri. 

                                 YURI
                        Not again, Jimmy. Not now.

                                 JIMMY
                        The cops are looking for you to hit 
                        back. They’ll be all over you.

                                 YURI
                        Cops? We don’t worry about cops. 

           Jimmy sighs, there’s no stopping Yuri now. His soldiers start 
           piling out the door, armed to the teeth, one after the other.

                                 YURI (CONT’D)
                        Things will get ugly, friend. Keep 
                        your head down.

           As Yuri and his crew exit, Jimmy walks over to the crate of 
           Kevlar vests. He takes hold of one and--

           INT. POLICE STATION - CARL’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Carl is at his desk, pouring over crime scene photos from the 
           Brothel. Banks enters. Carl doesn’t look up.

                                 BANKS
                        Burnin’ the midnight oil? 

                                 CARL
                        Tryin’ to make sense of this shit.

                                 BANKS
                        Three and a half million is a lot 
                        of coin. Makes perfect sense to me. 
                        You take from me. I take from you.
                                 CARL
                        I just don’t like the timing. The 
                        scope...

                                 BANKS 
                        If you wanna see the conspiracy 
                        badly enough, you will. But the 
                        truth? It ain’t there. Jimmy’s 
                        holdin’ onto a memory for dear 
                        life. You can’t get sucked in. You 
                        can’t validate his delusion. 

           That settles it. Carl’s done. He puts the photos away.

                                 BANKS (CONT’D)
                        Heard you got the papers today. 
                        Wanted to make sure you were okay.

           Carl takes a beat, then looks up at Banks, fire in his eyes.

                                 CARL
                        The papers...
                             (takes a deep breath)
                        Are you redoing my den, Howard?

                                 BANKS
                        Carl, I--

                                 CARL
                        --Neighbor said he’s seen trucks at 
                        the house all week. Furniture 
                        comin’ in and out. 

                                 BANKS
                        What do you want from me, man?

                                 CARL
                        I want to know why you’ve moved in, 
                        why you’re re-doing my God damn den 
                        when the papers aren’t even signed?

           Banks is speechless. Carl looks him squarely in the eye.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        I told you when you started fucking 
                        her, keep that shit outta this 
                        house. In here, you’re my 
                        Lieutenant and there’s nothing I 
                        can do about that. But we’re not 
                        friends anymore, so lose the act.
           INT. FLAMINGOS BAR - NIGHT

           To call this a dive would be a compliment. Sticky floors. Low 
           lighting. Dirty tables. However, it seems to suit the 
           clientele, mostly shady-looking Russian ex-pats, just fine.

           A wildly intoxicated Jimmy stares defiantly down at a 
           PHOTOGRAPH. VITALE ROMANOVSKI’s bullet-ridden corpse.

           Just then, the alarm on Jimmy’s digital watch SOUNDS. He 
           slides off of his stool and starts doing pushups right in the 
           middle of the bar.

           INT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON - KITCHEN - MORNING

           A heavy-set PRISONER works kitchen-duty. He places a small 
           plastic BAGGIE inside an empty bowl and smothers it with a 
           ladle of oatmeal.

           He looks over to the door and locks eyes with the GUARD...

           The Guard takes the bowl of oatmeal from a FOOD CART and 
           approaches a CELL, peeking inside...

           INT. PRISON - CELL - CONTINUOUS

           ...where a massive, shirtless MAN barrels through his own set 
           of push-ups. His long hair falls over his face, obscuring his 
           identity, until... A KNOCK at the door.

           The man rises to his feet and we finally get look at him. 
           Rippling muscles, twenty-two inch neck, thick-graying beard. 
           And a SCAR on his CHEST. An OLD BULLET WOUND.

           His entire body is covered in tatoos. A cross on his chest. A 
           tiger on each arm. Stalin’s ugly mug over his heart. And a 
           star on each knee. No doubt about it now--

           This is THE WOLF, IVAN ROMANOVSKI. Well into his forties now, 
           the hard-time has only made him stronger and more imposing.

           The Guard slides the oatmeal through the slot in the door.

           Ivan fishes the baggie out of the bowl. Inside he finds--

           An all-too-familiar THIN STRIP OF RED PAPER! He pulls a 
           RUSSIAN CHILDREN’S DECODER RING from under his mattress and 
           works the dial. He deciphers the message and smiles.
           EXT. CIGARETTE HOUSE - LITTLE ARMENIA - EARLY MORNING

           A one-room Armenian Pre-School. This harmless, even hopeful 
           setting contrasts sharply with what sits next door--

           An Armenian mafia contraband house. Shot to shit. A war zone. 

           A crowd of ARMENIAN LOCALS is gathering. They’re angry, 
           SHOUTING at the Police. Demanding answers. Demanding justice. 

           Carl weaves through the crowd, careful to avoid the FEMALE 
           REPORTER setting up for a shot with her CAMERAMAN. Banks and 
           Harris approach. 

                                 BANKS
                        Five dead Armenians. Soldiers. 
                        Bosses. Even a kid...

                                 CARL
                        Right next to a school no less...

                                 HARRIS
                        A street full of purple-haireds 
                        watch it go down, yet no one can 
                        tell us a God damned thing.

                                 BANKS
                        Cultural amnesia. Get used to it.

           Carl eyes the crowd of angry Armenian locals wearily. Banks 
           pulls him close.

                                 BANKS (CONT’D)
                        Hate to say I told you so, but, 
                        even the talking heads are wise.

           He motions to the Female Reporter, now rushing over...

                                 FEMALE REPORTER
                        Captain Morris! Is it safe to 
                        assume this was Russian retaliation 
                        for last night’s brothel massacre?

           Harris steps up and escorts the reporter away. The crowd is 
           really starting to get belligerent. They’re SCREAMING now. 
           Wide-eyed and angry. Things are coming to a boil here.

           Ramirez approaches, looks like he’s got more bad news...

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Armos just hit back. Russian bakery 
                        on Fairfax. Two dead.
                                 CARL
                        I need to get with Armen. Have him 
                        put the brakes on. This shit is 
                        gettin’ out of hand.

           EXT. BILL’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Jimmy, hungover and sleep-deprived, takes a swig from a brown-
           bagged tallboy of Steel Reserve. As he limps toward the 
           building’s entrance, something steals his attention--

           Through the reflection in the apartment window, he notices a 
           SILVER BMW 7 Series with a couple of shady-looking characters 
           inside. It creeps past him, then parks down the block. 

           He’s so focused on the car that he almost gets run over by-- 
           A BLACK KID on a bicycle!

                                 BLACK KID
                        Hey fool! Watch where you goin’!

           The bike skids to a halt. Sensing an opportunity, Jimmy 
           reaches into his pocket and pulls out a five dollar bill.

                                 JIMMY
                        There’s a silver BMW, ‘bout half a 
                        block down. It’s been following me. 
                        I need a plate number. 

                                 BLACK KID
                        Nigga, you drunk! And you stink!

           He starts to pedal away. Jimmy sighs and pulls out a ten. 

                                 JIMMY
                        How about a Hamilton? That change 
                        things?

                                 BLACK KID
                        You make it a Jackson, we cool.

           Jimmy groans. He takes out a twenty and rips it in half. 

                                 BLACK KID (CONT’D)
                        Hey man, whatch’you doing?!

           Jimmy hands one half of the twenty to the Black Kid.

                                 JIMMY
                        Get me the plate number and the 
                        rest is yours.
           INT. BILL’S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

           Jimmy steps out of the elevator and into the hallway. He 
           approaches Bill’s door and notices--

           It’s CRACKED OPEN. Jimmy pulls his PATPARINE 9.2MM (the most 
           powerful Russian-made hand gun). He pushes the door open and 
           braces himself for the worst--

           INT. BILL’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           WHOOSH! Jimmy’s head is immediately covered in a black cloth 
           bag! And we’re enveloped in darkness along with him. Then--

           BOOM! Jimmy’s Patparine FIRES! A male voice SCREAMS in agony. 
           He rips the bag off his head, and sees--

           A WOUNDED RUSSIAN GUNMAN writhing on the ground, howling in 
           pain. Bleeding profusely. Then--

           WHACK! ANOTHER MASSIVE RUSSIAN kicks Jimmy in the face! Jimmy 
           drops his gun and stumbles back...

           The Russian is on him instantly, delivering one devastating 
           kick after another. Putting on one hell of a Systema display. 
           He tosses the cloth bag back to Jimmy.

                                 RUSSIAN (IN RUSSIAN)
                        Put it on. You’re coming with me.

           Jimmy isn’t having it. He tosses the bag away and kicks the 
           Russian right in the testes. The behemoth drops to his knees. 

           Now, it’s Jimmy’s turn. He pummels his opponent with a 
           barrage of kicks and punches. But the Russian is quickly back 
           to his feet. He lowers his head and charges at Jimmy. Then--

           Jimmy SIDESTEPS him and uses the Russian’s weight and 
           momentum to send him FLYING OUT THE FIFTH STORY WINDOW!!!

           EXT. BILL’S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           The Russian falls five stories, SCREAMING the whole way down. 
           He crashes through the roof of a PARKED CAR. Metal twisting. 
           Alarm sounding. Glass spraying in all directions.

           Jimmy stumbles out, in bad shape, still on high alert. He 
           peers down the block, where the BMW was parked--

           But the car is GONE. Nowhere to be found. The Black Kid 
           approaches, checking out the dead Russian.

                                 BLACK KID
                        Damn! You fucked him up real good.
           The Black Kid’s got the plate number. Jimmy tries to take it, 
           but he pulls it away.

                                 BLACK KID (CONT’D)
                        The twenty, nigga. 

           Nearby, tires SQUEAL! Jimmy looks up to see...THE BMW 
           SPEEDING TOWARD THEM!

           Jimmy pushes the Black Kid to the ground, and FIRES his gun--

           BOOM! He gets one shot off before the GUNMAN inside raises 
           his AK-47: RAT-A-TAT-TAT!

           Two quick BLASTS from the rifle. Jimmy goes down. The BMW 
           SQUEALS off!

           Jimmy lays on the ground, MOANING in pain. The Black Kid gets 
           up, unharmed and surprisingly unfazed. He snatches the other 
           half of the twenty from Jimmy’s pocket, replacing it with the 
           plate number and then he disappears down the street...

           INT. MIKHAIL’S RUSSIAN & TURKISH BATHS - THE WARM ROOM - DAY

           A couple of naked Russian BATHERS enjoy the continuous flow 
           of hot dry air, which allows them to perspire freely.

           A beat and Yuri enters, Alexei and another GOON behind him.

           INT. MIKHAIL’S RUSSIAN & TURKISH BATHS - BACK ROOM - DAY 

           Jimmy’s getting stitched up by a sweaty RUSSIAN DOCTOR, 
           reflector on his head, blood stains on his white jacket. 

           Jimmy pops a Vicodin and washes it down with a swig of vodka. 
           The Doctor snatches the bottle away.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Bad for you. No drink with those.

           Jimmy GAGS, almost vomits. Doctor wasn’t kiddin’.

           Across the room, Yuri inspects a CCCP-labeled Kevlar vest. 
           Two gaping bullet holes where Jimmy was shot. He shakes his 
           head, looks back at Jimmy. Close call.

                                 JIMMY
                        You bring me flowers?

           Yuri shoots the Doctor a look and motions to the door. The 
           Doctor excuses himself immediately. Yuri turns to Jimmy, his 
           look severe.
                                 YURI 
                        They have my family. In Russia. I 
                        must go to them.

                                 JIMMY
                        Romanovski.

                                 YURI
                        I owe you an apology. You were 
                        right. 

           Jimmy’s heart starts to race.

                                 JIMMY
                        Why now?

                                 YURI
                        I was hoping you could tell me.

           Jimmy is at a loss. Yuri expected as much. 

                                 YURI (CONT’D)
                        You’re the closest thing I have to 
                        a friend in this country. I fly out 
                        of Santa Monica tonight. Come with 
                        me.

                                 JIMMY
                        I’m not going anywhere.

                                 YURI
                        Vitale will kill everyone, Jimmy. 
                        Just like last time. I know you’ve 
                        been waiting for this. But trust 
                        me. You can’t win here. You won’t.

           Jimmy notices something new in his old friend. Fear.

           INT. POLICE STATION - CARL’S OFFICE - DAY

           A PINK SHIRT-clad Carl is on the phone. His secretary, 
           PHYLLIS, walks in, upset.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        I told him you were busy, but--

           Jimmy limps in behind her. White. Ghastly. Beat all to hell.

                                 JIMMY
                        Nice shirt...

           Carl quickly hangs up. He looks Jimmy up and down.
                                 CARL
                        Jesus, man. I heard you were dead.

                                 JIMMY
                        Yuri Petrov’s headed back to Moscow 
                        with his tail between his legs.

           Carl knows where he’s going and he doesn’t want to hear it. 

                                 CARL
                        Don’t come to me with more 
                        bullshit. I don’t have the time.

                                 JIMMY
                        I need you to run a plate for me.

           Carl LAUGHS like this is an absurd request.

                                 CARL
                        I got a gang war, seems to get 
                        worse by the minute. Got a call 
                        from the Mayor today, Jimbo. And it 
                        wasn’t to congratulate me for 
                        keeping the town quiet all these 
                        years. After that ATF fiasco, my 
                        job’s on the line. I can’t get 
                        sucked into another one of your 
                        fits of craziness. I need you outta 
                        my way. If I have to lock your ass 
                        up, I’ll do it.

           Jimmy looks stung. Carl reaches into his wallet and tosses a 
           twenty on the table. A peace offering.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Go get yourself drunk. Just keep 
                        your head down, let me handle this.

           Jimmy looks to Carl with angry eyes.

                                 JIMMY
                        This is the last favor I’ll ask. No 
                        more stories. No more bailouts.

           Carl grudgingly takes the plate number from Jimmy and 
           inspects it.

                                 CARL
                        Seven Series?

                                 JIMMY
                        Yeah. Brand new.

           Carl consults a DOCUMENT on his desk.
                                 CARL
                        I’ll be damned...

           Jimmy’s not following.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        A load of Beamers were ripped from 
                        a truck a few weeks back. Found a 
                        coupl’a them at Nazarian’s house. 
                        Souped-up. VINs changed. Along with 
                        a batch of bogus sequential plates. 
                        This is one of the ones that was 
                        missing...

           Carl knows exactly what Jimmy is thinking.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        I know that look, Jimmy. You’re not 
                        in the game anymore. Shit, it’s a 
                        miracle you ain’t dead. Count your 
                        blessings. Sit this one out. My 
                        boys’ll run this down.

           Jimmy rolls his eyes. Carl’s had it.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Fine. Gimme your piece.

                                 JIMMY
                        What? Why?

                                 CARL
                        This ain’t a God damned discussion. 
                        Hand it over. Now.

           Reluctantly, Jimmy hands Carl his Patparine 9.2mm. 

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Your spare too, Jim. Don’t make me 
                        search your ass.

           Jimmy pulls a .38 from an ankle-holster and hands it over. 

                                 JIMMY
                        You’re an asshole...

           Jimmy snags the twenty from Carl’s desk and then stomps out. 
           As soon as he’s gone, Ramirez and Harris enter. 

                                 CARL 
                        I want you two glued to his ass. He 
                        goes anywhere but a bar, drag him 
                        right back here. I don’t care if 
                        he’s kicking and screaming. 
           INT. POLICE CRUISER - DAY

           A frustrated Ramirez and Harris covertly watch as Jimmy paces 
           apprehensively outside a BAR. He’s all-cleaned up, wearing a 
           tight tank top to show off his muscles.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        City’s on fire and we’re stuck 
                        babysitting a bum.

           Something’s clearly bothering Harris. It finally hits her.

                                 HARRIS
                        That’s a god damned fag bar. 

                                 RAMIREZ
                             (laughs)
                        What?

                                 HARRIS
                        Christ, I never would’a figured. 
                        What a shame...

           Ramirez tries to pretend the comment doesn’t bother him.

           INT. ANOTHER BAR - CONTINUOUS

           The bar is full of MEN. Madonna’s Like a Prayer, plays on the 
           speakers. Harris wasn’t kidding...

           Jimmy enters. The PATRONS eye him ravenously. Fresh meat.

           Jimmy sits down next to his mark, WANG (20s). A real dainty 
           Chinese guy. Meticulously quaffed hair. Long finger nails. 
           Form-fitting jeans.

           Jimmy hands Carl’s twenty to the BARTENDER.

                                 JIMMY
                        Gimme a Bud. And let me buy a drink 
                        for my man here.

           Wang smiles wryly. He and Jimmy lock eyes. Then--

           INT. ANOTHER BAR - BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A room full of men in red velvet booths, all engaged in 
           furious sexual activity. Wang has Jimmy by the hand, leading 
           him through the melee. They settle on a booth.

           Wang slides in next to Jimmy. Close. Jimmy’s nervous. It 
           excites Wang. He finally leans in for a kiss. Jimmy takes 
           that as his cue--
           He grabs Wang by the neck, choking him. Jimmy figured on 
           scaring this kid, but Wang seems to like it...

                                 WANG
                        Oh, yeah... Choke me, Daddy.

                                 JIMMY
                        No, you don’t-- I’m not--

           Wang is really excited. He starts to play with himself...

                                 WANG
                        Choke me, Daddy. CHOKE ME!

           Jimmy is seriously about to vomit. He finally lets go.

                                 JIMMY
                        Garo Nazarian had a load of Beamers 
                        chopped. You set it up. I need to 
                        know who did the work.

                                 WANG
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about...

           Wang tries to leave. Jimmy shoves him back into the booth.

                                 JIMMY
                        Look, there are two, maybe three 
                        guys who could’a set this up.

                                 WANG
                        So...go talk to them.

                                 JIMMY
                        You’re the only one who smokes 
                        cock... Look, I’m not a cop. I’m 
                        not here to mess with your 
                        business. I just need to know where 
                        you sent those BMWs. 

                                 WANG
                        I ain’t telling you shit. Garo and 
                        I were in love. 

           Jimmy can’t help but laugh. Oh the irony. 

                                 JIMMY
                        He died with some other guy’s lips 
                        wrapped around his dick. You know 
                        that, right?

           Wang is shocked. He clearly did not know that...
           INT. ANOTHER BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Ramirez tries to hold the door open for Harris. Quite a 
           gentleman. She looks at him like he is insane.

                                 HARRIS
                        No. After you. I insist.

           Ramirez reluctantly steps in first, almost squirming. 
           Smelling his fear, the patrons greet him with HOOTS and 
           HOLLERS. Harris rolls her eyes and heads for the Bartender.

                                 HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        Guy in the beater. Where’d he go?

                                 BARTENDER
                             (winks at Ramirez)
                        You kiss, I tell...

           Ramirez turns bright red. Harris flashes her badge, annoyed.

                                 HARRIS
                        Slow your roll, princess.

           Bartender reluctantly points them toward the back room.

           BACK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ramirez and Harris rush in and run smack dab into a flustered 
           Wang. He knows exactly who they’re after. 

                                 WANG
                        He just slipped out the back!

           As Ramirez and Harris make for the back door, Wang hightails 
           it out of there...

           EXT. ANOTHER BAR - BACK ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Ramirez and Harris spill into the alley, guns drawn. But 
           Jimmy is long gone. Carl is gonna have their asses....

                                 HARRIS
                        GOD DAMN IT!!!

           EXT. BUS STOP - SOUTH LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Jimmy steps off a CITY BUS. It pulls away, revealing--

           RED, WHITE & BLUE AUTO BODY. American flags wave frantically 
           atop the fence posts. A couple of grizzled old LITHUANIANS 
           play Backgammon in a repair bay.
           It’s quiet, peaceful. Nothing out of the ordinary. Except for 
           the EXPENSIVE SURVEILLANCE CAMERA above the front door. 

           Jimmy knows he’s onto something. He sneaks down the back 
           alley for a better look.

           EXT. RED, WHITE & BLUE AUTO BODY - BACK ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Jimmy peeks through a hole in the fence. Sitting right there 
           in the parking lot is--

           The BMW from the drive-by! The back window has a BULLET 
           lodged in it. His bullet. This window, all the windows... 
           They’re made of BULLETPROOF GLASS. His heart races. 

           Just then, a Russian exits the GARAGE. This is SERGEI (35), a 
           bodybuilder-type. He’s wearing shorts, so we see the STARS 
           TATTOOED on his knees.

           He goes to work on a plain white PICKUP TRUCK, transforming 
           it into an LAPD BEACH PATROL TRUCK in a matter of seconds 
           simply by slapping a couple of DECALS on each side.

           ANOTHER MAN steps out of the garage, dragging a MILITARY 
           CRATE behind him--

           It’s BILL! The man who hired Jimmy to find Ileana. He motions 
           to the BMW.

                                 BILL (IN RUSSIAN)
                        You leave anything in there? 
                        They’re ready to crush it.

                                 SERGEI (IN RUSSIAN)
                             (shakes his head)
                        It’s windy today.

           Bill shrugs, not concerned. He and Sergei finally lift the 
           military crate into the bed of the pickup truck...

           EXT. JEWELRY STORE - DUSK

           A strip mall Jewelry emporium, somewhere on the west side. 
           Carl heads inside.

           INT. JEWELRY STORE - MOMENTS LATER

           A YOUNG ARMENIAN eyes Carl suspiciously. 

                                 YOUNG ARMENIAN
                        No Armen here.
                                 CARL
                        Don’t mess with me, kid. I don’t 
                        have the time.

           Just then, a VOICE from the back room.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Is that Captain Carl Morris I 
                        hear?! Vahe! Let him back!

           INT. JEWELRY STORE - BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Carl enters to find ARMEN (60s) carefully inspecting a RING 
           through the LOUPE, attached to his eye.

                                 ARMEN
                        The last time you came to me, you 
                        were in hot water with the Misses. 
                        Picked up one of these babies to 
                        cool things off. 
                             (beat)
                        What’d you do this time?

           Carl smirks. Armen’s more right than he knows.

                                 ARMEN (CONT’D)
                        A diamond ring can tame even the 
                        toughest of them. We just got some 
                        really nice bracelets in from--

                                 CARL
                        --I can’t have anymore blood on the 
                        streets, Armen.

           Armen sobers. Carl isn’t here for more jewelry.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        I want a word with the big man. I 
                        just need a couple of days to 
                        straighten--

                                 ARMEN
                        --You’ll have no trouble from our 
                        side. A truce has just been 
                        arranged.

           Carl is floored. A truce? 

                                 ARMEN (CONT’D)
                        But there are others who do not 
                        have our experience, Captain. Or 
                        our wisdom. There are many yet, who 
                        will drown in their own blood. 
           Before Carl can ask any questions, his cell phone RINGS. He’s 
           got to take it.

                                 CARL
                        Morris.

           A beat as Carl takes in some more bad news.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        The airport?!

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - BOARDWALK - DUSK

           It’s getting late. The tourists are long gone. The HOMELESS 
           are setting up their cardboard beds for the night. Jimmy 
           blends in surprisingly well.

           He intently watches the LAPD BEACH PATROL TRUCK. It’s parked 
           next to a LIFEGUARD STATION, a foot from the water’s edge.

           Next to it: Bill fiddles with a WALKIE-TALKIE. Sergei grabs a 
           handful of dry sand, tosses it in the air and watches the 
           wind carry it away.

           Suddenly, a shadow falls over Jimmy. Startled, he whips 
           around to see...an ANGRY VAGRANT, armed with a BASEBALL BAT.

                                 ANGRY VAGRANT
                        You in my spot!

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - BOARDWALK - NIGHT

           Jimmy’s on the pay phone, all worked up. It’s dark out now.

                                 JIMMY
                        You’re not listening! Something 
                        big’s goin’ down. I need backup!

           EXT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

           Rogers drives. Carl rides shotgun, shouting into his phone.

                                 CARL
                        Call 911 and get the fuck outta 
                        there. I got trouble at the 
                        airport. I need every man I got.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - BOARDWALK - NIGHT

           Jimmy on the phone. An awful thought sinks in.

                                 JIMMY
                        What’s going on at the airport?
           CLICK. Carl hung up. Frustrated, Jimmy SLAMS the phone down.

           EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - MAIN DRIVE - CONTINUOUS

           CARL’S POLICE CRUISER fishtails past a pair of overturned, 
           bullet-ridden SQUAD CARS and barrels toward the service gate.

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Carl looks to the runway and his face contorts...

           EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS

           A small SINGLE ENGINE PROP PLANE tears down the runway, 
           followed closely by an AIRPORT CATERING VAN.

           INT. PROP PLANE - CONTINUOUS

           Yuri SCREAMS at the PILOT.

                                 YURI
                        Go! GET OFF THE FUCKING GROUND!

           EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The Catering Van’s side doors rip open revealing FOUR masked, 
           AK-47 wielding GUNMEN. They lean out and FIRE at the plane. 
           RAT-A-TAT-TAT!

           The plane takes a couple of hits, but continues down the 
           runway, picking up speed...

           Before the Gunmen can get off another series of shots, an 
           AIRPORT POLICE CAR joins the melee. 

           BOOM! BOOM! The AIRPORT COP fires at the doors and windows of 
           the van. But his bullets seem to have no effect. 

           RAT-A-TAT-TAT! His car is littered with AK-47 fire. The hood 
           peels off, the windows explode. The Airport Cop and his 
           PARTNER are slaughtered.

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Carl rolls down his window and loads up a SHOTGUN.

                                 CARL
                        Get me closer.

           EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Rogers steps on it. As they gain on the Catering Van, Carl 
           takes aim at its tires and FIRES! BOOM! BOOM!
           Two direct hits, but both shots bounce harmlessly off! As a 
           frustrated Carl processes this--

           YURI’S PLANE LIFTS OFF INTO THE HEAVENS.

           INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS

           Yuri screams for joy, patting his Pilot on the back.

           EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The catering van SCREECHES to a halt at the end of the 
           runway. A pair of GUNMEN leap out and aim at the plane.

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Carl turns to Rogers.

                                 CARL
                        Hit’em.

                                 ROGERS
                        What?

                                 CARL
                        RUN THEIR ASSES OVER!!!

           From the passenger seat, Carl yanks the wheel left and stomps 
           down on the gas pedal. The car barrels toward the Gunmen.

           EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Just as the Gunmen begin firing into the air--

           BOOM! Carl’s police cruiser RAMS INTO THEM! The Gunman roll 
           up the hood and are launched over the roof of the car, firing 
           wildly: RAT-A-TAT-TAT!

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Rogers locks up the breaks. Carl looks over to see the 
           airport catering van tear up alongside them.

                                 CARL
                        GET THE FUCK OUTTA THE CAR!!!

           Carl and Rogers DIVE out the driver’s side door, moments 
           before the remaining Gunmen open fire: RAT-A-TAT-TAT!

           INT. CATERING VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Nikolay eyes the smoldering remains of the police cruiser 
           while the wounded Gunmen climb back into the van. Suddenly, 
           he hears more SIRENS approaching.
                                 NIKOLAY (IN RUSSIAN)
                        Get out of here!

           EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Carl steps from behind the bullet-ridden corpse of his 
           cruiser, unscathed, just in time to see the Catering Van 
           disappear onto the streets of Los Angeles. God damn it...

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - LIFE GUARD STATION - NIGHT

           Sergei stares quietly out at the Pacific, waiting... Bill’s 
           WALKIE-TALKIE SQUAWKS, breaking the silence.

                                 WALKIE-TALKIE (IN RUSSIAN)
                        We missed. He’s headed your way.

           Bill tilts his head toward the sky...

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - BOARDWALK - CONTINUOUS

           Jimmy looks up and sees it: A SINGLE ENGINE PROP PLANE, still 
           climbing, coming this way. YURI’S PLANE. 

           Jimmy thinks about what Carl said: Trouble at the airport.

           He shifts his focus back to the pickup. Bill pulls the 
           military crate out of the bed. Sergei reaches inside and 
           pulls: A SHOULDER-MOUNTED ROCKET LAUNCHER!

                                 JIMMY
                        Hey... HEY!

           They don’t hear him. Jimmy reaches for his gun, but it’s 
           gone. Carl took it. Took his spare too. What the fuck is he 
           going to do?

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - LIFE GUARD STATION - NIGHT

           The plane is out over the water now. Sergei is tracking it, 
           taking aim. Finally, he pulls the trigger-- 

           SWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH! A brilliant orange surge and the rocket 
           lifts off, screaming toward the plane.

           INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS

           Yuri watches in horror as the rocket gets closer and closer--

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - LIFE GUARD STATION - CONTINUOUS

           BOOM! A FIREBALL in the air. Flaming wreckage crashes into 
           the water. Bill and Sergei share a proud smile. Then--
           WHAM! JIMMY HITS SERGEI WITH THE VAGRANT’S BASEBALL BAT!

           WHACK! WHACK! He hammers the Russian over and over again, 
           until he’s barely moving.

           A stunned Bill doesn’t waste any time. He abandons his 
           comrade, dives into the truck and SLAMS ON THE GAS!

           Jimmy LUNGES and grabs hold of the truck’s bumper. Somehow, 
           he manages to claw his way into the bed of the truck.

           THE BED OF THE TRUCK

           As the truck tears across the beach, Jimmy makes for the cab.  
           He puts his size 13 boot through the back window and reaches 
           inside. He gets his hand around Bills neck and squeezes...

           GASPING for air, Bill puts the pedal down to the floor and 
           AIMS FOR THE BOARDWALK.

           ON THE BOARDWALK

           VAGRANTS dive out of the way as Bill’s truck chews up 
           refrigerator box houses and shopping carts full of junk.

           Bill spins the steering wheel, left, then right, desperately 
           trying to shake Jimmy. But somehow, our hero hangs on.

           Now in dire need of oxygen, Bill spins the wheel one last 
           time. Jimmy looks up to see that they’re headed right for--

           ANOTHER LIFEGUARD STATION

           The armor-enforced vehicle CRASHES through it. The Station 
           EXPLODES, sending shards of wood and glass flying in all 
           directions. Jimmy hits the sand. HARD.

           He rises to his feet and dusts himself off, watching as the 
           truck disappears onto the Venice streets.

           All is not lost, however. Jimmy looks back toward the water 
           where...SERGEI is still laying unconscious. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           The place is buzzing. Phones ring off the hook. A livid Carl 
           spots Harris and Ramirez amid the chaos. 

                                 CARL
                        Where the fuck is Marino?

           The detectives can’t look him in the eye. Carl grabs Ramirez’ 
           tie, pulls him in close.
                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        I give you assholes ONE simple God 
                        damn task...

           Before Carl can really get on a roll, ATF Agent Gondoli 
           enters. Carl rushes right over to him.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Hold a grudge, kick me in the teeth 
                        another time. Shit’s hit the fan 
                        and I don’t have the manpower.                                                                                    
                        You said you wanted the lead here. 
                        It’s all yours.

                                 GONDOLI
                        Intel’s saying this is old world 
                        Russian shit. I ain’t touchin’ that 
                        with a ten-foot pole. I got kids, 
                        man. My men have kids.

                                 CARL
                        Jaspar--

                                 GONDOLI
                        --Way I see it, all the Ruskis are 
                        doing is killing each other. It’s a 
                        power grab. A changing of the 
                        guard. There’s a new sheriff in 
                        town. A bold one, no doubt...but 
                        that’s all we’re looking at. Do 
                        your men a favor and stay outta his 
                        way. The dust’ll settle in a 
                        coupl’a days.

           Gondoli heads for the door.

                                 CARL
                        I’m gonna remember this, Gondoli.

                                 GONDOLI
                        Figure it just makes us even.

           Gondoli exits. Frustrated and angry, Carl turns to Ramirez 
           and Harris.

                                 CARL
                        Find Jimmy. That asshole’s the only 
                        one who knows what’s going on. 

           On cue: BOOM! A GIANT MAN spills through the main door and 
           onto the floor. The entire station turns their heads to see--

           Sergei...his hands are tied behind his back with fishing 
           line. Jimmy limps in behind him, a savage smile on his face.
                                 JIMMY
                        You looking for me?

           MUSIC plays over the following:

           EXT. RED, WHITE & BLUE AUTO BODY - MORNING

           SWAT OFFICERS cautiously approach the fence line...

           INT. RED, WHITE & BLUE AUTO BODY - MORNING

           Suddenly, a cannister CRASHES through the window. BANG! Then 
           a brilliant FLASH OF LIGHT.

           The Lithuanians inside hit the ground, covering their 
           eyes/ears, as SWAT OFFICERS storm the garage.

           EXT. RED, WHITE & BLUE AUTO BODY - MORNING

           SQUAD CARS. FORENSIC TRUCK. PADDY WAGON. A cop convention.

           We find Harris in the crowd, smiling wide as OFFICERS pull 
           more WEAPONS CRATES from the garage.

           INT. RED, WHITE & BLUE AUTO BODY - REPAIR BAYS - CONTINUOUS

           A UNIFORMED OFFICER leads Ramirez into a REPAIR BAY.

           Inside is a perfectly reproduced LAPD SQUAD CAR. One of its 
           TIRES has been slashed open. It’s been stuffed full of 
           SILICONE. Ramirez’ jaw drops. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - VIEWING ROOM - DAY

           Carl and Banks stand awkwardly outside the interrogation 
           room, staring through the two-way mirror at Sergei.

           Banks looks to Carl. He almost says something. But then 
           Ramirez and Harris approach. A welcome distraction. 

                                 HARRIS
                        Auto shop was a gold mine. RPGs. 
                        Bulletproof glass. Armor plating. 
                        All sorts of official decals.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        They’re filling their tires with 
                        silicone. Makes’em virtually 
                        indestructible. 

                                 CARL
                        Shit. You’re telling me...
                                 HARRIS
                        Those Lithuanians are fucking 
                        artists. We found a mocked-up squad 
                        car that would even fool you.

           Jimmy limps over. 

                                 JIMMY
                        It’s been three hours. Get in there 
                        and knock him around.

                                 BANKS
                        We’re still waiting on the 
                        translator.

           Jimmy shakes his head. Damn it. He’s done waiting. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Carl is right on Jimmy’s heels.

                                 CARL
                        Quit screwing around. Wait for--

           Jimmy gets right up in Sergei’s face.

                                 JIMMY (IN PERFECT RUSSIAN)
                        --I know he’s behind this. I saw 
                        him. Different face. Same eyes. 
                        Tell them now, or I’m gonna let 
                        “Pink Shirt” over there fuck you in 
                        the ass.

                                 CARL
                        ...the translator.

           Carl is flabbergasted. Sergei lets out a boisterous laugh.

                                 SERGEI (IN RUSSIAN)
                        That is how we do things in Russia, 
                        but here you have soft stomachs.

                                 CARL
                        Since when do you speak Russian?

                                 JIMMY
                        Don’t worry about it...

                                 CARL
                        What’d he say?

                                 JIMMY
                        Says your shirt is gay. Figures you 
                        have a soft stomach.
                                 CARL
                        Oh, I’ll show him a soft stomach.

           Carl, sensitive about his pink shirt, gets up in Sergei’s 
           face. The Russian laughs again.

                                 SERGEI (IN RUSSIAN)
                        Idle threats. This queer is a 
                        Police Officer. He cannot hit me.

                                 JIMMY (IN RUSSIAN)
                        Yeah? Well guess what?

           WHAM! Jimmy smashes him in the face.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        I ain’t no cop...

           INT. POLICE STATION - VIEWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           WHAM! Banks, Ramirez and Harris watch Jimmy hit Sergei again. 
           Ramirez moves to stop him. Banks grabs his arm.

                                 BANKS
                        Just like the old days. Watch and 
                        learn, kid. Sometimes you gotta 
                        improvise.

           Harris is loving this. Jimmy does have his charms...

           INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           WHAM! WHAM! Jimmy wails on the Russian. Sergei just laughs.

                                 SERGEI
                             (thick Russian accent)
                        Yuri Petrov was just the beginning. 
                        You are all marked. Walking dead.

           Carl and Jimmy share a look. Of course, he speaks English. 

                                 SERGEI (CONT’D)
                        The Ghost. He’s coming for you.

           Carl’s eyes go wide. Jimmy smiles, vindicated.

           INT. POLICE STATION - VIEWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Banks’ heart skips a beat. Harris notices.

                                 HARRIS
                        Who the fuck’s The Ghost?

           Banks ignores her, speeding off, into--
           INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Just as Banks steps in-- 

                                 CARL
                        You’re telling me Vitale Romanovski 
                        is alive? He’s back in the States? 

           Sergei stares back at Carl, confidently, defiantly.

                                 BANKS
                        Bullshit. Romanovski was gunned 
                        down in Lensk six years ago.

                                 JIMMY
                        I went to Lensk. There was no body. 

           Carl’s not sure what to believe.

                                 CARL
                        Why come back after all these 
                        years? Why make all this noise?

                                 SERGEI
                        He has...unfinished business.

           Sergei smiles wryly. It makes Carl’s skin crawl.

           INT. POLICE STATION - CARL’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Carl and Jimmy sit with Ramirez and Harris. Banks steps in.

                                 JIMMY
                        Bout twelve years ago, Vitale 
                        Romanovski and his brother Ivan 
                        rolled into Los Angeles and set up 
                        their very own Little Odessa. 

                                 CARL
                        Assholes wanted to take over 
                        everything. Girls, weapons, drugs. 
                        So they started a war. With 
                        everyone.

                                 JIMMY
                        Mexicans. Blacks. Armenians. 
                        Chinese. Motherfuckers mowed down 
                        anyone who got in their way. 

                                 CARL
                        Me. The Lieutenant. Jim. Another 
                        detective, Chester Grimes. We ran 
                        this Eurasian Task Force. Got stuck 
                        refereeing a God damn blood bath.
                                 HARRIS
                        So why’s the fuck still standing?

           Carl and Jimmy share a sober look. Banks finally steps up.

                                 CARL
                        Ivan’s in a cage at Lancaster. 
                        Vitale got away.

                                 BANKS
                        Until the FSB shot him dead.

           Jimmy ignores Banks, hands Ramirez and Harris an old PICTURE 
           of Vitale.

                                 HARRIS
                        Ugly motherfucker.

                                 JIMMY
                        He’s older. Obviously had some 
                        plastic surgery. But it’s more than 
                        that. Guy just looked...I don’t 
                        know. Frail. Sick. He was coughing 
                        up blood.

           Banks turns to Jimmy, he’s not buying a word of it. And his 
           tone is more than a little condescending. 

                                 BANKS
                        Let’s get you with a sketch artist, 
                        get his face out there.

                                 JIMMY
                        It was dark. Guns blazing. People 
                        screaming...

                                 BANKS
                        You were drunk!

           Jimmy wants to argue, but he can’t...

                                 BANKS (CONT’D)
                        Come on, Carl. You can’t really be 
                        swallowing this bullsh--

                                 CARL
                        --That’s enough, Lieutenant!

           Banks reluctantly backs off. Harris and Ramirez share a look.

                                 HARRIS
                        Let’s get back in there, beat on 
                        the Russian some more. I’m sure he--
                                 JIMMY
                        --We got all we’re gonna get outta 
                        Sergei. You see those stars on his 
                        knees?

                                 HARRIS
                        I love a guy with ink...

                                 CARL
                        Means he’s a bad motherfucker. 
                        Lives by a code.

                                 JIMMY
                        You could light him on fire and he 
                        wouldn’t tell you the sky is blue. 
                        He did time in the Artic Circle. 
                        Pelican Bay’ll be a vacation.
                             (a beat)
                        He only told us what Vitale wants 
                        us to know. He’s fucking with us.

           Carl gets serious, demanding the young detectives’ attention.

                                 CARL 
                        Look, when Jim said they took down 
                        anyone who got in their way, he 
                        wasn’t kiddin’. These guys don’t 
                        discriminate. They’ll shoot you 
                        just to see if their gun works. 
                        They’ll come for your family, your 
                        friends...

           Jimmy sizes them up, then looks to Carl. 

                                 JIMMY
                        No. No way. Barbie and Ken skin 
                        their knees and her daddy’ll hang 
                        us by our balls.

                                 HARRIS
                        Fuck you, Marino.
                             (to Carl)
                        We’re in. What’s next?

                                 JIMMY
                        Carl--

           Harris looks Jimmy dead in the eye.

                                 HARRIS
                        --What’s next, old man?

           Jimmy smiles. He’s starting to like her.
           INT. POLICE STATION - MAIN FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           The entire crew is exiting the office. Banks approaches Carl.

                                 CARL
                        Guess we know why the Armenians 
                        were so quick to call a truce.

           Banks stares at him, incredulous. 

                                 BANKS
                        We go down this road and he’s wrong 
                        again...Mayor’ll have your badge. 
                        You know that, right?

           What Carl is about to say is hard for him...

                                 CARL
                        You need to go to Rosa. Keep her 
                        safe. I already got a couple unis 
                        on their way. He’s coming for us, 
                        Howard. All of us. 

           Banks shakes his head. He’s tired of arguing.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna take Jimmy, find Grimes.

           Banks stomps off. Ramirez and Harris approach.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        So, Jimmy. He was true blue?

                                 CARL
                        Best God damn cop I ever saw. 

           Ramirez and Harris look over to Jimmy with new perspective.

           EXT. CHESTER GRIMES’ HOUSE - NIGHT

           ADDICTS stumble in and out of a CRACK DEN, jonesing for a 
           fix. FIVE-DOLLAR WHORES attempt to flag down passing cars. 
           ONE of them brightens when she sees--

           Carl’s TOWN CAR pulls up in front of a RUN-DOWN HOUSE. Before 
           he can exit, she’s got her goodies stuffed in his face.

                                 CARL
                        Not tonight, doll.

           Jimmy glances toward the house and immediately draws his 
           weapon. We turn with Carl and see why--

           The front door has been completely BLOWN TO SHREDS.
           Carl pulls his weapon and cautiously approaches the porch.

           INT. CHESTER GRIMES’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The place is disgusting. A pigsty. Shades of Jimmy’s boat. 

           Jimmy moves down the hallway where a DOG lies still. It’s 
           been SHOT. He braces himself before entering...

           INT. CHESTER GRIMES’ HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jimmy inches toward the bed. He lifts the blood-stained 
           sheets to find--

           A naked DEAD WOMAN. She’s been shot three times in the face. 

           Jimmy closes his eyes, affected. Carl appears in the doorway.

                                 CARL
                        Chester?

                                 JIMMY
                        His girlfriend. 

           Carl bites his lip. Motherfuckers.

           INT. ROSA’S HOUSE - CARL’S OLD DEN - NIGHT

           Banks is drunk and upset, flipping through some paperwork. We 
           take a quick look--

           It appears to be a series of DOSSIERS. Pictures of hard-nosed 
           men, each accompanied by a full background check. It’s all 
           printed on HARRINGTON INDUSTRIES letterhead.

           Banks stuffs the dossiers into a FILE FOLDER and then makes 
           his way over to a VIDEO CAMERA sitting on a tripod.

           INT. FLAMINGO’S BAR - NIGHT

           Jimmy’s talking on a pay phone.

                                 JIMMY
                        Take a God damn cab if you have to! 
                        I told you we’d pay. Just get here.

           Jimmy hangs up and walks over to a table, where a frustrated 
           Carl snaps his cell phone shut.

                                 CARL
                        I had Ramirez and Harris pick up 
                        where we left off.
                                 JIMMY
                        You did a good job bringing them 
                        up. They’re sharp.

           Carl smiles like a proud father.

                                 CARL
                        Still can’t get Banks on the phone 
                        though. Asshole.

                                 JIMMY
                        I got a hold of some junkie 
                        Chester’s been hiding out with. 
                        He’s on his way over now, but he’s 
                        expecting to get paid.

                                 CARL
                        Everyone’a these assholes has 
                        wanted a handout and we don’t have 
                        a single lead to show for it.

           Jimmy pours a couple of beers...

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        How long’s it been since we had a 
                        beer together?

                                 JIMMY
                        Six years, easy...

                                 CARL
                        Lot’s changed...

                                 JIMMY
                        I go off the reservation. You and 
                        the battle-ax get hitched...

           This makes Carl smile. Jimmy too. 

                                 CARL
                        She always hated when you called 
                        her that.

                                 JIMMY
                        Me? You started it. And it stuck.
                             (a beat)
                        How the fuck did that even happen? 

                                 CARL
                        Rosa and I, we spent a lot of late 
                        nights together. Pourin’ over case 
                        files. Prepping her to send up 
                        Ivan. Lotta threats came her way. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CARL (CONT'D)
                        She was scared. She needed someone. 
                        I was just there I guess...

           Jimmy watches Carl closely. He sees genuine sadness in his 
           friend’s eyes. Carl eventually snaps out of his funk and 
           takes a look around.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        You always knew this day would 
                        come. Eight years, people telling 
                        you you’re crazy. But you were 
                        right, Jim. God damn it, you were 
                        right.

           The old friends lock eyes for a beat.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        And you did good. Learning the 
                        language, drinking in shit-stains 
                        like this, buddying up to commie 
                        lowlifes.

                                 JIMMY
                        These guys ain’t so bad. Yuri...he 
                        was like family.

           Carl shows genuine remorse here. He feels like he could’ve 
           done more for Jimmy. Should’ve done more. He takes a long 
           look into Jimmy’s eyes. He sees a man thriving on revenge. A 
           man with nothing to lose. It concerns him.

                                 CARL
                        You know... We’re gonna get this 
                        asshole and then life’s gonna go 
                        on. You gonna be ready for that?

           Before he has to answer, a strung-out JUNKIE enters the bar.

                                 JIMMY
                        Break out the cash. That’s our boy.

           EXT. MARINA - NIGHT

           Carl and Jimmy stumble down the dock. They’re both extremely 
           drunk. Extremely loud. They finally come upon Jimmy’s beat-to-
           shit BOAT. Carl barely recognizes it.

                                 CARL
                        Christ, guess a late night ride’s 
                        out of the question.

           INT. JIMMY’S BOAT - NIGHT

           Jimmy stumbles in, notices the time...
                                 JIMMY
                        It’s late.

           Carl pulls out his cell phone, checks the clock.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        You’re not gonna get any reception 
                        here. You need to check in with the 
                        Battle-axe, there’s a pay phone 
                        down the way.

                                 CARL
                        Nah... I’m good.

           Jimmy raises an eyebrow. Trouble in paradise. Carl clearly 
           doesn’t want to talk about it. Before he has to--

           The ALARM on Jimmy’s digital watch sounds. And despite his 
           lack of sobriety, he drops to the ground and begins a set of 
           drunken push-ups.

           Carl checks out some framed PHOTOS by the door. One shows 
           Jimmy and Cathy on this very boat. It was brand new then and 
           so were they. Newlyweds. Their whole lives ahead of them...

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        She never named this heap, did she?

           Jimmy continues his push-ups as he speaks.

                                 JIMMY
                        Nah. You know her. It had to be 
                        perfect. She never found it...

           Carl moves on to another photo--

           This one features a younger Jimmy, Carl, Banks and Grimes, 
           standing in front of Jimmy’s old house. Carl smiles. 

                                 CARL
                        Forgot what a pretty boy Chester 
                        was, back in the day... Ladies 
                        couldn’t keep their hands off him.
                             (looking closer)
                        And that tiny-ass house of yours--

           It finally hits Carl. He does a lap around the cabin, taking 
           everything in. He notices a blanket and pillow laid out on 
           the couch. Clothes. Food.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Shit... You’re livin’ here.

           Jimmy finishes his pushups, stands up.
                                 JIMMY
                        For a few years now...

           Carl is suddenly overcome with guilt. He never realized 
           things were this bad for Jimmy.

                                 CARL
                        What happened to the house? The 
                        pension? The savings?

           Jimmy motions to his COMMAND CENTER. The World Map with the 
           PUSH PINS marking the countries he’s visited.

                                 JIMMY
                        I’ve chased Vitale all over the 
                        world. Armenia. Prague. Israel. 
                        Ocean liner tip came from a 
                        smuggler on the Georgian border. 
                        Sonuvabitch took my last dime.

           Carl moves in for a closer look and finally stumbles upon--

           A PYRAMID-SHAPED WEB OF INDIVIDUAL PHOTOS, each with a note 
           card underneath, a “who’s who” directory of the 90s LA 
           underworld. The Ghost & The Wolf at the top...

           Next to it is ANOTHER PYRAMID. The guys that carved up the 
           empire once they where gone. Yuri and his Russians and a 
           whole host of other gangs: Armenians, Georgians, Albanians, 
           Chinese, Vietnamese, the list goes on and on...

                                 CARL 
                        Christ almighty...

           Beneath Yuri, are his Russian Lieutenants. We recognize many 
           of them from the Brothel massacre. They’ve been LABELED 
           DECEASED with RED MAGIC MARKER.

           Jimmy’s look is grave. He eyeballs the shot of Yuri and takes 
           hold of the RED MARKER. He tries, but he just can’t. Carl 
           takes the marker and labels Yuri as deceased himself.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Sergei was right. Yuri, you, the 
                        Armenians. That’s just for 
                        starters. Vitale won’t stop until 
                        he kills all these motherfuckers.

           Jimmy doesn’t doubt it for a second. A long beat.

                                 JIMMY
                        Look, Carl. For what it’s worth...

           Carl waits, expectant.
                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        All the bullshit. I’m sorry.

           Off Carl’s reaction--

           INT. JIMMY’S BOAT - NIGHT

           Jimmy’s on the couch. Carl’s on the floor. Passed-out, 
           catching some Zs.

           EXT. MARINA - CONTINUOUS

           THREE Masked, AK-47 wielding GUNMEN tip-toe down the dock and 
           surround Jimmy’s boat.

           One of the Gunman carefully boards the ship. Just as he steps 
           down on the deck...SNAP! 

           INT. JIMMY’S BOAT - CONTINUOUS

           Jimmy is wrenched awake by the Gunman’s blood-curdling 
           SCREAM! He reaches into his COOKIE JAR and pulls another 
           Patparine 9.2mm.

           Suddenly, an ALARM BLARES! SPOTLIGHTS FLASH on deck!

           Carl sits up, groggy, disoriented. Then--

           RAT-A-TAT-TAT! The screaming stops.

           EXT. JIMMY’S BOAT - ON DECK - CONTINUOUS

           ALARM still BLARING. LIGHTS still FLASHING. Jimmy and Carl 
           emerge from the cabin, weapons raised, to find--

           One of the Gunman is CAUGHT IN THE JAWS OF JIMMY’S BEAR TRAP.

                                 CARL
                        Jesus, man. What the hell is this?

           Jimmy turns off the alarm and checks the body. The Gunman is 
           stone dead. Shot several times in the face.

                                 JIMMY
                        They wouldn’t shoot him if he could 
                        be trusted. Vitale must be breaking 
                        in some new blood...

           EXT. JIMMY’S BOAT - ON DECK - MORNING

           Another crime scene. Harris is on deck, marveling at the 
           sight of the dead Gunmen stuck in the bear trap.
                                 HARRIS
                        That is badass. Where can I find 
                        one of these?

                                 JIMMY
                        My kinda girl... I know a guy in 
                        Vyborg. Get with me later.

           She smiles. Carl shakes his head. Ramirez approaches.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Dispatch has been trying Lieutenant 
                        Banks all morning. He’s M.I.A.

                                 CARL
                        Asshole. Rosa’s got a fund-raiser 
                        tonight. She’s probably got him 
                        pickin’ out tablecloths or some 
                        shit. Tell them to keep trying.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Check just came back. Gunman’s name 
                        is Pavel Rustev. He’s SpetsNaz. 
                        Former special forces. Got sent up 
                        for armed robbery in ‘05. Was 
                        released from Lancaster last month.

           Jimmy and Carl share a loaded look.

                                 HARRIS
                        That’s where Nazarian did his time.

                                 CARL
                        Interesting coincidence, Ivan 
                        Romanovski being a permanent 
                        resident and all...

                                 JIMMY
                        Looks like little brother’s calling 
                        shots from his five-by-five.

                                 CARL
                        Get in the car. We’re gonna drop in 
                        on his ass.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 

           Carl drives. Jimmy sleeps soundly in the passenger seat. The 
           car comes around a bend, finally revealing: CALIFORNIA STATE 
           PRISON at LANCASTER.
           INT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON - DAY

           The Guard Captain, JOE MASON (50s) leads Carl and Jimmy down 
           a dark, cold hallway.

                                 CARL
                        How’s the new gig treating you? 

                                 MASON
                        Hours are better. Consistent. Love 
                        the health plan. And all our 
                        animals are locked up in cages. I 
                        got a house out near Lake Fortune. 
                        Three times the size of what we had 
                        in the city. Truth is, I wouldn’t 
                        come back if you doubled my salary.

                                 CARL
                        Shit, I may put in for a transfer.

                                 MASON
                        After that ocean liner debacle, you 
                        may not have much of a choice...

           Carl shoots Jimmy a look. Finally, they reach the end of the 
           hall. Before Mason unlocks the door, he gets serious. 

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        Warden gets word of this, he’ll 
                        have my ass. You wanna set up an 
                        interrogation, you need him to sign 
                        off. That can take weeks... Do you 
                        really think Ivan’s wrapped up in 
                        all this?

                                 CARL
                        I know he is.

           A scary thought. Mason’s gonna help. They head on through the 
           door.

                                 JIMMY
                        Place don’t look like much...

                                 MASON
                        This is Administration. We house 
                        minimum security inmates here. 
                        Romanovski’s across the river. 
                        Maximum security compound. Spends 
                        twenty-three hours a day in a five-
                        by-five.

                                 CARL
                        What’d he do?
                                 MASON
                        Gutted some poor schlep out in the 
                        yard with a spoon. Thought the guy 
                        took his jacket. Turns out it was a 
                        different guy. He gutted him too.

           Jimmy and Carl share a look. Some things never change.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        He’s still got half the inmates 
                        doin’ his bidding though. Guards 
                        slipping him contraband. Life could 
                        be worse...

           Jimmy seethes. Carl pulls him aside.

                                 CARL
                        Look, you gotta promise me...we do 
                        this by the book. I can’t run with 
                        some half-crazed vigilante.

           Nothing. Carl pulls Jimmy close, looks him dead in the eye.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Promise me.

           Jimmy finally nods.

           INT. CAL STATE PRISON - MAXIMUM SECURITY WING - CELL - DAY

           A TEAM OF GUARDS forces Ivan Romanovski into a heavy-duty set 
           of wrist and ankle chains and drag him out of the fortress-
           like maximum security wing.

           INT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON - HALLWAY - DAY

           ARMED GUARDS lead Ivan into the less-menacing Administrative 
           Building.

           INT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 

           Carl and Jimmy wait impatiently. Suddenly, the door bursts 
           open and they are standing toe-to-toe with IVAN ROMANOVSKI.

           Jimmy bites his lip. The sight of this guy is enough to 
           enrage him. Ivan takes a seat. The guards file out.

                                 IVAN
                        Gentleman. Surprised to see you in 
                        one piece. After your little 
                        adventure last night... 

           Jimmy and Carl share a look. Just as they suspected. 
                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        Detective Marino... Well, it’s not 
                        Detective anymore is it? How’s your 
                        wife doing these days?

           Jimmy lunges at the Russian. Carl rips him back. Ivan smirks.

                                 CARL
                        Simmer down. You promised.

           Jimmy calms down. Carl turns to Ivan.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        We know your brother’s alive. That 
                        he’s back in the States. You’re 
                        gonna tell me why. 

                                 JIMMY
                        He’s sick, isn’t he?

           Ivan’s smile disappears for the briefest of moments. Jimmy 
           knows he’s onto something... 

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Too bad you’re rotting in here. I’m 
                        sure he’d love to see that pretty 
                        face of yours one last time.

           He’s getting at Ivan now. Carl pulls out his cell phone. 

                                 CARL
                        Give him a call. He turns himself 
                        in, you assholes can share a bunk 
                        bed again.

                                 JIMMY
                        How much time he got left?

                                 IVAN
                        Enough. He will watch you die.

           Satisfied to be back on the offensive, Ivan looks to Carl.

                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        Your friend, maybe he has nothing 
                        to lose. But the same is not true 
                        for you, Captain... Money. A 
                        career. A wife. Two-timing whore 
                        that she is.
                             (Carl’s steaming)
                        Can’t say that I blame her though. 
                        I’ve seen the heat these niggers 
                        pack. Truly humbling. Banks, he 
                        must have magnum in there, no? 
           Carl rips up in anger and starts pummeling Ivan. The Guards 
           outside charge in and peel him away.

                                 JIMMY
                        What happened to by the book?

                                 CARL
                        Fuck you...

           Ivan looks up defiantly. Lip split, eye turning black.

                                 IVAN
                        She gives a speech tonight, no? 
                        Wish I could be there. Perfect spot 
                        for another reunion. 

           INT. CARL’S TOWN CAR - DAY 

           Jimmy stares out the window, lost in thought, unhappy. Carl 
           is getting earful from his cell phone. 

                                 CARL (INTO PHONE)
                        What good’s a fundraiser if you end 
                        up dead? You gotta trust me here, 
                        Rosa. We find Romanovski and--

           CLICK. Carl got hung up on. Jimmy turns to him. 

                                 JIMMY
                        Motherfucker’s living like a king 
                        in there. That’s too God damn good 
                        for Vitale. 

           Carl is pissed and in absolutely no mood for arguing.

                                 CARL
                        This ain’t Death Wish. And you 
                        ain’t Charles Bronson. We get 
                        Vitale. We lock him up. 

           Jimmy decides now isn’t the time to push it. An awkward beat.

                                 JIMMY
                        Why didn’t you tell me? About Rosa 
                        and Banks...

                                 CARL
                        Shit’s complicated.

                                 JIMMY
                        Couldn’t keep your dick in your 
                        pants, could you?
           Carl can’t look Jimmy in the eye. He punches another number 
           into his cell phone.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        What’re you doin’?

                                 CARL
                        Callin’ in a favor.

           INT. ROSA’S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

           Carl leads Jimmy past a couple of UNIFORMED OFFICERS and into 
           the foyer of Rosa’s home.

           Carl removes his shoes and heads for the living room. Jimmy 
           follows, but doesn’t bother with his shoes.

           INT. ROSA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Rosa is on her cell phone.

                                 ROSA
                        Howard, baby. I need you to call me 
                        back. I’m starting to worry.

           INT. ROSA’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Carl looks back to Jimmy. 

                                 CARL
                        Look man, she’s gonna be pissed. 
                        Real pissed, so--

           Carl notices something. He’s instantly livid.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        The fuck you doin’?

           Jimmy has no idea what Carl’s talking about.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        You see how I took my shoes off 
                        before walking on the carpet? You 
                        ever stop and think there might be 
                        a reason?

           Carl points to the white carpet. It’s now covered in Jimmy’s 
           muddy footprints.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        That’s why, motherfucker! This look 
                        like a barn to you? How the hell 
                        you even manage that? This is L.A. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        You find the one puddle in the city 
                        and take a bath in it? 

           Rosa rushes over, her face red with anger. Carl stands on top 
           of the mud stain, hoping she doesn’t notice...

                                 ROSA
                        Mayor shut my fundraiser down. You 
                        happy now, asshole?

                                 CARL
                        I was just trying to protect--

                                 ROSA
                        --You ever go over my head like 
                        that again, I’ll rip your dick off. 
                        You cost me half a million-dollars 
                        in campaign contributions.

                                 JIMMY
                        Lesson learned, Battle-Ax. Next 
                        time, we won’t even bother. We’ll--

                                 ROSA
                        --I was elected because I’m tough 
                        on crime, Carl. Now you’ve got me 
                        hiding from it. Howard told me this 
                        piece of shit was back in your 
                        head. I didn’t want to believe it.

                                 JIMMY
                        People are getting blown to hell 
                        out there and you’re bitching about 
                        campaign contributions?!

                                 CARL
                        Jimmy--

                                 JIMMY
                        --No, Carl. Why are you even 
                        listening to this shit?! You were 
                        gonna eat lead tonight, lady. We 
                        saved your ass. Stop acting like a 
                        petulant brat and thank us.

           Jimmy’s crossed a line. Rosa’s ready to blow--

           EXT. ROSA’S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

           Jimmy walks out toward the edge of the pool. He looks down at 
           the water and takes a deep breath. It’s lit up, glowing 
           green. It relaxes him. Carl finally joins him. 
                                 CARL
                        What the fuck do you--

                                 JIMMY
                        --Don’t start. She’s not pissed at 
                        me. She’s pissed at you. So don’t--

           Something steals Jimmy’s attention, leaves him speechless. 
           Standing on the other side of the pool is--

           A MAN (38) - white and ghastly. Half of his face is deformed. 
           He’s obviously had acid splashed all over it. He paces back 
           and forth like a madman, clutching a 9mm, muttering 
           incoherently. Looks like he’s strung out on mescaline.

           The pool’s green glow has an eerie effect on him. As if we’re 
           suddenly in a horror film, face-to-face with a zombie. 

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Chester? 

           The Man locks eyes with Jimmy. This is CHESTER GRIMES. The 
           final player from the opening flashback. He touches his face.

                                 CHESTER
                        Not so pretty anymore, am I, Jimbo?

           Jimmy is floored. Just then, Rosa bursts out of the house.

                                 ROSA
                        My fucking carpet too?!

           She spots Grimes and stops dead in her tracks. A couple of 
           UNIs see what’s going on and rush out behind her, guns drawn.

                                 CARL
                        Stand down, guys. (re: Rosa) Take 
                        her inside. We’ll handle this.

           The Officers do as they’re told. Chester points the gun at 
           himself. He looks directly down the barrel. It would be so 
           easy to just end it.

                                 CHESTER
                        They shot my God damn dog, man...

           Jimmy approaches slowly, surely. Startled, Grimes points the 
           gun at him.

                                 CARL
                        Chester...

           Jimmy puts his hand up, quieting Carl.
                                 JIMMY
                        Everything’s okay here...

           Grimes drops his weapon, hugging Jimmy like his life depended 
           on it.

                                 CHESTER
                        They killed him, Jimmy.

                                 JIMMY 
                        It’s okay. It’s not your fault. 
                        None of this is...

                                 CHESTER
                        No. No, you’re wrong. It’s all my 
                        fault. Our fault. We sold our souls 
                        to the devil, man. And now he’s 
                        come to collect.

                                 CARL
                        Chester, what’re you saying?

                                 CHESTER
                        Me and Banks. Back in the day. We 
                        were working for the Romanovskis.

           Carl and Jimmy are speechless. What we notice, but our guys 
           do not, is the RED DOT from an assassin’s laser-sighted 
           rifle, dancing around on the wall behind them.

                                 CHESTER (CONT’D)
                        Dog and Pony. That’s what Vitale 
                        called us. Banks was obedient, he’d 
                        say. Useful... Me? I was just 
                        pretty. Pretty like a pony.
                             (he sits)
                        They were gonna kill me from the 
                        get-go this time. Said I’d become a 
                        liability. But Banks wouldn’t let 
                        them. Vitale needed him. He wanted--

           Just then, the red dot lands on Grimes’ forehead. Jimmy 
           immediately recognizes it--

                                 JIMMY
                        NOOOOO!!!!!

           BANG! A gunshot. Grimes’ head EXPLODES!

           As Carl reaches for his gun, Jimmy sees something: A GRENADE 
           rolls out from under the chair and comes to rest at his feet.

           With blinding speed, Jimmy dive-tackles Carl into the pool. 
           THEY PLUNGE UNDERWATER

           Carl’s eyes are wide, his cheeks bloated. Jimmy holds him 
           down. BOOOOOM! The grenade detonates! Debris rains into the 
           pool. Gunfire is exchanged in the distance. And then--

           JIMMY AND CARL BREAK THE SURFACE

           Gasping for air. But alive...

           INT. POLICE STATION - BANKS’ OFFICE - DAY 

           Carl hangs over Ramirez and Harris as they pour through 
           Banks’ files. Jimmy stews off in the corner, still rattled 
           from last night.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        If he was dirty...he hid it well. 
                        There’s nothing here.

           Harris slams a stack of papers on the floor, angry.

                                 HARRIS
                        Of course there’s nothing! Grimes 
                        was a smack-head. Fuck him!

           A KNOCK at the door. Carl opens it. Phyllis is on the other 
           side, unable to make eye contact. 

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Lt. Banks. They...

           MUSIC fades up and carries us over the following--

           INT. SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS - DAY

           Amongst the dense foliage is a crime scene. Banks’ body is 
           being loaded into a Medical Examiner’s van. 

           Carl has a tough time watching. Harris is struggling to hide 
           her tears. Ramirez has his arm around her, trying to console.

           But Jimmy is a very different story. He’s angry. Full of 
           purpose. He stands near the edge of the cliff, overlooking 
           the city. His city. Somewhere out there, the Ghost is hiding.

                                 JIMMY
                        I’m gonna fucking kill him, Carl.

           INT. CITY HALL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Carl walks down the hallway, somber. IGNORANT PEOPLE 
           cheerfully greet him.
           Carl peers inside ROSA’S OFFICE, sees her laughing with one 
           of her AIDES. He takes a deep breath and heads inside...

           We don’t hear what he says. We just see the blood drain from 
           Rosa’s face. She grabs onto Carl and clings to him for dear 
           life. And the MUSIC fades out...

           INT. MORGUE - DAY 

           Carl looks over Banks’ corpse. There’s a visible blood stain 
           on his crotch and all down his pant leg. It triggers horrible 
           memories. Jimmy and the opening flashback.

           ACROSS THE ROOM

           Jimmy examines some items laid out on a table. He turns to 
           the KOREAN MORTICIAN.

                                 JIMMY
                        All this stuff, he had it on him?

                                 MORTICIAN
                        All his. No Badge. No gun, though.

           Jimmy takes hold of something on the table and smiles 
           knowingly. Just then--

                                 CARL
                        Jimmy, come’ere...

           Jimmy heads over. Carl has hold of Banks’ wrist. There is 
           something written on his hand. A set of numbers: 10-27-08.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Looks like a date.

                                 JIMMY
                        He was trying to tell us something. 

                                 CARL
                        Ramirez! Harris!

           They step in. It’s hard for them, seeing Banks’ like this. 

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        October twenty-seventh, two 
                        thousand eight. I want anything you 
                        can find on the significance of 
                        that date. Anything involving the 
                        Russians, Banks. Us, maybe?

           Ramirez and Harris rush off. Jimmy finally hands Carl--

           A COLORFUL RUSSIAN TOKEN. We remember this one.
                                 JIMMY
                        Banks had this on him. You give it 
                        to the madam on your way into the 
                        brothel. It’s how she knows you 
                        paid. He was obviously plucked away 
                        before he could cash it in. 

                                 CARL
                        So, they take him out. Get him 
                        drunk. He thinks he’s headed in 
                        back for a blow job and Vitale’s 
                        sittin’ there waitin’ for him.

                                 JIMMY
                        Sounds like you weren’t the only 
                        one that couldn’t keep his dick in 
                        his pants. Romanovski must have a 
                        new place open.

           INT. THE NEW SPUTNIK - DAY

           Enrique Iglesias’ Hero softens the mood. Carl and Jimmy 
           enter. The DOORMAN approaches, moves to pat them down. Carl 
           flashes his badge. 

                                 CARL
                        Not today, friend.

           The Doorman puts his hands up and takes a step back.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Get the manager.

           The Doorman heads into a back room and we take a look around 
           the new joint. It’s a little cleaner, a little classier.

                                 JIMMY
                        New place is nice.

           Just then, they round the corner and see--

           A RUSSIAN in a TRACK SUIT is on stage, performing oral sex on 
           a FEMALE STRIPPER. Quite a sight. Carl shakes his head.

                                 CARL
                        Yeah...real Martha Stewart-type 
                        shit.

           Jimmy is suddenly tense. There’s just something about that 
           guy in the track suit. Jimmy pulls his gun and makes for the 
           stage. Carl is lost...

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Jimmy? What’re you doin’?
           What we see, but our boys do not, is NIKOLAY, the SCAR-FACED 
           BARTENDER from the old Sputnik, stepping out of a back room.

           He sees Jimmy and draws his weapon, instantly peeling off a 
           couple of shots: BOOM! BOOM! 

           Carl and Jimmy hit the floor!

           The guy in the track suit finally rips his face from the 
           STRIPPER’s crotch--

           It’s ALEXEI! Yuri’s old right-hand man. He spots Jimmy and 
           Carl and bolts for the back door!

           BOOM! BOOM! Nikolay just keeps firing at our heroes, not the 
           least bit concerned about who may get in the way.

           Carl attempts to return fire, but there are STRIPPERS and 
           PATRONS EVERYWHERE, SCREAMING and RUNNING for the exits!

           BOOM! BOOM! Nikolay fires off a couple more rounds and then 
           slips out back door himself! 

           Jimmy lumbers off after him. Carl grudgingly follows...

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        God damn it!

           EXT. THE NEW SPUTNIK - BACK ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Jimmy and Carl are a good ten or twenty feet behind.

           In seconds, the much younger Nikolay and Alexei scale the 
           fence at the end of the alley.

           Jimmy hits the fence and starts climbing. Carl’s too tired. 
           He stops, struggling to catch his breath.

           Jimmy eventually nears the top of the fence, but he’s having 
           trouble getting over.

                                 CARL
                        Get down off of there old man. You 
                        look like an asshole.

           Jimmy’s not stopping. Carl has to walk over and physically 
           pull him off. 

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        GET DOWN, JIM! They’re long gone.
           INT. THE NEW SPUTNIK - BAR - LATER

           A crime scene. HOOKERS and EMPLOYEES are carted off by 
           UNIFORMED OFFICERS. Patrons are being patched-up by EMS.

           We find Jimmy in the BACK OFFICE, looking for something. It 
           takes a good beat, but then...BINGO!

           Jimmy pulls an ASHTRAY out of the desk. It contains a lighter 
           and a pile of BURNT RED PAPER REMNANTS. He understands now.

           He digs back into the drawer and after a beat, he comes up 
           with it: THE RUSSIAN CHILDREN’S DECODER RING.

           INT. THE NEW SPUTNIK - BACK ROOM - DAY 

           A FORENSIC TEAM tears the place apart. Blood is splattered 
           across the white walls. A chair with rope restraints sits in 
           the middle of the room.

           Jimmy examines some items on a nearby table. He sees it and 
           winces...a sock filled with dirt. It’s soaked in blood. 
           Brings back bad memories. Carl approaches.

                                 CARL
                        Banks had bruises on his kidneys. 
                        Blood and urine in his drawers.
                             (Jimmy nods)
                        We found his gun and badge in the 
                        corner there. And check this out...

           Carl hands over a handful of unused BULLETS. Shells for a .38 
           with a DISTINCT RED TIP.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Armor piercing. Found a whole case 
                        of ’em over there. Different 
                        calibers. Guess we can leave the 
                        kevlar at home now.

                                 JIMMY 
                        Muff-diver used to work for Yuri.  
                        Guy with the scar was behind the 
                        bar at the old Sputnik the night of 
                        the raid.

                                 CARL
                        How the fuck he make it out?

                                 JIMMY
                        Someone tipped him off. Fifteen 
                        minutes before. Freaky-looking kid 
                        came in with a little red strip of 
                        paper. He used this to decode it.
           Jimmy shows him the DECODER RING. Carl remembers something.

                                 CARL
                        Little red strips of paper?

           INT. POLICE STATION - BREAK ROOM - DAY 

           Harris and Ramirez are at a table, armed with SMALL PADS OF 
           PAPER and rolls of scotch tape.

           Detective Rogers dumps 5 RUSSIAN CHILDREN’S DECODER RINGS 
           onto the table. 

           Carl and Jimmy enter with an EVIDENCE BAG containing dozens 
           of the strips of red paper taken from Garo Nazarian’s place.

                                 CARL
                        Everybody get a ring, don’t be shy.

           They all scramble to get a hold of them.

                                 ROGERS
                        Are we getting overtime for this?

           The detectives chuckle, eagerly awaiting Carl’s response...

                                 CARL
                        Yeah...fill out a slip...then shove 
                        it up your ass.

           INT. POLICE STATION - BREAK ROOM - LATER

           We move through the break room. Everyone’s hard at 
           work...taping, decoding, writing. A well-oiled machine.

           Ramirez tapes a red coded slip to his pad of paper. He turns 
           the dial on the decoder ring a couple of times and scribbles 
           something down on the pad. He then heads over to the next 
           table and hands it off to Jimmy.

           Carl hangs over him as he pours through stacks of paper, 
           translating the Cyrillic and writing up the English version 
           of each message. He finishes one up and smirks...

                                 JIMMY
                        “The Baba Yaga act stops now.”

                                 CARL
                        Baba what now?

                                 JIMMY
                        Russian Folkfore. Baba Yaga was a 
                        witch that kidnapped and ate 
                        children.
           Carl chuckles, understanding it all too well now. 

                                 CARL
                        Sounds like Nazarian...

                                 JIMMY
                        Then it says “Sputnik leaves the 
                        sky.” And there’s a date. The 
                        brothel massacre. This is the 
                        order.

           INT. POLICE STATION - CARL’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Harris and Ramirez stand by as Carl looks over a typed 
           summary of what’s been translated.

                                 HARRIS
                        The brothel massacre. Petrov’s 
                        plane. The tanks at the auto shop. 
                        Nazarian supplied the party favors. 
                        Vitale ordered it all.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Jimmy did a hell of a job here.

                                 CARL
                        Make sure you tell him that.

                                 HARRIS
                        One problem. Nazarian croaked too 
                        soon. Most recent message is a week 
                        old. Romanovski’s got something 
                        else brewing here... 

                                 CARL
                        What’d you find on 10-27-08? 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        It’s a dead end.

           Harris shoots Ramirez a troubled look. Carl notices.

                                 CARL
                        What is it?

                                 HARRIS
                        We called Mrs. Morris. She and the 
                        Lieutenant, it’s the day they...

           Carl gets it real quick. And it stings like a bitch.
           INT. POLICE STATION - BREAK ROOM - DAY 

           All the messages have been decoded. Jimmy’s still hard at 
           work, however, pouring over the translations. Suddenly--

                                 JIMMY
                        Holy shit!

           INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

           Carl’s working with Ramirez and Harris. Jimmy approaches, 
           notepad in-hand.

                                 JIMMY
                        What did the Romanovskis call Banks 
                        and Grimes?

                                 CARL
                        Their code names? (searching) Uh...
                        Dog and Pony?

                                 JIMMY
                        That’s what I thought. A couple of 
                        strips here. They talk about, “The 
                        Dog” setting up “a move.”

                                 CARL
                        A move?

                                 JIMMY
                        Yeah...it doesn’t get any more 
                        specific than that. And then there 
                        are two others...about “the Dog” 
                        providing “Shvenkas.”

                                 HARRIS
                        What the fuck’s a Shvenka? 

                                 JIMMY
                        It’s Russian slang, usually means 
                        “pin.” You know, like a campaign 
                        button or something...

           A beat. They’re close. Then, Ramirez has something...

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Could it mean...a police badge, 
                        maybe?

           Jimmy smiles. BINGO!
                                 CARL
                        You think that’s what Grimes was 
                        trying to tell us? Banks got 
                        Romanovski badges?

                                 JIMMY
                        The squad car in the garage, 
                        everything we’ve seen. Makes sense.

                                 HARRIS
                        How the hell could the Lieutenant 
                        get these guys legit badges?

           A long beat as Carl considers.

                                 CARL
                        The Reserve Officer Program...

           INT. POLICE STATION - RESERVE OFFICE - DAY 

           Carl emerges from the file room. He slaps a couple of papers 
           down on the counter in front of Jimmy, Ramirez and Harris.

                                 CARL
                        Order was processed a month ago. 
                        Eight badges for the Fall class.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        But we don’t have a Fall class.

                                 HARRIS
                        Jesus fucking Christ...

           Jimmy sifts through the paper work.

                                 JIMMY
                        Apps say half these guys are 
                        employed by a company called 
                        Harrington Industries.

           Carl looks to Ramirez and Harris. They get it.

                                 HARRIS
                        We’ll check it out.

           INT. ROSA’S HOUSE - CARL’S OLD DEN - NIGHT

           Jimmy’s set up shop here. He’s fully immersed in his work, 
           culling through the translated messages yet again. 

           Carl enters and takes a good look around. Banks’ full-on 
           remodel is almost finished.
                                 CARL
                        Plaid God damn carpeting. Asshole 
                        suddenly thinks he’s Ralph Lauren.

           Carl tries to hand Jimmy a beer, but he doesn’t even look up.

           Carl sets the beer down on the desk and heads across the room 
           where PLANS for Banks’ remodel are laid out on a WORK BENCH. 

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Look at this shit. Riding trophies? 
                        Guy never mounted a horse in his 
                        life. He was terrified of’em.
                             (a solemn beat)
                        Place used to be a God damn oasis. 
                        Now it’s just...

           Jimmy still isn’t listening. Carl finally calms down and 
           makes his way over to--

           The NEW PYRAMID-SHAPED WEB tacked up on the wall, behind 
           Jimmy. The Ghost and the Wolf are back on top. Nikolay, 
           Alexei, Bill, Nazarian...all the new players are included.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Harrington Industries was a dead 
                        end. Address on file with the city 
                        was just an empty warehouse down at 
                        the harbor.

                                 JIMMY
                        I know we’ve missed something here. 
                        The answer’s in this room. Banks 
                        left that number for a reason. He 
                        was telling us something. 

                                 CARL
                        Jimmy. October 27th, 2008. It was 
                        the day he and Rosa got together. 
                        That’s all. Shit was just one last 
                        fuck you.

                                 JIMMY
                        You’re wrong. Banks wouldn’t leave 
                        his friends hanging. He left 
                        something for us. I know it.

           Carl sighs indignantly. He shuffles around the room and 
           finally comes upon--

           That same FRAMED PHOTO of Banks, Carl, Grimes and Jimmy hangs 
           on the wall. It softens him.
                                 CARL
                        I’m worried about Rosa. I’ve never 
                        seen her like this. This funeral 
                        tomorrow, it’s gonna be hard on--

                                 JIMMY
                        --What’re you doin’ down here, man? 
                        Go up and tell this shit to her.

                                 CARL
                        She don’t wanna see me.

           Jimmy realizes his friend is really hurting here. He softens.

                                 JIMMY
                        Again. You’re wrong. Look, do you 
                        know what I’d give to have Cathy 
                        sittin’ upstairs right now?

                                 CARL
                        It’s not the same, Jim. You don’t 
                        understand.

                                 JIMMY
                        Cut the bullshit. Do you love her?

           Carl thinks about that for a moment.

                                 CARL
                        ...yeah. I do.

                                 JIMMY
                        Then nothing else matters. Life’s 
                        too short. You got a lot of shit to 
                        apologize for. Go upstairs. Get it 
                        done.

           INT. ROSA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Rosa lays in bed, writing on a legal pad. There is a KNOCK at 
           the door. She scrambles to wipe the tears from her eyes.

                                 ROSA
                        Yeah?

           Carl enters. She sits up, surprised to see him.

                                 CARL
                        What’re you doing?

                                 ROSA
                        Writing the eulogy.
                                 CARL
                        Rosa, honey. These guys are going 
                        to come for you and if you’re out 
                        in the open like that I can’t--

                                 ROSA
                        --I don’t give a God damn, Carl! 
                        I’m done hiding. I’m going to that 
                        funeral. And I’m going to say what 
                        I need to say.

           She means business. Carl isn’t happy, but he relents.

                                 CARL
                        I don’t want to fight anymore.
                             (a beat)
                        Look, I owe you an apology. I owe 
                        you a whole lot more than that. I 
                        won’t get there tonight, but...

           It doesn’t look like Rosa’s swallowing it. Carl backs off. 

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        It's getting late. I’ll be down on 
                        the couch if you need to talk... 

           Carl heads for the hallway.

                                 ROSA
                        Carl?

           He stops, steps back in...

                                 ROSA (CONT’D)
                        I’m scared... Could you just lay 
                        here with me?

           Carl is completely disarmed. He shuts the door and lays down 
           next to her. We roll on them for a long quiet beat.

           INT. ROSA’S HOUSE - CARL’S OLD DEN - DAWN

           The sun is starting to peek through the window. The beer Carl 
           left for Jimmy sits on the desk. Remarkably, it’s untouched.

           Jimmy hasn’t slept a wink. He’s clumsily banging on the keys 
           of a laptop, sifting through google search results on “10-27-
           08.” But he’s not finding a thing. After a beat, the alarm on 
           his digital watch SOUNDS. 

           Jimmy finds a spot over by the work bench. He’s about to 
           start in on his push-ups, when he catches a glimpse of Banks’ 
           renovation plans. 
           Plaid carpeting? Riding trophies? Carl was right. What a 
           fucking mess. But then something steals his attention. He 
           checks the plans again, just to be sure...

           He scans the room. His eyes ultimately fall upon that PHOTO 
           of the four friends. He rushes over and pulls it away from 
           the wall revealing--

           A WALL SAFE. Jimmy’s heart races as he enters a combination: 
           10-27-08. CLICK! It opens! Inside is a FILE FOLDER and a 
           PACKAGE.

           Jimmy rummages through the contents of the file folder 
           labeled: “HARRINGTON INDUSTRIES.” It contains the dossiers we 
           saw Banks examining earlier.

           We get a good look at them. One of the dossiers has BILL’S 
           (the guy who hired Jimmy to find Ileana) PICTURE ON IT! 

           Jimmy then takes hold of the package. Inside is a VIDEO TAPE 
           labeled: “TO CARL...”

           INT. ROSA’S HOUSE - CARL’S OLD DEN - MORNING

           Carl pops in the video tape and presses play. He and Jimmy 
           watch with bated breath.

           ON SCREEN: BANKS. Worked up. Scared. He stares into the 
           camera, looking his friends posthumously in the eye.

                                 BANKS
                        Hey, guys... God, I hope you’re 
                        still out there....

           Carl and Jimmy share a look. This is gonna be tough.

                                 BANKS (CONT’D)
                        Carl, I loved you like a brother, 
                        man. Rosa and I. I never meant it 
                        to happen. Sometimes, that shit 
                        just creeps up on you. For what 
                        it’s worth. I’m sorry. I am.

           Carl swallows hard.

                                 BANKS (CONT’D)
                        It’s about time I come clean with 
                        you... Vitale Romanovski. He didn’t 
                        give us the slip back in ‘01. While 
                        you were bringing in Ivan. Cryin’ 
                        over Cathy... Grimes and I, we put 
                        him on a plane.

           Jimmy bites his lip. He’s starting to relive everything.
                                 BANKS (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, Jimmy. Cathy... Man, we 
                        never thought it’d go that far...

           Banks is full-on crying now. Jimmy’s pretty close. Carl isn’t 
           far behind either.

                                 BANKS (CONT’D)
                        He popped up again. Said I had to 
                        make things right for what happened 
                        to Ivan. Promised to keep Rosa out 
                        of it as long as I played ball.

           Banks takes a long beat, catches his breath.

                                 BANKS (CONT’D)
                        They wanted badges. I didn’t know 
                        why until the next demand came, 
                        just a coupl’a days ago.
                             (a beat)
                        They had me make a few calls...an 
                        appointment for an LAPD contingent 
                        to visit the California State 
                        Prison at Lancaster. To interrogate 
                        Ivan Romanovski. They’re gonna bust 
                        him out, Carl. Those two assholes, 
                        together again...

           Carl’s eyes go wide. 

                                 BANKS (CONT’D)
                             (a look of determination)
                        You need to stop this. Put these 
                        monsters away for real this time. 
                        Put’em in the ground.

           ONSCREEN: Banks stands, approaches the camera and turns it 
           off. He disappears into the static. A ghost.

           EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - MORNING

           A PACIFIC BELL TRUCK is parked next to a TELEPHONE POLE. 

           We start a long 360 arc up and around the WORKER in the 
           CROW’S NEST. He raises a pair of BOLT CUTTERS. Just as he 
           CUTS THE LINE the camera reveals--

           CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON AT LANCASTER.

           EXT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON - DAY 

           An LAPD SQUAD CAR approaches the front gate, followed by two 
           heavy-duty LAPD VANS.
           EXT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON - DAY 

           The convoy is parked inside the prison walls. Bill, Nikolay, 
           and five THUGS in PATROLMAN’S UNIFORMS enter the 
           Administration Building.

           INT. THE FIRST LAPD VAN - DAY

           Alexei pulls a ski mask over his face. His breathing is 
           erratic. He’s obviously nervous. He and three other MASKED 
           THUGS lie in wait, armed to the teeth.

           INT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON - OFFICES - DAY 

           The faux LAPD posse approaches the GUARD desk, Bill leading 
           the way. He flashes a badge.

                                 BILL
                             (perfect English)
                        We’re here to see Ivan Romanovski.

                                 GUARD 1
                        Which one of you is Banks?

           Bill and Nikolay share a loaded look. A tense beat, then Joe 
           Mason (Carl’s Guard Captain friend) steps over.

                                 MASON
                        Banks is dead...

           Bill suddenly looks angry, flushed with emotion. He points 
           his finger down the hall.

                                 BILL
                        Asshole in there ordered the hit.

           It’s really an Oscar-caliber moment. Mason looks satisfied.

           INT. POLICE STATION - CARL’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Jimmy, Ramirez and Harris sit. Carl is on the phone.

                                 CARL
                        Thanks, Jaspar. I owe you one. 

           Carl hangs up the phone.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Gondoli made some calls. ATF’s 
                        gonna move him.
                                 RAMIREZ
                        How the hell does Vitale think he’s 
                        gonna bust his brother out of a 
                        maximum security lockup? It’s 
                        impossible.

                                 CARL
                        Impossible if he’s locked up in his 
                        five-by-five. Cell block is a 
                        fortress, but they’re gonna move 
                        him into the Administrative 
                        Building. There, all bets are off.

                                 JIMMY
                        Yeah. Only hard part would be 
                        getting inside.

                                 HARRIS
                        Crazy fucking cunts...

                                 JIMMY
                        Vitale’s taking his empire back. 
                        And he wants to hand it off to his 
                        brother before he dies.

           Carl shouts out onto the floor.

                                 CARL
                        Phyllis, how we doing?

                                 PHYLLIS
                        I can’t get anyone over there...

                                 CARL
                        What do you mean?

                                 PHYLLIS
                        I don’t know. It’s not even 
                        ringing.

           The Detectives are suddenly alarmed. Jimmy particularly.

                                 JIMMY
                        The funeral. They’re gonna do it 
                        today.

                                 CARL
                        Phyllis, Joe Mason’s cell phone 
                        number is in my rolodex. He’s a 
                        Guard Captain over there. Keep 
                        calling til you get him.
           INT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON - HALLWAY - DAY 

           Ivan Romanovski (eye still black from Carl’s beating) is 
           dragged in by a couple of GUARDS, all shackled up.

           INT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 

           Bill and his crew wait. The Guards finally bring Ivan in.

                                 BILL
                        Take his cuffs off...

                                 GUARD
                        You kiddin’?

           He’s clearly not. The Guards reluctantly unshackle Ivan. Once 
           they exit, Bill smiles.

                                 BILL (IN RUSSIAN)
                        Uncle...

           INT. SQUAD CAR - DAY

           Carl drives, Jimmy rides shotgun. The RADIO chirps:

                        Captain Morris?

           It’s Phyllis, Carl grabs the handset...

                        Jesus Christ...what took so long?

                        Phone Company says the lines are 
                        just a mess out there... I finally 
                        got Captain Mason on his cell. He’s 
                        standing next to Warden Tinsdale.

                                 CARL
                        Warden...having a little trouble 
                        out there?

                        Yeah. Phones. We’re working on 
                        it... You’re lucky I’m even talking 
                        to you after that shit you pulled 
                        the other day. 

           Jimmy and Carl share a smirk.

                                 WARDEN
                        Look, I just spoke with your ATF 
                        cronies--
                                 CARL
                        --Warden, I’m headed your way right 
                        now. ATF’s gonna meet me there and 
                        we can hash it out then.

                                 TINSDALE (FILTERED)
                        Yeah, I don’t have time for your 
                        bullshit. Gondoli’s got an order 
                        from the Governor. Romanovski’s all 
                        yours. What do you say I spare you 
                        the shouting match and just leave 
                        him with your boys here?

                                 CARL
                        What’s that?

                                 TINSDALE (FILTERED)
                        Your contingent. They’re in with 
                        him now. I’ll just--

           Jimmy’s eyes go wide. Holy shit!

                                 CARL
                        --Warden...crash the building.

                                 TINSDALE
                        What’s that now?

                                 CARL
                        Those aren’t cops! CRASH THE 
                        BUILDING! CRASH THE BUILDING!

           EXT. OPEN ROAD - DAY 

           Carl flips on the SIREN and his car tears out of frame. The 
           other squad cars follow suit. One-by-one. 

           INT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON - GUARD HOUSE - DAY 

           ANOTHER GUARD CAPTAIN turns toward his MEN.

                                 GUARD CAPTAIN
                        CRASH THE BUILDING!

           His GUARDS leap to attention. The ALARM SOUNDS: WHOOOP! 
           WHOOOP! It continues over:

           EXT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON - DAY 

           The MAIN GATE is closing. ARMED GUARDS flood the catwalks.
           INT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 

           Bill and his boys ready their weapons. Onto Plan B. Nikolay 
           puts a KEVLAR VEST on Ivan.

           EXT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON - YARD - DAY 

           Alexei and the other masked, AK-47 wielding Gunmen pour from 
           the LAPD van outside and enter the building.

           INT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 

           A CONCERNED GUARD rushes in to warn them...

                                 GUARD
                        They're coming in!

           Bill draws his gun! BOOM! The Guard takes one in the face.

           INT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON - ADMIN BUILDING - DAY

           RAT-A-TAT-TAT! The Guards at the front desk are mowed-down. 
           Alexei and the Gunmen speed past them into the hallway.

           INT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           RAT-A-TAT-TAT! A gang of GUARDS are roasted as Alexei and the 
           Masked Gunmen scream down the hallway.

           They reach the door of the Interrogation Room and take up 
           defensive positions around it. Alexei heads inside.

           INT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONT.

           Alexei enters. Bill smiles.

                                 BILL (IN RUSSIAN)
                        Let’s move.

           EXT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON - YARD - CONTINUOUS 

           Alexei and the Masked Men come out first and fire at the 
           catwalks. RAT-A-TAT-TAT!

           Nikolay and the other Patrolmen trickle out after them. They 
           shield Ivan from the gunfire and stash him safely in the 
           middle van. Bill and Nikolay slide back into the patrol car.

           In the blink of an eye, everyone is packed up and headed out, 
           barrelling toward the fence.
           EXT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON - MAIN GATE - CONTINUOUS

           Bullets rain down from the catwalks and towers, but they 
           bounce harmlessly off of the Armored Russian vehicles.

           A GUARD pulls a SPIKE STRIP into the road, but the Russians 
           roll right over it... Silicone tires.

           Finally, with a brilliant shower of sparks and a thunderous 
           BOOM, the vans crash the main gate and fishtail onto the 
           highway. Bill’s out right behind them.

           EXT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON - YARD - CONTINUOUS

           A couple of Guards scramble into a CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF 
           CORRECTIONS (D.O.C.) SQUAD CAR and give chase.

           INT. CARL’S SQUAD CAR - DAY 

           Siren blaring, Carl and Jimmy are catapulting down the road. 
           A line of cops behind them. 

           BILL’S CONVOY roars past them, headed in the other direction. 
           Carl snatches hold of the Radio.

                                 CARL 
                        That’s them, God damn it!!

           EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Carl’s Squad car bangs a sudden and violent 180 degree turn 
           to go back after Bill. The other Squad cars follow suit.

           The D.O.C. car falls in behind them.

           INT. BILL’S SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Bill glances in his rear-view mirror, sees Carl and the boys 
           doubling back. He shouts into his walkie-talkie.

                                 BILL (IN RUSSIAN)
                        We’ve got company.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Carl and the boys sneak in behind Bill’s convoy. Very 
           suddenly, the D.O.C. car accelerates.

           INT. CARL’S SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Carl watches the D.O.C. car zip past and move for the convoy. 
           He screams into the radio.
                                 CARL
                        D-O-C, hold on now!

           EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The D.O.C. car pulls up along the driver’s side of the second 
           van. The GUARD riding shotgun hangs out the window--

           BOOM! BOOM! His rifle spits fire. No effect.

           Suddenly, the Van SWERVES violently toward him.

           The Guard is SMASHED between the squad car and the van and 
           finally spit out, flailing onto the road.

           Carl and the other LAPD boys veer suddenly left and just 
           barely miss him. Then--

           The Van SWERVES again. This time it HAMMERS the D.O.C. car. 

           The D.O.C. car launches off of the highway, flipping end over 
           end into the desert. 

           INT. CARL’S SQUAD CAR - DAY 

           Carl watches as the D.O.C. car bursts into flames. Jimmy 
           pulls the .38 from his ankle-holster and starts loading.

                                 CARL
                        That what I think it is?

           Jimmy smiles. We get a closer look at his ammo’s DISTINCT RED 
           TIP. Armor piercing bullets from the Sputnik.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        You asshole... Hold on.

           Carl steps on the gas. VROOOOM!!!!

           INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

           The driver sees Carl speeding up in his rearview mirror.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Carl pulls up along the passenger side of the second van. 
           Jimmy crawls out, sitting in his window, taking aim over the 
           roof of the Squad car. Before he can get a shot off--

           The van SWERVES towards them.
           INT. CARL’S SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Carl jerks the wheel and narrowly avoids contact, but Jimmy’s 
           hands come loose and he’s almost spit out onto the road.

           INT. RAMIREZ' SQUAD CAR - DAY 

           Ramirez and Harris. Their eyes go wide as Jimmy barely avoids 
           kissing pavement.

                                 HARRIS
                        Old man’s crazier than those 
                        Russians’ll ever be.

           INT. CARL’S SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Jimmy steadies himself. He leans back inside.

                                 JIMMY
                        TAKE IT EASY, GOD DAMN IT!

                                 CARL
                        QUIT YOUR BITCHING AND SHOOT!

           EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Carl zooms back up along-side the van, still being tailed 
           closely by Ramirez and Harris. Jimmy takes aim. The overly 
           confident Thugs taunt him from inside. Then--

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Jimmy’s armor piercing bullets burst 
           through the “bullet proof” glass, obliterating the Thug in 
           the passenger seat and wounding the Driver.

           INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

           The Driver SCREAMS IN PAIN and LOCKS UP THE BRAKES!

           EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           In the blink of an eye, the van drops from 90 M.P.H. down to 
           almost nothing, grinding to a halt.

           The three Squad cars tailing it are too close. It’s too late.

           INT. RAMIREZ' SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Ramirez stomps on the brakes. Harris braces herself.

                                 HARRIS
                        Fuck! FUCK! FUUUUCCCCKKKK!!!!
           EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! One-by-one the Squad cars PLOW into the van 
           and are immediately crushed in accordion-like fashion. 

           The van finally JACKKNIFES and slides several hundred feet 
           down the highway on it’s side, sparks spewing onto the road.

           All the good guys have left now are Carl and Jimmy.

           INT. CARL’S SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Carl points to the remaining Russian van and Squad car.

                                 CARL
                        One down. Two to go.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Carl’s squad car challenges the remaining van on the Driver’s 
           side. Jimmy leans out of his window, taking aim. When--

           The van’s side door tears open revealing IVAN and the AK-47 
           wielding THUGS inside...

           Ivan locks eyes with Jimmy. Jimmy boils.

           INT. CARL’S SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Carl looks over, sees the thugs preparing to fire!

                                 CARL
                        Get down!!!!!

           Carl turns the steering wheel violently right.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           RAT-A-TAT-TAT! Carl’s car is pasted with gunfire.

           It tears off the road, turning over in the air and finally 
           crashing on its roof.

           INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

           As the thugs cheer, Ivan turns to the driver, stone-faced.

                                 IVAN (IN RUSSIAN)
                        Tell them to turn around.
           EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY 

           We stand about 100 feet away from Carl’s overturned squad 
           car. Our friends are banged up, but it looks like they might 
           be okay. Until--

           Two sets of BLACK BOOTS step into frame in front of us.

           OVERLAP -- An Ocean Liner’s horn WAILS!

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           We hear a lot of activity from outside. Sounds like a busy 
           port or harbor. The HAIR-LIPPED KID (the one who warned 
           Nikolay before the brothel massacre) is crouched in a corner, 
           poking a DEAD RAT with a stick.

           Nikolay enters, fresh from battle and makes his way over to--

           Vitale. He’s working on an old-fashioned typewriter. He 
           doesn’t acknowledge Nikolay’s presence. And Nikolay doesn’t 
           dare interrupt. DING!

           Vitale pulls the page out. The paper is red. The type is 
           yellow. He finally looks up at Nikolay.

                                 NIKOLAY (IN RUSSIAN)
                        He’s here.

           Vitale takes a few breaths from an oxygen mask...

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

           A couple of GUARDS open the massive BAY DOOR and the faux 
           LAPD Van rolls in. Vitale charges over to meet it. With each 
           step he seems younger, more vibrant. Healthy even. 

           Ivan exits. He and Vitale exchange a warm embrace. 

                                 VITALE (IN RUSSIAN)
                        Brother...

           Eight years have separated these two. They take a moment to 
           adjust to the other’s new visage. A powerful silence. 

           Seeing Vitale in this weakened state is very hard on Ivan. 
           He’s quickly overwhelmed with emotion. 

                                 IVAN (IN RUSSIAN)
                        I never thought this day would 
                        come. You’ve risked everything... 

           Vitale raises his hand, dismissive. 
                                 VITALE (IN RUSSIAN)
                        I can die happy now, knowing you 
                        are free. Knowing you will be there 
                        to look after things. I only regret 
                        it could not have been sooner...
                             (noticing his black eye)
                        Your face...

                                 IVAN (IN RUSSIAN)
                        A gift from our old friends...

                                 VITALE (IN RUSSIAN)
                        They will pay soon enough. 

           Ivan shakes his head. 

                                 IVAN
                        They will pay now. 

           Bill and a couple of RUSSIAN GOONS, pull Carl and Jimmy from 
           the back of the van and spill them onto the warehouse floor.

           Jimmy and Vitale share a long, loaded look. Carl can’t 
           believe it. He’s looking at a ghost... 

           You couldn’t sandblast the smile off Vitale’s face. But 
           Nikolay looks particularly nervous.

                                 NIKOLAY (IN RUSSIAN)
                        We can’t stay here. Nazarian’s 
                        mercenaries are in custody. Those 
                        aren’t our men. Someone will talk.

                                 VITALE
                        Then we’ll have to make it quick...

           OVERLAP -- RUSSIAN MUSIC CRACKLES from an old boom box.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER

           Carl and Jimmy are tied to chairs in the center of the room.

           Vitale sings along with the music, clapping his hands and 
           hopping around them. He’s been waiting for this moment so 
           long, it seems to have driven him mad.

           Ivan, having traded in his prison-issue orange jumpsuit for 
           street clothes, is having the time of his life.

           The Hair-lipped Kid limps up to Carl and starts rummaging 
           through his pockets. Carl jerks and squirms, but it’s no use. 
           The Hair-lipped Kid gets a hold of his wallet. He liberates a 
           wad of twenties from it. Vitale pulls him away.
                                 VITALE
                        My toolbox. Bring it to me.

           The Hair-lipped kid scurries off. Bill approaches.

                                 BILL
                        It’s time.

           Vitale hands Bill the RED SLIP OF PAPER he typed up earlier.

                                 VITALE (IN RUSSIAN)
                        Make me proud...

           NIKOLAY approaches with a LONG RIFLE CASE.

                                 NIKOLAY (IN RUSSIAN)
                        You need to wrap this up. The 
                        police will come.

           Vitale looks to Ivan and smirks. 

                                 VITALE (IN RUSSIAN)
                        He worries too much. 

           Nikolay shakes his head and reluctantly follows Bill over to 
           the faux LAPD Van.

           As the Van rolls out, the Hair-lipped kid approaches with the 
           TOOLBOX. But Vitale isn’t quite ready for it.

                                 VITALE (CONT’D)
                        When the doctors first discovered 
                        my illness, they gave me only three 
                        months to live... Three months, 
                        James! I had always taken life for 
                        granted. I thought I had all the 
                        time in the world. But now they 
                        were telling me that wasn’t so.
                             (a labored breath)
                        I had so much left undone. I sulked 
                        for a while. Felt sorry for myself. 
                        But one morning, I woke 
                        up...changed. Energized. I looked 
                        at myself long and hard in the 
                        mirror and made a promise. I would 
                        not die until I was finished.

           Jimmy tries to keep cool, not wanting to give him any 
           satisfaction.

                                 VITALE (CONT’D)
                        That was four years ago, James. For 
                        four years, I have kept death at 
                        bay. My need to free my brother.

                        My need to take back what’s mine. 
                        My need to watch you die... This is 
                        what’s kept me breathing...

           Vitale turns to the Hair-lipped kid.

                                 VITALE (CONT’D)
                        Open it.

           The Hair-lipped Kid opens the toolbox, revealing: Ivan’s old 
           CATTLE PROD and a bloody, DIRT-FILLED SOCK. 

           Ivan takes hold of his deadly instrument, flips a switch and 
           listens as it HUMS TO LIFE. Music to his ears. He is THE WOLF 
           once again...

                                 VITALE (CONT’D)
                        You were so close that day at the 
                        docks, James. I watched you from 
                        the bridge of the ship.

           Jimmy’s eyes flood with hate. Vitale smiles.

                                 JIMMY
                        You’re lying.

                                 VITALE
                        You played right into my hands. I 
                        wanted you there. I needed you 
                        there. But I never dreamt it would 
                        work out as well as it did. 
                        Especially after Nazarian’s little 
                        mishap... My brother free. My 
                        enemies falling by the wayside. 
                        Soon, my empire will be fully 
                        restored. And I’ll owe it all to 
                        you...

           Jimmy shakes with absolute rage. Ivan steps out of frame, 
           headed for Carl and...FLASH-CRACK! Carl SCREAMS!

           MUSIC plays over the following:

           EXT. CEMETERY - GATE - DAY

           The FUNERAL PROCESSION pours through the gate, car-by-car. 
           The HEARSE is out in front. 

           EXT. CEMETERY - ROAD - DAY

           Rosa is one of many somber FUNERAL-GOERS stepping from their 
           cars. Press PHOTOGRAPHERS snap photos.
           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           A SERIES OF SHOTS:

           1. The casket is pulled from the hearse and carried by a  
           TEAM OF OFFICERS in their DRESS BLUES.

           2. A CATHOLIC PRIEST reads a prayer.

           3. BOOM! SEVEN OFFICERS fire into the air. The first seven 
           shots in a 21 gun salute.

           4. A TEAM OF OFFICERS removes an AMERICAN FLAG from the 
           casket and ceremonially folds it.

           5. BOOM! The Officers fire into the air again. Shots 8-14.

           6. The folded flag is handed over to Banks’ PARENTS.

           7. BOOM! The Officers fire into the air. Shots 15-21.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           Detective Rogers leans over to Rosa.

                                 ROGERS
                        Where’s the Captain?

           She just shakes her head. She has no idea...

           END MUSIC

           INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER

           Ivan lays into Carl. ZZAAPP!! Vitale gets another good whack 
           in on Jimmy’s kidney. Our heroes are in intense pain.

           Vitale pulls a handkerchief and covers his mouth. Soon, he’s 
           coughing up BLOOD again. The Hair-lipped Kid quickly moves to 
           retrieve something. 

                                 VITALE 
                        You ever stop and think, James, 
                        about how much different our lives 
                        would be, if you’d have just taken 
                        my money, like your partners did?

                                 JIMMY
                        Yeah. Because it really worked out 
                        great for them.

           ZZAAPP! Ivan sends an electric jolt down Jimmy’s spine.
           The Hair-lipped Kid finally returns with an oxygen mask. 
           Vitale takes a couple of breaths from it, then--

                                 VITALE
                        So many years wasted... You’ve 
                        given Ivan and I a happy ending. 
                        But you... Your life ends in 
                        tragedy. Instead of drowning in 
                        vodka on that floating coffin of 
                        yours, you could’ve lived the 
                        American Dream. Beautiful wife at 
                        your side. A home. A family...
                             (a beat)
                        When I kill you. No one will miss 
                        you. No one will care. It will be 
                        as if you never existed. 

           EXT. ROAD NEAR PRISON - DAY 

           The crash scene from the jail break car chase. Smoke. 
           AMBULANCES. POLICE CARS. FIRE TRUCKS. Something for everyone. 

           Ramirez, his face covered in blood, sweat and dust, stands at 
           the back of an ambulance. He watches an EMT dress the leg 
           wounds of a HANDCUFFED RUSSIAN. Something catches his eye...

           He pulls Harris close.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Check out his knees. 

                                 HARRIS
                        Douchey’s got a boo-boo.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Nah. Remember what Jimmy said?

                                 HARRIS
                        The bad motherfuckers have stars on 
                        their knees.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        This guy’s a lightweight.

           The two march purposefully over to the EMT.

                                 HARRIS
                        Hey, we’re gonna need to use your 
                        bus for a minute. 

                                 EMT
                        Excuse me?

           Harris jams her gun in his face.
                                 HARRIS
                        You got a hearing problem?!

           The EMT can hear just fine. He bolts.

           Harris and Ramirez climb up into the ambulance and we finally 
           get a look at the handcuffed Russian. It’s Alexei!

                                 HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        Improvise?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Improvise.

           Ramirez closes the door. Alexei SCREAMS in agony...

           INT. AMBULANCE - MOMENTS LATER

           Harris puts the keys in the ignition, flips on the siren and 
           slams on the gas. VROOOM!!!

           EXT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS

           The ambulance SQUEALS off. The back doors swing open and 
           Ramirez kicks Alexei out into the street.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Thanks. You been a big help. 

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           The FAUX LAPD VAN, Nikolay at the wheel, rolls to a stop near 
           the funeral service.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           The Priest is finishing a prayer. Rosa stands behind him, 
           staring nervously down at her typed notes.

           INT. FAUX LAPD VAN - DAY

           BILL opens the CASE and starts to assemble a SNIPER RIFLE. 
           Nikolay checks his watch.

                                 NIKOLAY (IN RUSSIAN)
                        It’s almost time...

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Vitale takes another deep breath from his mask. This ordeal is 
           really taking a physical toll. He pops a couple of pills then 
           peers down at his watch. He turns to the Hair-lipped kid...
                                 VITALE (IN RUSSIAN)
                        Turn on the television.

           The Hair-lipped kid flips on a small TELEVISION. Ivan turns 
           Jimmy and Carl so they can see it.

           ON TELEVISION: Local news coverage of Banks’ funeral. Rosa is 
           taking the podium.

           Carl and Jimmy share a desperate look.

                                 CARL
                        You stay the fuck away from her!

           Vitale shakes his head, so sad... TSK, TSK...

                                 VITALE
                        In Russia, if a friend beds your 
                        wife, to retain any shred of honor, 
                        you must kill them both. Friend and 
                        whore.
                             (he smiles)
                        But my brother and I, we have 
                        special place in our heart for you, 
                        Captain. You sit back and relax. 
                        We’ll take care of your dirty work. 

           Carl looks like a raging bull. We haven’t seen him like this.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           Rosa takes a deep, emotional breath and starts in.

                                 ROSA
                        All who knew Howard Banks knew that 
                        he was a man of integrity... 

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           ON TELEVISION: Rosa, continues her speech.

           In the distance, we hear a faint AMBULANCE SIREN over the 
           commotion of the docks.

           Vitale and Ivan relish watching Carl and Jimmy as they squirm 
           helplessly in front of the television. 

                                 CARL
                        You hurt her, I swear to God I’ll 
                        kill you. Doesn’t matter what 
                        armpit you hide under this time, 
                        I’ll find you.
           The brothers LAUGH uproariously. They’re so loud that they 
           don’t hear the rapidly approaching SIREN. Carl hears it just 
           fine though. Now he’s the one smiling. Ivan takes notice.

                                 IVAN
                        You think this is funny?

           Suddenly, GUNFIRE from outside! BANG! BANG! FRANTIC SHOUTING 
           FROM THE RUSSIAN GUARDS! SOMEONE SCREAMS. RAT-A-TAT-TAT! 
           RETURN FIRE! Ivan and Vitale turn to see--

           CRASH! Harris' ambulance barrels through the garage door!!!

           Vitale dives out of the way just in time but--

           Ivan isn’t so lucky. The ambulance SLAMS right into him!

           Vitale crawls back to his feet and heads for the back door.

           The Hair-lipped Kid stays frozen in his chair. If he’s not 
           terrified, then the freaky bastard just got his first boner.

           INSIDE THE AMBULANCE

           Harris sits in the driver’s seat. Groggy and disoriented. She 
           hit her head pretty good and took a bullet in the shoulder. 

           Ramirez is only in slightly better shape. He spills out and 
           stumbles over to Jimmy and Carl.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        You guys still breathin’?

           WITH JIMMY AND CARL

           They’re breathing, but just barely. Ramirez cuts them loose. 

                                 CARL
                        Took you long enough.

           Jimmy staggers to his feet, pulls Ramirez close.

                                 JIMMY
                        Give me your weapon.

           Ramirez hands it over. Jimmy heads for the back door.

                                 CARL
                        Jimmy! Wait!

           Jimmy turns, reluctant.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Kill his ass.
           Jimmy nods, limps out after Vitale. Carl turns to Ramirez.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Get dispatch on the phone. I need 
                        them making calls!

           POV - BILL’S RIFLE SCOPE

           Rosa is in the cross hairs.

           INT. RUSSIAN LAPD VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Bill stares through his scope, carefully readying his shot.

                                 NIKOLAY (IN RUSSIAN)
                        Take the shot.

                                 BILL (IN RUSSIAN)
                        It’s beautiful. Let her finish.

           EXT. CEMETERY - CONTINUOUS

           Rosa is amid speech.

                                 ROSA
                        There is now no doubt in my mind as 
                        to the existence of heaven. For no 
                        good and just God could call this 
                        man away to any place else--

           --RING! RING! Suddenly, a cell phone rings. Rosa looks up 
           from her notes, annoyed.

           THE CROWD

           Rogers scrambles to quiet his CELL PHONE. 

           THE PODIUM

           Rosa just re-finds her place in the speech when--

           --RING! RING! Another phone starts screaming.

           THE CROWD

           Another TALL OFFICER turns his ringer off. Just then--

           RING! BUZZ! RING! BUZZ! It spreads like wildfire. Dozens of 
           phones start ringing and buzzing in unison.

           The OFFICERS in the crowd look curiously to one another.
           THE PODIUM

           Rosa is floored.

           INT. RUSSIAN LAPD VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Nikolay is getting a really bad feeling about this...

           THE CROWD

           RING! BUZZ! RING! BUZZ! Finally, Rogers answers his phone. 
           Then another Officer does. And another. And another.

           After a short beat, one-by-one, every cop’s head turns toward 
           Bill’s faux LAPD van.

           POV - BILL’S RIFLE SCOPE

           All the Officers are standing, staring directly at him. He 
           doesn’t have a clean shot anymore.

           INT. RUSSIAN LAPD VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Bill turns to Nikolay, flabbergasted.

                                 BILL (IN RUSSIAN)
                        Get the fuck out of here.

           Nikolay fires the van up and slams it into gear, just as a 
           pair of LAPD cruisers roll in and block his path.

                                 BILL (IN RUSSIAN) (CONT’D)
                        BACK UP!

           Nikolay throws it in reverse and another LAPD cruiser 
           screeches to a halt behind them. 

           There’s nowhere to go now. Game over. As panic starts to set 
           in, Bill turns to see--

           A FORCE OF LAPD OFFICERS descend upon them. The van starts to 
           shake violently. Just as Bill and Nikolay shit their pants--

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Ramirez has the Ambulance door open, hovering over his 
           partner, terribly concerned. Harris is going into shock.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Come on, girl. Fight for that shit.
           NEAR THE OPEN BAY DOOR

           Carl hangs up his cell, wholly relieved. He shouts to 
           Ramirez, across the room...

                                 CARL
                        They got those motherfuckers in--

           Carl’s expression changes. Blood drains from his face--

           IVAN IS BACK UP ON HIS FEET, battered and bruised, but no 
           less ferocious. Ramirez is fighting tooth and nail to keep 
           him away from Harris, but it proves futile.

           Ivan palms Ramirez’ head and SMASHES it into the ambulance 
           door. Ramirez spills onto the ground, screaming in pain.

           The collision causes Harris to stir. Ivan wraps his massive 
           hand around her neck and rips her up out of her seat.

           He takes a moment to feel her breasts. It’s been eight years 
           since he’s seen a pair like this...

                                 IVAN
                        Pretty girl...

           And then, Ivan pulls out a SWITCHBLADE...

           WITH CARL

           Carl barrels across the room and lowers his shoulder into 
           Ivan. The switchblade flies from his hand and skips across 
           the floor. Harris falls, unconscious. Maybe even dead. 

           WHACK! To the stomach! WHACK! To the face! WHACK! WHACK! 
           WHACK! Carl lands one hit after another...

           Ivan just smiles. He feels no pain. He finally winds up and--

           DOOF! A brutal kick to the chest sends Carl sprawling.

           ACROSS THE ROOM

           The Hair-lipped Kid watches with wonder as Ivan descends upon 
           Carl. Then, something steals his attention-- 

           The SWITCHBLADE has come to rest right in front of him. He 
           smiles like a kid on Christmas.

           EXT. DOCKS - DAY

           Vitale works his way up a RAMP destined for the MAIN DECK of 
           an OCEAN LINER. It’s getting ready to set sail. A gaggle of 
           CHINESE SHIPMATES rush to their stations.
           Vitale peers through the CROWD to see...JIMMY, hot on his 
           heels. Vitale fires wildly: BOOM! BOOM!

           The Shipmates panic, SCREAMING and running, but...

           Jimmy doesn’t even flinch. Vitale disappears into the belly 
           of the ship. Jimmy’s right behind.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Ivan has both of his massive hands wrapped around Carl’s 
           neck. Carl struggles valiantly, but it’s no use. 

           ACROSS THE ROOM

           Ramirez staggers to his feet. He’s still seeing stars. But 
           the sight of his struggling Captain sobers him quickly--

           Ramirez knows he has to act fast. He reaches for his gun, but 
           it’s gone. Then he sees it...THE CATTLE PROD.

           BACK WITH CARL

           Ivan squeezes until it looks like Carl’s eyes are going to 
           pop from his head. With a thunderous ROAR, Ivan lifts Carl 
           into the air.

           It looks like the end, until: ZZZAAAPPP!!! Ivan’s eyes roll 
           back in his head.

           Carl hits the ground, gasping for air. 

           Ivan turns to see Ramirez, just about to jab the cattle prod 
           into his gut! ZZZAAAPPP!!! 

           Ivan staggers backward. Finally, something has an effect on 
           this behemoth. ZZZAAAPPP!!! Again! ZZZAAAPPP!!! And AGAIN! 

           Ivan vomits ferociously and drops to one knee. He can’t take 
           much more. Just as Ramirez moves to finish him off--

           THOOP! Ramirez’ face contorts. He looks down to see Ivan’s 
           SWITCHBLADE sticking into his leg!!! The Hair-lipped Kid is 
           right there, twisting the knife in deeper and deeper...

           Ramirez drops the cattle prod, HOWLING in pain. But he still 
           manages to KICK THE KID IN THE FACE!!!

           Ramirez turns back for the cattle prod, but it isn’t there. 

           IT’S IN IVAN’S HANDS! He drives the weapon into Ramirez’ 
           chest and: ZZZAAAPPP!!! The tide turns once again.

           Outside. The ship’s HORN WAILS. It’s getting ready to leave.
           INT. OCEAN LINER - CORRIDOR - DAY

           Vitale has a sizable lead. Jimmy bobs and weaves through the 
           crowded corridor, trying to get a clean shot... Finally, he 
           has it: BOOM! BOOM!

           But Vitale disappears around the corner just in time--

           PING! PANG! POOM! Jimmy’s bullets ricochet wildly off of the 
           metal walls, sparks flying everywhere. A CHINESE SHIPMATE 
           SCREAMS and runs for his life. Suddenly--

           A RUSSIAN GOON bursts from a CARGO BAY, AK-47 in-hand. Jimmy 
           grabs the barrel of the gun and YANKS it with all his might!

           The Goon stumbles forward, trying to keep his balance, trying 
           to reach the trigger. But he never gets a chance-- 

           Jimmy delivers a roundhouse kick that sends the Goon over the 
           railing and onto the floor of the ENGINEERING BAY below. 

           Jimmy turns to see THREE RUSSIAN THUGS charging toward him!!! 
           He takes the original Goon’s AK-47 and UNLOADS it on them!

           RAT-A-TAT-TAT! By the time the gun is out of ammo, all three 
           have gone down like bowling pins. 

           INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Carl, dazed and confused, climbs up a nearby HI-LO to get to 
           his feet. He sees Ivan descending upon a desperate Ramirez.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - DUSK

           Ramirez emerges from the warehouse, crawling on his hands and 
           knees. Blood pouring from his eyes, nose and ears. Ivan is 
           right behind him, cattle prod in hand: ZZZAAAPPP!!!

                                 RAMIREZ
                        No more. Please...

           Begging always did make Ivan smile. He turns the dial on the 
           cattle prod, drastically cranking up the wattage. It HUMS 
           electric death. The Russian winds up and--

           The HI-LO BURSTS through the hole in the bay door and 
           DEMOLISHES Ivan! He’s flung head-first into the water.

           The Hi-lo screeches to a halt at the waters edge. Carl’s 
           behind the wheel, a satisfied look on his face.

                                 CARL
                        Tell your brother I said hello. 
                        Asshole.
           INT. OCEAN LINER - ENGINEERING BAY - DAY

           It’s cold and dark...save for the ominous red glow emanating 
           from the massive BOILER powering the ship. Jimmy steps over 
           the Goon’s corpse and creeps in, 9mm drawn, when--

           CLA-CLACK! A gun cocks. Jimmy feels cold steel against his 
           temple. And then there’s that hacking cough. 

           VITALE. His hands trembling...

                                 VITALE
                        Party’s over, James...

           He pulls the trigger and: CLICK! Shit. Click. Click. Click. 
           He’s out of ammo.

                                 VITALE (CONT’D)
                        Oops!

           Jimmy grabs Vitale by the throat and JAMS his gun into the 
           Russian’s mouth, taking out some of his teeth in the process. 

           Jimmy’s waited eight years for this. He’s just about to pull 
           the trigger, but something stops him. He lowers his weapon.

           Vitale laughs like only a madman can. With blood smothering 
           the few teeth he has left, he looks like a devil.

                                 VITALE (CONT’D)
                        Everyone on this boat works for me. 
                        Get off while you can. Walk away 
                        and you and I are done. We both can 
                        live. Leave our fates to God.

           Jimmy opens up the chamber of his gun, and drops all the 
           bullets to the ground. 

           Vitale smiles. That horrible fucking smile.

                                 VITALE (CONT’D)
                        I always figured you for a 
                        reasonable man, Jam--

           WHACK! Jimmy smashes his fist into Vitale’s face. Vitale 
           stumbles backward, spitting blood. He looks up, fear-in-eyes.

                                 JIMMY
                        I want to feel you die.

           Jimmy’s never looked so focused. He grabs Ramirez’ 9mm by the 
           barrel and just starts pistol-whipping the shit out of 
           Vitale. WHACK! WHACK!
           Vitale falls to his knees. Jimmy starts pounding on him with 
           his fists now. WHAM! WHAM! Before the Russian can lose 
           consciousness, Jimmy rips him back to his feet...

           Jimmy looks into the cold dead eyes of the man who stole his 
           life. Vengeance is now his for the taking...

           Vitale knows the end is coming. He remains defiant.

                                 VITALE
                        I’ll send Cathy your regards...

           Jimmy’s eyes FLARE! He gives the Russian an absolutely 
           devastating boot to the chest! Vitale flips over the railing 
           and disappears into the fiery belly of the boiler.

           Jimmy stands there, listening to Vitale scream in agony, 
           huffing the stench of charred flesh. A beat and it’s over...

           EXT. THE BAY - CONTINUOUS

           The sky is an evil, fiery orange. Like the gates of hell have 
           just been opened up. SQUAD CARS flood the waterfront. An LAPD 
           CHOPPER hovers over the scene.

           We’re out in the middle of the overly choppy water, watching 
           as Jimmy emerges from the ocean liner.

           He limps over to Carl. The two friends share a loaded look. 
           The end of a long road. Then, something funny happens.

           The alarm on Jimmy’s digital watch SOUNDS. But this time, 
           instead of doing his push-ups, he yanks the watch from his 
           wrist and tosses it in the water.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. THE OCEAN - DAY

           It’s a beautiful, sunny day. We’re out over the calm, serene 
           ocean water, watching as Jimmy prepares his boat for a trip. 
           It’s been fixed up and repainted. It looks brand new. 

           EXT. JIMMY’S BOAT - CONTINUOUS

           As Jimmy puts the finishing touches on the motor, Carl 
           approaches, tackle in-hand, dressed to fish.

                                 CARL
                        Old tub’s looking good. How does 
                        she ride?
                                 JIMMY
                        You bring a suit? We may end up 
                        swimmin’ back.

                                 CARL
                        You know damn well I can’t swim.

                                 JIMMY
                             (smiles)
                        You single again?

                                 CARL
                        Hopefully not. We’re workin’ on it.

                                 JIMMY
                        Sorry to hear that. I was gonna 
                        introduce you to a nice Russian 
                        girl...

                                 CARL
                        Shit... What she charge?

           Jimmy laughs. Carl gets serious.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        You know, Jim. We turned some heads 
                        with this thing. Commissioner’s got 
                        me puttin’ together a new task 
                        force. I want you to lead it. How’d 
                        you like to get your shield back?

                                 JIMMY
                        Task force? I can imagine the 
                        assholes you’d stick me with.

           Just then, Harris approaches. She very gently helps Ramirez, 
           limping and all bandaged up, onto the boat.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Ouch! Slow down, damn it.

                                 HARRIS
                        Stop being a fucking pussy.

           Jimmy shakes his head and smiles.

                                 JIMMY 
                        It’s a hell of an offer. But I’m 
                        not sure I’m ready to decide what’s 
                        next. Not yet.
                                 CARL
                        Think about it.
                             (turns to Harris)
                        You assholes bring the beer?

                                 HARRIS
                        Cooler full of it. Need a hand 
                        carrying it though. Gimpy here 
                        ain’t worth shit.

           Carl is about to walk off with Harris, when he remembers 
           something. He turns back to Jimmy.

                                 CARL 
                        You know, I was thinking. The boat. 
                        You should name her after Cathy.

                                 JIMMY
                        Good idea. But you’re a little 
                        late...

                                 CARL
                        Why’s that?

                                 JIMMY
                        I already named her after you.

           We finally see it. The boat has been named: THE S.S. ASSHOLE. 
           Carl shakes his head.

                                 CARL
                        You asshole...

           Ramirez and Harris laugh uproariously. We pull slowly back 
           across the water and finally...

           FADE TO BLACK

           THE END
