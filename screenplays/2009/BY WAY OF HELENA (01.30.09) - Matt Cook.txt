           EXT. DOWNTOWN, HELENA, TEXAS, 1857 - MID DAY

           It’s a hot summer afternoon in downtown Helena, Texas.  
           Once a Mexican trading post, Helena is a center for 
           commerce along a major trade route.  The sign at the edge 
           of town reads: “un-Welcome to Helena - The toughest place 
           on earth.”  

           A dead mule smolders outside a blacksmith shop.  

           The air is full of dust, grime, and smoke.  

           Sickly Mexican orphans pick through a pile of waste 
           outside a saloon.  

           A drunk Cowboy pulls a prostitute by her hair down an 
           alley.

           Two bloodthirsty MOBS stand in the middle of a dirt 
           street lined with shops and brothels.  Fiercely opposing 
           each other, their contempt is fueled by the heat.  One 
           crowd is distinctly cosmopolitan, the other haggard and 
           worn. In front of them stand two men, the leaders of the 
           rival groups.  

           ABRAHAM BRANT (25) stands in front of the urbane crowd.  
           He is very tall, well over six feet, and his thin frame 
           is defined with lean muscularity.  Alopecic, he is 
           completely hairless, even devoid of eyebrows.  His bald 
           head and deep penetrating eyes give him a unique and 
           unforgettable presence.  

           His opponent, JESSE KINGSTON (37) stands in front of the 
           rough looking assemblage.  A man of few words, he is 
           short and squatty, with handsome features hidden behind a 
           thick beard and dozens of scars on his face and neck.  

           They square off between their respective posses and  
           escalate the tension.  Insults and threats fly between 
           the impatient mobs.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Good afternoon, Jesse.

                                 JESSE
                        Abraham.

           Abraham looks over Jesse into the crowd behind him and 
           smiles.

           CONTINUED:

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Looks like I’ve gone and got them 
                        all agitated.  

           His smile diminishes as he turns his gaze to Jesse.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Are you right with God, Jesse?

                                 JESSE
                        You know I ain’t got religion.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Do you not fear eternal hell?

                                 JESSE
                        I ain’t planning to see it just 
                        yet.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        You’ve got a lively bunch there, 
                        Jesse.  They reek of your 
                        inequities.  

                                 JESSE
                        They stink of a whole lot more 
                        than that.

           SAUL EPHRAIM (45) slowly exits a brothel and makes his 
           way onto the street.  The crowds grow quiet by his 
           presence.  He licks and folds closed a cigarette and 
           lights it.  

           He greets the two men with handshakes.  He is well 
           groomed, dressed in fine tailored clothing, medium 
           height, and is fidgety and sweats profusely.  He is pale 
           and his eyes are wet and burn red from sickness.

                                 SAUL
                        Good people of Helena. I am 
                        saddened on this day.  Because 
                        today Helena loses one of its true 
                        sons.  We have cleansed our city 
                        of Mexican filth but the infirmity 
                        left behind them has infected our 
                        civilities.  These heathen hordes 
                        push their carts through our 
                        lands, running wild as niggers and 
                        injuns from here to San 
                        Antone...yet you have turned your 
                        contempt towards one another.  
                        Instead of uniting against these 
                        irritations, we stand here 
                        divided.     

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           He looks upon the rival groups and a deep and angry scowl 
           grows over his face.

                                 SAUL (CONT’D)
                        This division ends now!  On the 
                        challenge given Abraham Brant by 
                        Jesse Kingston are we assembled on 
                        this resolute day.  In the form of 
                        a Helena Duel do we here decide 
                        who holds sway!

           The mobs point and curse at one another, cheering on 
           their leaders with macabre threats and taunts.  Saul 
           raises his arms and they grow quiet.

                                 SAUL (CONT’D)
                        He who bleeds the dirt most red, 
                        his deeds will not be forgotten.  
                        But make no mistake, he who stands 
                        at the end of this noble duel, 
                        leads with absolution.  He speaks 
                        my words, he commands my orders to 
                        all, and he answers only to me.  

           A beat.

                                 SAUL (CONT’D)
                        Gentlemen, prepare yourselves.

           Abraham and Jesse turn to their followers and strip down 
           to their pants.  Abraham’s skin is clean and unblemished, 
           his chest and arms defined with muscle.  

           Jesse’s body is scarred with knife and bullet wounds and 
           is caked with old dirt and sweat.  HARLAND (40) gathers 
           his clothes and pistol as he strips them off.

                                 JESSE
                        You got d’at buckskin, Harland?

                                 MAN
                        I do.

                                 JESSE
                        Give it me.

           Jesse takes it from Harland and tugs at it, testing the 
           durability.  

                                 HARLAND
                        Watch ya self, Jesse.  God made 
                        Abraham wid’ the devil at his 
                        elbow.

           Jesse ignores the warning.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 JESSE
                        Give me a pinch a baccey’. 

           Harland hands him a leather pouch full of dried tobacco 
           which he stuffs into the side of his mouth.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Where’s my knife?

           He hands it to Jesse who examines it closely.  It is old 
           and the three inch blade is covered with dry blood from a 
           previous duel.  Jesse thrusts it into the air and his 
           supporters cheer wildly.  

           Abraham turns to them with a menacing smile.  He holds up 
           his knife, examining it in front of them.  It is polished 
           and sharp and the short blade reflects the sun’s rays 
           back into his ghostly eyes.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Take care of my boy if I fall.

                                 HARLAND
                        I will, Jesse.

           Jesse turns to face Abraham and the crowds once again 
           grow quiet.  

                                 ABRAHAM
                        God made this world, Jesse.  And 
                        though he didn’t fashion it for 
                        everyone, it still pains me to 
                        send you from it.

                                 JESSE
                        That’s pretty talk Preacher, but 
                        hell ain’t half full wid’ men like 
                        you I dealt wid’ fore’.  

           Jesse releases a stream of brown spit from his cheek and 
           tugs at the buckskin.  

                                 SAUL
                        Come forward, gentlemen.

           The men meet at the center of the street.  Saul gazes 
           into each of their eyes approvingly.  He takes the 
           buckskin from Jesse and bounds the two men’s left hands 
           together tightly.  They each give it a tug to meet his 
           approval.  

           Saul takes them by the shoulder and spins them around in 
           circles.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (4)

                                 SAUL (CONT’D)
                        You shall pour out each other’s 
                        blood...and we will cover it with 
                        dust.

           He releases their shoulders slowly and creeps 
           methodically out of their way.  

           As soon as he is clear, Jesse thrusts forward, aiming to 
           gouge Abraham’s neck.  He falls short and cuts his chest 
           and arms.  Abraham takes it unflinchingly.  He jabs his 
           knife under Jesse right armpit lifting him into the air, 
           slamming him to the ground.

           Jesse is hurt but manages to gouge his knife into 
           Abraham’s thigh and calf.  He rolls from underneath 
           Abraham, contorting the giant’s arm, and momentarily 
           pinning it.  

           He thrusts his short blade into Abraham’s lower back, 
           searching for his kidneys. But Abraham is strong and 
           manages to free his arm.  Abraham looks down at his 
           bloody body.  A look of fascination stretches across his 
           face.  

           They move around in circles.  They thrust and cut one 
           another repeatedly for several seconds.  

           Finally, Jesse thrusts his knife into Abraham’s left arm, 
           losing hold of the blade as he tries to pull it free.  

           His hands are too bloody to gain a grip on the handle.  

           Abraham waits for Jesse’s attempts to retrieve the blade 
           from his arm, then cuts him several times severely.  

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I walk a path from which I cannot 
                        stray.  Today it goes through you, 
                        old man.

           The dirt below them has turned into red mud.  Jesse turns 
           pale, and continues with futile attempts to retrieve his 
           blade.  Abraham cuts him quicker and faster in more vital 
           places.  Jesse staggers from loss of blood.  Abraham 
           stabs him several more times, toying with him, studying 
           how much more his opponent can take.

           Abraham pulls him closely, turning Jesse towards his 
           followers.  He controls him like a puppet and displays 
           his control to the crowd, before stabbing his opponent in 
           the neck, severing his throat.  

           Jesse grabs the wound and gasps for air.  His body goes 
           limp and he slides down Abraham’s leg.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (5)

           Abraham cuts the buckskin with his blade and Jesse’s body 
           falls dead into the painted mud below.

           Abraham towers above all.  He is covered in blood.  The 
           tempestuous crowd watches quietly as DAVID (3) pushes his 
           way through the dejected mob.  He walks slowly up to 
           Jesse’s body and kneels beside it.  

           The heat and light of the cloudless day beats down upon 
           them.  Abraham pulls the knife from his arm and drops it 
           in front of the boy.  The child looks up to study 
           Abraham, but his face is hidden by the sun that sits high 
           in the sky directly beside his head.  The child squints, 
           but cannot make out the figure’s face.

           INT. AUSTIN, TEXAS, GOVERNOR LAWRENCE SULLIVAN ROSS’S 
           OFFICE - MORNING, 30 YEARS LATER

           ROSS (50) sits at his desk mulling over paper work.  The 
           top of his head is bald and shiny, the sides bushy and 
           thick.  He sports a long goatee and mustache and is 
           dressed in a black suit with a thick shawl around his 
           neck.  Behind his desk is an enormous map of the state of 
           Texas.  

           On his walls hang old pictures of him dressed in 
           Confederate Army and Texas Ranger uniforms as well as 
           pictures of Comanche Indians.  His military decorations 
           are framed and neatly placed around the room alongside 
           various military and Native American paraphernalia.  

           There is a knock on his door.

                                 ROSS
                        Yes.

           The door opens and THOMAS, a black butler dressed in a 
           tuxedo, escorts DAVID KINGSTON (33) into the room.  He is 
           tall, six foot, well built and handsome.  He is dressed 
           in a Texas Ranger uniform, very similar to the one worn 
           in the pictures of Ross.  He has long, shoulder length 
           hair and a thick, well trimmed beard.

                                 BUTLER
                        Mr. Kingston, Sir.

           CONTINUED:

                                 ROSS
                        Thank you, Thomas.

           Thomas closes the door and exits the room.

                                 ROSS (CONT’D)
                        Major Kingston, it’s a pleasure to 
                        make your acquaintance.  

                                 DAVID
                        Likewise, Governor.

           Ross moves from behind his desk and they shake hands.  He 
           digs through a box and pulls out two cigars.  He offers 
           one to David who accepts.  

                                 ROSS
                        They’re Dominican.

           Ross strikes a match and lights them.

                                 DAVID
                        Thank you, Sir.  It’s a fine 
                        cigar.

                                 ROSS
                        How long have you been a Ranger?

                                 DAVID
                        Ten years.

                                 ROSS
                        And you enjoy it?

                                 DAVID
                        I’ve never done anything else.  
                        It’s all I know, really.

                                 ROSS
                        You men distinguished yourselves 
                        honorably against the Cheyenne.  I 
                        am no friend to the Redman either.  
                        It was the Comanche in my time.  
                        Either or, a contemptible form of 
                        man.  Would you agree, Mr. 
                        Kingston?  

                                 DAVID
                        Perhaps.  Or perhaps they’re 
                        misunderstood, your honor.  

           David looks around the room at the pictures of Indians 
           and paraphernalia and medals.

                        I do possess a small sense of 
                        compassion for them, Sir.  

           A beat.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        But duty is duty.

           Ross flashes David a coy, fatherly smile.  

                                 ROSS
                        Duty.  What a word.  It holds a 
                        different meaning to the 
                        uninitiated, than it does to men 
                        like you and I.

           Ross pulls from his cigar and looks through David, losing 
           himself in thought.

                                 ROSS (CONT’D)
                        But eventually, the blood we’ve 
                        spilled turns us blind.  The war 
                        drums that pound deep within you, 
                        that give you a reason to wake up, 
                        will turn into the buzz of flies 
                        dancing on the eyeballs of 
                        dreamless men...men you sent to 
                        the far shores...under your 
                        knife... or under your command.  
                        It stays with you forever.

           A beat.

                                 ROSS (CONT’D)
                        My heart has grown numb as yours 
                        will over time.  There will be few 
                        in this world that you do not find 
                        contemptible.  

           Ross strikes another match to resuscitate his cigar.  
           David studies him through the thick smoke of tobacco.  

                                 DAVID
                        I understand you have a 
                        problem...with a dead Mexican.

           EXT. PRESIDIO COUNTY, WEST TEXAS - MID DAY

           A young MEXICAN MAN breathes heavily through panicked 
           tears as he runs through branches of scrub oak and yucca, 
           tearing his cloths and scratching his arms, feet, and 
           face.

           Ross flicks the ashes from the tip of his cigar into an 
           ashtray.

           EXT. PRESIDIO COUNTY, WEST TEXAS - SAME

           A loud shot from a high-powered rifle echoes across 
           Presidio County, Texas.  A dark pink mist explodes from 
           the head of the Mexican man as he falls dead into a 
           bundle of cactus.

           He passes the ashtray to David who flicks the tip of his 
           cigar into it.  

           EXT. PRESIDIO COUNTY, WEST TEXAS - SAME

           A bloated body of a 20 year old Mexican man floats in a 
           strainer of the Rio Grande face up.  It is presumably the 
           body of Calderon’s nephew. 

           Two Mexican soldiers jump into the water and drag him 
           from the strainer.  A platoon of angry soldiers quietly 
           watch them from the bank.

           He moves around his desk to the map of Texas.

                                 DAVID
                        What exactly is it that you want 
                        from me, your Honor?

                                 ROSS
                        There’s a town out west in 
                        Presidio, County, called Mount 
                        Hermon.

           Ross uses the map to emphasize the desolate location.  
           It’s in the far reaches of West Texas, near the Rio 
           Grande.  

                                 ROSS (CONT’D)
                        The bodies are all turning up in 
                        the same strainer of the Rio 
                        Grande.  Right here.  

           He points to a spot 5 miles southeast of Mount Hermon.  
           Ross walks back towards David and leans on the front of 
           his desk.      

                                 ROSS (CONT’D)
                        Major Kingston, have you ever 
                        heard of a man named Abraham 
                        Brant?

           David is visibly surprised and disturbed by the question, 
           but does his best to hide the sudden emotion.

                                 DAVID
                        Only foolhardy stories.  Tales 
                        once, from Helena, and the War.  
                        They call him the Preacher, I 
                        believe.  

           Ross smiles.

                                 ROSS
                        Do not be so quick to dismiss, 
                        Major.  I saw him once in Kansas, 
                        just before the war.  Some 
                        ranchers near Wichita were paying 
                        50 cents for every Red scalp 
                        brought in along the Chisholm down 
                        to the Red River.

                        One day I see Abraham ride into 
                        town on this beautiful, white 
                        palomino stained blood-black from 
                        the scalps hanging off his saddle 
                        and mane.  He led a dozen of the 
                        most severe looking men you’ve 
                        ever seen.  

           Abraham rides tall on his white palomino.  A DOZEN MEN 
           trail behind him as they move slowly down the street.  
           They are covered in filth and grime and dark scalps hang 
           from their saddles and horses.

           People in town stop and fearfully watch them ride by.  
           Abraham tips his hat to women and smiles at a young Ross 
           who stares intently as they pass by.

                        - A couple hours later I saw him 
                        again in the square.

                        He was preaching the word of God

                        spirit I have never heard since.  

           A young Ross watches from the edge of the square.  
           Abraham stands before an excited congregation in the 
           middle of a captivating sermon.

                        And as God is my witness, I saw 
                        him lay his massive hands on a 
                        gimpy teenage girl, curing her

                        and she walked?

                        All the way to church, Mr. 
                        Kingston.  He married her the next

                        I’m assuming he resides in Mount

           The wind pushes the curtains of the open window gently 
           into waves.  Fat rain drops speckle the window frame and 
           a distant thunder echoes through the room.  

           David and MARISOL (25), David’s wife, lie in bed covered 
           in sweat.  She is a beautiful Mexican woman, curvy, with 
           flawless light-brown skin and black hair.  Her big brown 
           eyes, though alive with passion, strike in everyone who 
           looks at her a sense of sadness.

                        when I’ll be back.

           They lie naked half covered in white sheets and pillows.  
           They caress and explore each other’s bodies as if it was 
           the first time.

                        where I’m going.  

           David lies in bed and watches as she combs her hair.  
           Their eyes meet in the mirror and lock.

           CONTINUED:

           Marisol walks out, dressed only in his shirt.  She wraps 
           her arms around him, momentarily burying her face in his 
           back.

                                 MARISOL
                        Can’t I come with you?  

           A beat.

                                 MARISOL (CONT’D)
                        I am coming with you.  I have to.  
                        I grow sick when you’re away from 
                        me.  

           He turns to her and pulls her hair away from her face.  

                                 MARISOL (CONT’D)
                        I won’t do it again.  I can’t.

           EXT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S HOUSE, FRONT YARD - MORNING

           David is clean shaven.  He hands a box of bagged sugar 
           and flour to Marisol, who packs it away neatly into a 
           wagon.  It is full of food and supplies needed for the 
           journey ahead.  

           ARGOS, their beautiful black and brown German Shepherd 
           sits inquisitively on the porch watching them pack, 
           before he notices Governor Ross has arrive. 

           David helps Marisol off the wagon and the couple meet him 
           in the middle of the yard.  Governor Ross is taken aback 
           by her beauty.

                                 DAVID
                        Governor Ross, this is my wife, 
                        Marisol.

                                 ROSS
                        Es un placer.

           She giggles at his use of Spanish and takes his extended 
           hand.

                                 MARISOL
                        El placer es mio.

                                 DAVID
                        To what do we owe the visit, your 
                        Honor?

           He shoots David an awkward look to which Marisol 
           immediately responds.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARISOL
                        Excuse me gentlemen.  I must 
                        finish packing and see to the 
                        horses.  Good day, Mr. Ross.

                                 ROSS
                        Buen dia, Mrs. Kingston.

           The Governor politely watches until she is out of range.  
           His face turns into a scowl.

                                 DAVID
                        Yes, she’s coming with me.  

                                 ROSS
                        This is not a good idea!

                                 DAVID
                        She understands what she’s getting 
                        into.  She’s a strong woman.  And 
                        it will be less conspicuous.    

           A beat.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        It’s just the way it’s going to 
                        be.

           Ross sees there is little sense in arguing.

                                 ROSS
                        Very well, Major.  I came by to 
                        urge caution.  Do not squat on 
                        your spurs for one moment.  
                        Abraham Brant is a mystic.  He 
                        makes the worst of the world look 
                        like a prayer meeting...and speaks 
                        in a way...a man would be a fool 
                        not to believe him. 

           David nods his head and responds with a grin.  

                                 DAVID
                        I will keep that in mind, your 
                        Honor.

           Ross sees the cynicism in David’s face and changes his 
           tone.

                                 ROSS
                        Do you have all of your possibles? 

           David turns to the wagon.  Marisol is watering the 
           horses.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 DAVID
                        We’re all set, Sir.

           Ross hands David a sealed envelope.

                                 ROSS
                        Report in to Fort Davis before you 
                        head south into Presidio County.  
                        Give this to Colonel Bedlow when 
                        you arrive.  He will extend you 
                        every courtesy.

                                 DAVID
                        Thank you, Governor.

                                 ROSS
                        Very well then.  Contact me as 
                        soon as you can.  

                                 DAVID
                        I will.

                                 ROSS
                        God bless you.  Both of you.

           They shake hands.  David watches as Ross walks off.

           EXT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S HOUSE, FRONT YARD - MORNING

           Marisol sits on the wagon waiting patiently to leave.  
           Argos basks in the sun, his nose to the cool breeze.

           INT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           All of the furniture is covered in sheets and drapes.  
           David opens his drawer and pulls out a box.  From the box  
           he pulls out a small knife, with a three inch blade.  It 
           is stained by time and the blood of his father that has 
           never washed off.  

           He examines it momentarily, searching his memory for that 
           day, before wrapping it in a thick cloth and burying it 
           in his satchel.

           EXT. OUTSIDE OF AUSTIN - MORNING

           Their wagon makes its way along a worn dirt road.  At the 
           top of a rolling hill, Marisol glances back towards 
           Austin, lying quietly in the distance.

           She bundles herself up in wool blanket as a chill breeze 
           cuts across her face.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Argos jogs in front of the horses, navigating their way 
           down the scenic trail.

           EXT. TEXAS HILL COUNTRY - AFTERNOON

           They move through the beautiful Texas Hill country.  The 
           trail is surrounded on all sides by lush rolling hills of 
           Elm, Oak, and Mountain Cedars that have turned the color 
           of winter.  Dried sage brush, honeysuckle vine and other 
           vegetation dot the country with countless brown and gold 
           colors.  

           David steers the horses and wagon along the trail as 
           Marisol draws him in her journal with a charcoal pencil.  
           She intensely studies his striking features, shading the 
           contours of his face and neck with her delicate finger.  
           She reaches and touches his smooth chin and cheeks with 
           the back of her hand. 

           Argos sleeps in the back of the wagon on a bundle of 
           blankets.

           EXT. TEXAS HILL COUNTRY NIGHT - NIGHT

           They make camp in a clearing next to a cliff.  A small 
           fire illuminates their faces.  Marisol rests between 
           David’s legs, resting her head on his stomach.  

           David stares up into the cold, starry night, listening to 
           her angelic voice as she sings a Spanish song a capella.  

           Argos lies by the fire, sound asleep.

           EXT. FREDERICKSBURG, TEXAS - DAY

           Their wagon moves along the trail past a sign that reads 
           ‘FREDERICKSBURG - HOME OF THE SOCIETY FOR PROTECTION OF 
           GERMAN IMMIGRANTS.’  

           INT. FREDERICKSBURG HOTEL - EVENING

           Marisol soaks in a hot bath, washing her  smooth skin 
           with a soapy piece of pumice.  David stands by the 
           window, staring out into the bustling street.

                                 DAVID
                        I like this place.  

           Marisol closes her eyes and takes a deep breath.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Me too.

           David turns and smiles at her.

                                 DAVID
                        Maybe after all this is over, we 
                        can come back...settle here.  

                                 MARISOL
                        Quizas. (maybe)  

           EXT. TEXAS TRAIL - MORNING

           As their wagon moves West, the landscape slowly begins to 
           change.  Thick fields of grass and shrub turn to rock and 
           weeds.  The rolling hills give way to sharp spurs and 
           cuts in short, jagged mountains speckled with juniper and 
           live oak.  

           EXT. TEXAS TRAIL - EVENING

           David and Marisol camp next to the Pecos River.  The 
           brown water flows with little energy, cutting slowly 
           through the West Texas desert.  The vegetation is sparse 
           here, the minerals in the sharp rocks glow in the cool 
           sand as the sun pushes to the edge of the sky.  

           Marisol sits on a blanket a few feet from the water, 
           petting a contented Argos.  She laughs as she watches 
           David fight to remove a small catfish from the hook of 
           his fishing line.  

           EXT. TEXAS TRAIL - NIGHT, A FEW HOURS LATER

           They stand on the bank looking out onto the river.  David 
           stands behind Marisol, wrapping her up warmly in a 
           blanket.  

                                 MARISOL
                        You smell like fish.

           They laugh as he puts his hands over her nose.  

                                 MARISOL (CONT’D)
                        Did your father teach you to catch 
                        them?

           A beat.

                                 DAVID
                        He wasn’t around to teach me 
                        anything.

           She pulls him in tighter.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Te amare’ por siempre, Marisol.

           EXT. FORT DAVIS - MORNING

           Snow drifts around the air as if it cannot find the 
           ground as David and Marisol pass through the gates of  
           Fort Davis.  Argos sits tall between them, studying the 
           new surroundings.

           A PLATOON from the 9th US Calvary maneuvers past them.  
           The soldiers stare at Marisol with an insatiable lust and 
           throw scowls at David as they ride by.

           The Davis Mountains lying west of the fort cast shadows 
           onto the rooftops of its wooden structures.  They pass 
           several depleted buildings: officer quarters, enlisted 
           quarters, storehouses, and a hospital.  

           As they pass a guardhouse a group of jailed, decrepit 
           APACHES holler at them and raise their fist through the 
           steel bars of the window.  David studies them 
           disapprovingly.  

           Outside a building with no name, several scantly looking 
           Mexican prostitutes wave at David and invite him in.  
           Marisol stares at them sadly.

           The camp is bustling with American troops and Mexican 
           workers.  The wagon finally makes it to the edge of the 
           fort and stops at a house designated:  COLONEL BEDLOW, 
           COMMANDER, 9TH CALVARY, FORT DAVIS, TEXAS.

           They are greeted immediately at the door by BEDLOW and 
           his wife, SARAH.  They both speak with heavy New England 
           accents.  

           INT. BEDLOW LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           They sit chatting in the living room.  A heavy set 
           Mexican maid enters from the kitchen and hands them all 
           hot chocolate.  

           Bedlow stands a head shorter than David, with a bushy 
           mustache and thinning hair.  He is heavy set and his 
           physical movements and jittery eyes give the impression 
           he is a bit mad.

           CONTINUED:

           Sarah is pretty but aged, with thick black hair and dark 
           blue eyes.  She too appears a bit off-kilter.

                                 BEDLOW
                        It seems you’ve brought with you 
                        the snow.

                                 SARAH
                        We can’t remember the last time we 
                        saw snow.

                                 BEDLOW
                        I take it the journey here has 
                        been tolerable.

                                 DAVID
                        Yes, Sir.  It has actually been 
                        quite pleasant. 

                                 SARAH
                                 (to Marisol)
                        How long have you two been 
                        married?

                                 MARISOL
                        Six years.  Though it feels we’ve 
                        been apart for most.  My husband’s 
                        duties keep him away too often.

                                 SARAH
                        Such is the life of a soldier.  
                        And how did you meet?

                                 BEDLOW
                        Easy Sarah, they have just 
                        arrived.

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t see the-

                                 MARISOL
                        -It’s okay.  My father was a drunk 
                        and a swindler.  He was left for 
                        dead after cheating at cards in 
                        San Antonio when I was seventeen.  
                        David saw him back to health.

                                 DAVID
                        It was not as noble as she makes 
                        it sound.  I-

                                 MARISOL
                        -As payment, I was betrothed to 
                        him by my father.  I did not 
                        object.

           She looks at David and smiles.

                                 SARAH
                        Arranged marriage?  How 
                        unorthodox.  But why should I be 
                        surprised by anything in 
                        this...country.  

           Sarah pulls out a handkerchief and covers her nose and 
           mouth with it.

           There is a long beat as they stare at one another 
           silently.

                                 DAVID
                        I have an official letter for you, 
                        Sir.  From the Governor.  

                                 BEDLOW
                        Wonderful!  Let’s speak in my 
                        office.  Ladies, excuse us.

           David and Bedlow politely bow to the women on their way 
           out.

           INT. BEDLOW OFFICE - DAY

                                 BEDLOW
                        The governor wired me before you 
                        arrived.  Your reputation proceeds 
                        you, Major.  You could do well for 
                        yourself in the Army.  Rid 
                        yourself of this Abraham Brant 
                        problem.  I know many influential 
                        men and with my recommendation-

                                 DAVID
                        -No thank you, Sir.  I’m a Texas 
                        man, not a federal man.  I’m 
                        afraid I’d find the Army uniform 
                        as uncomfortable as a wet blanket.

           Bedlow shows his displeasure.  He opens the letter and 
           begins to read.  His hands shake and his eyes dart around 
           the paper nervously.  David curiously studies his 
           expression, then his office.

           On the walls hang terrible oil and acrylic paintings of 
           Indians, Cowboys, and a portrait of Bedlow with some 
           children.  

                                 BEDLOW
                        My wife’s.  She can’t paint for 
                        shit, but it calms her nerves.

           He opens a drawer and pulls out a flask of whiskey.  He 
           pours it into his hot chocolate and takes a long drink.   

           He points to the letter.

                                 BEDLOW (CONT’D)
                        The Governor says that I am to 
                        begin making preparations to close 
                        this post.  

           He goes to the window and stares up into the sky.  His 
           lips begin to quiver.

                                 BEDLOW (CONT’D)
                                 (quietly)
                        You brought the snow.

                                 DAVID
                        Excuse me, Sir.

                                 BEDLOW
                        Thank you...God.

                                 DAVID
                        Sir?

                                 BEDLOW
                        Don’t you see, Major?  I’m dried 
                        up like jerky.  This land.  This 
                        fucking command.  It’s a gift of 
                        switches and ash...given to punish 
                        me...five years and no reprieve...

           He slams his fist on the table angrily.

                                 BEDLOW (CONT’D)
                        One cannot rule where there is no 
                        law!  Do you understand?  I could 
                        burn it all fucking down!  Then 
                        they would see.

           He calms himself and loosens his collar.  David studies 
           him apathetically.  Bedlow takes another drink to gather 
           himself.  He picks up the letter.

                                 BEDLOW (CONT’D)
                        You go to Mount Hermon.  Your 
                        punishment?  

           A beat.  

                                 DAVID
                        Can you tell me how far the town 
                        lies from here?

                        It is a one way trip.  

                                 DAVID
                        Sir, please.

                                 BEDLOW
                        The wrath of God lies sleeping 
                        there.

           David becomes annoyed.

                                 DAVID
                        Sir!  How far?

                                 BEDLOW
                        Three days!  Three days, Major.

           A beat.

                                 DAVID
                        The Governor assured me you would 
                        see that we are re-fit and 
                        provided lodgings for the night.

           Bedlow grabs a sheet of paper and begins to scribble.  

                                 BEDLOW
                        Take this to the Quarter Master.  
                        He will see to everything you 
                        need.  

           David takes the paper and turns to walk out.

                                 BEDLOW (CONT’D)
                        And Major.  Keep a close eye on 
                        your pretty brown wife while 
                        you’re here.  There’s a reason for 
                        the whores.  I have no doubt you 
                        saw them on your way in.

           INT. FORT DAVIS LODGINGS - EVENING

           David sits in bed writing in his black leather journal.  
           Marisol sits at the end of the bed, working the leather 
           of the saddles.  Argos sleeps curled up on the floor 
           below David.

                                 MARISOL
                        Mrs. Bedlow trembled when I asked 
                        her about Mount Hermon.  

           A beat.

                        She turned pale when I asked her 
                        about Abraham.  She said he was an 
                        evil angel...Strangely beautiful.

                                 DAVID
                        Pay no attention to the Bedlows.  
                        They’re mad.

                                 MARISOL
                        Still, I wonder what he looks 
                        like?

                                 DAVID
                        Like a man, Marisol.  

           A beat.

                                 MARISOL
                        Read it to me.

           She slowly stops treating the saddles as they lock eyes.    

                                 DAVID
                        Battle cries of native pride, the 
                        war drums beat today...

           Marisol moves to the window and blows out the candle.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Bullets cracking, cannons 
                        clapping, through thick smoke we 
                        parley...

           She blows out the candle on the dresser.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Vengeant fingers pull cold 
                        triggers, leaving dead along the 
                        way...

           She lowers the lantern on the desk and crawls into bed 
           embracing him.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Arteries hemorrhage and enemies 
                        pillage, for a waiver from hell we 
                        pray. 

           He blows out the candle on the night stand and the room 
           goes black.
           EXT. MARFA PLATEAU - MORNING

           David combs the horses as they drink from a stream 
           trickling down the wall of a short cliff.  Argos lies in 
           the shade of the wagon, licking a pile of thin snow.  

           Marisol finishes drawing a picture of a man that looks 
           astonishingly like Abraham.  David pauses to roll a 
           cigarette and stares at a cloud of smoke rising into the 
           winter sky, just south beyond the plateau.

           EXT. A MILE OUTSIDE OF MOUNT HERMON - DAY

           THREE MEN sit stationary on horseback on top of small 
           hilltop at the edge of long clearing.  David spots them 
           and pulls the wagon to a stop.  He watches them, his eyes 
           are sharp and piercing.

           EXT. A MILE OUTSIDE OF MOUNT HERMON - MINUTES LATER

           David and Marisol approach the three men.  Dressed in 
           fine clothing, they sit on new saddles and carry polished 
           rifles.  A look of suspicious alertness is branded on 
           their faces.  

                                 DAVID
                        Hello, Gentlemen.  

           They nod to him and tip their hat to Marisol.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        We saw the smoke.  Thought we’d 
                        see to some lodgings and rest the 
                        horses.

           Two of the riders, DALE and MONTE, look towards the man 
           in the middle for direction.  His name is ISAAC.  He is 
           the same size as David.  Clean shaven, there is nothing 
           extraordinary about him.

                                 ISAAC
                        There’s nothing out here, except 
                        the railroad.  What brings you 
                        this way?

                                 DAVID
                        No real reason.  Just the beaten 
                        path. 

           Isaac studies David.  He spits the chew from his cheek.

                                  ISAAC
                        You need to see the Preacher.  
           EXT. MOUNT HERMON STREETS - LATER

           Marisol and David follow the riders.  They pass HOOT’S 
           saloon at the edge of town.  TWO WOMEN sit on rocking 
           chairs on the front porch.  One of them, a beautiful red 
           head with fair skin, catches David’s eye.  They share a 
           moment before David sheepishly looks away.

           They continue into Mount Hermon.  It is moderately sized, 
           with pristine homes and establishments.  There is no 
           trash in the streets.  The people are well dressed, and 
           faintly scowl at the couple as they pass by.  Marisol 
           nervously grabs David’s arm.

           They stop in the middle of town at a white building.  
           MOUNT HERMON HALL is chiseled above the door.  Isaac 
           quietly escorts them inside.

           INT. ABRAHAM’S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

           Isaac leads them into Abraham’s study in the back of the 
           hall.  It is dimly lit, save for his desk, which glows 
           from the flame of two lanterns.  Abraham writes in Latin 
           into a large book.  Thirty years has aged him little.

           The three stand before him quietly.  Marisol becomes 
           noticeably distressed as she realizes her drawing is 
           distinctly similar to the real Abraham. 

           His eyes remain focused on his work.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Denique vos supervenio.  (Latin -
                        Finally, you have arrived.)

           He looks up from his pages and smiles at David and 
           Marisol as though he’s seen them before.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        We have guests?

                                 ISAAC
                        They’re seeking ‘temporary’ 
                        lodging.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Then they shall have it.  Welcome 
                        to Mount Hermon.

           He moves around his desk.  David extends his hand and 
           reaches into his memory for some familiarity.  The men 
           study one another, surveying the other’s mettle.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DAVID
                        My name is David Locke.  This is 
                        my wife Marisol.  

           Abraham smiles and kisses her hand.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I am Abraham Brant.  You’ve met my 
                        son, Isaac.  

           David and Isaac exchange neutral glances.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        He says welcome.

           Abraham throws Isaac a dissatisfied look.

           EXT. MOUNT HERMON STREETS - DAY

           Abraham escorts David and Marisol to their lodgings.  The 
           townspeople bow and wave to Abraham as they pass.  He 
           rides next to their wagon on his white palomino.  

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I am the town mayor and acting 
                        peacekeeper when there is need, 
                        but I am unfailingly the town’s 
                        ethereal counselor.  Tell me, are 
                        you a religious person, Marisol?

                                 MARISOL
                        I am spiritual, but I do not like 
                        religion.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Who does?  And you, David?

           David looks to Abraham and nods to Marisol.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        The Almighty mulls and portions 
                        his gifts in a manner peculiar 
                        only to himself, and he has saw it 
                        fit to bestow our town with good 
                        fortune.

           As they continue through town, citizens of Mount Hermon 
           step outside of their homes and shops to greet Abraham 
           and dubiously study the newcomers.

                                 DAVID
                                 (sarcastically)
                        It seems very hospitable.

           CONTINUED:

                                 ABRAHAM
                        You’ll find Mount Hermon has 
                        everything you need.  Blacksmith, 
                        doctor, apothecary...

           He turns to study David.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        You’re a drinking man aren’t you, 
                        David? 

           David shrugs his shoulders and glances at Marisol, who 
           stares intensely at him, gauging his response.  

                                 DAVID
                        On occasion.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        There’s a brothel on the edge of 
                        town full of fine...whiskey.  

           He turns his glance towards Marisol.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Though I doubt you need venture to 
                        the second floor of any bordello.

           Marisol breaks his gaze and looks away.  Argos appears 
           from the wagon and moves between David and Marisol.  She 
           grabs hold and hugs him.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        What is your dog’s name?

                                 DAVID
                        Argos.

           Abraham laughs and studies the dog.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        He must be faithful.

           They arrive at a house on the southern edge of town.  It 
           is a new cabin made of trunks of live oak with a front 
           and back yard and patio.  A small privy sits next to the 
           house in a small garden.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Here we are.  Unpack your plunder.  
                        If you need anything at all, do 
                        not hesitate. 

                                 DAVID
                        All we need now is some rest.  
                        Thank you, Abraham.

           CONTINUED: (2)

           Abraham tips his hat and bids them good night.  David 
           watches him ride off with a mixed look of bewilderment 
           and calculated emotion.

           INT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S CABIN - NIGHT

           The couple unpack their essential belongings.  A fire 
           burns in the bedroom adding to the light of lanterns 
           placed about the room.

           David feels around the walls and the windows.

                                 DAVID
                        There’s not even a draft.

           Marisol moves about the room rearranging things.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Are you hungry?  I can prepare 
                        something.

           She continues at her task, unresponsive.  She opens her 
           book and peaks at her drawing of Abraham.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Marisol?

           She shakes her head and does her best to hide her 
           anxiety.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 MARISOL
                        It’s nothing.

                                 DAVID
                        The house?

                                 MARISOL
                        No..it’s fine.

           He consoles her with a sympathetic smile.  She laughs 
           softly.

                                 MARISOL (CONT’D)
                        It’s just that...I get the 
                        feeling...like he knows us.

           David is surprised by her comment but does his best to 
           hide it and comfort her.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DAVID
                        No one knows us.  We’re tired and 
                        it’s been a long trip.

           David feels her forehead with the back of his hand.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You’re warm.  You need to sleep.  

           He pulls the sheets down and helps her into bed.  Her 
           eyes are heavy and tired.  She kisses his hand.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        We won’t be here long.  I promise.

           She nods and rolls away from him, closing her eyes.

           INT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S CABIN - MORNING

           David is up early.  Marisol lies in a deep sleep in the 
           same position as the night before.  

           David places a plate of food into the kiln and sets a 
           kettle of coffee on its surface.  He places a handful of 
           desert marigolds onto the bed next to her, along with a 
           note.

           EXT. MOUNT HERMON STREETS - MORNING

           David rides through the street orienting himself to the 
           town.  For the moment no one stirs.  He is alone with the 
           beautiful pink dawn.  

           The quiet is broken by the sound of hooves.  He rides 
           upon Abraham, Isaac, Dale, Monte, and THREE MEN wearing 
           very high-end, tailored suits and top hats, riding on 
           fine quarter horses.  It is obvious they are not from 
           Mount Hermon.

                                 ISAAC
                        What are you doing out here?

           David shrugs his shoulders and looks over the men.

                                 DAVID
                        Just riding.  

                                 ABRAHAM
                        How did you find the cabin?  Did 
                        you sleep well?

                                 DAVID
                        It was fine.  Thank you.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ABRAHAM
                        And Marisol?

           David studies his earnestness.

                                 DAVID
                        She’s a bit laid up.  

                                 MONTE
                        Ain’t that the dribblin shits?

           He spits.  David looks at him coldly, before brushing him 
           off with a slight grin.  He turns his gaze to the 
           strangers.

           A long beat as they measure one another.  Abraham smiles 
           at David.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Isaac, you go ahead without me 
                        today.  Mr. Locke is going to join 
                        me for breakfast.

                                 ISAAC
                        I thought we was gonna-

                                 ABRAHAM 
                                 (to the Strangers)
                        -Isaac will see to all of your 
                        arrangements.

           Abraham turns a fierce gaze to his son.   

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Happy hunting, Gentlemen.

           Isaac whistles to his horse and the group rides out.  

           INT. ORPHA’S DINER - MORNING

           ORPHA and her husband, HORACE, cook in the back of the 
           diner.  The room is filled with empty tables and chairs.  
           Abraham and David are the only patrons.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        You must forgive our friends, 
                        their charming qualities don’t 
                        come shining through right at the 
                        outset.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s alright.  I’m thick skinned.

           CONTINUED:

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I can tell.  You strike me as an 
                        accomplished man, David.  

                                 DAVID
                        I’ve managed to fool you, too.

           Abraham laughs as Orpha brings him a plate of food and 
           refills David’s coffee.  David nods to her thankfully.  
           She walks off unresponsive.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        But a man in search of something.

           David shrugs his shoulders.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        We’re all looking for something, 
                        David.  God, war, a home, 
                        ...revenge.

           David struggles not to react.

                                 DAVID
                        You don’t strike me as the type of 
                        man to hide his meaning in 
                        vocabulary.  

           Abraham smiles and nods.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Indeed.  

           David drinks from his cup of coffee, staring over the 
           brim at Abraham.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        So why are you here?

                                 DAVID
                        We became restless and felt like 
                        it was the perfect time to move 
                        on...head nowhere particular.  
                        Figured we’d know to stop when we 
                        got there.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Welcome to nowhere particular.

           David and Abraham share a subtle laugh.  

           Two men from the town, JEDIDIAH and CLEM, walk in and sit 
           at a table a few feet from them.  They stare coldly at 
           David as they pass.  Abraham catches it.

                        Not the warmest welcome I’ve ever 
                        received.  

                                 ABRAHAM
                        We’re all protective of our little 
                        oasis.  

           Abraham nods to the two men.  They return his greeting.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        So how long will you be staying in 
                        our quaint town?

                                 DAVID
                        Not sure.  Just a few days.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Perhaps I can convince you to stay 
                        a while?

           David smiles suspiciously.

                                 DAVID
                        Why is that?  You’ve just met me.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I know people.  I can tell that 
                        you’re a man one can tie to.  And 
                        perhaps I can help you find what 
                        you’re looking for.

           A beat.

                                 DAVID
                        I’d have no trade in this town.  

                                 ABRAHAM
                        A spot for the town Sheriff has 
                        just opened up this very moment.

           David and Abraham share another laugh.

                                 DAVID
                        I get the feeling there isn’t a 
                        strong demand for a law man in 
                        Mount Hermon.  And I have no 
                        experience.

                        We’re all subject to a guardian

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I’ll pay you and free lodgings.

           David studies him with a cunning smile.

                                 DAVID
                        That’s not the issue-

                                 ABRAHAM
                        -Then it’s settled.

           Abraham slams his hands onto the table approvingly and 
           laughs.  David has no time to fake an objection.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                                 (to Jedidiah and 
                                 Clem)
                        Jedidiah, Clem, meet your new 
                        sheriff.

           A confused look crosses their face.  They smile cordially 
           and tip their hat to David.

           INT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S CABIN - MORNING

           Marisol is out of bed and moving slowly about the 
           kitchen.  Argos sits in the doorway watching her.  She 
           looks rested and much improved.

           There is a knock on the door.  She opens it and finds 
           five women all carrying plates of food and gifts standing 
           on the front porch.  They are:  ESTER (45), BEATRICE 
           (34), PHILOMENA (55), ANNE (25), AND LORENA (30). 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARISOL
                        Can I help you?

                                 PHILOMENA
                        Welcome to Mount Hermon, Marisol.

                                 ESTER
                        We heard you weren’t feeling well.  
                        We brought you and David some 
                        food.

                                 MARISOL
                        Thank you, but who told you -

           The women begin to file by her and move into the house.

                                 LORENA
                        -And we just had to meet the wife 
                        of the new Sheriff.  

                                 MARISOL
                        Sheriff?

                                 BEATRICE
                        Did you have a long journey here?

                                 MARISOL
                        -Yes, but-

                                 ANNE
                        -You’re even more beautiful than 
                        was spoken of you.

           Marisol watches them as they set their food down and 
           arrange the kitchen.  They walk in and out bringing in 
           pots, pans, dishes, and blankets.  Argos sits under the 
           table growling lowly to himself.  

                                 MARISOL
                        Who spoke?

                                 BEATRICE
                        The town.  Abraham.

                                 ESTER
                        Not sure how much need there is in 
                        this town for a sheriff, but 
                        Abraham thought it well.  

                                 MARISOL
                        Sheriff?  But I don’t know you-

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 LORENA
                        -How rude of us!  I’m Lorena, 
                        that’s Beatrice, Ester, Philomena, 
                        and Anne.  

           Philomena and Anne hug Marisol and kiss her on the cheek.  
           Marisol hesitantly reciprocates.  

                                 PHILOMENA
                        You look like a Spanish angel.  

                                 MARISOL
                        No, I’m very tired.  I must look-

                                 ANNE
                        Abraham speaks very highly of you 
                        and David.  

           A beat.

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        He foresaw you coming.  Did he 
                        tell you?

                                 BEATRICE
                        You will do well in this town, 
                        Marisol.

           Marisol is overwhelmed with the speed and persistence of 
           the women, but does her best to act welcoming.    

                                 PHILOMENA
                        Let’s eat.  It will do us all well 
                        to get to know you better.

           EXT. DEEP INSIDE DAVIS MOUNTAINS - AFTERNOON

           David moves about slowly on his horse.  His eyes move 
           from searching the ground to studying a map.  

           He keeps to the low ground and skirts the mountain 
           ridges.

           He dismounts his horse and finds a handful of spent 
           shells.  He smells them and puts them into his pocket.

           He arrives at the Rio Grande and looks out.  The setting 
           sun and a potpourri of colorful clouds reflect off the 
           slow waters before retiring into the cold night.
           INT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S CABIN - NIGHT

           David ties up his horse.  Argos sits on the front patio 
           patiently waiting for his master.  He follows him inside.

           Marisol sits at the table in the kitchen staring into 
           space.  

           David leans in to kiss her.

                                 DAVID
                        Feeling better?

                                 MARISOL
                        Where have you been?

                                 DAVID
                        I found the strainer, where the 
                        bodies are being found.

                                 MARISOL
                        They came and brought food and 
                        moved things around-

                                 DAVID
                        -Who came?

                                 MARISOL
                        And they knew things.

                                 DAVID
                        Marisol, who came?

                                 MARISOL
                        All of these women.  Beatrice and 
                        Lorena and-

                                 DAVID
                        -What did they want?

                                 MARISOL
                        They said you were the new 
                        Sheriff, that Abraham foresaw us 
                        coming.

           David shakes his head.

                                 DAVID
                        No, Marisol.  I mean yes, he asked 
                        me to be Sheriff, but it’s only 
                        until I can find out what’s going 
                        on.  And then we’ll leave as fast 
                        as we came.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She stands and pulls him into her, holding him tightly.  
           Her lips quiver.

                                 MARISOL
                        He frightens me.

                                 DAVID
                        He’s a man, Marisol, not a crystal 
                        gazer.  And these people, they’re 
                        just a bit off the reservation.

                                 MARISOL
                        I was so scared.  I just let them 
                        in.  I was frozen.

           He kisses her face and neck.

                                 DAVID
                        There’s nothing to be afraid of.

           He pulls out the shells he found earlier in the day.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I found these out a mile or so 
                        from the strainer.  They’re 45 
                        millimeter shells.  Probably from 
                        a Winchester.  It might be 
                        something.

           She nods.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

                                 MARISOL
                        Yes.

                                 DAVID
                        If you want to leave, take the 
                        wagon and wait for me at Fort 
                        Davis.

           She shakes her head.

                                 MARISOL
                        No...I’d never leave you.

           He rubs his hands over her face.  He lifts her up as she 
           wraps her legs around his waste.  They kiss passionately 
           before he carries her towards the bedroom.
           EXT. MOUNT HERMON STREETS - MORNING

           David walks down the street on his way to the town 
           jailhouse.  Folks are slightly more cordial, tipping 
           their hats and nodding, but certainly not welcoming as he 
           passes by.  He reciprocates in kind.

           INT. JAILHOUSE - MINUTES LATER

           The jailhouse is pristine as all the other buildings in 
           town.  Nothing hangs on the walls but a few sets of keys.  

           There is a single cell, a couple of tables, a desk, a 
           cot, and an armory.  David rifles through the drawers of 
           the desk.  They are empty.  

           He grabs the keys hanging on the wall and opens up the 
           armory.  There are several different types of polished 
           rifles, including a 45 Winchester.

           David picks it up and studies it.  He tests the lever 
           action and smells the chamber.  He puts it back into the 
           Armory and locks it up.

           EXT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S FRONT YARD - DAY

           Marisol is rearranging the wagon, pulling out needed 
           items and setting them off to the side.  Argos sits in 
           the front of the wagon watching her from the seat.  

                                 MARISOL
                                 (to Argos)
                        What are you hungry for tonight, 
                        Argos?  Chicken?.  

           She scratches his head as he wags his tale.  

                                 MARISOL (CONT’D)
                        Of course we have to find a 
                        chicken.

           Argos lets off a deep, slow growl and sits up.

                                 MARISOL (CONT’D)
                        What is it, Argos?

           She turns to find Abraham watching her from the back of 
           the wagon.

           She jumps and lets out a quick, chilled scream.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I know where you can find a whole 
                        nest of cocks.

           He laughs.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        I’m terribly sorry to have 
                        frightened you, Marisol.

           She calms and catches her breath.  She laughs to mask her 
           fear and looks away from his penetrating gaze.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Can I give you a hand with 
                        anything?

           INT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S CABIN - MINUTES LATER

           Abraham sits at the table in the kitchen watching 
           Marisol.  She grabs a cup and pours him some coffee.

                                 MARISOL
                        Milk?  Sugar?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        No, thank you.  I like it strong 
                        and dark.

           She places the coffee in front of Abraham and sits at the 
           other end of the table.

           There is an uncomfortable, silent moment between them.

                                 MARISOL
                        Are you married, Abraham?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        My wife is in Heaven.

                                 MARISOL
                        I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean-

                                 ABRAHAM
                        -Do not be sorry.  She died many 
                        years ago birthing Isaac.  She 
                        left him with many of 
                        her...talents.

                                 MARISOL
                        I’m sure she was a beautiful 
                        woman.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 ABRAHAM
                        She could back the buzzards off a 
                        gut wagon.  

           Marisol can’t help but to crack a smile as Abraham 
           laughs.  

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        But truly, she was lovely. There 
                        was never a more pure heart to 
                        wreck a man.  

           They smile.

                                 MARISOL
                        Have you always been a preacher?

                        No man is leave of God’s calling.  
                        Mine takes many forms in many 
                        places.

           Marisol looks at him as though she is holding something 
           back.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead.  Ask.

                                 MARISOL
                        Is it true that you have visions?  
                        That you’re clairvoyant?

           Abraham laughs shrewdly.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        You’ve had some visitors.  How did 
                        you find our fine Mount Hermon 
                        women?

                                 MARISOL
                        Ummm, they were very...kind.

           Abraham laughs.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        You’re a horrible liar, Marisol.  
                        They’re as wretched as the hind 
                        quarters of bad luck.

           Marisol laughs and becomes more comfortable.

                                 MARISOL
                        No.  Not at all.  I was just 
                        surprised by their hospitality.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Just watch what you say around 
                        them or you will be the center of 
                        gossip at their next card game.

           They laugh together.  

                                 MARISOL
                        We still have some pie leftover 
                        from their visit.  Would you like 
                        some? 

                                 ABRAHAM
                        How could a man refuse?

           Marisol gets up and uncovers the pie.  She grabs some 
           silverware and a plate.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Tell me, what was David’s 
                        occupation before?

           Marisol cuts the pie and searches for an answer.

                                 MARISOL
                        He was a peace-officer.  He has 
                        always been a lawman.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Undoubtedly so.  

           Abraham smiles to himself.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        He speaks so little of himself.

                                 MARISOL
                        He is a very modest man.

           She smiles at Abraham and sets a piece of pie in front of 
           him.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        And lucky.

           She blushes as he bites into the pie.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Apple.  My favorite.
           EXT. MOUNT HERMON STREET - DAY

           David exits the jailhouse and heads down the street.  He 
           passes stores and houses and receives no greetings; only 
           slightly cordial head bows and blank stares.

           He shakes his head and chuckles to himself.

           INT. GENERAL STORE - SAME

           David walks into the General Store.  Lorena and Anne look 
           over the paperbacks.  He nods and smiles to them.  Their 
           tight lips hardly crack a response.

           PORTENCE, the owner of the store stands behind the 
           counter staring at him.  She is short and pudgy with a 
           slight hair-lip and could easily pass as a man.  She 
           wears a visor with a plastic green shield and an apron.

                                 DAVID
                        Good day, Sir.

           Her face bends into a scowl.  A feminine voice responds 
           rudely.

                                 PORTENCE
                        And to you, Sheriff.

           David turns a bit red with embarrassment.

                                 PORTENCE (CONT’D)
                        What can I get you?

                                 DAVID
                        A pouch of that smoking tobacco 
                        and papers, please.  

           She grabs the items and sets them in front of him.

           He waits an uncomfortable second.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        How much do I owe you?

                                 PORTENCE
                        Your money is no good here, Sir.

                                 DAVID
                        Pardon?

                                 PORTENCE
                        Abraham has ordered your expenses 
                        covered.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           David picks up the tobacco and papers.

                                 DAVID
                        I’d really like to pay.

                                 PORTENCE
                        Abraham insists.

           David reluctantly nods and tips his hat.  

                                 DAVID
                        In that case...

           He grabs some chocolates sitting in a jar and smiles at 
           her.  She turns and walks away.

           INT. ORPHA’S DINER - LATER

           David sits in the corner of the diner next to the window 
           reading an old newspaper.  

           He looks around the room.  The restaurant is nearly full, 
           yet no one passes a glances or strikes a conversation.  

           He turns his gaze outside of the window.   Across the 
           street Naomi and Isaac are in a muted argument.  He grabs 
           her arm firmly before she snags it away and heads towards 
           the brothel.  He stumbles after her visibly drunk.

           Orpha delivers him a bowl of stew and dumplings.  He 
           smiles and nods in thanks.

           EXT. MOUNT HERMON STREET - LATER

           David makes his way down the street smoking a cigarette.  
           He stops in front of HOOT’S BROTHEL and stares at the 
           front door.

           A second later Isaac, Dale, and Monte exit the brothel.  
           They are intoxicated.

                                 ISAAC
                        Deputy Dave!

           Dale and Monte laugh with Isaac.  David haphazardly 
           smiles to get along.

                                 MONTE
                        He must be off duty!

           Dale and Monte continue to laugh.  Isaac moves close to 
           David.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ISAAC
                        What are you doing here?

                                 DAVID
                        Just passing by.  

                                 ISAAC
                        Probably a good idea...just keep 
                        on going.

           Isaac points out of town.  Dale and Monte smirk like 
           puppets behind him.

           David scowls at them and licks his lips.

                                 DAVID
                        But now I think about it...I am a 
                        bit thirsty.

           Isaac face turns serious.

                                 ISAAC
                        You wouldn’t like it here.  The 
                        beer tastes like piss.

                                 DAVID
                        Then I guess I’ll drink some 
                        whiskey.  

                                 ISAAC
                        I don’t think you’re listening to 
                        me...Sheriff.  I’m telling you, 
                        no.

           David steps towards Isaac.

                                 DAVID
                        Did you enjoy that, Isaac?

           A look of confusion crosses his face.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Savor it.  That’s the first and 
                        last time I’ll ever allow you to 
                        speak to me like that.

           Isaac opens his mouth to speak.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Stop...Choose your next words 
                        carefully.

           Isaac holds David’s stare, but with less confidence.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Nothing.  Good.  Now get the fuck 
                        out of my way.

           Isaac turns back and looks to Monte and Dale.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Move!

           Isaac steps aside just enough to brush up against David 
           as he passes.  David walks between Monte and Dale making 
           eye contact with both before he reaches the door to the 
           brothel.

           INT. HOOT’S BROTHEL - DAY

           The downstairs lobby holds a bar the length of the room 
           along one wall, and the rest of the room is filled with 
           tables and chairs.  A balcony sits at the top of the 
           stairs and wraps around the room.  

           A polished baby grand sits in the corner.  Clem and 
           Jedidiah play cards with a two other men from town at a 
           table.  A dozen other men sit drinking either at a table 
           or the bar.  

           NIGEL (30, white), CHARLIE (30, white), and WINSTON (30, 
           black) speak with British accents to half a dozen 
           beautiful prostitutes wearing elegant, yet revealing 
           dresses.  The Englishmen are dressed in sober sack suits 
           and Norfolk Jackets.

           NAOMI (23), the beautiful red haired prostitute from the 
           porch before, chats with another prostitute at the end of 
           the bar.  They whisper to each other as David walks in.  
           She locks eyes with him as posts himself on a stool.  

           HOOT (50) sets the glass he’s cleaning down and 
           approaches David from behind the bar.

                                 DAVID
                        You must be Hoot.

                                 HOOT
                        I am.

                                 DAVID
                        I hear the beer here is excellent.

                                 HOOT
                        I’ve no complaints.

           Hoot sets a beer in front of David.  He takes a long 
           drink and a deep breath to cool his temper.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He looks about the room and studies the patrons.  He 
           spends a moment on the Englishmen, before glancing again 
           at Naomi.  

           He takes another pull from his beer as Naomi makes her 
           way over to him.

                                 NAOMI
                        May I sit?

                                 DAVID
                        Be my guest.

                                 NAOMI
                                 (to Hoot)
                        Hoot, another round for the 
                        Gentleman?
                                 (to David)
                        I’m Naomi.

                                 DAVID
                        David.  

           They shake hands.

                                 NAOMI
                        I know who you are.

           Hoot hands David another beer.

                                 DAVID
                        Is Hoot his real name?

                                 NAOMI
                        That’s what I hear.  

                                 DAVID
                        What else do you hear?

                                 NAOMI
                        Whatever falls earshot.

           She smiles and studies him for a long moment as he drinks 
           from his beer.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        You have a kind face.

                                 DAVID
                        That’s kind of you, but I’m not 
                        here to be entertained.

           David motions to the Englishmen.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 NAOMI
                        I know about your wife.  I’m not 
                        soliciting you.  I’m a prostitute, 
                        not a whore.

           David nods.

                                 DAVID
                        News travels fast.

                                 NAOMI
                        This town echoes every word 
                        Abraham breathes.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m beginning to notice that.  

                                 NAOMI
                        Stay here long enough and you 
                        might start believing him too.

           Her eyes move suspiciously about the room.

                                 DAVID
                        How long have you been here?

                                 NAOMI
                        Almost a year.

                                 DAVID
                        How did you come by this place?

                                 NAOMI
                        I was a married to a soldier at 
                        Fort Davis.  I met Hoot there 
                        right after my husband killed 
                        himself.  I had no where to go.  
                        Hoot offered me a job.

           Naomi takes a sip from his beer.  Her face turns serious.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Thought I would work, save a 
                        little money and move to San 
                        Francisco.

                                 DAVID
                        You’re a long way from California.

           She sadly smiles.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you leave?

           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 NAOMI
                        This town is different, David.

                                 DAVID
                        I can attest to that.

                                 NAOMI
                        I mean it’s not what it seems.  
                        You just can’t leave.  

                                 DAVID
                        How do you mean?

           Clem and Jedidiah take a seat a couple of stools from 
           David.  Naomi tosses them a flirtacious smile.  

                                 NAOMI
                        Hello, Gentleman.

                             CLEM
                                                        JEDIDIAH
           Naomi.
                                              Ma’am.

           Naomi leans into David and acts as though she were trying 
           to seduce him.  She rubs her hand over his arm, making 
           him completely uncomfortable.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                                 (whispering)
                        You’re not safe.  You need to get 
                        far away from this place.

           David turns from her and looks at Clem and Jedidiah who 
           stare intensely at him.  He looks over to the Englishmen 
           who are oblivious to anything other than the booze and 
           women.

           Her lips lightly touch his ear.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        He knew you were coming.

           David pushes her away gently.

                                 DAVID
                        Jesus Christ crucified.

                                 NAOMI
                        Careful.  He hears every word.

           Her eyes look up towards the Heavens.

                                 DAVID
                        Who?...God?

                                 NAOMI
                        No...

           A frightened look crosses her face.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Abraham.

           A beat.

                                 DAVID
                        Nice to meet you.

           David pushes his stool back.  He tosses some money on the 
           bar and stares back at Clem and Jedidiah as he makes his 
           way towards the door.

                                 HOOT
                        You’re money’s no good here.

           Hoot reaches for the bills sitting on the bar before Clem 
           slams his hands down on them, sliding them into his 
           pocket.

           EXT. MOUNT HERMON STREET - DAY

           David and Abraham meet on their horses in the middle of 
           the street in front of SILAS’S MEAT STORE.

           Abraham is in a jovial mood, while David seems put off 
           from his day.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        David!  How are you?

                                 DAVID
                        Fine.  Thank you.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Is something troubling you?

                                 DAVID
                        I suppose I should tell you before 
                        you hear some fumbled up version.  
                        I had a run in with Isaac earlier.

           Abraham laughs.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Did he rattle your armor a bit?

                                 DAVID
                        He’s awful cavalier with that 
                        tongue of his.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I wonder where he gets it?

           He laughs and winks at David.

                                 DAVID
                        He won’t escape a second time 
                        without a beating.

           Abraham laughs harder.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        That’s exactly what he needs.

           SILAS (40) enters the street from his store.  He is short 
           and fat and is carrying a rope tied at both ends to the 
           feet of two headless chickens.  He pulls on their necks 
           draining the last bits of blood onto the dirt street.

           Abraham nods to Silas and points to David.  A look of 
           disappointment covers his face.  He hands the rope and 
           chickens over to David.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, Silas.  You are the 
                        salt of the Earth.

                                 SILAS
                        My pleasure, Abraham.

                                 DAVID
                                 (to Abraham)
                        What is this?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        That’s your dinner, my friend.

           David fakes a smile.  Silas turns back towards his store.

                                 DAVID
                        Thank you, Silas.

           He looks back to David and returns a subtle nod.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        He says your welcome.

           Abraham laughs.

                                 DAVID
                        Will you speak to Isaac?  I do not 
                        want a repeat of this afternoon.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Enjoy your chickens!

           Abraham pats David on the shoulder and rides off smiling.

           EXT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S CABIN - EVENING

           Marisol sits on the front patio.  She is sketching in her 
           journal a still life of Argos.  Argos jumps out of his 
           slumber and runs towards David.  

           David rides up to the cabin.  The rope is tied to his 
           saddle and chickens bounce around on the sides of his 
           horse.  Marisol walks out to greet him.  He jumps off the 
           horse and kisses her as she ties up the reins.

                                 DAVID
                        Feeling better?

                                 MARISOL
                        A bit strange, but alright.

                                 DAVID
                        Good.  I’ve brought dinner.

           Marisol smiles and hugs David.

                                 MARISOL
                                 (to Argos)
                        Chicken!

           INT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S CABIN - EVENING

           David cleans the chickens at the table as Marisol peels 
           the shucks off some ears of corn over the stove.  Argos 
           lies at David’s feet.

                                 MARISOL
                        Abraham visited me this morning.

                                 DAVID
                        Alone?

                                 MARISOL
                        Yes.

                                 DAVID
                        I just saw him an hour ago.  He 
                        made no mention of it.

                                 MARISOL
                        Where did you see him?

                                 DAVID
                        In town.  He gave me these 
                        chickens and rode off.

           Marisol laughs to herself.

                        What?  What did he say?

                                 MARISOL
                        We talked about his wife and the 
                        town...He was not inappropriate.

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t like him coming here, 
                        Marisol.

                                 MARISOL
                        What would you have me do?

                                 DAVID
                        Just be careful what you say.  I 
                        will speak to him.

           Marisol smiles at David seemingly unconcerned.

                                 MARISOL
                        I’d like to go riding tomorrow.

                        Okay.

           EXT.  DAVID AND MARISOL’S CABIN - MORNING

           David follows Marisol as they carry their saddles through 
           the front door.  She looks tired and unwell.

                                 DAVID
                        Are you sure you’re well enough?

                                 MARISOL
                        I’m fine.

           Marisol stops dead in her tracks, dropping her saddle. 

           In the front yard, resting on their own horses, sit 
           Abraham, Isaac, and Naomi.  

                                 ISAAC

                        Just now arrived.

           David nods.  Abraham tips his hat to Marisol.

                        Marisol.  It’s a beautiful day for 
                        a ride.

                                 DAVID
                        Yes it is.

           Abraham motions to Naomi, who sits tensely on her horse, 
           a nervous expression carved in her face.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        This is Naomi.  But I believe you 
                        two already met...at Hoot’s.

           Marisol looks sternly at David.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Naomi, this is Marisol.

                                 NAOMI
                        Pleasure.

           Marisol turns to Naomi and nods politely.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        We just stopped by to let you know 
                        I’ll be holding a service at the 
                        town hall Sunday evening.

           Abraham turns his focus to Marisol.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        You’re more than welcome to join 
                        us.

           Marisol smiles to him and nods approvingly.

                                 DAVID
                        Thank you.  We’ll consider it.

           A beat.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Very well then.  We’ll be on our 
                        way.  Enjoy your ride.

           David nods.

           Isaac smirks and turns away.

           David peers at Naomi who smiles quaintly at him before 
           she turns.  Marisol catches this and scowls.  

           David watches them ride away.  Marisol angrily picks up 
           her saddle and walks to her horse.  David watches 
           momentarily and follows.  

           EXT. HILLTOP - AFTERNOON

           David and Marisol sit quietly on their horses on a hill 
           over looking Mount Hermon.  David stares at Marisol, who 
           looks towards the town, lost in thought, her face and 
           hair wet from sweat.  

           She snaps from her trance and half smiles at David.  She 
           spurns her horse forward and gallops back towards the 
           town.  David takes a deep breath and watches her go ahead 
           for a moment before he follows.

           EXT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S CABIN - NIGHT

           David sits on the steps of the front porch rolling a 
           cigarette.  Argos sits next to him, his nose raised to 
           the cold night air.

           David examines the sky and lights his cigarette.  Loud 
           coughing and moaning comes from inside the cabin.  He 
           throws the cigarette and runs inside.  

           Marisol runs through the kitchen to the back patio.  
           David rushes behind her.  She leans over the steps and 
           vomits as David pulls her hair back.

           He pulls a handkerchief from his pocket and cleans her 
           face.   

                                 DAVID
                        Marisol?

           Her face is pale and her eyes water.  She leans into him, 
           burying her face in his chest.

           INT. JAILHOUSE - DAY

           David sits at the desk looking over maps.  The maps have 
           been marked and circled and David has taken notes.  For 
           the first time we see his pistols.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Naomi shoves open the door and stumbles in.  She has been 
           badly beaten.  Her face is swollen and bleeding and her 
           arms and neck are severely scratched.  She is bawling.  

                                 DAVID
                        Naomi?

                                 NAOMI
                        Please, help me!

           David jumps out of his seat and grabs hold of her, 
           helping her into the chair.  He surgically wipes away the 
           blood from her face and checks her wounds.

                                 DAVID
                        What happened?

           She cannot get out the words for crying.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Who did this to you?

           She buries her face into his chest and pulls herself into 
           him tightly.  He reluctantly loosens his body and 
           comforts her until she calms.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Naomi, who did this to you?

                                 NAOMI
                        The English fellow.

                                 DAVID
                        Why?

                                 NAOMI
                        He’s drunk...I was entertaining 
                        him and he grabbed his gun...He  
                        tried to put it...inside...I 
                        wouldn’t let him...

           She begins to sob again.  David wraps his arms firmly 
           around her.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay.  You’re okay.  Is he still 
                        there?

           She nods affirmatively into his chest.  David grabs his 
           pistols and puts them around his waste.  He opens the 
           armory and takes out one of the rifles.

           He leans down and lifts her head.  He wipes away some 
           blood with his hands and rubs it on his trousers.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be back in a little bit.  You 
                        stay here and wait til I get back.  
                        Okay?

           She nods and tries to collect herself.  He walks out the 
           door.

           INT. HOOT’S BROTHEL - MINUTES LATER

           The door to Hoot’s slams open.  David walks in 
           forcefully, the rifle at his side.  A few men from town 
           play cards in the corner.  Nigel and Winston sit at the 
           bar, surrounded by a handful of frightened prostitutes.  
           It is obvious they are drunk.

           Everyone stops and stares at David as he marches in.

                                 DAVID
                                 (to Hoot)
                        Where is he?

           No one answers and the room becomes silently hostile.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        WHERE!?

           Hoot nods to the Charlie sitting in the corner, staring 
           at David, completely intoxicated.  He has a new girl on 
           his lap.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                                 (to Hoot)
                        You gonna do anything about this?

                                 HOOT
                        Abraham handles these things, 
                        Mister.

           Hoot throws his towel down on the bar and crosses his 
           arms.  David calmly turns towards Charlie.  The girl 
           jumps off his lap as he approaches.

           David turns the rifle around and slams the stock into the 
           Charlie’s forehead.  Again.  And Again.

           Nigel and Winston jump from their stools and move towards 
           David.  He flips the rifle and slams back the lever 
           action.

                                 DAVID
                        Come on, Goddamn.  I want you to.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           They freeze, but David is beyond anger.  He moves towards 
           them and hits Winston in the face with the barrel of the 
           rifle.  Nigel backs away to the bar.

                                 NIGEL
                        No!  No!  Okay!  Okay!  

           David turns back to the table.  He leans down and punches 
           Charlie in the face a couple more times.  He grabs him by 
           the hair and walks him towards the door.

           EXT. MOUNT HERMON STREET - SECONDS LATER.

           The door to Hoot’s slams open and Charlie flies out.  
           David follows him.  He picks him up by his hair again, 
           and walks him down the street.  

           People trickle out of their shops and homes to watch.  
           David sees Portence as he passes the General Store.

                                 DAVID
                        Find the doctor.  Get him to the 
                        jail, now.

           She stands there unresponsive.  He drops Charlie and 
           marches towards her.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        DO IT!  NOW!

           She jumps with a startle and runs down the street.

           EXT. TOWN HALL - EARLY EVENING

           Marisol walks down the street carrying an empty basket.  
           She stops in front of the town hall.  Through the open 
           doors she finds Abraham giving a cult like sermon to the 
           majority of the town.

           She walks inside and leans against the back wall.

           INT. TOWN HALL - SAME

           The congregation sings as their bodies shake and dance 
           and convulse.  Abraham, towering over everyone, walks 
           through the crowd putting his hands on their heads.  

                                 ABRAHAM
                        By using my name they will force 
                        out demons, and they will speak 
                        new languages.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The parishioners speak in tongues as Abraham moves past 
           them.  Silas and Jedidiah walk through the room carrying 
           wooden boxes.  

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        And they will handle snakes and 
                        drink poison and not be hurt.  

           Those moved by the spirit lift rattle snakes from the 
           boxes.  They hold them to their faces and raise them 
           towards heaven.  

           Abraham spots Marisol.  A sinister smile covers his face 
           as he watches her study the service.  

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        I anoint you in the name of 
                        Christ.  

           Abraham takes a snake from an old woman.  He wraps it 
           around his neck.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Fear not.  They are lifeless in 
                        the hands of the anointed.

           Abraham makes his way to the back of the room.  He nods 
           at Marisol who stares back frightened.  She turns red and 
           sweat leaks from her pores.  He closes the door and 
           stands before her.

           He takes the snake from his neck and holds it to her.

           Marisol shakes her head and takes a couple steps back.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        The spirit led you here.  You have 
                        nothing to fear in me.  

           He takes a step towards her.  

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Take the snake.

           They lock eyes.  Abraham gazes at her intensely, as if he 
           was hypnotizing her.  She slowly raises her arms, her 
           hands shaking.  She grabs hold of the snake and keeps it 
           as far from her body as she can.

           Abraham turns and continues through the room.  He looks 
           up towards the sky and tosses the heavens a menacing 
           smile.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        If you are bit...if you die 
                        handling the serpent...your 
                        salvation is assured.

           Marisol hands off the snake to Silas as he passes by with 
           the box.  She watches Abraham as he walks through the 
           congregation. 

           She wipes the sweat from her brow and slowly begins to 
           clap in sync with the rest of the parishioners.  

           INT. JAILHOUSE - EVENING

           The doctor, MORRIS (50s), stands above Naomi stitching  
           her face.  He is tall, skinny, and balding, but has a 
           very pleasant demeanor.

                                 MORRIS
                        He sure did a number on you, Miss 
                        Naomi.

           Naomi is stripped to her undergarments and holds a mirror 
           in front of her, watching Morris sew thread into her 
           face.  Her lips quiver.  She adjust the mirror and finds 
           David sitting at the desk staring back at her.  

           David notices a large ‘A’ has been branded on the inside 
           of her thigh.  She quickly moves her hand to cover it.  
           Her eyes fill with tears.

           Charlie sits unconscious in the cell.  

                                 MORRIS (CONT’D)
                        I’m not sure I’m going to have 
                        enough thread to stitch the other 
                        fella.

                                 DAVID
                        Don’t worry about him.  He won’t 
                        be getting any.

           The door to the jail flies open.  Isaac storms in, his 
           eyes darting around the room.  Morris stops stitching as 
           Naomi grabs a blanket to cover herself with.  David does 
           not move an inch.

                                 ISAAC
                        Where is he?!

           David nods towards the cell.  Isaac rushes over and looks 
           at Charlie’s beaten, unconscious body.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ISAAC (CONT’D)
                        Is he dead?

           David responds with an unapologetic stare.

                                 ISAAC (CONT’D)
                        I am not pleased, David.

                                 DAVID
                        In case you haven’t figured it out 
                        yet...I don’t really give a shit.

                                 ISAAC
                        I don’t think you understand 
                        what’s going on here!

           Isaac pushes Morris out of the way and grabs Naomi.  She 
           screams out in pain.

                                 ISAAC (CONT’D)
                        For this?!  She’s nothing more 
                        than a lick and a promise!  You 
                        stupid fuck!

           David rushes from his seat and pushes Isaac into the 
           wall.  

                                 ISAAC (CONT’D)
                                 (to Naomi)
                        Goddamn whore!  Who’s gonna fuck 
                        you now?  
                                 (to David)
                        Abraham will not be pleased by 
                        this.

                                 DAVID
                        Run to your father.  

           A beat.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        He likes me more anyway.

           Isaac pulls out his pistol and points the barrel inches 
           from David’s forehead.  David stays composed.

                                 ISAAC
                        You’re mistaken.  It’s that pretty 
                        bean-eating wife of yours that 
                        he’s keen on.

           David slaps Isaac’s arm away from his head.  A round goes 
           off and Morris and Naomi duck.  David head-butts Isaac 
           square in face, shattering his nose.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Isaac slides down the wall to the floor, bleeding into 
           his hands.  David picks up his pistol and whips him with 
           it.

                                 DAVID
                        Don’t you ever speak of my wife!

           David grabs him by the legs and drags him outside.  

           EXT. MOUNT HERMON STREET - SAME

           David drags Isaac into the middle of the street.  Isaac 
           attempts to fight him off with his legs, but David is 
           able to strike him with the pistol repeatedly.  Isaac 
           becomes a limp bloody mess.

           A crowd forms around them as the congregation breaks up 
           and the parishioners leave town hall.  Monte pushes 
           through the crowd and rushes David.  David sees him at 
           the last second.  He flips the pistol around and stops 
           Monte in his tracks.

                                 MONTE
                        What are you gonna do?  I ain’t 
                        heeled.

           A pistol drops in front of Monte.  David and Monte look 
           to see Abraham standing feet from them smiling, 
           entertained.  

           A look of despair moves over Monte’s face.  He takes a 
           deep breath.  David stands ready, emotionless.  Monte 
           slowly turns away.  He helps Isaac up and moves him 
           through the crowd.

           Abraham laughs and pats David on the back.  David sees 
           Marisol staring nervously in the back of the crowd.  She 
           is sweaty, and looks tired and confused.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        The show is over my dear friends.  
                                 (to Morris)
                        Morris, please tend to Isaac.

           Morris nods and scurries off.  

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        I warned him.  I told him you were 
                        a man run through the mill.

           Abraham and David notice Naomi leaning against a pillar 
           on the porch of the jail.  She is covered in a blanket, 
           staring at David.  Marisol watches her.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DAVID
                        I’m taking my wife home.  Will you 
                        tend to Naomi?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I’ll tend to her every need.

           David walks towards Marisol. 

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        And David...

           He turns back to Abraham.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Don’t go kicking all the dogs just 
                        because one of them has fleas.

           David takes Marisol’s hand and turns towards the cabin.

           Abraham turns and smiles to Naomi.  Her eyes fill with 
           tears as she turns and walks back into the jailhouse.

           INT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S CABIN - NIGHT

           David and Marisol eat dinner.  She is pale and sweaty and 
           her eyes are heavy and red.  She pushes her food around, 
           but does not raise anything to her mouth.  Argos sits at 
           the door, watching them intently.

                                 MARISOL
                        What happened to that woman?

                                 DAVID
                        She was beaten up in the brothel.

                                 MARISOL
                        Is that why you were fighting 
                        Isaac?

                                 DAVID
                        No.  Marisol, you look terrible.  
                        How-

                                 MARISOL
                        -I guess that’s what happens to 
                        pretty whores.

           David looks at Marisol strangely.  The fork trembles in 
           her shaky hands.

                                 MARISOL (CONT’D)
                        Do you think she’s pretty?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DAVID
                        Stop it, Marisol.

                                 MARISOL
                        Abraham will take care of her.

                                 DAVID
                        Will he?  He branded that poor 
                        girl.  Burned an ‘A’ on the inside 
                        of her thigh.

                                 MARISOL
                        He wouldn’t do that.

                                 DAVID
                        Why are speaking about him like 
                        you know him?

           She looks up and sways in her chair as if she’s about to 
           faint.

                                 MARISOL
                        He can see what’s inside me...

           David jumps across the table and grabs her before she 
           falls into her plate.

           He picks her up and carries her to the bedroom.

           INT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Marisol opens her red eyes.  The sheets below her are wet 
           from sweating.  David rubs a cool, damp towel over her 
           head.  Argos jumps on the bed and lies next to her.

                                 DAVID
                        You have a fever.

           Marisol’s fights to keep her heavy eyes open, as she 
           falls in and out of sleep.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You’ll feel better after it 
                        breaks.  

           He leans down and kisses her head.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Soon.

           She whispers incoherently as David concertedly watches 
           her fade to sleep.
           EXT. MOUNT HERMON STREET - MORNING

           David rides through town on his way to the jailhouse.  He 
           is approached by Abraham, Monte, Dale, and three CHINESE 
           MEN, dressed in black frock coats and matching trousers 
           and black soft felt hats.  They all have distinguished 
           mustaches.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Gentleman.  Go on.  I’ll catch up 
                        with you directly.

           David studies the Chinese men as they pass.  

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        A fascinating culture.  They say 
                        they’re trapped in the Samsara, an 
                        ever changing world of good and 
                        evil.  If they do not take control 
                        of their desires, they are subject 
                        to great suffering, both here and 
                        the afterlife.

           David watches them as they ride slowly towards the edge 
           of town.  

           Abraham smiles.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t have the heart to tell 
                        them that heathens are damned to 
                        hell anyway.

                                 DAVID
                        What are they doing here?

           Abraham shrugs and lifts his hairless eyebrows.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        How are you feeling my dear 
                        pugilist?

                                 DAVID
                        Fine.  How is Isaac?

           Abraham laughs.  David’s eyes bounce from Abraham to the 
           strange Chinese men.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        He’s full of torment.  I should be 
                        angry with you, but I never doubt 
                        the wisdom of my biases.  However, 
                        I do think it best you stay out of 
                        his business from now on.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DAVID
                        That won’t be a problem.  We’ll be 
                        leaving soon.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Are you?

                                 DAVID
                        Marisol is feverish.  As soon as 
                        it breaks and she gets back some 
                        energy, we’ll be moving on.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        “No where particular.”

           David fakes a smile and nods.  

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                                 (Latin)
                        Vos erant sent hic mihi. EGO mos 
                        retineo vos vado. (You were sent 
                        here for me.  I will not let you 
                        go.)  

                                 DAVID
                        What does that mean?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I shall embrace your company while 
                        I have it.

           Abraham turns his horse and rides on to catch up with the 
           others.

           INT. JAILOUSE - EVENING

           David sits at the desk writing in his journal.  He notes 
           the Chinese men, the Englishmen, the rifle, and the spent 
           shells.  

           A map with detailed locations and notes rests on the 
           desk.

           He folds the map and closes his journal and locks them in 
           the drawer.  

           There is a light knock on the back window.  David walks 
           over and pushes the curtain aside.  Naomi motions him to 
           come around back.
           EXT. BEHIND THE JAIL - SAME

           David sneaks around to the back of the building and finds 
           Naomi.  Her cuts are bandaged but her face has bruised 
           badly.

                                 DAVID
                        What is it?

                                 NAOMI
                        I need to speak to you.

                                 DAVID
                        Come inside.

                                 NAOMI
                        I can’t.  Not here.

                                 DAVID
                        Why?

                                 NAOMI
                        Meet me Sunday at first light.  
                        The Split Fork Creek.

                                 DAVID
                        What do you know?

                                 NAOMI
                        I know you just didn’t stumble 
                        into town for no reason.

           She inches closer to him. 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        And I know you’re not safe.

           She puts her hand on his face.  He allows her to hold it 
           for a moment before he pulls back slowly, her hand 
           falling back to her side.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        You’re resistant to him, but 
                        there’s things you don’t know 
                        about this town. 

                                 DAVID
                        Tell me!

           The sound of voices stir on the street.  Naomi grabs hold 
           of David and pulls him close.  She whispers in his ear.  
           Her warm breath sends condensation into the air.

                                 NAOMI
                        Sunday morning.  First light.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She throws a shawl over her head and runs off.  David 
           watches her until she is lost in the dark.

           INT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           David sits in a chair in the corner of the room and 
           watches Marisol.  She has grown more pale and sickly.  
           Argos sits at David’s side, licking his hand.

           EXT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S HOUSE, PATIO - MORNING

           David drinks coffee and stares out into the mountains.  

           Morris exits the front door.  David looks at him, reading 
           his expression.

                                 MORRIS
                        I think she has a serious kidney 
                        infection.  Back pain, fever, and 
                        blood in her urine.

           David grimaces.

                                 MORRIS (CONT’D)
                        I gave her some corn cure and 
                        stomach bitters.  That should help 
                        her keep some food down.  

                                 DAVID
                        Can she travel?

                                 MORRIS
                        No.  It will kill her.

           David nods.

                                 DAVID
                        Thank you, Morris.

           Morris walks off the porch and turns back towards David.

                                 MORRIS
                        ...And he shall bless thy bread, 
                        and thy water; and HE will take 
                        sickness away from the midst of 
                        thee.

           David stares at him unresponsively.  Morris smiles and 
           walks away.
           INT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S CABIN - AFTERNOON

           David sits at the table cleaning his pistols.  He stops 
           to stare through the window at distant lightning.

           Marisol calls out deliriously.  He runs into the room and 
           rubs a wet towel over her head.

           INT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           David sits in the chair at the foot of the bed.  He 
           watches as Marisol whispers in her sleep.  She is 
           drenched in sweat.  Argos moans in the corner of the 
           room.

           INT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S BEDROOM - DAWN

           David awakens from the chair at the foot of the bed.  
           Marisol sleeps in a pool of sweat.  

           David dresses quietly and leaves.  

           Marisol opens her red eyes the second he is out of the 
           room.

           EXT. SPLIT FORKS CREEK BED - DAWN

           David rides his horse through the dry creek looking for 
           Naomi.  She walks from behind a large boulder carrying a  
           bag.  She is dressed in baggy pants and a large shirt and 
           boots.  

           David studies her momentarily and shakes his head.

           She motions to her clothes.

                                 NAOMI
                        Hoot’s get up.

           She struts towards him flirtatiously.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        How do I look?

                                 DAVID
                        It suits you.

           She laughs and grimaces from the pain in her face.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

           She shakes her head.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Running?

                                 NAOMI
                        We can’t stay here.

                                 DAVID
                        We?

                                 NAOMI
                        David, you’re not safe either.

           David laughs.

                                 DAVID
                        You keep saying that.

                                 NAOMI
                        You’re a good man, David.  I can 
                        see that in you.  You did a good 
                        thing for me and now I want to do 
                        a good thing for you.

                                 DAVID
                        Come on, Naomi.  Please, out with 
                        it.

           A beat.  She looks around to make sure no one is watching 
           them.

                                 NAOMI
                        Isaac and Monte have been 
                        talking...and the town does not 
                        want you.  They’ve been urging 
                        Abraham to get rid of you.

                                 DAVID
                        Then why hasn’t he?

                                 NAOMI
                        He says that he knew you would 
                        come...that he knew your father...

           David’s face grows alert.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        And that you would bring him a 
                        wife.

           He quickly dismounts his horse and rushes towards Naomi.  
           She cowers, expecting to get hit.  He grabs her firmly by 
           the shoulders and shakes her.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 DAVID
                        What does that mean!?

           She begins to cry.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Tell me!

                                 NAOMI
                        Marisol...He wants her.

           David pushes Naomi away.

                                 DAVID
                        Well, he can’t have her.

                                 NAOMI
                        I’m sorry, David.  She’s already 
                        his.  She was his the second you 
                        brought her to Mount Hermon.

           David raises his hand to punch her.  Naomi cowers again.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Please!  No!

           David stops short of hitting her.  She grabs hold of him 
           and embraces him tightly.  He pulls her arms apart and 
           pushes her away.

           He hurries towards to his horse.  She grabs hold of him 
           and spins him around.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Come with me.  We can’t go back 
                        there.

                                 DAVID
                        Stop it!

           She continues to hug him and cry desperately.

                                 NAOMI
                        We can go to San Francisco.  I 
                        will be a good woman to you, 
                        David.

           She tries forcefully to kiss him and he pushes her onto 
           her knees.  

                                 DAVID
                        Stop it, Goddamn!

           She grabs a handful of sand and throws it at him.

           A beat.

                                 NAOMI
                        I’ll be lost out there...

           She looks out into the Mountains.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        I’ll die out there without you.  
                        Please.

           David looks at her sympathetically.  

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Is there no room in your heart for 
                        me?  

                                 DAVID
                        I want to help you, but-

                                 NAOMI
                        -You don’t have to love me.

           A beat.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m sorry.  I’m not leaving my 
                        wife.

           Naomi nods and rises to her feet.  David watches her limp 
           over to her bag.  She struggles to pick it up.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Naomi...wait.

           He runs over to his horse and grabs the reins.  He walks 
           it towards Naomi.

           He pulls out a compass from his saddle bag.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Do you know how to use one of 
                        these?

                                 NAOMI
                        No.

                                 DAVID
                        Hold it out in front of you, away 
                        from anything metal.  

           He puts it in her hands and holds it out in front of her.

                        The arrow here always points 
                        north.  You see?  And that line is 
                        west.  

           She nods.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        San Francisco is going to be in 
                        between them, but it’s a long ways 
                        away.

                                 NAOMI
                        I know.

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t know what else is out 
                        there.  Just stay on that path and 
                        pray you come across something 
                        settled.

           He hands her the reins of his horse.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Here.  He’s yours.  Keep him 
                        watered and don’t ride him too 
                        hard and he’ll get you to 
                        California.  

           She cries.

                                 NAOMI
                        Thank you, David.  

                                 DAVID
                        You best get going.  They’re gonna 
                        know you’re gone in a couple 
                        hours.  Get some distance between 
                        you.

           She leans in slowly and kisses the side of his mouth.  He 
           allows her to hold it there momentarily.

           He helps her into the saddle.  They share one last glance 
           before she spurs the horse away.

           EXT. MOUNT HERMON STREETS - MORNING

           Marisol stumbles into town distressed and dishevelled.  
           She is soaked from sweating, her eyes red as apples.  She 
           trips onto store patios and front porches in town.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She cries quietly to herself, grabbing at people in town 
           as she passes them.  They come out of their homes and 
           stores to watch her.

                                 MARISOL
                        Help me...I need help...Where is 
                        Abraham?

           They whisper behind her as she makes her way towards town 
           hall. 

                                 MARISOL (CONT’D)
                        Please...Something is very 
                        wrong...I need help...I need 
                        Abraham.

           She walks onto the porch in front of Silas’s meat store.  
           He walks out of his door in time to catch her as she 
           collapses.  

           Marisol lies on the wooden porch.  Silas’s hand props up 
           her head.  Her eyes dart from face to face.  Finally, she 
           sees Abraham move through the crowd and tower above her.

           She jumps to her knees and hugs his legs.  He places his 
           hands on her chin and looks her in the eyes.

                                 MARISOL (CONT’D)
                        Abraham...there is something wrong 
                        with me...help me...please?

                        I last saw him at 
                        Hoot’s...drinking whiskey with 
                        that cut-up whore.

           Abraham nods.  He places his hands on Marisol’s head.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        You are infected, Marisol.  A 
                        thorn in the flesh and worm in 
                        your soul.

           Marisol grabs his hands and kisses them and rubs them on 
           her cheek and neck.

                                 MARISOL
                        Tell me what to do...please...help 
                        me?

                        Yes, Abraham.

           Anne and Lorena pick up the bottom of their dresses and 
           scurry off.  Silas picks up Marisol and cradles her 
           firmly in his arms.  Her body grows limp, but her eyes 
           are locked on Abraham.

                                 ABRAHAM
                                 (to Marisol)
                        For the sins of those you have 
                        loved, you must also suffer.  Your 
                        malediction like your beauty is a 
                        curse, for which I am your only 
                        panacea.  

           Abraham nods to Silas and he takes her away.

           EXT. MOUNT HERMON STREETS - AFTERNOON

           David walks into town haggard and sore from the long walk 
           back.  The wind blows dried weeds and loose dirt around, 
           catching some in small whirlwinds on the street.

           INT. HOOT’S BROTHEL - SAME

           The bar is full of men from town, including Abraham, 
           Isaac, Monte, Dale, and three new strangers:  WILLIAM 
           (late 50s) is the father of the other two - twins named, 
           JOHN and GEORGE (30s).  They are dressed in proper New 
           England attire and speak in according accents.  

           The prostitutes are scattered around the room, sitting 
           among the men.  They occasionally get up to gather more 
           drinks.

           Abraham sits towards the front of the room.  As always, 
           he plays to the gallery of attentive listeners.

                        As it were, no one dared raise an 
                        eyebrow to us.  We were killing 
                        more Yankee malefactor than an 
                        entire regiment.  On paper, we

                        certain jurisdictions.  

           His audience laughs.  

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        I believe General Lee referred to 
                        us as the Hangmen Militia.  

                                 JOHN
                        You met General Lee?

           Abraham laughs.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        A man who’s name no doubt draws 
                        blasphemy from you Bostonians.

           The room laughs again.  Abraham nods.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        I met him...once.

           EXT.  MANASSAS, VIRGINIA - FLASHBACK

                                 ABRAHAM (V.O.)
                        It was Virginia...right after the 
                        Second Battle of Manassas.  

           On a large flat field, a sizeable contingency of 
           uniformed Confederate soldiers shooting from behind a 
           vast string of boulders, stand to get overrun by an even 
           larger number of uniformed Union forces.  

           A young Abraham steps out front and calmly leads his 
           small militia straight towards the Union forces, as if 
           they were invincible.  The ground explodes next to him 
           and rounds kick up dirt around his feet.  They shoot and 
           kill many Union soldiers.  

                                 ABRAHAM (V.O. CONT’D) (CONT’D)
                        You Yankees refer to it as the 
                        Second Battle of Bull Run.
           EXT. MANASSAS, VIRGINIA - FLASHBACK, LATER

           On the same large field bodies litter the ground of both 
           forces.  Smoke rises from the scorched earth into the 
           light mist floating in the air.  

                                 ABRAHAM
                        It was a beautiful day to behold.  
                        Only the brushes of war can stroke 
                        a canvas so vividly.  

           Through the mist a band of Confederate officers appear.  
           They are led by General Robert E. Lee.  They stop and 
           observe Abraham and his militia.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Sulfur filled our lungs, our mind 
                        and senses sharpened by battle and 
                        crimson...and death.  We rode out 
                        to pay homage to our comrades 
                        after the final shots had been 
                        fired.

           Abraham’s militia pillages the battlefield.  One of his 
           men cuts the ears off a Union soldier.  Another scalps 
           the head of a dead black drummer boy.  

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        I happened upon General Lee’s 
                        detail.  He introduced me to his 
                        dedicated staff and we spoke about 
                        the battle.

           Others dig through the pockets of the dead, stealing 
           boots and pulling teeth.  Abraham rides approvingly 
           between them on his tall palomino.

           The Confederate Soldiers are repulsed by their actions.  
           General Lee stares down Abraham.  His eyes burn with 
           anger at the sight of their deportment.  He shakes his 
           head in disgust.  Abraham returns the scowl with a coy 
           smile.

           INT. HOOT’S BROTHEL - SAME

           All eyes are on Abraham.  He has his audience captivated.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Then he asked me to dine with him.  

                                 GEORGE
                        What did you say?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Oh...I respectfully declined.  I 
                        told him I had a pretty little 
                        buckle bunny waiting to feed me a 
                        mouthful in Manassas.  

           The room erupts into laughter.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Did you fight in many battles?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        That’s a question a man should be 
                        asking his father.

           A beat.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I have never served in war.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        No true patriot ever does.

           Abraham notices David leaning against the wall next to 
           the door. 

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Ah...David...He’s the one you 
                        should be asking young man.   

           David combs the room and moves towards the bar.  He 
           motions to Hoot, who brings him a beer.  He sets his hat 
           beside his drink and looks over the crowd.

                                 GEORGE
                        Is that true, Mister?  You’ve 
                        fought in a lot of battles?

           A beat.

                                 DAVID
                        Why don’t you just come out and 
                        say what you’re really asking?

           George looks at him disconcertingly.  

           David shrugs his shoulders and tilts his head, waiting 
           for a response.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m not sure-

                                 DAVID
                        -Just ask me if I’ve killed 
                        anyone.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           George becomes uncomfortable and looks around the quiet 
           room for guidance that doesn’t come.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        That’s what you want to know.

                                 GEORGE
                        Well have you?  Killed anyone?

                                 DAVID
                        I’ve fought in many battles.  
                        Obviously you haven’t or you 
                        wouldn’t be asking. 

                                 GEORGE
                        That’s just because I never had a 
                        chance.

           David chuckles to himself.

                                 DAVID
                        Not strangely, I’ve heard that one 
                        before.  Listening and reading 
                        other men’s stories about killing 
                        and war have become a substitute 
                        for participation.  

           The room is dead silent.   

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        But then you get a little older 
                        and realize you’re not half the 
                        man as the fella whose stories you 
                        admire so much...

           He takes a sip from his beer.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You hunger to be a hero...you long 
                        to know what it is to kill your 
                        enemies...to bleed...to scar... 
                        And then you wake up one day and 
                        it’s too late.  You’ve lost the 
                        courage of your youth...or hate 
                        yourself when you realize you 
                        never had it.

           David pulls out his tobacco and rolls a cigarette.

                                 JOHN
                        Are you calling us cowards, 
                        Mister?  You don’t think we have 
                        the ingredients?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 DAVID
                        I’m just saying you can’t draw 
                        blood out of a stone.

                                 ISAAC
                        You’re so full of shit.

           David looks at Isaac coldly.  

                                 ABRAHAM
                        The lives of those we’ve killed 
                        remain in our eyes.  The 
                        expression never leaves our 
                        face...As if the wind changed the 
                        second the pin hit the shell.  

           Abraham tilts his head to study David.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        There’s no labor to killing a man.  
                        But for some, it’s living after 
                        that’s work.  I wonder, David.  
                        How many?  You carry a heavy 
                        burden.

                                 DAVID
                        As you should.

           Abraham smiles.  

                                 ABRAHAM
                        My reflection is murderous, but my 
                        conscience is clean.  I am the 
                        righteous hand of God.  I am the 
                        executioner of the Lord’s foul 
                        bane.

           David finishes his beer and slips on his hat as he makes 
           his way to the door.

                                 DAVID
                        And I am his bitter affliction.

           He tips his hat to the room.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Good-night.

           David walks through the door and out into the street.
           INT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S CABIN - NIGHT

           David walks into the house to find it in disarray.  The 
           furniture is toppled over and their belongings have been 
           tossed around the cabin

           He hears some unusual moaning and crying and rushes 
           through the house into the back yard.

           EXT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S HOUSE, BACK YARD - SAME

           Marisol clutches a large knife and rocks back in forth.  
           Her dress is ripped revealing much of her naked body.  
           She is covered in blood oozing from cuts she has sliced 
           into her arms and thighs and stomach.

           Her eyes are blood red and she cries to herself as she 
           rocks.

           Argos lays feet from her in a pool of blood.  He cries 
           softly, barely breathing, barely alive.

           David runs to Marisol and grabs the knife from her hands.

                                 DAVID
                        No...no...no.

           He wraps his arms around her and hugs her closely.  She 
           continues to rock despondently and unresponsively.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        What have you done to yourself?

           He folds her into his arms and picks her up, and carries 
           her inside.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got you now.

           INT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S BEDROOM - HOURS LATER

           David has placed Marisol into a bathtub.  Some of her 
           lacerations have been stitched.  He gently rubs a wet 
           cloth over her body and face.  

           She breathes heavily, her blood-red eyes stare blankly 
           off into space.  

           Argos lies a few feet from the tub wrapped in a blanket.  
           He stares at David.

                                 DAVID
                        We’re leaving in the morning.
           INT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S BEDROOM - DAWN

           David sits on the floor, leaning against the wall in the 
           corner of the bedroom, his pistols resting beside him.  
           His eyes are tired and heavy as he watches Marisol’s 
           restless sleep.  Argos lies at his side.

           EXT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S HOUSE, FRONT YARD - MORNING

           David readies the wagon for their journey. 

           He ties and saddles the horses.  He packs food and makes 
           a bed in the back of the wagon.  

           He searches his belongings for his journal.  He cannot 
           find it.  He remembers that he has left it at the jail.  

           He unties one of the horses and makes his way into town.

           EXT. MOUNT HERMON STREETS - MINUTES LATER

           As David rides into town, he sees several horses tied to 
           the patio and the door to the jail is open.  He dismounts 
           and ties his horse up in an alley between two houses.  He 
           waits and watches.

           Seconds later Abraham, Isaac, Dale, Monte, George, John, 
           and William exit, all carrying rifles from the armory.  
           They mount their horses and slowly make their way out of 
           town in the opposite direction.  

           David watches them ride off.  He looks back towards his 
           cabin and Marisol indecisively.  

           He waits until they are out of sight and moves into the 
           jail.  The armory is wide open and all the rifles are 
           gone.  He uses his keys and opens the desk.  He finds his 
           journal and maps and tucks them away under his shirt.  

           He mounts his horse in the middle of the street.  He 
           again stares back towards his cabin, but turns and starts 
           towards Abraham and the rest of the group.  

           EXT. OUTSIDE OF MOUNT HERMON - MORNING

           Abraham leads as they ride south.  The Davis Mountains 
           stand tall, its ridges looming all around them.  They 
           follow a trail through the mystical terrain.

           Abraham sings in Latin and whistles to himself as he 
           takes in the beauty of the country.  It is a beautiful 
           song.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 WILLIAM
                        What is that?  That song?  

           Abraham smiles, gratified by the question.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        It’s a setting of Psalm 51, called 
                        Miserere.  Because of its beauty 
                        it was forbidden by Pope Urban the 
                        Eighth to be transcribed or played 
                        outside of the Sistine 
                        Chapel...Rome. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Who stole it then?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        A fourteen year-old boy named 
                        Mozart heard it one morning during 
                        service.  Later that day he wrote 
                        it down entirely from memory and 
                        gave it to the world. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        And where did you hear it?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        The Sistine Chapel.

           Abraham closes his eyes and continues the song.  The 
           riders trail behind him in awe.

           David watches them from the top of a short hill.  He 
           hides behind a large boulder.

           EXT. DEEP INSIDE DAVIS MOUNTAINS - LATER

           The terrain around them has become more rugged.  Abraham 
           leads them down a worn path between two steep draws.  

           They enter a clearing and come upon a prison sitting in 
           the middle of a camp.  It is almost completely walled 
           with bars and is roofed by thin, rotting wood.  Buzzards 
           fly overhead.

           Inside the prison are two dozen Mexican men, women, and 
           children.  They are filthy and malnourished and 
           desperate.  At the sight of Abraham and the others, they 
           draw back from the bars and collapse into the middle.

           CONTINUED:

           A short distance away from the prison, a tent has been 
           erected.  A large kettle steams over an open fire.  

           Jedidiah walks out of the tent, half-dressed, dragging a 
           disheveled and distraught, young Mexican girl, MARIA 
           (20).  She is very attractive, with big brown eyes and 
           dark skin.  Her hair is black and matted.  She obediently 
           squats down next to the fire.

                                 JEDIDIAH
                        Morning, Gentlemen.

                                 ISAAC
                        How do you bed down with this 
                        filth?

                                 JEDIDIAH
                        I clean her up before I lay with 
                        her..  

           Isaac looks at Jedidiah and the girl with disgust.  

                                 JEDIDIAH (CONT’D)
                        I aim to marry her, Abraham.

                                 ISAAC
                        You’re not bringing that into our 
                        town.

           Jedidiah tends the kettle, ignoring Isaac’s scowl.  

           Abraham leads the group over to the cell.  The Mexicans 
           inside cry and howl and push each other towards the bars 
           as the men dismount their horses.

                                 ISAAC (CONT’D)
                        They’re as savage as a meat axe.

           Abraham turns to Isaac and nods to him a fatherly grin.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Pick your prey, Gentlemen.  It’s a 
                        flat rate.

           William, John, and George study the Mexican’s.  William 
           points to a Mexican man his age (50s).  He fights to hide 
           himself but the rest of the prisoners push him to the 
           gate of the jail.  Monte pulls him out and forces him to 
           the ground.

           George points to a young Mexican woman (20s).  She too is 
           forced to the gate and pulled out by Monte.

           John looks at George disgusted.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s in our blood.

           John turns towards the prisoners and picks out a young 
           Mexican man (20s).  He is the last to be pushed to the 
           gate and pulled out by Monte.  

           EXT. DEEP INSIDE DAVIS MOUNTAINS, OUTSIDE OF ENCAMPMENT - 
           SAME

           David squats behind some rocks and brush and watches from 
           a distance on top of a spur.  The three Mexican prisoners 
           picked out are now eating a bowl of food around a fire 
           and passing around water and whiskey.  The men hover 
           around them, watching and laughing.

           David pulls out his maps.  He looks around to orient 
           himself and circles an area in the mountains.  He takes 
           out his journal and sketches the encampment.  

           EXT. DEEP INSIDE DAVIS MOUNTAINS, ENCAMPMENT - SAME

           The men stand over the Mexicans and watch as they lick 
           their bowls clean.  

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Gentlemen, make your preparations.  

           William, George, and John load their rifles and pistols.  
           At the sight the Mexican prisoners plead and cry.

           Abraham calmly instructs them to rise.  He huddles them 
           close and speaks to them with a gentle voice.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                                 (in Spanish)
                        Do not be afraid.  Freedom awaits 
                        you, if God so chooses.  You are 
                        at the mercy of his grace, and the 
                        aim of these three men.  If you 
                        make it back to Mexico, we will 
                        not hunt you down.  

           The Mexicans begin to cry and point to there bare feet.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                                 (in Spanish)
                        We will give you a gift.  One 
                        hour.

           He pulls a watch from his pocket and clicks it.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Your time begins now.

           The young Mexican male and female immediately take off 
           along separate paths in full sprint towards Mexico.  The 
           older male runs over to William and drops to his knees.  
           He cries and kisses William’s hand and begs for his life.

           William stares at him with an uncertain anxiety.  Isaac 
           walks over and pulls the Mexican’s head back.  He points 
           to the buzzards flying above them and pulls out his 
           watch.  He makes ticking sounds with his tongue into the 
           Mexican’s ear and dangles the watch in front of his face.

           The Mexican breaks into a full on sob and stands up.  He 
           takes a last look at Abraham, who nods and tips his hat.  
           He finds the sun in the east, and turns and begins a slow 
           walk west.  

                                 DALE
                        Don’t look like your hombre’s 
                        gonna give you much of a hunt, Old 
                        Timer.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Just the same.  

           He charges his rifle.  Dale rolls his eyes, his face 
           mocking William’s courage.

                                 DALE
                        It’s your dime.

           David watches from the same spot as before.  He watches 
           as the men eat around the fire.  His eyes are heavy and 
           he is tired.  

           He rests against the rocks.  He pulls out his pistols and 
           inspects the chambers.  He chews on a piece of jerky and 
           drinks water.  He closes his eyes for a few seconds.  His 
           head slowly drops before he wakes himself up.  

           He turns back to find the men mounting their horses.  He 
           watches as they split up.  Dale rides out with William.  
           Monte rides out with John.  George is escorted by Isaac 
           and Abraham.

           David runs to his horse and packs his things into the 
           saddle.  He mounts and heads out in the direction of 
           Abraham and Isaac.

           EXT. DEEP INSIDE DAVIS MOUNTAINS, OUTSIDE OF ENCAMPMENT - 
           LATER

           David follows Abraham, Isaac, and George from a safe 
           distance.  He dismounts as they come to a stop.  George 
           raises his rifle and fires.

           The Mexican girl, now walking, ducks after hearing the 
           shot.  It lands a good five feet from her.  She jumps 
           behind a rock and begins to cry.  Seconds later, she is 
           running.  

           A second round zips by her.

           George misses shot number three and takes off on his 
           horse in the direction of the girl.

           Abraham and Isaac laugh to one another and chase after 
           him.  

           EXT. DEEP INSIDE OF DAVIS MOUNTAINS - SAME

           David watches the scene from above, hidden in the 
           mountains.  He is visibly torn by what to do.

           EXT. DEEP INSIDE DAVIS MOUNTAINS - SAME

           The Mexican girl is running through brush.  Her tattered 
           clothes are falling off of her.  Her face, arms, and legs 
           rip from lacerations as she pushes through the jagged 
           vegetation.  Dirty tears stream down her cheeks.

           A round goes through her shoulder and she drops to the 
           ground.  She picks herself up slowly and turns to see 
           George is no more than 50 meters from her.

           She stares at him as he raises his rifle and aims.  A 
           round goes through her neck as she drops to the earth.  

           George watches as the girl squirms on the ground.  Isaac 
           and Abraham ride up behind him.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Go ahead, Son.  Put another one in 
                        her.  

           George hesitantly raises his rifle and fires until the 
           girl grows still.

           exhilarated expression plastered across his face.

           David watches as the men move to the girl.  He is visibly 
           upset.

           EXT. DEEP INSIDE DAVIS MOUNTAINS - MOMENTS LATER

           Abraham, Isaac, and George stand above the dead girl.  
           She lies in a pool of blood, her eyes wide open.  

           Abraham reaches behind his back and pulls out a large 
           knife with a white bone handle.  He hands it to George 
           who looks at him quizzically.  

                                 ABRAHAM
                        You have to take the scalp, 
                        George.

                                 GEORGE
                        Nah, that’s alright.  

                                 ISAAC
                        You wanna remember your first 
                        kill, don’t you?

                                 GEORGE
                        I won’t forget this.  Ever.

           He laughs uncomfortably.  He tries to hand the knife back 
           to Abraham who doesn’t take it.  

           Abraham winks and nods to the girl.  George slowly kneels 
           next to her and fumbles with the knife.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Doesn’t take much.  Just a quick 
                        slit and pull.  

                                 ISAAC
                        I guarantee you she’d take yours.  
                        They’re as savage as Injuns.

           George’s hands tremble as he hesitantly saws away at her 
           hairline.  He cuts slowly and pulls the girl’s bloody 
           scalp from her head.  
           EXT. DEEP INSIDE DAVIS MOUNTAINS - SAME

           David watches as George finishes scalping the girl.  He 
           holds it up to the sky and howls like a wolf. 

           David sees Abraham staring in his direction.  They make 
           eye contact momentarily.  Abraham smiles and tips his hat 
           to David, who jumps behind the rocks.  

           He gathers himself and turns back towards the men.  
           Abraham hands Isaac a short handled shovel from his 
           saddle before he and George ride back the way they came.  

           David watches them leave and stays with Isaac.  Isaac 
           pretends to dig until Abraham is out of sight.  He packs 
           the shovel and throws the dead girl on his horse and 
           rides west.

           David mounts his horse and tracks him.

           EXT. RIO GRANDE - LATER

           David rides behind a tree and watches as Isaac approaches 
           the river.  

           Isaac rides into the middle of the Rio Grande.  He flips 
           the dead girl off his horse and watches as she slowly 
           gets caught in the current and drifts down river.

           He turns and slowly rides back towards Mt. Hermon.  Once 
           he is out of sight, David pulls out his map and marks it.  
           He looks around and quickly sketches the terrain.

           He repacks his gear and strides back to Mount Hermon as 
           quickly as he can.

           EXT. MOUNT HERMON STREETS - LATER

           David trots through Mount Hermon on his way back to the 
           cabin.  

           There is no one on the streets or on porches.  He looks 
           around suspiciously as he rides through town.

           EXT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S CABIN - MINUTES LATER

           David arrives to find the town has gathered at his cabin.  
           They are packed inside or outside watching and talking 
           through the windows.  

           David dismounts his horse and pushes his way through the 
           crowd.

                        doing here?  Where’s Abraham?

           INT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S CABIN - SAME

           David fights his way to the bedroom, pushing everyone in 
           his path out of the way.  They hush and whisper as he 
           passes by.

                                 DAVID
                        Marisol!  

           He reaches his bedroom door and looks inside.  Marisol is 
           tied to the bed, shaking, and lying in a pool of sweat.  

           Abraham stands over her, whispering into her ear.  He 
           gently presses a cross into her forehead.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck are you doing to my 
                        wife?

           Abraham walks to the edge of the bed.  He presents the 
           Bible in his hands and smiles malevolently.  

                                 ABRAHAM
                        She’s not yours anymore, David.  

           Suddenly Hoot, Morris, and Silas appear from inside the 
           room.  Silas pushes David back into the crowd and Hoot 
           slams the door in his face.  

           The crowd mobs David.  They beat and curse and push him 
           back outside of the cabin and throw him back into the 
           front yard.  

           He screams defiantly at them, his eyes turning red and 
           wet with rage.  

           He finds his horse and mounts.  He turns and rides back 
           towards town.

           INT. GENERAL STORE - MOMENTS LATER

           David rampages through the store.  He dumps the contents 
           out of every bottle and jar he can find and fills them 
           with kerosene.  He tears away sheets of cloth, soaks them 
           quickly in the gas, and stuffs them into the lids of the 
           bottles.

           He packs them into his saddle bag and walks towards the 
           door, leaving a trail of kerosene behind him.

           He pulls out a match and lights it, tossing it back into 
           the store, setting it aflame.  

           EXT. MOUNT HERMON STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           David rides down the street lighting the cocktails.  He 
           stops indiscriminately in front of various stores and 
           houses and tosses them through the windows leaving in his 
           wake smoke and flames.  

           He runs out of cocktails towards the edge of town.  He 
           rides to Hoot’s and dismounts.  He loads himself up with 
           ammo and rope and handcuffs and slaps his horse away.  

           INT. HOOT’S BROTHEL - SAME

           Isaac plays on the piano.  George, John, and William sit 
           at a table with some prostitutes drinking whiskey and 
           beer, bragging about their kills.  George wears the scalp 
           of the Mexican girl on his head, the brown hair falling 
           around his shoulders. 

           Monte and Dale kick back at the table next to them 
           listening entertained.  

                                 JOHN
                        I missed the first five shots!  I 
                        picked the fastest Mexican out of 
                        the bunch.  

           William and George laugh.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        He damn near got to the river!  
                        Monte said that’s the farthest any 
                        Mexican has made it yet.  

           He takes a pull from his beer and slams it down.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                                 (to Monte)
                        That was a damn fine hunt.  Wasn’t 
                        it Monte?

           Monte shrugs his shoulders and nods.

           The front door slams open and the room goes quiet.  David 
           walks in slowly and surveys the room.  His face is 
           painted with anger.  

           He pushes back his jacket and slowly removes a pistol.  
           No one budges.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He holds it out to his side and continues to scan their 
           faces.

                                 ISAAC
                        What are you going to with that?

           David turns his stare to Isaac and slowly raises his 
           pistol.  He pulls the trigger and the back of George’s 
           head explodes, knocking the scalp to the floor.  Everyone 
           ducks behind or under a table.  David quickly draws his 
           other pistol and holds them both in front of him.

                                 DAVID
                        Sit up.  Everyone.  

           They slowly rise back to their seats.  William looks at 
           George and begins to cry and whimper.  David motions to 
           the girls at the table.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You and you...grab everyone’s 
                        pistols and bring them to me.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You killed my son.

           The girls hesitate.

                                 DAVID
                        Do it!

           They quickly move about the room gathering the guns.  
           They drop them carefully at David’s feet.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Girls...you may want to leave now.  

           All of the women rush to the door and out into the 
           street.  

           David pulls out a pair of handcuffs and tosses them to 
           Isaac, who is back on the piano seat defiantly.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Cuff yourself to the leg.

           Isaac moves slowly to the floor and cuffs his wrist to 
           the piano leg.

                                 ISAAC
                                 (sarcastically)
                        Heard your wife’s sick?  Is she 
                        okay?

           David walks over and kicks Isaac in the chest.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           He makes his way to the bar and grabs a bottle of whiskey 
           and takes a pull.  He studies John and William, who are 
           still crying.

                                 DAVID
                        How much did you pay to come here?

           A beat.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        What were those Mexicans worth?

           John and William sit silently, uncertain if they should 
           answer.  David grabs a glass from the bar and throws it 
           at them.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        How much?!

                                 JOHN
                                 (stuttering)
                        Two-hundred dollars per hunt.

                                 DAVID
                        Hunt?  You call that a hunt?  

           A beat.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Answer me!

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t know...I don’t know.

           John cries and pisses down his leg.  

                                 DAVID
                        Why are you here old man?

           William shakes his head.  David grabs another glass and 
           throws it at him.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Because...because we wanted to 
                        kill something.

                                 DAVID
                        Something...or someone?

           William tries to regain his composure.  

                                 WILLIAM
                        Someone...We wanted to know what 
                        it felt like to kill someone.

           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 DAVID
                        You didn’t kill anyone...you 
                        murdered them.  There’s a 
                        difference.  You feel it don’t 
                        you?

           William nods and continues to sob.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Are you scared?

           William nods.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Well, I’m gonna let you kill and I 
                        ain’t even gonna charge you.

           David grabs a pistol from the pile on the floor and walks 
           over and sets it onto the table in front of John.  He 
           studies him for a second and steps back to the bar.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You’re going to pick up that 
                        pistol and shoot Monte in his ugly 
                        fucking face, or I’m going to 
                        shoot your father dead.

           John looks at the gun and sobs.  He sets his trembling 
           hands on the table and shakes his head.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        In fact, go on and shoot Dale as 
                        well.  I don’t much like his face 
                        either.

           Monte and Dale are frozen.  They stare at David in 
           complete fear.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Pick up the pistol, boy.

           John’s hands shake furiously as he grabs his hair and 
           looks over at Dale and Monte.  

           David raises his pistol and points it at William.  

           John slowly picks up the pistol.  He is lost in fear and 
           confusion and tears.  He lazily points the gun at the 
           Dale and Monte.

           David charges his pistol which straightens John’s aim.  
           Dale and Monte push their chairs back slowly and hold 
           their hands up.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (4)

                                 MONTE
                        Don’t do it, John.  Please.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m giving you five seconds.  
                        Five...Four.

           The pistol shakes in John’s hand.  He closes his eyes and 
           fires.  He shoots holes in various parts of Monte, Dale, 
           and the bar until the rounds are expended.  

           Monte and Dale fall dead onto the floor in pools of 
           blood.  John drops the gun onto the table and buries his 
           face into his hands.

           David rests his pistol back into his holsters and relaxes 
           into a stool at the bar.  He locks eyes with Isaac who 
           stares at his friends lying dead on the floor.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You say one word, and I’m going to 
                        have his Father put one in your 
                        dome.

           David takes a drink.  

           Abraham walks in with Morris, Silas, and Hoot.  They 
           examine the carnage.  

           David takes another sip of whiskey and turns towards 
           Abraham.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Your town’s on fire.

           Abraham smiles.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        You’ve turned my little Heaven 
                        into Purgatory.  

           David regards John and William.

                                 DAVID
                        I had help.

           Abraham walks around the room, nudging the bodies with 
           his boot.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Marisol?

           Abraham smiles.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Where she belongs.   

           He quickly draws a pistol from his holster.  David draws 
           in kind.  Abraham takes aim and shoots John and William 
           in the head, killing them instantly.  He puts the pistol 
           back into his holster and smiles.

           More people from town fill the room looking to punish 
           David for the fires.  He watches them enter from his 
           stool.  Silas releases Isaac from the cuffs.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                                 (to the crowd)
                        Some men walk the earth their 
                        entire lives, driven by a force 
                        deeper than their own 
                        comprehension.  It’s not God or 
                        love or fame they seek...it’s 
                        revenge.

           David’s eyes follow Abraham as he marches around the 
           room.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        I’ve known you’d be coming, David, 
                        for quite some time.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN, HELENA, TEXAS - FLASHBACK

           A young David looks up at a younger Abraham towering 
           above him after he has killed his father.  David’s view 
           of Abraham is momentarily obstructed by the glaring sun 
           beside his head.  

           As Abraham puts on his hat, he blocks the sun revealing 
           his face.

           INT. HOOT’S BROTHEL - PRESENT, SAME

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I took pleasure in killing your 
                        father.  He was foul a man with 
                        loose principles.  

           David chuckles to himself.  

                                 DAVID
                        You think I’m here for revenge.  
                        You think too highly of yourself, 
                        Abraham.

           He reaches into his saddle bag and pulls out a piece of 
           folded cloth.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I hardly have a memory of my 
                        father.  You were nothing more to 
                        me here than youthful intrigue. 

           He tosses the folded piece of cloth to Abraham.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I’m a Texas Ranger.  I was sent 
                        here by the Governor himself.  All 
                        these Mexicans you’ve been killing 
                        are floating up in the same 
                        strainer a couple miles down 
                        river.  One was some Mexican 
                        general’s nephew.

           David laughs.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Revenge?

           Abraham unwraps the cloth and holds up the knife.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        This news is shocking to me, 
                        David, though it seems you have 
                        some bad information.  You see we 
                        bury the bodies.  Mexicans 
                        decompose rather quickly.

           David looks at Isaac.  

                                 DAVID
                        How dirty did you get the shovel 
                        today, Isaac?

           A look from Abraham draws fear in Isaac.

                        Don’t believe him, Father.  He’s 
                        lying.  
                                 (to David)
                        You’re a fucking liar!

                                 DAVID
                        I bet it won’t take them long to 
                        find that little, scalpless 
                        Mexican girl you dumped today.

           Isaac’s face goes white.  Abraham walks over to him.

                        Father, I can explain.

           Abraham slaps him with the back of his hand repeatedly 
           until Isaac is on the floor hugging his leg, begging him 
           to stop.

           Abraham pushes him away.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        You’re as crippled as your mother 
                        was.  

           Abraham turns to David.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        I suppose I’ll have to try 
                        again...with a new wife.

                                 DAVID
                        I’ll kill Marisol before I let you 
                        have her.  

           A beat.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I have a better idea.

           Abraham turns back to Isaac.  

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Are you ready to redeem yourself?

                                 ISAAC
                        Please, Father.  Anything.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Drop your pistols, David.  They’ll 
                        be no more shooting today.

           He tosses the bundled knife back to David.

           EXT. MOUNT HERMON STREETS - LATER

           The town has formed a circle around Isaac, David, and 
           Abraham.  A light snow drops from a grey sky.  Behind 
           them, much of the town is in flames.  Smoke and ash 
           caught in the breeze mixes with the snow and floats by 
           them.

           David and Isaac are stripped down to boots and pants.  
           The shiver from the cold and fear.  David holds his 
           father’s knife tightly in his hand.  They face off a few 
           meters from one another, Abraham between them.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Good people of Mount Hermon, 
                        you’re about to witness a Helena 
                        Duel, the most honorable of  
                        duels.  

           He reaches into a pouch on his belt and pulls out a 
           shiny, short-bladed knife and holds it up for all to see.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        I took David’s father with this 
                        knife thirty years ago.  The one 
                        he holds in his grip is stained 
                        with my blood from the same duel.  

           He hands his knife to Isaac.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        And now it will surely drip 
                        crimson with my son’s.  

           Abraham grabs a bottle of whiskey from Hoot and takes a 
           long drink.  He hands it to David.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        But to the victor come the spoils.

                                 PORTENCE
                        He should be hung for what he done 
                        to our town!

           Abraham quickly turns to Portence, silencing her with his 
           gaze.  

           David takes a pull from the bottle of whiskey and throws 
           it to Isaac.  He catches it and pulls a large gulp from 
           the bottle.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        If Isaac lives, he is forgiven for 
                        his doltishness.  If David is 
                        victor...well...I’m sure God will 
                        speak to me on that matter.

                                 DAVID
                        I want Marisol back.  You tell God 
                        that.

           Abraham smiles and motions them to come together.  They 
           extend their arms and take hold of the other’s.  Abraham 
           wraps their arms together in buckskin.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ISAAC
                        You can scream at him yourself, 
                        though I doubt he will hear you 
                        from hell.

           Isaac and David stare at one another.  The are perfectly 
           matched in height and weight and physical strength.  

                                 DAVID
                        I got my own road there, and it’s 
                        not on any map you’ve drawn up.  

           Abraham finishes arranging the buckskin.  Isaac and David 
           pull at one another to make sure it’s secure.  

           Abraham remains between them.  He grabs them by the 
           shoulders and the three begin to spin.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        You shall pour out each other’s 
                        blood...and we will cover it with 
                        dust.

           Abraham slowly lifts his hands from their shoulders and 
           steps away.

           Isaac and David are visibly dizzy.  Isaac thrusts at 
           David several times, but David is able to dodge the 
           strikes.

           David regains his equilibrium first and is able to cut 
           Isaac several times in the stomach.  Isaac cries out in 
           pain and thrust back cutting David’s arms.

           They move about in a circle.  Isaac continues to thrust 
           cutting him in various places until David is able catch 
           him off balance and lock his arm.  He wrestles Isaac to 
           the ground, pinning him helpless, stabbing him repeatedly 
           with great veracity.  

           Portence breaks through the crowd and hits David in the 
           side of the head with large piece of wood knocking him 
           off of Isaac.

           Abraham grabs Portence by the neck, lifting her from her 
           feet and tossing her back into the crowd.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Stay back you foolish woman!

           Isaac rises to his feet with a handful of sand, throwing 
           it into David’s face, blinding him.  David swings 
           aimlessly, trying to clear his eyes as Isaac cuts him 
           over and over.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           David slowly regains his vision.  They are both weak and 
           pools of blood form at their feet.  David is full of 
           rage.  They circle each other slowly taking quick jabs.

           Isaac swings and misses.  David pulls him closer and 
           thrusts his blade into Isaacs neck.  He gasps and drops 
           his knife, reaching for his throat.  

           David trips him to the ground.  He grabs Isaac’s knife 
           from the blood soaked sand and stabs him in the eye, 
           killing him.

           He pulls his knife from Isaac’s throat and cuts himself 
           free of the buckskin.  He is badly wounded and bleeding 
           everywhere.  

           He walks a few feet and stares at the crowd, and the town 
           burning behind them.  He faints and falls to the ground.

           INT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           David’s eyes open slowly.  He wakes in his bed to find 
           Marisol re-dressing his wounds.  She sings the beautiful 
           song she sang to him during the journey.  She does not 
           David has woken.

           David lies still, watching her clean his wounds silently.  
           He smiles.  All is normal.  

           He painfully lifts his arm to touch her, but she pushes 
           it down coldly.

                                 MARISOL
                        Please don’t.  You’ll pull your 
                        stitches out and bleed everywhere.  

           Pain floods his body.

                                 DAVID
                        Marisol.  

           She ignores him.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Look at me.

           She drops her towel and looks at him.  She is still a 
           little pale, but most of her beauty has returned.  She 
           stares distantly upon him. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Please, can you feel my eyes one 
                        you?

           CONTINUED:

           David sits up slowly.  Marisol leans away, but David 
           grabs her hand and pulls her close.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Can you feel me in your heart?   

           Blood trickles from several of his wounds and he becomes 
           visibly weak.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I need you now.  Please, come back 
                        to me.

           A confused look crosses Marisol’s face.  David’s eyes 
           slowly close as he wobbles to fight from fainting.  She 
           grabs him by the neck and lays him back down gently into 
           the sheets.  

           EXT. DAVID’S DREAM SEQUENCE - FLASHBACK

           A clean, scruffy, and shorter haired David, rides in a 
           uniform down a busy street.  He passes a longer haired 
           Marisol helping a drunk old man walk.

                                 DAVID (V.O.)
                        Farewell to scars and grim hopes 
                        for dying.  Splintered sleep cold 
                        beneath damp sheets.

           They lock eyes as he passes by, equally taken with the 
           other.  

                                 DAVID (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Goodbye the burdens that surround 
                        me hiding.  Survived by uniforms 
                        and gilded feats.

           David turns back to see the old man push Marisol away. 
           She shamefully looks towards David, pushing black hair 
           away from her beautiful face. 

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

           A short bearded, longer haired David and Marisol make 
           love in a spring hidden by thick trees and brush.  She 
           straddles him, clothed in her wet undergarments, her dark 
           body and curves shown through.  

                                 DAVID  (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
                        She breathes new colors to warm my 
                        frigid day...

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

           CONTINUED:

           They sit on the porch of their cabin in Austin.  David 
           has a full beard and Marisol’s hair is longer.  She lies 
           between his legs, staring out to the beautiful hill 
           country, caressing his arms.  He reads the poem aloud to 
           her from his familiar leather journal.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO.

                        Unmasked for me, she takes her 
                        loving slow...

           In the black his voice fades and the voice of Abraham 
           takes over.

           INT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S BEDROOM, 2 DAYS LATER - EVENING

           David wakes in his bed to find Abraham reading the poem 
           from his black leather journal.  

                                 ABRAHAM
                        No sense of time beside her where 
                        I lay...She knows only yearning, 
                        what else is there to know?

           AMBROSE (40), EZRA (40), and PATRICK (40) stand behind 
           him.  They are dressed in expensive suits and boots, with 
           clean felt cowboy hats and thick mustaches.  

           Marisol stands off to the side, near the door.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        That’s beautiful, David.  

           He smiles sincerely.  

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        You’re just full of surprises. 

           David looks from Marisol to Abraham.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        And so are these pictures and 
                        maps.  You’ve been busy...when no 
                        one is watching.

           He points to the maps, drawings, and notes sitting on the 
           night-stand.  He holds up the journal and smiles to 
           Marisol.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for sharing, Marisol.

           CONTINUED:

           She smiles back and turns a glance to David.  He stares 
           back, but sees that she is gone.  There are no remnants 
           of their love left in her.  

                                 MARISOL
                        He asked me to help him escape, he 
                        almost convinced me.

           David turns his head away from her.  He is visibly 
           devastated and angry.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Did he now?

           A beat.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to give you that 
                        opportunity, David.  These 
                        gentleman just arrived back to the 
                        States from a safari in Africa.  
                        They’ve killed animals that God 
                        hasn’t named yet...and now they’re 
                        paying a lot money to kill you.   

           They tip their hats to David who looks at them with 
           disgust.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        You’re obviously disadvantaged at 
                        the moment, so we’re giving you 
                        until the first light.  The time 
                        until then is yours.  

           The men tip their hats to David once more as they make 
           their way out of the room.  

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        I’ve known you for a short time, 
                        but I am a keen observer of men.  
                        You’re a good man, David.  Virtue 
                        has never been an inconvenient 
                        quality for you.  

           David laughs painfully as he sits up.  

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        And for that, I will do right by 
                        you.  

           David pulls a bandage from his arm and examines the 
           wound.  He throws the bloody cloth at Abraham’s feet.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Please get him dressed and fed, 
                        Marisol.  

           She nods and smiles to Abraham as he leaves the room.  
           She pulls the sheets back from the bed and pulls David’s 
           clothing from a trunk.  

           He watches her for a few moments before he stands.  She 
           brings over his clothes and pulls off his bloody 
           undergarments.  He makes no effort to help her.  She 
           pulls off his shirt and pants and he stands completely 
           naked before her.  She avoids looking at his body, 
           focusing only on his chest.

           She picks up a fresh pair of underpants and holds them 
           out.  He remains still, fixated on her beautiful face.

                                 MARISOL
                        Please put these on.

           He doesn’t respond.  She reluctantly kneels down and 
           forces them on one leg at time.  He watches her eyes, 
           hoping she will look at him and feel something.  She 
           turns her head as she rises and pulls the pants up his 
           legs.  

           She grabs a fresh undershirt and holds it out to him.  He 
           refuses to take it and she frowns.  She finally looks at 
           him.  Their long stare is intense.

           He gently takes her hand and pins it against his chest.  
           He slowly moves it down over his stomach.

                                 DAVID
                        Where have you gone?  

           She stares unflinching as he pushes her hand into his 
           underpants.  His breathing grows heavy.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Te ame’ mas que el´ nunca. (I 
                        loved you more than he ever will)

           She thrusts her body behind a slap that firmly crosses 
           his cheek, ripping off a small bandage.  She throws the 
           shirt at his face and storms out of the room.  

           He watches her go.
           EXT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S HOUSE, PATIO - LATER

           David limps onto the front porch.  Abraham, Patrick, 
           Ezra, Ambrose, and Marisol sit atop their horses in the 
           front yard.  Marisol faces the opposite direction.  Argos 
           lies in the shade, wrapped in bandages.  He gets up 
           gingerly and limps over to David.  David leans down and 
           pets his wounded dog.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I’ve placed a rifle and a generous 
                        amount of shells in the wagon.  

           Patrick, Ambrose, and Ezra immediately look over to 
           Abraham with great concern.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Calm, Gentlemen.  I assure you, 
                        hunting is entirely more 
                        entertaining when someone is 
                        firing back at you.  

           He smiles wickedly at them.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        And I imagine young David can 
                        shoot a mans’s pecker through his 
                        watch pocket from a thousand 
                        meters.

                                 PATRICK
                        We did NOT discuss this.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        It’s not negotiable.  And there’s 
                        no refund.  

           Abraham and David are locked in a stare.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Either you hunt, or you don’t.

                                 DAVID
                        I’ll be walking south through town 
                        shortly.  I see anyone on the 
                        street, I’m going to shoot them 
                        dead.

           He glances at Marisol.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Women too.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Abraham nods and smiles.  He nudges his horse and rides 
           off, the other three men follow closely behind.  Marisol 
           turns and takes one last look at Argos, and then David.  

           He kneels and pets his dog.  He looks up at her and meets 
           her gaze.  She turns around slowly and rides away.

           EXT. DAVID AND MARISOL’S HOUSE, PATIO - SUNSET

           David eats and watches a harlequin sunset.  He shares his 
           food with Argos, who rests his head in David’s lap.  

           He kisses the dog’s head.  

                                 DAVID
                        You stay, Argos.  Remind her 
                        everyday of me until I come back 
                        for you.  

           He rises and limps to the wagon.  He grabs the rifle and 
           a pistol belt full of shells.  He grabs a full canteen 
           and throws it over his neck.  

           Argos limps severely behind him, moaning with every step.  
           He stops at the edge of the yard and sits.  He watches 
           and barks as David walks off into the cold night.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Godamn, Mexican whore.

           He doesn’t look back.

           EXT. MOUNT HERMON STREETS - NIGHT

           David walks lamely through town in the middle of the 
           street.  The debris from burned houses and stores have 
           been cleared.  The only remnants remaining are black sand 
           and smoke stains on standing structures.

           He searches windows and alleys, but no one is out.  He 
           clears the town and struggles out towards the mountains.  

           EXT. DEEP INSIDE DAVIS MOUNTAINS - NIGHT

           Series of shots of David faltering down trails into the 
           Mountains.  The cold night passes harshly for him as he 
           struggles through rough terrain and deals with his 
           wounds.  

           Dawn quickly approaches and the sun makes it’s first peek 
           on the horizon.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He rests to drink water and smells something fowl.  He 
           searches the ground for a moment before he looks into the 
           trees.  

           Naomi’s naked body hangs from a branch not far from the 
           trail.  Her throat has been cut and dry blood turned 
           black and dirt litter her frail body.  

           David stares at her, sadness sweeps his face.

           He lightly touches the bottom of her foot and looks up 
           towards a tall peak.  

           EXT. SIDE OF PEAK - MORNING

           David lurches slowly up the peak, stopping every so often 
           to rest.  Several of his bandages have fallen from his 
           skin and bleed through his pants and shirt.

           He reaches the top and finds a few large boulders to rest 
           against.  He scans the trails far below him and sees 
           nothing.  He is tired and weak and cold. 

           He bundles up in his coat and sets his hat on the dirt.  
           He leans up against a large boulder and closes his eyes.

           EXT. DEEP INSIDE DAVIS MOUNTAINS - MORNING

           Ezra, Patrick, Ambrose, and Abraham ride slowly down the 
           trail.  They hold rifles in their laps, their eyes 
           swinging from one side of the trail to the other.

           They ride quietly.  The morning sounds of the lively 
           mountains echo through the silence.

                                 EZRA
                        There’s something I’ve been 
                        wanting to ask you, Abraham.

           His voice shatters the quiet.

                                 PATRICK
                        Shhhhh....

           He lowers his tone.

                                 EZRA
                        Why did you insist I bring two 
                        others?  Why three?  I’d prefer 
                        discretion.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ABRAHAM
                        For the same reason you came 
                        today.  Because they did.  You’re 
                        here, Ezra, because you’ve never 
                        killed a man.  None of you have.  
                        You’re privilege and self-
                        entitlement excused you from the 
                        battlefield and now you hate the 
                        world for your position when you 
                        should hate yourself for your 
                        cowardice.

           Abraham searches the tops of the ridge.  

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Killing a man is never what one 
                        expects it to be.  It’s a visceral 
                        feeling to some, and to other it’s 
                        detestable.  Either way, you need 
                        each other here to do it...Peer 
                        pressure, gentleman.  

           They stare at Abraham, unable to express a reaction.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        And I prefer not to listen to your 
                        tittle-tattle afterwards, so I ask 
                        you bring friends to share it 
                        with, rather than me.

           Patrick is nervous.  He looks to the others for comfort, 
           but he is completely out of his element.

                                 AMBROSE
                        This Ranger...is he famous?  I 
                        mean he burned your city down.    

                                 ABRAHAM
                        He had every reason.  It doesn’t 
                        take a big man to carry a grudge.  

                                 PATRICK
                        Is he a dangerous?

                                 AMBROSE
                        What’s the matter with you, 
                        Patrick?  

                                 EZRA
                        He was terribly wounded.  He’s 
                        probably dead.

           Abraham looks at them sternly.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ABRAHAM
                        No, Gentlemen.  I assure you he is 
                        not dead.  

                                 AMBROSE
                        If he is, I expect a free Mexican.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        You can have the whole lot.

           Abraham stops his horse.  He closes his eyes and lifts 
           his head momentarily towards Heaven.  A shot is fired and 
           echoes through the mountains before the round lodges into 
           Patrick’s forehead.  He drops from his saddle and breaks 
           his neck on the ground.

           Ezra and Ambrose leap from their saddles and duck behind 
           a large boulder just off the trail.  Abraham moves slowly 
           behind them.  

                                 EZRA
                        Fuck...Fuck...He ain’t dead.  

                                 AMBROSE
                        What are we gonna do?

           They look to Abraham who searches the peaks of the ridge 
           for signs of David.  Three more shots echo across the 
           trail.  Two of their horses drop in succession, as the 
           other two run back down the trail.

           Ezra grabs Abraham’s sleeves and buries his face in his 
           coat.

                                 AMBROSE (CONT’D)
                        What are we gonna do?  

           Abraham laughs.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        You were ready to eat the liver of 
                        a Mexican a second ago.  You tell 
                        me.  

                                 AMBROSE
                        He’s killed the horses.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I’ve brought you a battle, 
                        gentleman!  Do not run from this 
                        opportunity.  

           Ezra pulls his head away from Abraham and looks over at 
           Patrick’s dead body. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 EZRA
                        We can’t stay here...I want to go 
                        home...get me home.

           He begins to panic and pull at Abraham.

                                 EZRA (CONT’D)
                        Please.  I don’t want to fight.

           Abraham pushes him against the rock by his throat.  He 
           raises him until his head is above the top of the small 
           boulder.  A shot rings out and a second later Ezra’s head 
           explodes, shooting a red mist over Abraham and Ambrose.  

           Ambrose sits in shock.  The rifle drops from his hands as 
           he moves them over his head.  He stares down the trail 
           they had come.  He rises against the boulder slowly.

           Abraham picks up the rifle and charges it.  

                                 ABRAHAM
                        You’re not worthy of this man.  

           He smiles warmly at Ambrose, then shoots him through the 
           head.  

           The fight between David and Abraham ensues.  David keeps 
           Abraham from gaining any high ground. He puts a few 
           rounds into Abraham who takes them unflinchingly.  He in 
           turn puts a round through David’s arm.

           Abraham runs himself into a dry ravine surrounded by tall 
           cliff walls.  David has run out of rounds.  He uses his 
           rifle for leverage and dislodges a large boulder resting 
           at the top of the cliff.  It rolls over the edge 
           perfectly, hitting Abraham, and pinning him to the 
           ground, his leg crushed and stuck under the boulder.  

           David walks down to him.  Both are in terrible condition, 
           but David looks much more the worse for wear.  He picks 
           up the rifle sitting a few feet from Abraham’s reach and 
           breaks it against the boulder.  

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        What will you do now, David?

           David picks up Abraham’s pistol and points it momentarily 
           at his head, before he slides it into his pistol belt. 

                                 DAVID
                        I’m not gonna kill you.

           Abraham nods.

           CONTINUED: (4)

                                 ABRAHAM
                        You should thank me for killing 
                        your father.  Had he raised you, 
                        you’d not be the fine man that 
                        you’ve become.

                                 DAVID
                        You’re going to die out here 
                        slowly.

           He picks up a few large rocks and lodges them at the base 
           of the boulder, securing it.  

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Am I?

                                 DAVID
                        It’s going to be painful.  The 
                        smell will lead them to your body 
                        in a week. No use screaming 
                        though.  No one will hear you.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I always have an audience, David.

           David grimaces with pain as he watches Abraham search the 
           sky.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Life is painful without her, isn’t 
                        it.  Like life without war.  You 
                        loved your men, and you loved her  
                        because they both needed you. 

           David spits blood from his mouth.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        With no one to care for, we are 
                        forced to look inward and examine 
                        the monsters we truly are.

           He smiles again at David.

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        It is futile for men like you and 
                        I to toil over such things.  

                                 DAVID
                        She was never mine to care for, as 
                        much as I was hers.  

           David reaches into his boot and pulls out the knife he 
           used in the duel, his father’s knife.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (5)

           He steps on Abraham’s shoulder and lodges the knife deep 
           into his forearm.  Abraham winces in pain.  He looks up 
           at David, but his face is lost in the sun that rests in 
           the sky directly behind his head.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Do it yourself.

           David stumbles off of him and limps away.  Abraham 
           studies the knife in his arm and drops his head onto the 
           ground.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I cannot, David.  Killing oneself 
                        is a sure route to Hell!

           He laughs to himself and turns to watch David trip down 
           the trail until he is out of sight.  

                                 ABRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        We are bound to our fates!  I will 
                        see you again!

           EXT. DEEP INSIDE DAVIS MOUNTAINS - LATER

           David picks up a large stick and uses it as a cane to 
           help himself down the trail.  He reaches the bodies of 
           Ambrose and Ezra.  Abraham’s palomino has returned and 
           nudges the bodies of the dead horses.

           David approaches him slowly.  He is able to mount him and 
           continues down the trail.

           EXT. DEEP INSIDE DAVIS MOUNTAINS, CLIFF - SAME

           Abraham tests the weight of the boulder with his free 
           leg.  It does not budge.  He grips the knife stuck in his 
           arm and pulls it out slowly.

           He holds it up and watches the blood drip from it.

           EXT. DEEP INSIDE DAVIS MOUNTAINS, ENCAMPMENT - LATER

           David arrives at the prison.  The Mexican’s inside the 
           bars are haggard and weak, but wake wildly as he 
           dismounts the horse and pulls out the pistol.

           He looks them over as he walks towards the gate.  He 
           raises the pistol and shoots the locks off with 
           precision.  The gates swing open.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DAVID
                        Vayate ahora.  Eres libre.  (Go 
                        now.  You’re free)

           David walks over to the tent and pulls it down, exposing 
           bags of rice and potatoes.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Vayate ahora.  Nadie se lastimo.  
                        (Go.  No one will hurt you.)

           He throws the food towards the jail.  A few of the 
           Mexicans bravely run through the gate and flee.  The 
           others observe David and once they see he is not a 
           threat, they begin to rush out.  They grab the food and 
           run.  

           EXT. DEEP INSIDE DAVIS MOUNTAINS, CLIFF - SAME

           Abraham opens his eyes from a painful slumber.  He 
           whispers something to himself and sits up slowly.  He 
           rises onto the toes of his free leg and thrusts himself 
           up, howling and laughing in pain as he breaks the trapped 
           one.  

           He rips off his shirt violently and tears it into strips.  
           He wraps the strips around his thigh several times and 
           knots it tightly.  

           He picks up the knife and stabs down onto his leg 
           fiercely.  His teeth grind and he drools as he saws away 
           at his leg with the tiny blade.

           EXT. DEEP INSIDE DAVIS MOUNTAINS, ENCAMPMENT - SAME

           Maria is the last through the gate.  She is bruised and 
           battered and can barely walk.  

           David walks over to her.  She makes no effort to fight as 
           he picks her up and carries her to the horse.  He helps 
           her onto the saddle.  He jumps on behind her and pushes 
           towards the border.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. TEXAS GOVERNOR LAWRENCE SULLIVAN ROSS’S OFFICE - SIX 
           MONTHS LATER.

           Governor Ross sits behind his desk reading over papers.  
           Thomas enters escorting GENERAL CALDERON.  He is a 
           distinguished, middle aged man.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He wears a groomed mustache and a neat Mexican uniform 
           decorated with medals.  

           Governor Ross rises and points to a chair across from his 
           desk.  

                                 ROSS
                        Thomas, would you get the General 
                        some tea, please.  And a whiskey 
                        for me.

           Thomas nods and exits the office.

                                 ROSS (CONT’D)
                        General Calderon, to what do I owe 
                        the pleasure? 

                                 GENERAL CALERON
                        I have brought my daughter here to 
                        attend school.  I thought I would 
                        drop by and say hello.

           Ross fakes a cordial smile.

                                 ROSS
                        Good.

                                 GENERAL CALERON
                        I have received no correspondence 
                        from my letters.  No wires.

                                 ROSS
                        There is nothing to communicate.

                                 GENERAL CALERON
                        The killings have stopped, no?

                                 ROSS
                        You know as well as I we haven’t 
                        found a dead Mexican there in six 
                        months.

                                 GENERAL CALERON
                        And what of your investigation?

           Ross becomes visibly agitated.

                                 ROSS
                        There are no more bodies.  There 
                        is nothing more to investigate.

           Thomas returns with a tray of beverages.  He hands some 
           tea to the General and whiskey to the Governor.

                                 GENERAL CALDERON
                        Thank, you.  Sir.

                                 ROSS
                        That will be all, Thomas.  Thank 
                        you.

           Thomas bows and exits the office.

                                 GENERAL CALDERON
                        You sent your Rangers to this town 
                        to corroborate the stories of this 
                        prison, no?

                                 ROSS
                        The prison was never found.  It 
                        doesn’t exist.

           General Calderon becomes impatient.  He sips his tea and 
           looks around the Governor’s office.  

                                 GENERAL CALERON
                        And what of Abraham Brant?  Hmmm?  
                        And the man who freed my people 
                        from the make-believe prison?

                                 ROSS
                        We found Brant.  He was hardly in 
                        a condition to be capable of what 
                        he’s accused.  Regardless, he has 
                        since moved and his whereabouts 
                        are unknown.    

           Ross takes a sip from his whiskey.

                                 ROSS (CONT’D)
                        And the other man you speak of was 
                        a Ranger I sent to investigate.  
                        His name was David Kingston. 

           Ross stares at Calderon and ponders how much he wants to 
           reveal.

                                 ROSS (CONT’D)
                        I never heard from him.  I’ve 
                        inquired to his whereabouts, but 
                        by all accounts he is dead or 
                        missing.  

                                 GENERAL CALDERON
                        Perhaps you’ll allow me to send a 
                        personal detail to search for this 
                        camp and for Mr. Kingston.

                        I don’t think so, General.  We’ve 
                        moved on from this.  

                                 GENERAL CALDERON
                        I do not think that there has been 
                        a suitable resolution to this.  I 
                        can certainly-

                                 ROSS
                        -Will that be all, General?

           The General smiles and sets his tea onto the saucer 
           resting on the desk.  He rises and walks towards the 
           door.  He stops and turns back to the Governor.

                                 GENERAL CALDERON
                        My superior will not be pleased 
                        with this investigation.  If I 
                        could trouble you for a report of 
                        the findings-

                        my people to check in on your 
                        daughter from time to time.

           General Calderon bows defeated and exits the office.  The 
           ending score begins.

           EXT. ROCKY MOUNTAINS, COLORADO - DAY

           In a muted scene, THREE WEALTHY MEN on horseback ride 
           through a half-built town.  Around them familiar faces of 
           folks from Mount Hermon walk about the street.  

           The men reach a cabin on the edge of town.  They ride up 
           to Abraham who rests on a chair on the front patio 
           reading David’s black leather journal.  His left leg is 
           gone above the knee.

           He looks up from the pages and welcomes them with his 
           intoxicating smile.  Marisol walks from the house 
           carrying a child.

           Down the street, beyond the cabin at the edge of town, 
           Argos sits staring into the empty mountains, waiting.

           INT. BEDROOM, VILLA, MEXICO - MORNING

           In a muted scene, David wakes abruptly from a dream.  He 
           stares motionless at the ceiling for a moment, before he 
           sits up and stares through the window.

           Outside of it lies a sleepy Mexican village.  

           David’s wounds are mostly healed.  Two arms wrap around 
           his chest.  Maria kisses his back and neck and ear.  Her 
           hands rub his chest and slowly move down his stomach 
           towards his lap.

           He stares into the village, uncaring, lost in thought.
