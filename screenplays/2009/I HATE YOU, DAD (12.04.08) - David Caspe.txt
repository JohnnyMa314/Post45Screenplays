           SUPER: NEW JERSEY - 1984

           INT. GRADE SCHOOL - MORNING

           13 YEAR OLD DONNY stands with his BUDDIES at his locker.  He 
           pulls out TWO CONCERT TICKETS -- the Buddies ADMIRE them.

                                 13 YEAR OLD DONNY
                        Read em and weep.  Springsteen at 
                        the Meadowlands.  Third row.  I 
                        bagged a lot of groceries to get 
                        these.  Now all I need is a date.  

           Donny looks across the hall: A group of GIGGLING GIRLS talk 
           by their lockers.  The boys evaluate them.

                                 BUDDY
                        You should take Jolene, man.  I bet 
                        she’d let you feel her up.  

                                 13 YEAR OLD DONNY
                        Jolene has an Andy Gibb backpack.  
                        This is The Boss.  Get serious.
                        Ugh, I think I’m just not into 
                        girls anymore.
                             (off his Buddies’ SHOCK)
                        I’m into women.

           Donny NODS toward the end of the hall -- they TURN -- 

           SLOW-MOTION: The sea of kids PARTS -- in STRUTS the hottest 
           teacher of the 1980s, MARY MCGARRICLE (perfect, like if Kate 
           Hudson had big Jersey hair).  SO. HOT. AS. SHE. STRUTS.  

           Buddy SHIVERS -- then covers his crotch with an “A-TEAM” 
           FOLDER.  Donny SMILES coolly, steps forward.

                                 13 YEAR OLD DONNY (CONT’D)
                        Hey Mary, you’re lookin smokin hot 
                        today.  I’ve got two tickets to 
                        Springsteen this weekend, you in?

                                 MARY MCGARRICLE
                             (incredulous)
                        It’s Miss McGarricle, Donny.  And  
                        that’s sweet, but, I’m your 
                        teacher, not your girlfriend.

                                 13 YEAR OLD DONNY
                        Whoa, whoa, Miss McGarricle, who 
                        said anything about girlfriends?
                                 (MORE)
                                 13 YEAR OLD DONNY (cont'd)
                        Let’s just start with a summer 
                        fling - a couple handjobs, no 
                        expectations - see where it goes.  
                        Don’t get all psycho on me right 
                        away.

           His Buddies LAUGH -- Mary McGarricle’s PISSED.

                                 MARY MCGARRICLE
                        You know, I usually only give 
                        handjobs to guys that’ve gone 
                        through puberty.  

                                 DONNY’S BUDDIES
                        Ooooooh!/Burned!

                                 13 YEAR OLD DONNY
                             (goes red, embarrassed)
                        Oh yeah?  Well...um...
                             (PULLS down his shorts 
                              just enough)
                        What time should I pick you up!?

                                 MARY MCGARRICLE
                        That’s a month’s detention!

           INT. MARY MCGARRICLE’S CLASSROOM - AFTER SCHOOL

           Mary McGarricle GRADES A PAPER at her desk.  Donny enters -- 
           she doesn’t look up, she just keeps writing.  Donny DROPS the 
           blinds on the door window.

                                 13 YEAR OLD DONNY
                             (coyly)
                        Oops.  Did I do that?  

                                 MARY MCGARRICLE
                        Sit down, Donny.

                                 13 YEAR OLD DONNY 
                        Whoa, listen, I get that you gotta 
                        act tough in front of the other 
                        kids.  That’s smart.  But, we’re 
                        alone now.  Let your guard down.

           Mary shakes her head, keeps writing.  He walks toward her.

                                 13 YEAR OLD DONNY (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, I’ve seen the way you look 
                        at me in my gym shorts.  It’s okay.  
                        Let yourself have this.  Don’t 
                        worry, I can keep a secret.
                             (she just keeps writing)
                                 (MORE)
                                 13 YEAR OLD DONNY (CONT’D)
                        You’re scared, I’m scared, we’re 
                        all scared.  The world thinks I’m 
                        too young.  But you know what they 
                        say, ”Once you go young, you 
                        never...have had so much fun.”  Or 
                        something.  Who cares what the 
                        world thinks?  Treat yourself.

           He KISSES his bicep.  Mary STOPS writing, looks up.

                                 MARY MCGARRICLE
                        You’re in a lot of trouble, Donny.

                                 13 YEAR OLD DONNY
                             (scared like a kid)
                        Wait, you’re not gonna call my dad, 
                        are you?  He’ll kick my ass.  
                        Seriously.  C’mon, I was just 
                        kidding around.

                                 MARY MCGARRICLE
                        So you don’t want me?

                                 13 YEAR OLD DONNY 
                        What?  No.  I mean, yeah.  I’m not 
                        sure what I’m supposed to say here.

           Mary stands up, walks around the desk slowly.

                                 MARY MCGARRICLE
                        I’ve been watching you since the 
                        first day of school in September.  
                        When you hit that game winning 3 
                        pointer to beat Fairfield Junior 
                        High - God that was so hot.  I’ve 
                        tried to ignore this feeling, cause 
                        I thought it was wrong, but maybe 
                        you’re right, who cares what the 
                        world thinks?

           She stops right in front of him -- he LAUGHS nervously.

                                 13 YEAR OLD DONNY
                        Ha, ha, very funny, Miss 
                        McGarricle.  Hittin me with the old 
                        reverse thing.  I get.

                                 MARY MCGARRICLE
                        No, you don’t.  I think we’re meant 
                        to be together.
           She grabs the PAPER she was “grading”, hands it to him: it’s 
           COVERED in junior high style LOVE DOODLES (Mary+Donny 4 Ever; 
           hearts; etc.).  Donny’s eyes WIDEN.  She UNDOES HER PONYTAIL.

                                 13 YEAR OLD DONNY
                        Ohmigod, is this happening?

                                 MARY MCGARRICLE
                        Oh it’s happening, Donny.  Right 
                        now.

           She puts a HAND through his hair -- he RAMBLES nervously.

                                 13 YEAR OLD DONNY
                        Okay, awesome.  I’m totally in. 
                        But, um, so how do you wanna do it?  
                        I mean - I’ve made love before - a 
                        lot...of ways. How should we start?  
                        Just go straight to handjobs, or --

           She puts a FINGER to his lips.  His voice cracks --

                                 13 YEAR OLD DONNY (CONT’D)
                        I’m - a virgin.

                                 MARY MCGARRICLE
                        Don’t worry.  I’ll teach you.

           HER LIPS APPROACH HIS LIPS AND THEN THEY --

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           A PACKED courtroom.  It’s a MEDIA CIRCUS.  The JUDGE (50, 
           female) SLAMS her gavel!

                                 JUDGE
                        Order.  Order!  
                             (the courtroom settles)
                        I know a lot of people think this 
                        “situation” is every young boy’s 
                        ultimate fantasy.  

           The MALE BAILIFF nods absentmindedly (as do ALL THE MEN).

                                 JUDGE (CONT’D)
                        BUT, that doesn’t change the fact 
                        that this is a serious crime.  
                             (sternly)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JUDGE (CONT’D)
                        The state of New Jersey finds Mary 
                        Beth McGarricle guilty on 15 counts 
                        of statutory rape.

           BEHIND THE DEFENSE TABLE, Mary McGarricle (orange prison 
           jumpsuit) goes WHITE, then turns to the gallery --

                                 MARY MCGARRICLE
                        I love you Donny!

           14 YEAR OLD DONNY stands up in the audience.

                                 14 YEAR OLD DONNY
                        I love you too, Miss McGarricle!

           The room EXPLODES WITH CHATTER -- the Judge SLAMS her gavel!  
           DONNY’S DAD (blue collar, mean) PULLS Donny down roughly.

                                 JUDGE
                             (incredulous)
                        The fact that this “relationship” 
                        has been going on for a year, that 
                        it resulted in a pregnancy, and 
                        that you show no remorse...
                             (shakes her head)
                        Mary McGarricle, rise for 
                        sentencing.

           Mary McGarricle STRUGGLES to get out of her chair -- REVEAL 
           she is 8 MONTHS PREGNANT.  Her LAWYER helps her to her feet.

                                 JUDGE (CONT’D)
                        I have no choice but to levy the 
                        maximum penalty: 30 years in the 
                        Jersey Women’s Penitentiary.
                             (the room ERUPTS)
                        FURTHERMORE, the court grants 
                        custody of the unborn child to 
                        Donny Levine’s father, until Donny 
                        is 18, at which time, he will 
                        assume full custody.

           Donny’s Dad SLAPS Donny on the back of the head.  The Bailiff 
           PULLS Mary McGarricle away -- she TURNS --

                                 MARY MCGARRICLE
                        TAKE CARE OF OUR SON, DONNY!

           FADE TO BLACK
           SUPER: NEW YORK - 25 YEARS LATER

           EXT. MANHATTAN - SUNRISE

           The SUN RISES behind the epic Manhattan skyline.

           EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE - SAME

           A “NEW YORK TIMES” VAN inches down an affluent street as the 
           driver tosses NEWSPAPERS at very expensive townhouses.  We 
           hear a guy SINGING badly but with passion.

                                 SINGING GUY (V.O.)
                        If you want love, we’ll make it,
                        Swim in a deep sea of blankets,
                        Take your big plans and break em,
                        This is bound to be awhile...

           INT. TODD AND STACEY’S TOWNHOUSE, SHOWER - LATER

           Find the singing guy: TODD (25) dances as he showers.  HE’S 
           ON TOP OF THE WORLD.

                                 TODD (SINGING)
                        Your body is a wonderland!
                        I’ll use my hands...

           REVEAL that Todd’s wearing SWIM TRUNKS.  He soaps himself 
           UNDER the trunks, as if that’s TOTALLY NORMAL.

           EXT. TODD AND STACEY’S TOWNHOUSE - LATER

           The DOOR to their EXPENSIVE TOWNHOUSE opens -- STACEY (29, 
           gorgeous, robe) grabs the PAPER excitedly -- TEARS through it 
           to a SECTION -- then looks at it EMOTIONALLY.

                                 STACEY
                        It’s beautiful.    

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           Todd pulls a shirt from his OCD CLOSET (suffocatingly neat, 
           color-coded, etc.) as Stacey SKIPS in, practically singing.

                                 STACEY 
                        How excited are you right now!?
                                 TODD
                        I’d say off the charts, or, like, 
                        right at the edge of the charts.

           She rolls her eyes, then shows him the PAPER: a PHOTO of Todd 
           and Stacey, MID-LAUGH, covers the “WEDDING SECTION”.  DORKY.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        Wow.  I just - I still don’t get 
                        why we did this.  Who announces 
                        their wedding?  I feel like that 
                        only happens on “Sex and the City”.

                        weekend wedding section.  Last year 
                        was Tory Burch.
                             (Todd hasn’t heard of her)
                        C’mon, look how great we look...

                                 TODD
                             (examines the photo)
                        Yeah...I guess we look good, but...

                             (kisses his cheek)
                        We look perfect.    

                                 TODD
                             (smiles)
                        Yeah, we do.  Alright, c’mon honey, 
                        get ready.  The caterer’s coming 
                        and we gotta get to the airport.

                                 STACEY
                        Todd, my parents don’t land for 
                        three hours.  Relax.  

                                 TODD
                        I just want this weekend to be 
                        perfect.

                                 STACEY
                        Stop worrying.  We’re gonna have 
                        the best wedding ever.

                        I just - I mean, this thing’s got 
                        our names, and our picture and 
                        everything.  I just don’t want 
                        people knowing how to...find us.

                        How to find us?  Take a Xanax.  Who 
                        are you so afraid is gonna see 
                        this?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. NEW JERSEY - MORNING

           DONNY (39 now, out of shape, tight jeans, dressed like mid-
           80s Springsteen) leans against an empty above-ground hot tub, 
           nursing a Schlitz wide mouth.  HE’S AT ROCK BOTTOM.

                                 DONNY
                        Hey, hey, listen.  I know what 
                        you’re thinking.  You’re thinking, 
                        “Oh my God, it’s Donny Levine.  I’m 
                        a huge fan.  Can I have a picture 
                        or something that I could send to 
                        my sister who’s totally in love 
                        with you and legitimately hot?”
                             (SWIGS the beer)
                        Don’t worry, I get that all the 
                        time.  Blah, blah, blah, I was one 
                        of Morton Downey Jr.’s most 
                        intriguing people of 1985.  But 
                        that’s not important anymore.  
                             (takes a LONG, SAD SWIG)
                        I mean, that’s not important right 
                        now.  What I’m trying to say 
                        is...that’s not the reason you 
                        should buy this hot tub.

           PULL OUT TO REVEAL a shitty lot full of hot tubs: “DONNY 
           LEVINE’S HOT FOR TEACHER USED HOT TUBS”.  He’s trying to sell 
           a tub to a CONSERVATIVE COUPLE (60s).  He hands them a BOOK.

                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        And, this signed copy of my second 
                        novel - which is a gift either way - 
                        is also not the reason you should 
                        buy this tub.  Though, it’s a 
                        pretty serious potential Ebay gem.  

           SHOT of the BOOK COVER: Young Donny sits pensively on the 
           swings, “EXTRA CREDIT: MORE OF THE DONNY LEVINE STORY”. 

                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        Nope.  The reason you should buy 
                        this perfectly maintained pre-owned 
                        beauty is cause it’s a Whirlington.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        And nothing holds up as good as a 
                        Whirlington.  Not a Beachton, not a 
                        Jetspa, not a Coleman. 

           Donny tries to HOP into the empty tub -- but FALLS IN FACE 
           FIRST instead.  He POPS UP, hurt, but continues to sell.

                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        Eight dual core jets; three speeds; 
                        double reinforced linoleum benches -
                             (caresses the paint)
                        Baby blue splatter celebration 
                        finish?  This is the expensive 
                        champagne of above-ground spas.  
                        And it’s in mint condition.  

                                 WIFE
                             (inspecting the tub)
                        Is that a blood stain?

                                 DONNY
                        Probably.   
                             (stares at the tub SADLY)
                        ...It used to be the life of the 
                        party.  Now it’s just empty inside.

                                 HUSBAND
                        Uh...we’re really just browsing.

                                 DONNY
                        Alright.  Brass tacks: What if I 
                        were to tell you I made love to 
                        Joyce Dewitt in this very hot tub?  

                                 WIFE
                        You mean, like, in this same model?

                                 DONNY
                        Nope, in this actual tub.  Previous 
                        owner’s a buddy of mine.  Well, was 
                        a buddy of mine.  Til I borrowed 
                        his girlfriend.
                             (nostalgic)
                        But, man, did we have some summer 
                        nights in here...  The ladies 
                        cannot resist a Whirlington. 

           Donny puts up a HI-FIVE for the Husband, who DOESN’T slap it. 
           So, he DRIFTS the HI-FIVE toward the Wife hopefully...NOPE. 

                                 HUSBAND
                        ...We’ll think about it.

           They walk away, FAST.  Donny DOWNS his beer, goes after them.
                                 DONNY
                        Wait, wait.  Lemme bottom line it 
                        for you.  I’m having serious 
                        personal problems.  
                             (they’re SO UNCOMFORTABLE)
                        I owe the IRS a lot of money.  
                        That’s just me getting real with 
                        you right now.  So, what I need you 
                        to do, is buy some hot tubs.  
                        Please?  

                                 HUSBAND
                             (indicates a PIZZA PLACE)
                        Sorry, but, we were just killing 
                        time while we waited for our pizza.

                                 DONNY
                        You know, Ian Ziering played me in 
                        a movie of the week.  And we still 
                        hang out socially.
                             (the Couple HURRIES away)
                        Fine.  I don’t need you.  Maybe 
                        I’ll write another novel.  How many 
                        novels have you written?!  

           EXT. 1-800 LAWYERS - LATER

           Donny PACES outside a STRIP MALL LAW FIRM: “1-800-LAWYERS”.  
           He takes a nervous DEEP BREATH, then looks up.

                                 DONNY
                        C’mon, God.  One time!  

           INT. 1-800-LAWYERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Donny sits across from his lawyer, CRAIG.  Both ANXIOUS.

                                 CRAIG
                        So...you got any big plans for the 
                        long weekend?  Go out and kinda 
                        live every day like it’s your last?

                                 DONNY
                        What’d the IRS say, Craig?  Are 
                        they taking my hot tub dealership?

                                 CRAIG
                        Oh, Don...yeah, man.  It’s a lot 
                        worse than that.
                                 DONNY
                             (deep breath)
                        Alright.  Just hit me with it.  
                        Real quick.  Like pulling off a --

                                 CRAIG
                        3 years in prison.

                                 DONNY
                        3 years!?  You son of a bitch.

                                 CRAIG
                        You haven’t paid taxes since ‘94.

                                 DONNY
                        I thought they were taking it out 
                        automatically.  Did you even tell 
                        them that?

                                 CRAIG
                        ...Yeah.  They didn’t care.  But 
                        listen, if you’d let me finish, 
                        there is some good news.  If you 
                        can pay off the interest, they’ll 
                        suspend the sentence.  For now.  

                                 DONNY
                        Okay, okay.  There you go.  What’re 
                        we talking?  Throw it at me --

                                 CRAIG
                        43,346 --  

           Donny THROWS his chair against the wall! 

                                 DONNY
                        I thought you were gonna say like 
                        300 bucks!  

                                 CRAIG 
                        And...you only have til Monday to 
                        come up with the cash.  Wait, 
                        actually, Monday’s Memorial Day, so 
                        you have a whole extra day. 

                                 DONNY
                        Oh, thank God, that’ll gimme time 
                        to sell my DIAMOND LAMBORGHINI!  We 
                        are no longer friends, Craig.
           Donny KICKS the wall -- his entire leg goes THROUGH the cheap 
           wood panelling!  He awkwardly STRUGGLES to free himself.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A SIGN: “CLASSY RICK’S BACON AND LEGGS”  NEON LIGHTS UP: 
           “GIRLS!” (beat) “GIRLS!” (beat) “BREAKFAST!”.    

           INT. CLASSY RICK’S BACON AND LEGGS - LATER

           The most depressing strip club/breakfast buffet on earth.  A 
           STRIPPER IN AN ARM CAST dances the pole clumsily.  

           Donny picks at some eggs AS he gets a NONCHALANT SEXLESS LAP 
           DANCE from CHAMPALE (50, worn, Jersey smoker’s voice).  They 
           talk CASUALLY THROUGHOUT (she’s like his SHRINK/CONSIGLIERE).  

                                 DONNY
                        What did I do to my life, Champale?

                                 CHAMPALE
                        Don, honey, everything happens for 
                        a reason.  You’re gonna be okay.

                                 DONNY
                        You know what the worst part is?  I 
                        thought about it, and jail’s not 
                        necessarily a step down from what I 
                        got going right now.  I’m about to 
                        turn 40, I live at the Y, and the 
                        only thing I’m good at is being 
                        Donny Levine.  But no one wants to 
                        pay for the Donny Levine story 
                        anymore.
                             (sighs)
                        I guess there’s always gonna be a 
                        younger, better looking kid...who 
                        got raped by his teacher.
                             (beat)
                        Statutory.  But, still.

           She pats his shoulder, sympathetic.  Donny puts his beer down 
           on a FOLDED NY TIMES -- IT CATCHES HIS EYE -- HE PICKS IT UP.

                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit.  

                                 CHAMPALE
                        What?

                                 DONNY
                        It’s my son.
                                 CHAMPALE
                             (shocked, stops dancing)
                        Oh my god, really?  Are you sure 
                        it’s him?

                                 DONNY
                        It’s only been 8 years.  He’s lost 
                        a ton of weight...but see that scar 
                        on his forehead?  That’s from when 
                        I dropped him in the urinal at the 
                        Met game. 

                                 CHAMPALE 
                             (takes it, reads)
                        “Todd Peterson to wed Stacey 
                        Hayward this Sunday at The Plaza.”  
                        Todd Peterson?

                                 DONNY
                        I guess that’s his name now.  

                                 CHAMPALE
                        “Peterson’s the youngest ever large-
                        cap hedge fund manager, all the 
                        more impressive considering he was 
                        orphaned...at age 9...when both his 
                        parents died in a horrific 
                        explosion.”  Ooh.  Sorry, sweetie.

                                 DONNY
                             (chokes up a bit)
                        Hey, I’m mad at him, too.

                                 CHAMPALE
                        Donny, this has gotta stop.  Your 
                        son’s getting married.  That’s once 
                        in a lifetime.  Ideally.  You gotta 
                        be there.  Besides, maybe he’d even 
                        help you, if you stop being a dick.  

                                 DONNY
                        He’s the dick!  And I would never 
                        make the first move.  And, I don’t 
                        need his money, Champale.  I’m 
                        Donny Levine.  I’ve got options.   

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. DONNY’S FIERO - LATER

           Donny CHOKES BACK TEARS as he talks on his HUGE ‘80s cell 
           phone in his shitty ‘88 FIERO.
                                 DONNY (ON THE PHONE)
                        Hello, is this Amy at the Maury 
                        Povich show?  ...She died?  Are you 
                        sure?  ...Wow, 9 years ago?  Well, 
                        my condolences.  Anyhoo...this is 
                        Donny Levine and - get ready to be 
                        happy - I’d like to offer Maury an 
                        exclusive 1 hour interview with me 
                        for the low, low price of 43 thou --      
                             (beat, deflates)
                        Yeah.  Sure.  L-E-V-I --  

           LATER

                                 DONNY (ON THE PHONE)
                        Yo, this message is for Montel.  
                        Hey, brotha.  I caught your last 
                        couple ‘Hot For Teacher’ episodes.  
                        Not good.  I know I coulda added 
                        some valuable veteran insight.  I’m 
                        super busy right now.  Swamped.  
                        But, I am available.  Immediately.

           LATER

                                 DONNY (ON THE PHONE)
                        Fine.  Sally Jesse’s entitled to 
                        her side of the story.  But, did 
                        you ever think that maybe she gave 
                        me Hepatitis?  Is that possible?

           He THROWS the phone aside, then FLIPS DOWN THE VISOR -- 
           REVEAL an old PHOTO: YOUNG DONNY and YOUNG TODD (CHUBBY as a 
           kid) smiling. 

           Donny LOOKS at the photo, then RIPS it down -- REVEAL Donny’s 
           face in the VISOR MIRROR -- he stares at himself, DEPRESSED.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           TODD’S FACE IN HIS VISOR MIRROR.

           INT. TODD’S MERCEDES, AT LAGUARDIA AIRPORT - DAY

           Todd (suit/tie) examines himself as Stacey scans the AIRPORT 
           CROWD for her parents.   

                                 TODD
                        Great.  I’m sweating like Meatloaf 
                        over here.
                                 (MORE)
                                 TODD (cont'd)
                             (sings)
                        “I would do anything for love...”

                                 STACEY
                        I don’t know why you’re always so 
                        nervous around my parents.  They 
                        love you.

                                 TODD 
                        Are you sure?  Even your dad?

                                 STACEY
                        Yes I’m sure. He’s just protective, 
                        you know?  I’m his baby girl.   

                                 TODD
                        I feel like when he looks at me, 
                        all he sees is my penis going into 
                        your vagina.

           Stacey laughs, then SPOTS her folks.  She CLAPS excitedly, 
           and HOPS OUT!  Todd psyches himself up in the VISOR MIRROR.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        You made 2 million dollars last 
                        year.  People like you.
                             (looks up to God)
                        One time!

           EXT. TODD’S MERCEDES, AT LAGUARDIA - MOMENTS LATER

           Stacey’s BLUE COLLAR parents, HELEN (50, hot) and JON HAYWARD 
           (60, tough), RUN UP AND HUG Stacey!  Todd puts out his hand. 

                                 TODD
                        Mr. and Mrs. Hayward, I want you to 
                        know that I promise to take care of 
                        your baby girl forever.  

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        Aww, you’re too sweet.  And for the 
                        last time, it’s Helen and Jon.  
                        We’re family now.

           She HUGS him!  Todd smiles, then goes to HUG Jon -- Jon puts 
           out a HANDSHAKE -- Todd awkwardly ADJUSTS, shakes.  Beat.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD (CONT’D)
                        Stace, guess who was on our plane?

           She motions to her right as -- a cheesy model looking guy, 
           CHAD (30, in all Ed Hardy crap), and his cheesy model 
           girlfriend, MIA (18, same), walk up, smiling.
                                 STACEY
                        Chad!  Yay!
                             (they hug enthusiastic)
                        And who is this gorgeous girl?

                                 CHAD
                        This is my plus one, Mia.

                                 STACEY
                        Wow, she’s sooo pretty.

                                 CHAD
                        I know, right?

                                 MIA
                             (to Stacey)
                        Me?  Look at you.  You’re gorgeous.  

           The girls giggle, then hug.  Todd kinda waits to the side.

                                 TODD
                        No, you’re pretty...

                                 STACEY
                        Honey, this is Chad!  I’m so glad 
                        you guys are finally meeting.  You 
                        remember, my best friend from 
                        ASU...

                                 TODD
                        Yes!  Of course.  The...life guard?

                                 CHAD
                        Life coach.  But, hey, we both save 
                        lives.

                                 TODD
                             (thinks Chad’s an idiot)
                        ...Right.

           They shake hands -- Chad PULLS Todd into a BRO HUG THING.

                                 CHAD
                        She’s a special girl, bro.  The 
                        best.  Treat her right, bro.  

                                 TODD 
                        Of course.  Totally.  Bro.

           Stacey notices her mom is CHOKED UP.

                                 STACEY
                        Aww, Mom, are you crying already?
                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        My baby’s getting married.  This is 
                        a big moment in a mother’s life.  
                             (to Todd)
                        Sorry honey, I know this whole 
                        thing must be bittersweet for you.

                                 TODD
                        Why?

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        You know...cause of your parents.

                                 TODD
                        Oh, no, please, don’t worry.  It 
                        was a long time ago.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        Well, I know they’ll be smiling 
                        down from heaven all weekend.

                                 TODD
                             (fake chokes up)
                        Yeah.  They woulda loved all this.

           Helen HUGS him again -- Todd SMILES (HE LOVES THE LOVE).

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        We’re all the family you need.

           EXT. SHITTY MOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Donny PACES outside a shitty motel room, nervous.  He takes a 
           deep breath, then KNOCKS.  IAN ZIERING (44, unshaven, briefs) 
           answers, NOT HAPPY to see Donny.  TENSE SILENCE.  Then --

                                 DONNY
                        Whaazzzuuuuuuup?  
                             (Ziering nods defiantly)
                        Hey, Ziering.  Listen, I don’t know 
                        where we’re at right now, if you’re 
                        still mad at me or --

                                 ZIERING
                        You slept with my mom.

                                 DONNY
                        I know, I know.  But in my defense, 
                        she came on really strong --

           Ziering tries to SLAM the door -- Donny CATCHES it!
                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        You’re really gonna let that end a 
                        20 year friendship?  Besides, it 
                        was like ‘92, man.  

                                 ZIERING
                        Yeah, but I just found out.  

                                 DONNY
                        Stop being selfish!  I’m in real 
                        trouble.  I need money.  Fast.

                                 ZIERING
                        You’re unbelievable.  What about 
                        the 10 grand I gave you to open 
                        that Laser Tag?  You said I’d 
                        double my money.

                                 DONNY
                        Oh, c’mon, Ziering!  You’ve got 
                        that sweet 90210 cash!  

                                 ZIERING
                        Really!?  When’s the last time you 
                        saw a new episode!?  I live in this 
                        motel, man.  I WORK AT AN ICE RINK!

           He tries to PUSH the door shut -- Donny HOLDS it open (an 
           AWKWARD TUG O’ WAR ensues)!

                                 DONNY
                        That’s it for the band then, too?  
                        16 years of playing Springsteen 
                        covers shoulder to shoulder and you 
                        throw it away cause me and your mom 
                        hooked up?  C’mon, man, we’re 
                        called Two Hearts.  I’m gonna look 
                        pretty silly up there alone.

                                 ZIERING
                        Yeah, well...I’m not even that into 
                        Springsteen anymore --

           SHOCKED, Donny PUNCHES him in the face!  Ziering TACKLES 
           Donny!  They roll around until Ziering ELBOWS him in the nose 
           HARD and KICKS him out! Donny looks up at him, BLEEDING, SAD.  

                                 DONNY 
                        We were in a couple threesomes 
                        together, man.  That used to mean 
                        something.

           Ziering hesitates, then SLAMS the door!  
           INT. DONNY’S FIERO - LATER

           Donny drops into his Fiero BAWLING UNCONTROLLABLY.  He CRIES 
           like a baby for awhile...then his phone RINGS.  He SWALLOWS 
           his tears --

                                 DONNY (ON THE PHONE)
                        Hello?  ...Yes, this is Donny.  You 
                        ran it by Montel?  What did he - 
                        No, the interview would just be me.  
                             (deflates)
                        Yeah, I get that you’ve already 
                        done 6 shows on me alone - What’s 
                        the new angle on my story?  Um... 
                        how bout Donny Levine: Raped again, 
                        but this time BY A MAN!  IN PRISON!
                             (beat, listens)
                        You do like that?  Well, no it 
                        hasn’t happened yet.  ...Maybe I 
                        will call you when it does!

           He THROWS the phone down, lies back, nose BLEEDING, BEATEN.  
           He looks at the shotgun seat: TODD’S WEDDING ARTICLE.

           INT. TODD AND STACEY’S TOWNHOUSE - THAT NIGHT

           CATERERS prepare for a COCKTAIL PARTY as Todd, Stacey, Jon, 
           Helen, Chad and Mia (all dressed up) talk.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        This place is amazing.

                                 JON HAYWARD
                        It better be for 4.6 million bucks.

                                 TODD
                        Oh, so, Stace told you how much we - 
                        Well, I guess we’re all family now.

                                 JON HAYWARD
                        You coulda bought a whole town for 
                        that.

                                 TODD
                        ...In Guatemala.

           No one laughs.  Awkward silence.  Stacey jumps in.

                                 STACEY
                        You know, Daddy, Todd’s about to be 
                        made partner at his hedge fund.  
                                 TODD
                        It’s not for sure, yet.  It’s still 
                        between me and a couple guys.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        Well, you deserve it.  
                             (prods her husband)
                        Right, Jon?

                                 JON HAYWARD
                             (relents, smiles at Todd)
                        Yeah.  I know you’re a hard worker.

                                 TODD
                        Actually, I just slept my way to 
                        the top.  Mr. Hayward.

           BEAT.  Todd thinks he went too far...but then Jon LAUGHS.  

                                 JON HAYWARD
                        Whatever works.  
                             (Todd laughs)
                        And really, call me Jon, okay?

           Stacey SMILES at Todd.  The doorbell RINGS -- she GETS UP.

                                 STACEY 
                        I’ll get it.  You guys talk.

                                 TODD
                        So, Jon, Stace told me you’re a 
                        Scotch drinker, right?

                                 JON HAYWARD
                        If you’re buying.

                                 TODD
                        I’ve got something I think you’re 
                        really gonna like.  
                             (goes to the bar)
                        Anyone else?  Chad?

                                 CHAD
                        I’d take a Diet Redbull vodka if 
                        you have it.

                                 TODD
                        ...Not sure I’ve got that.

                                 JON HAYWARD
                        Maybe just get him a wine cooler. 

           Jon and Todd SHARE A LAUGH (THE FATHER IS THAWING!!).
           AT THE FRONT DOOR - SAME

           Stacey opens the door to -- Donny.  He reacts to her hotness.

                                 DONNY
                        Wow.  You must be Stacey.

                                 STACEY
                        Yeah.  Hi.  You must be...  

                                 DONNY
                        Donny.
                             (off her silence)
                        Han’s never even mentioned me?

                                 STACEY
                        Who’s Han?

                                 DONNY
                             (annoyed)
                        Oh, I mean, Todd.  

                                 STACEY
                        No, I’m sure he has...  

                                 DONNY
                        Wait, where are my manners?  
                        Congratulations!

           He hands her an AUTOGRAPHED BOOK.  She looks at the COVER: 
           Young Donny at a desk, “HEAD IN THE CLASS: THE DONNY LEVINE 
           STORY”. 

                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        My first novel.  I came up with the 
                        title myself.  It’s like “Head of 
                        the Class”, but, you know...BJs.
                             (Stacey’s lost)
                        ...I’m also making you guys a 
                        couple mixtapes.

                                 STACEY
                        ...How did you say you and Todd 
                        knew each other again?

                                 DONNY
                        Well, funny story...  

           BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM

           Jon takes a sip of his Scotch as Todd looks on.
                                 JON HAYWARD
                        Wow.  Keep these coming, and you 
                        and I are gonna get along great.

                                 TODD
                        I know, right?  It’s really nice.

           As Todd takes a BIG SIP, BEHIND HIM Stacey enters with Donny.

                                 STACEY
                             (confused)
                        Uh, Todd, your...dad’s here?

                                 DONNY
                        Whaaazzzuuuuuup!? 

           TODD COUGHS HIS SCOTCH ALL OVER HELEN’S FACE/WHITE DRESS!

                                 TODD
                        Oh, god - Helen, I’m so sorry. 
                        Wrong pipe.  Shit.  Here --

           He tries to DRY HER OFF with his napkin -- Jon GRABS Todd’s 
           hands GRUFFLY, takes over the drying of his wife.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        Right.  Sorry.
                             (to Donny)
                        Donny, what - are you doing?

                                 DONNY
                             (laughs like it’s obvious)
                        Uh, I don’t know, thought I’d swing 
                        by my son’s wedding.

           Everyone looks to Todd CONFUSED.

                                 JON HAYWARD
                        I thought your parents were dead.

                                 TODD
                             (covers poorly)
                        No, they are.  So dead.  He’s 
                        hilarious.  “My dad.”  This is my 
                        old friend from the...
                             (can’t think of anything)
                        Whazzzzuuup!?  We’re trying to 
                        bring that back.  Cause it was not 
                        stupid the first time.  

           He grabs Donny’s hand and tries to FAKE an elaborate SCRIPTED 
           HANDSHAKE -- Donny doesn’t cooperate, UPSET BY THE LIE.
                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        See, we’ve got this joke where he 
                        tells people he’s my dad...and it’s 
                        hilarious cause my parents actually 
                        died.  In an explosion.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        That doesn’t sound funny.

                                 TODD
                        Well, yeah, you had to be there.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        ...At the explosion?

                                 TODD
                        No, at the inception of the joke - 
                        Donny, I can’t believe you made it!
                             (PATS him on the back)
                        Yes!  YES!   
                             (PATS HIM HARDER)
                        What?  You need a drink?  OKAY!

           He PULLS Donny into the kitchen as everyone exchanges a LOOK.

           KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           They yell at each other in a LOUD WHISPER THROUGHOUT.

                                 TODD
                        What’re you doing here!?

                                 DONNY
                        Why do you keep telling everyone I 
                        exploded!?  

                                 TODD
                        I WISH YOU DID EXPLODE!

                                 DONNY
                             (hurt)
                        ...God.  Really?  But...don’t you 
                        at least sorta want your dad at 
                        your wedding?

                                 TODD
                        You’re not my dad!  

                                 DONNY
                        Oh, yeah!?  Let’s put it to a vote! 

           Donny STARTS out -- Todd GRABS his arm, tries to reason.
                                 TODD
                        Wait.  Don.  She’ll call off the 
                        wedding, okay?  If she finds out 
                        I’ve been lying - and I’m just 
                        barely starting to win her dad over 
                        - minus the whole spitting Scotch 
                        on his wife thing.  But, please -- 

                                 STACEY (O.S.)
                        Todd?  Honey, is everything okay?

                                 TODD
                             (to O.S., fake laughing)
                        If by okay you mean the best night 
                        of my life, then yeah, everything’s 
                        okay.
                             (to Donny, pleading)
                        Please.  After the wedding.  I’ll 
                        tell everyone about you.  But, for 
                        now, can you just be my friend?
                             (off Donny’s RELUCTANCE)
                        I’VE NEVER ASKED YOU FOR ANYTHING!

                                 DONNY
                        THIS REALLY HURTS MY FEELINGS!

           LIVING ROOM

           Todd walks Donny into the living room.  Everyone’s CURIOUS.  
           Todd NERVOUSLY tries to improvise (he’s terrible at it).

                                 TODD
                        Sorry.  I was just so excited cause 
                        he told me he couldn’t make it, and 
                        then he’s here.  But that’s so him.  
                        We call him the...Terminator.  
                        Which is unrelated, but -- 
                             (introduces everyone)
                        Okay, so, my future father-in-law, 
                        Jon; his great wife, Helen; we’ve 
                        got Chad and Mia - who are so good 
                        looking.  I mean, literally, you 
                        guys look like two magazine covers 
                        sitting on our couch.  Maxim and... 
                        Men’s Health.  Or Details.  
                             (awkward beat)
                        And then my blushing bride Stacey - 
                        who I’ve told you so much about.  
                        This is my old friend, Donny. 

                                 DONNY
                        Best friend.  Hey everybody.  
                                 STACEY
                        Your best friend? 

                                 TODD
                        Yeah.  You remember the stories I 
                        told you about all those times 
                        we......had?  Donny. 

                                 STACEY
                        Not really.  

                                 TODD
                        Yeah...we met when...

                                 DONNY
                        -- I saved his life.  

                                 STACEY
                        What?  Really?

                                 TODD
                        Well, more metaphorically --

                                 DONNY
                        It was one of those subway deals.  
                        He dropped his burrito on the 
                        tracks, and when he went to grab 
                        it, the train was coming.  I pushed 
                        him outta the way.  We’ve been best 
                        friends ever since.

           Everyone is REALLY BLOWN AWAY.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        Wow.  That’s so brave.

                                 DONNY
                        It wasn’t really me.  It was 
                        something working through me.

                                 STACEY
                        Oh my god.  Todd, I can’t believe 
                        you never told me this story.

                                 TODD
                             (GLARES at Donny)
                        Yeah, well...it was a little 
                        embarrassing that I would go onto 
                        the subway tracks to pick up a 
                        burrito.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        What were you thinking, honey?
                                 CHAD
                        We should talk, bro.  You sound 
                        like you could really use a life 
                        coach.

                                 TODD
                        ...Oh, thanks, bro, but --

                                 STACEY
                             (to Donny)
                        Well, I’m so glad you made it.  I 
                        guess this weekend woulda never 
                        happened without you.  My folks are 
                        staying upstairs, so we’ll put you 
                        in the downstairs guest room, okay?  
                        No arguments, you’re staying here. 

           Todd’s eyes WIDEN with fear.

                                 DONNY
                        Wow, thank you.  You’re even 
                        sweeter than Todd said you were.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                             (stands up, re: dress)
                        So, I’m gonna just go change into 
                        something a little more...dry,  
                        before everyone gets here.

                                 TODD
                        Again, Helen, so sorry about the 
                        whole wrong pipe thing.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        Oh, no, don’t worry, honey.

                                 CHAD
                             (holds up DONNY’S BOOK)
                        Wait, you’re Donny Levine?
                             (to the room)
                        Remember that kid that got his 
                        teacher pregnant in Newark?  
                             (everyone nods a little)
                        Man, you were a god to me and my 
                        friends.  She was so hot, bro.  

                                 DONNY
                        Thanks.  It’s great to meet a fan.

                                 CHAD
                        Hey, whatever happened to your kid?
                                 DONNY
                             (GLARES at Todd)
                        He’s a dick.  
                             (off everyone’s LOOK)
                        ...You know, like a private eye.  
                        Really successful.  He’s one of the 
                        biggest dicks in the world.

                                 TODD
                        Okay!  So, Donny probably wants to 
                        change too -- 

                                 CHAD
                        You know, I got close once.  Mrs. 
                        Weiss, freshman geometry.  I think 
                        she woulda done it, too.  I just 
                        didn’t know how to make the move.

                                 DONNY
                        That’s where a lot of guys get 
                        tripped up.  I just grabbed her and 
                        said, “Miss McGarricle, the student 
                        has become the teacher.  Of sex.” 
                             (Todd tries to usher Donny 
                              away)
                        My third novel was actually gonna 
                        be a ‘How-To’ book, but the 
                        publishers wouldn’t release it.  
                        Something about “encouraging child 
                        molestation”. 

           Todd just DROPS his head, defeated.

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM (DONNY’S ROOM) - LATER

           Donny throws his GARBAGE BAG “SUITCASE” on the floor and 
           looks around the room, IMPRESSED, as Todd FRETS.  

                                 DONNY
                        I always knew you’d be making guest 
                        room money.  You were like a little 
                        Rain Man with numbers.  Up top.

           Donny puts up a HI-FIVE -- Todd leaves him HANGING.

                                 TODD
                        You saved my life?  Really!?

                                 DONNY
                        C’mon, they ate it up.  And you 
                        came with a whole lotta nothing.
                             (feels the bed)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DONNY (cont'd)
                        You guys wouldn’t happen to have a 
                        water-bed in the house?  I haven’t 
                        slept on a mattress in 15 years.

                                 TODD
                        Wow.  So, you’ve figured out a way 
                        to be creepy even while you sleep.
                             (Donny GLARES at him)
                        Don, in 20 minutes, every person 
                        that matters in my life is coming 
                        here.  Stacey’s friends, my boss - 
                        Shit.  Maybe you could just say 
                        something really important came up 
                        at work and you gotta go.  Though, 
                        who’s gonna believe you have a job? 

                                 DONNY
                             (hurt)
                        Wow, you really want me gone that 
                        bad, Han?    

                                 TODD
                        You can’t call me that!  My name’s 
                        Todd Peterson now.  Todd.

                                 DONNY
                        Really though?  You coulda changed 
                        it to anything, like, Leon, or... 
                        Val Kilmer.  And you chose Todd 
                        Peterson?  It’s so...normal.

                                 TODD
                        I WANNA BE NORMAL! --

           Stacey enters with a pillow -- Todd smiles, guiltily -- she 
           hands the pillow to Donny, a little curious.

                                 DONNY
                        Thanks, Stace.  And, hey, I want 
                        you to know how much this weekend 
                        means to me.  Nothing could pull me 
                        away from here.  Literally.  I 
                        would quit ten jobs if I had to.
                             (smiles at Todd)
                        These are the weekends that make up 
                        the years of our lives.

           Todd rolls his eyes at the idiocy -- Stacey eats it up.

                                 STACEY
                        Awww, that’s so sweet.

           She hugs him, walks out.  Donny takes off his shirt, goes 
           through his garbage bag (smelling t-shirts).  Todd sighs.
                                 TODD
                        Why are you here, Don?  Money?  You 
                        heard I’m doing well, you thought 
                        you could show up after eight 
                        years, and I’d give you a hand out?  
                        I would never give you a dime!      

                                 DONNY
                        What?  No.  I don’t need your 
                        money.  That hurts.  I want...
                             (thinks long)
                        I want to, you know, give you away 
                        at your wedding, and...be your dad.  
                        C’mon, why don’t you just try 
                        calling me dad.  See how it feels. 

                                 TODD
                        First off, Don, you don’t give the 
                        groom away at a wedding.  And 
                        second, why would I want you to be 
                        my dad?  Your suitcase is also a 
                        garbage bag - which is just amazing 
                        for a 40 year old man.  And, not 
                        sure if you remember, but you were 
                        the worst dad ever.  

                                 DONNY
                        C’mon, I did a pretty decent job.

                                 TODD
                        Really?  You wanna check in on the 
                        progress of your pretty decent job?  

           Todd grabs TEN SYRINGES from the desk, SHOWS them to Donny!

                                 DONNY
                        ...Oh, no.  You’re a junkie?

                                 TODD
                        It’s insulin.  I’m diabetic!  Cause 
                        you used to let me eat cake for 
                        breakfast.  Just one of the great 
                        souvenirs of childhood obesity.  
                        That, and no self-esteem.  You 
                        destroyed my metabolism, man.  It 
                        took me 6 years to lose all that 
                        weight.  I only eat 1000 calories a 
                        day now.  That’s like half a 
                        sandwich and 7 carrots!  

                                 DONNY
                        You do look amazing though...
                                 TODD
                        Yeah, I have to work out like 
                        Madonna!  Oh, and how bout these?
                             (pulls a CONTACT LENS from 
                              his eye)
                        These are the thickest contacts 
                        they make.  I’m practically blind 
                        cause you used to tell me that TV 
                        was better really close up!

                                 DONNY
                        A lot of people have contacts.

                                 TODD
                        Oh, well, do a lotta people have --

           Todd PULLS his shirt off and turns to reveal a HUGE TATTOO OF 
           EDDIE VEDDER covering his entire back.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        Do a lotta people have a 17 inch 
                        Eddie Vedder tattoo on their back?!

                                 DONNY
                        YOU BEGGED ME FOR THAT THING!

                                 TODD
                        I WAS THIRTEEN!  YOU WERE SUPPOSED 
                        TO SAY NO! --  

           Stacey enters with towels -- finds Todd and Donny (both 
           SHIRTLESS) in each other’s faces, and BREATHING HEAVY.

                                 STACEY
                        ...Is everything okay?

                                 TODD
                        Awesome, just showing Donny my ink.

                                 STACEY
                        Ugh, I hate that thing.  Wait, then 
                        why’s his shirt off? 

           Donny turns to reveal a huge, faded TATTOO OF SPRINGSTEEN.

                                 DONNY
                        The Boss.

                                 STACEY 
                        Wow.  You guys are so alike.  
                             (looks at them sideways)
                        You even kinda look alike.  Has 
                        anyone ever told you that?
                           TODD
                                                          DONNY
           No.
                                              All the time.

                                 TODD
                        A few people have...remarked that.

                                 STACEY
                        ...Right.  Well, here you go.

           She hands Donny the towels, a little suspicious.

                                 DONNY
                        Thanks, Stace.  You’re amazing.

                                 STACEY
                        Aww.  Well, we’re so glad you’re 
                        here.  Now, c’mon, let’s party!

           She kisses Todd, skips out.  Donny watches her go, then --

                                 DONNY 
                        How’d you get a girl that hot?  
                        Seriously, is this a citizenship 
                        thing?  I didn’t hear an accent.  

                                 TODD
                        Don, my life’s great for the first 
                        time ever, okay?  And the fact that 
                        I could put anything together - 
                        between near constant trips to 
                        therapy - is remarkable.  But, I’d 
                        really like to marry Stacey before 
                        she realizes I’m from a family of 
                        circus freaks and that she could do 
                        way better.  So, what’s your plan?  
                        You gonna go out there and ruin my 
                        life, or are you gonna help me for 
                        the first time ever?  Lemme know, 
                        cause maybe I could still get a 
                        refund on the honeymoon.    

                                 DONNY
                             (HURT, pulls on a shirt)
                        Wow.  Really not holding back.  
                        I’ve changed, Todd.  You’ll see.

           He starts for the door -- Todd GRABS his arm.

                                 TODD
                        Whoa, changed guy.  Get ready to 
                        change again.  You’re not wearing a 
                        t-shirt.  This is a cocktail party, 
                        not a Quiznos.  Put on a tie.
                                 DONNY
                        First off, you can’t tell me what 
                        to do.  I’m the dad.  And second, 
                        I’ve literally never worn a tie.  
                        It’s a 39 year streak.  

                                 TODD
                             (GRABS Donny by the shirt)
                        PUT ON A TIE AND COMB YOUR HAIR!

                                 DONNY
                        I’LL NEVER SELLOUT!

           They WRESTLE clumsily -- then SEPARATE.  Todd SIGHS DEEPLY.

                                 TODD
                        A hundred bucks.

           LATER

           He TIES Donny’s tie ANGRILY (like a dad tying his son’s tie).

                                 TODD
                        How are you still alive?  You have 
                        the skills of a 12 year old.

           Todd CINCHES it tight -- Donny PULLS at it -- they WRESTLE 
           for control of the tie!

                                 DONNY
                        It’s too tight!

                                 TODD
                        It’s supposed to be tight!

                                 DONNY
                        I CAN’T BREATHE!

                                 TODD
                        GOOD!

           INT. TODD AND STACEY’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

           A JAZZ TRIO PLAYS SOFTLY.  A YUPPIE COCKTAIL PARTY OF 30.  

           Todd talks to his boss, BILL SCOTT (50), while keeping a 
           CLOSE EYE on -- REVEAL Donny (hair PARTED hard, ill-fitting 
           SUIT/TIE) alone in the corner LIKE A KID AT A GROWN-UP PARTY.

                                 TODD
                        So, Bill, I was thinking that if we 
                        hedged our oil position by...by...
           Todd SEES Donny take a STEP toward the group -- Todd GLARES 
           him back into his corner -- Donny pouts, RETREATS.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        ...by, um - If we short the Euro --  

                                 BILL SCOTT
                        Todd, take a night off, okay?  This 
                        weekend I’m not your boss.
                             (to Stacey)
                        You’re marrying a real workaholic.

                                 STACEY
                             (smiles suggestively)
                        Isn’t that what you want in a 
                        partner, though?

                                 BILL SCOTT
                             (laughs)
                        She’s tough.  Alright, listen, I 
                        haven’t made my final decision yet, 
                        but I will tell you, I love that 
                        you’re getting married.  A guy with 
                        a stable family’s much less likely 
                        to steal a couple mil, change his 
                        name and move to Argentina, you 
                        know?  I gotta know I can trust my 
                        partner.

                                 TODD
                        Well...family’s so important to me.  

           Donny takes another STEP toward them -- Todd GLARES him back.  

                                 BILL SCOTT
                        Well, then, assuming Stacey shows 
                        up on Sunday, I’d say it’s looking 
                        pretty good for you.

           Bill WINKS, TOASTS Todd -- Stacey SMILES AT TODD EXCITEDLY.  
           Then, Helen spots Donny, motions him over to the group.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        Donny, come say hi to everyone.

           Donny SMILES and comes over -- Todd SWIGS his champagne hard.

                                 TODD 
                        Uh, Donny, this is my boss, Bill 
                        Scott.  Bill, this is Donny.

                                 DONNY
                        Whaazzzzuuuuuuuuuuuuuup!
           A LONG pregnant beat...Todd thinks he’s dead...then --

                                 BILL SCOTT 
                        Is that back?  I’ve been dying for 
                        that to come back.  Whaaazzzzuuup!

                                 CHAD
                        Whaaaazzzzzuuuup!

                                 JON HAYWARD
                             (laughs)
                        Whaaaaazzzuuup!

                                 BILL SCOTT/DONNY/CHAD/JON HAYWARD
                        Whaaaaazzzuuuup!

           Todd rolls his eyes, DOWNS his champagne, then --

                                 TODD
                        Whaaaazzzzuuuuuup!

           They look at him, AWKWARD -- he was too LATE, and BAD at it.

           LATER

           Now Donny’s surrounded by ALL 30 GUESTS.  They’re RAPT.

                                 DONNY
                        So I see the train coming, and I 
                        just - I don’t know, something 
                        takes over, right?  I jump off the 
                        platform - BAM!  Both my legs 
                        break.  
                             (they all gasp)
                        In half.
                             (off another gasp)
                        And...also my sternum and neck.

                                 BILL SCOTT
                        Jesus.

                                 DONNY
                        Yeah.  But, I’m so hopped up on 
                        adrenaline, I feel like Jiminy 
                        Christmas.  

           Todd looks around, amazed that they’re all buying this.

                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                             (GRABS Todd)
                        So I tackle him!  We roll outta the 
                        way, just as the train goes by.  
                        Inches.  I mean, inches.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        It was some real Wesley Snipes 
                        shit.  But that’s life, right?  
                        Inches.

                                 GUEST
                        Unbelievable.

                                 BILL SCOTT
                        Todd, what were you thinking?

                                 TODD
                        I really don’t know, Bill.

                                 WOMAN 1
                        I mean, why wouldn’t you just buy 
                        another burrito?

                                 WOMAN 2
                        The one you dropped woulda been all 
                        disgusting anyway.

                                 TODD
                             (so annoyed)
                        Yeah, not my best decision, okay?

                                 BILL SCOTT
                             (slaps Donny’s back)
                        Wow.  What’re you drinking, Donny?

           LATER

           Everyone HOLDS UP their drinks as Donny TOASTS the couple.

                                 DONNY
                             (making it up as he goes)
                        Long may you run...into the heavens 
                        ...above.  Where eagles soar on 
                        beds.  Made of children’s dreams.  

           BEAT...everyone LIFTS their glasses to their lips, then --

                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        But, don’t forget, the way you 
                        look...tonight.  At each other...in 
                        this here golden...light.  
                             (beat, they lift their 
                              drinks...then --)
                        That’s love...at first sight.  
                        Thank you.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        Beautiful.

           Everyone DRINKS, Todd ROLLS his eyes.  
           LATER

           Now the BAND PLAYS FAST.  Donny DANCES with Helen and Stacey, 
           the HIT OF THE PARTY!  Donny DIPS Helen playfully -- she 
           BLUSHES, LOVING IT.  Stacey gives a BIG THUMBS UP to -- 

           Todd, who drinks and STEWS in the corner.  He gives her an 
           annoyed THUMBS UP back, just as Bill DANCES by. 

                                 BILL SCOTT
                        Donny’s classic, man!

           Todd DANCES AWKWARDLY after Bill to try to talk to him.

                                 TODD
                        Yeah.  So, Bill, thanks again for 
                        considering me.  It’s an honor to --

                                 BILL SCOTT
                        Todd, stop kissing my ass, okay?  
                        I’m trying to get my party on!

           Todd STOPS dancing, then watches Bill dance to Donny -- they 
           HI-FIVE!  Todd grabs a passing champagne, DOWNS IT.

           LATER

           Donny shows his BOOK to Jon, Chad, Bill and some GUYS.

                                 BILL SCOTT
                        Man, I woulda killed to bang my 8th 
                        grade teacher.  Mrs. Cohn.  
                        Biology.  I used to dream about 
                        dissecting her with my penis.  True 
                        story.  It’s weird what’s going on 
                        upstairs when you hit puberty.

                                 GUY
                        I know.  I stole the librarian’s 
                        glasses to wear them while I 
                        masturbated.  What’s that about?

           Todd’s SO EMBARRASSED by the conversation.  He looks at Jon 
           and is about to apologize to him, when --

                                 JON HAYWARD
                        Ms. Lee.  She had the most perfect 
                        ...ass.  We all wanted her, but we 
                        didn’t think it was really 
                        possible.     
                                 BILL SCOTT
                             (toasts Donny)
                        Here’s to actually pulling it off.
                             (they drink, then to Todd)
                        I can’t believe Donny Levine pushed 
                        you outta the way of a train. Wild.

                                 TODD
                        Yeah, it’s pretty great.

           Mia LEANS IN from a nearby conversation --

                                 MIA
                        I gave my 8th grade gym teacher a 
                        hand job in his mini-van.

           Everyone looks at her, HORRIFIED.

           LATER

           Jon toasts Stacey, CHOKED UP.  

                                 JON HAYWARD
                        And the doctor said that had the 
                        umbilical cord been just a little 
                        lower, Stacey woulda never made it 
                        into this world.  But, that’s life, 
                        right?  Inches.  Inches.  You know 
                        what I’m talking about, Don.

           He nods at Donny -- Donny HOLDS UP his glass, TAPS his heart.  

                                 JON HAYWARD (CONT’D)
                        And now I have to give my baby girl 
                        away to the new man in her life.

           Todd HOLDS UP his glass toward Jon -- Jon IGNORES HIM.

                                 JON HAYWARD (CONT’D)
                        Stace, of all the things I’ve ever 
                        been, Daddy’s by far the best.  And 
                        anyone who’s ever been Daddy, knows 
                        exactly what I mean. 

           Donny’s TOUCHED.  He self-consciously WIPES HIS EYES. 

                                 STACEY
                        I love you, Daddy!

           Donny watches Jon and Stacey HUG.  Then Donny holds up a 
           PEACE TOAST to Todd, WARMLY -- Todd SHAKES HIS HEAD, SO COLD.
                                 STACEY (CONT’D)
                        I just had the best idea!  Donny, 
                        you can be Todd’s best man!  There 
                        isn’t anyone standing up with him.

                                 TODD
                        ...Ooh, really though?

                                 STACEY
                        I mean, he’s your best friend.  And 
                        he saved your life.

                                 TODD
                        Oh yeah, that’s right.  Have we 
                        told that story yet tonight?  
                             (PATS Donny’s back hard)
                        Hey, she’s right, man.  I totally 
                        owe you.  Please, be my best man.

                                 DONNY
                        Wow.  All I can say is yes.

                                 TODD
                        Yay!  It’s settled then.  
                             (downs another Champagne)
                        This is the BEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE!

                                 STACEY
                        Honey...maybe you should chill on 
                        the champagne.

                                 TODD
                        What?  C’mon, it’s a celebration.  
                        “I wanna celebrate and have a good 
                        time, WOO-HOO!”

           Todd walks off.  Stacey looks at Donny, confused.

                                 DONNY
                        He always gets anxious at parties.  
                        He pissed himself at every one of 
                        his birthdays til he was 15.
                             (beat, covers)
                        I mean, he told me he did.  We’re 
                        super close.  I’ll go talk to him.

           KITCHEN - LATER

           Donny finds Todd in the kitchen, BINGE EATING.

                                 DONNY
                        Whoa, that’s more than a thousand 
                        calories.  What’s wrong, man?
                                 TODD
                        Seriously?  You’re ruining my life 
                        out there!

                                 DONNY
                        Are we at the same party?  They’re 
                        literally toasting to me. 

                                 TODD
                        They’d love me too if I got to tell 
                        everyone I broke my neck pushing 
                        someone outta the way of a train!  
                        You think they’d still be into you 
                        if they knew how much of a loser 
                        you are?  Maybe I’ll tell them the 
                        one about when you fell asleep 
                        driving me to school!

                                 DONNY
                        We didn’t even get in an accident!

                                 TODD
                        I HATE YOU!

           He THROWS a balled up paper towel at the trash -- MISSES!

                                 DONNY
                        I feel like I’m coming through for 
                        you right now and all you’re doing 
                        is hitting me with negativity.  
                             (balls up a paper towel)
                        And by the way, when you do the 
                        whole ‘shoot a basket to make a 
                        point’ thing, it works better if 
                        you MAKE IT!

           Donny SHOOTS -- he MISSES too.

                                 TODD
                        You’re such an idiot.

           Todd picks up both “balls”, TOSSES them toward the trash -- 
           Donny swoops in and BLOCKS THEM HARD!  They LOCK EYES...

           BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Stacey talks with her GIRLFRIENDS.

                                 STACEY
                        I know Todd’s not like the guys I 
                        used to date, but, most bad boys 
                        end up living in their parents’ 
                        basements, you know?
                                 GIRLFRIEND 1
                        Who cares about sexy anyway?  When 
                        we’re 50, we’re all gonna be fat.  

                                 GIRLFRIEND 2
                        But at least you won’t be single.  
                        Or poor.

                                 STACEY
                             (off their giggles)
                        You guys are bad.  It’s just nice 
                        to be with a grown-up for once.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           BACK IN THE KITCHEN - LATER

           Now Todd and Donny are playing a VERY PHYSICAL GAME OF ONE-ON-
           ONE with the balled up paper towel and trash can.  Todd BACKS 
           Donny down in the “post” -- they BANG HARD!

                                 TODD
                        You - can’t - handle me down low.

                                 DONNY
                             (ELBOWS Todd’s kidney)
                        This is my paint!

                                 TODD
                        Oh, are we playing old guy rules?

                                 DONNY
                        What, you wanna call your mommy?

           Todd FAKES -- Donny BITES -- Todd goes under and SLAMS it in!  

                                 TODD 
                        Yeah!  Call my mom!  Tell her you 
                        just got raped again!

           Donny BALLS UP another paper towel and nods competitively as 
           he walks to the “top of the key”.

                                 DONNY
                        I’m gonna work you like a job!

                                 TODD
                             (gets in defensive stance)
                        Have you ever even had a job?

                                 DONNY
                        I’VE HAD HUNDREDS OF JOBS!
           Donny RUNS at him --

           OUT IN THE LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Back on Stacey and her friends.

                                 GIRLFRIEND 2
                        You’re so lucky, Stace.  I’m at the 
                        point where if the guy doesn’t get 
                        paid by the hour, I’m poking holes 
                        in the condom.  Here’s to 30!  Yay!

           They laugh -- but are interrupted by a CRASH OFF-SCREEN!

                                 STACEY 
                        Ugh, these caterers are the worst.  
                        I’ll be right back.

           KITCHEN - LATER

           Stacey enters just as Todd ZEALOUSLY BLOCKS Donny’s shot -- 
           his MOMENTUM sends him into a cabinet HARD!  Todd grabs the 
           “ball”, and SLAMS it home!

                                 TODD
                        YEAH!

                                 STACEY
                        Uh...honey?

                                 TODD
                             (barely glances at her)
                        Be out in a sec, Stace.

                                 STACEY
                        But...

                                 TODD
                        It’s all tied up right now, okay?

                                 STACEY
                        ...What’s all tied up?

                                 TODD
                        WE’RE ALL TIED UP!

           She throws up her hands, pissed, and walks out.  Instantly, 
           Donny DRIVES right -- Todd CHECKS him HARD into the wall!

                                 DONNY
                        Offensive foul!
                                 TODD
                        You’re on offense!

                                 DONNY
                             (to no one)
                        C’mon, ref, let em play!

                                 TODD
                        THAT DOESN’T MAKE SENSE!

           QUICK JUMP CUTS:

           -- Donny CHECKS Todd hard, SPINS, SLAMS it home, then does a 
           RIDICULOUS TOUCHDOWN DANCE!

           -- Todd RUNS THROUGH Donny, SHOOTS it in, then does a MOCKING 
           TOUCHDOWN DANCE in Donny’s face!

           -- Donny DUNKS!  Then Todd DUNKS!  IT’S VERY PHYSICAL NOW!

           -- Donny DRIVES -- Todd PUSHES him into a WATER COOLER -- the 
           JUG FLIES OFF -- SHATTERS a stack of PLATES -- then SPRAYS 
           water all over!  They DIVE for the “ball”!  

           Todd ELBOWS Donny in the face HARD -- Donny’s nose EXPLODES 
           WITH BLOOD -- Todd grabs the “ball” and SLAMS it home!  Todd 
           pops up and DANCES/YELLS in Donny’s BLOODY FACE!

                                 TODD
                        THAT’S GAME!  YEAH!  What a 
                        surprise!  Donny Levine failed at 
                        something!  WOW!  YOU’RE A LOSER!

           Todd (wet, sweating, out of breath) looks up -- REVEAL 
           Stacey, Helen, Jon, Bill, others, APPALLED.  Stacey GLARES at 
           Todd.  Helen kneels down and helps Donny up, babying him.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        Ooh, are you okay, honey?

                                 DONNY
                             (milking it)
                        I thought we were just playing... 
                        and then he elbowed me in the face.

                                 STACEY
                             (to Todd)
                        What’s wrong with you?
           INT. DONNY’S ROOM - LATER (THE PARTY’S OVER)

           Todd enters to find Helen CRADLING Donny as Stacey holds ICE 
           to his face.  Stacey GLARES at Todd, then starts out -- as 
           she PASSES him, Todd tries to KISS her -- she just BLOWS BY.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        Okay, then, I’ll let you boys talk.  
                        Just keep the ice on it, honey, and 
                        you’ll be fine.

                                 DONNY
                        Thanks, Helen.  You’re the best.

           Helen BRUSHES Donny’s hair back, then KISSES his cheek, then 
           LOOKS into his eyes for WAY TOO LONG (is she gonna KISS 
           HIM?)...finally, she snaps out of it, BLUSHES, hurries out.

                                 TODD
                        Uh...what the hell was that?

                                 DONNY
                        What?

                                 TODD
                        Hey, do me a favor and try not to 
                        have sex with my mother-in-law at 
                        my wedding, okay?  Stacey might be 
                        a little upset if her parents get 
                        divorced.

                                 DONNY
                        It’s not my fault, guy.  Older 
                        women can’t resist me, okay?  It’s 
                        the curse of the cougars.  You 
                        know, I invented cougars.  I 
                        shoulda copyrighted that shit.  I 
                        woulda made millions.  

           Todd rolls his eyes, then looks around -- the ROOM’S A MESS.

                                 TODD
                        And how’s this place already such a 
                        mess?  You’ve been here five hours.  
                        If you’re gonna stay under my roof, 
                        you’re gonna keep your room clean.

                                 DONNY
                             (like an insolent teen)
                        God!  I’ll do it tomorrow.

           Donny pulls off the ice -- REVEAL A BLACK EYE -- Todd reacts.
                                 TODD
                        So...are you okay?

                                 DONNY
                        What d’you care?

                                 TODD
                        You weren’t exactly playing at half 
                        speed yourself.  But, I guess, 
                        maybe I got a little carried away.

                                 DONNY
                        Hey, it’s a big day when you beat 
                        your dad at something for the first 
                        time.

                                 TODD
                        You’re not my dad, Don.  

                                 DONNY
                        You know, you’re a 25 year old 
                        millionaire with a hot wife.  I 
                        know I don’t deserve all the 
                        credit, but I feel like I get some.  
                        I taught you shit.

                                 TODD
                        Oh yeah, like what?  I don’t even 
                        know how to ride a bike.  You know 
                        how embarrassing that is?  

                                 DONNY
                        Well, I didn’t know you wanted to 
                        learn that.  I’ll take you out 
                        right now.

                                 TODD
                        Yeah, no thanks.

                                 DONNY
                             (thinks for awhile...)
                        I taught you to swim!

           QUICK FLASHBACK:

           -- YOUNG DONNY holds an ICE CREAM out of reach of 5 YEAR OLD 
           TODD (CHUBBY), LEADING him toward a POOL.  At the edge, he 
           THROWS the ICE CREAM into the pool -- Todd JUMPS in after it!

           BACK TO PRESENT:

                                 TODD
                        I almost drowned!
                                 DONNY
                        But you didn’t!  And you became a 
                        great swimmer.  You coulda made 
                        your high school team if you were a 
                        little more...aerodynamic.
                             (off Todd’s glare)
                        Jesus, fine, I get it.  You hate 
                        me.  Whatever.  
                             (shakes his head)
                        You wanna know why I’m really here?  

                                 TODD
                        Yes.  Please.

                                 DONNY
                             (thinks)
                        Well...I...I don’t know how to tell 
                        you this, but...your mom’s sick.  
                        They don’t know how long she’s got 
                        and...I told her you’d come visit 
                        her at the prison.  I shoulda asked 
                        before I got her hopes up, but I 
                        stupidly thought you’d wanna see 
                        her one last time, just in case...

                                 TODD
                             (long beat, affected)
                        Really?

                                 DONNY
                        Yeah.  Saturday’s the last time she 
                        can have visitors before her big 
                        surgery on Sunday.

                                 TODD
                             (incredulous/annoyed)
                        So, you want me to go see my dying 
                        mother in prison - for the first 
                        time in 20 years - the day before 
                        my wedding?

                                 DONNY
                        Hey, I just thought you should 
                        know.  Maybe part of me hoped we 
                        could go together. I get it though.  
                        You’ve got a better family now.    
                             (applies the ice)
                        Could you please just turn off the 
                        light on your way out?  My eye 
                        hurts.  And so does my nose.

           Todd hesitates, then FLICKS OFF the light and walks out.
           INT. TODD’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Todd sits at the end of the bed, staring at an OLD PHOTO: 4 
           YEAR OLD TODD and YOUNG DONNY smile with Mary McGarricle 
           (who’s behind a GLASS PRISON PARTITION), an ODD family photo.

           Stacey comes to the doorway -- Todd hides the picture.

                                 STACEY
                        What’s going on with you, Todd?  
                        You really embarrassed us tonight.    

                                 TODD
                        Nothing.  I’m sorry.  I’m -- 
                             (looks at her)
                        Doesn’t part of you just wanna run 
                        away from all these people and get 
                        married on a tiny beach somewhere?  
                        Maybe never come back?  I could 
                        learn to bartend, you could 
                        waitress at the same place... 
                        doesn’t that sound great?

                                 STACEY
                        ...That sounds terrible.  I don’t 
                        wanna be a waitress.  I want this.  
                        A perfect wedding, a perfect life 
                        together.  Like my parents have.

                                 TODD
                        No, I know.  Me too.  I’m kidding.  
                             (changes the subject)
                        So...and how bout that Chad?  He 
                        could be on the Real World/Road 
                        Rules Challenge.  
                             (she rolls her eyes)
                        Your friends are all really good 
                        looking.  Do you have a thing where 
                        you won’t hang out with anyone 
                        under 5’10”?  How’d I slip through?

                                 STACEY
                        Aww, is that what all this is?  
                        You’re jealous of Chad? 

                                 TODD
                        No, I was just saying, I wish I had 
                        hair that never moved.  Do you know 
                        what kinda product he uses?

           She smiles, then STRADDLES him, starts KISSING his neck.
                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        And just outta curiosity, how does 
                        a 30 year old guy with an 18 year 
                        old girlfriend, and no discernible 
                        income, coach anyone on how to live 
                        their life?

                                 STACEY
                        Todd, you and I are getting married 
                        in 2 days.  Chad’s like my brother.  
                        If I wanted to have sex with him, I 
                        could’ve.  A million times. 

                                 TODD
                        That’s not really how a brother 
                        works.

                                 STACEY
                             (laughs)
                        Ooh, you’re cute when you’re 
                        jealous...

           She UNBUTTONS HIS PANTS -- his EYES ROLL BACK.

                                 TODD
                        I am?  Then, Chad’s awesome.  I bet 
                        he has everything Ed Hardy makes.

                                 STACEY
                             (hands down his pants now)
                        Ooh, yeah...
                             (baby voice)
                        Toddy, will you please stop acting 
                        weird and start getting excited for 
                        our big perfect wedding?  Please?  

                                 TODD
                             (barely able to talk now)
                        Oh - Oh yeah...whatever you say...

           INT. DONNY’S ROOM - LATER

           Donny strums his DOUBLE-NECK acoustic guitar, CHOKING UP.

                                 DONNY (SINGING)
                        When your son tells you you’re a 
                        loser, it really hurts your 
                        feelings, but I don’t care at all, 
                        cause I know I’m awesome --

           He THROWS the guitar aside, near TEARS.  He SWIGS a beer 
           hard, then opens his Filofax and dials a number on his cell.
                                 PHONE (V.O.)
                        Hey, you’ve reached Montel 
                        Williams, you know the drill.

                                 DONNY (ON THE PHONE)
                        Hey, brotha. Donny Levine.  Call me 
                        right away.  I’ve got the new angle 
                        for my story.  You’ll love it.  
                        It’s what you always asked me for.

           He HANGS UP, then leans back with a HEAVY HEART...

           INT. DONNY’S BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Donny sleepily pulls a VERY FLAT TOOTHPASTE from his garbage 
           bag.  He SEARCHES for his toothbrush -- no luck.  He tries to 
           SQUEEZE the paste onto his finger -- NOTHING LEFT.

           EXT./INT. TODD’S BATHROOM - LATER

           Donny walks toward Todd’s bathroom.  

                                 DONNY 
                        Yo, can I borrow some toothpaste, 
                        man?  And a tooth brush?  And do 
                        you have any Axe body spray --

           He walks in AS Todd (SWIM TRUNKS) gets out of the shower -- 
           Todd SHRIEKS like a girl -- Donny turns away! 

                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        Whoa!  Sorry.  I’ve already seen 
                        your guy, though.  I changed your 
                        diapers.  You were a real shitter.
                             (turns back around)
                        Wait, why are you wearing shorts?  
                        Do you shower in clothes?

                                 TODD
                        I have body image issues!

                                 DONNY
                        ...You’re a dude.  Why do you care?

                                 TODD
                        Oh, you know, I wonder why --

           QUICK SERIES OF FLASHBACKS:

           -- SIDEWALK.  8 YEAR OLD TODD puts his HANDPRINTS in WET 
           CEMENT.  22 YEAR OLD DONNY approaches with a stick.
                                 22 YEAR OLD DONNY
                        I’ll write your name for you.

           Donny writes in the cement -- REVEAL: “THE FAT KID”. 

           -- 24 YEAR OLD DONNY and FRIENDS (including 28 YEAR OLD 
           ZIERING) drink/fish on a boat by the Jersey Shore.

                                 24 YEAR OLD DONNY

                        give you a beer...

           10 YEAR OLD TODD (CHUBBY) pulls up his shirt, does Chunk’s 
           DANCE from “Goonies”.  Everyone LAUGHS!

                                 28 YEAR OLD ZIERING
                        Baby Ruuuuuuuth!

           -- 15 YEAR OLD TODD talks nervously to a 15 YEAR OLD GIRL and 
           her FRIENDS.  SUDDENLY Young Donny runs up and DE-PANTSES 
           TODD!  The GIRLS GIGGLE as Donny LAUGHS and HI-FIVES Ziering!

           BACK TO PRESENT, IN TODD’S BATHROOM:

           Donny REACTS to the flashbacks, UPSET with himself.

                                 DONNY
                        ...Wow.  I was just...messing with 
                        you.  I didn’t realize it would 
                        have legit long term effects.

                                 TODD
                        I’m fine.  I actually liked being 
                        called Roseanne for the first 15 
                        years of my life.  Here --  
                             (gives him toothbrush/ 
                              toothpaste)
                        I don’t have Axe body spray cause 
                        I’m not a douchebag.  Go get ready.  
                        We gotta meet everyone at the 
                        church for the rehearsal cause 
                        you’re the best man, remember? Yay!

                                 DONNY
                             (beat, sincere)
                        Yeah, well, I’m...sorry about all 
                        that, Han.

                                 TODD
                        MY NAME IS TODD!
           INT. TODD’S MERCEDES - LATER

           Todd drives, Donny’s in shotgun.  They stare ahead, SILENT.  
           The stereo PLAYS “Your Body Is A Wonderland”...Donny CRINGES.

                                 DONNY
                        ...What is this?  

                                 TODD
                        John Mayer.   

                                 DONNY
                        ...It sounds like what Phil Collins 
                        would put on before he makes love 
                        to Richard Marx.  

                                 TODD
                        Yeah, well, he’s sold about 30 
                        million records, so, you don’t know 
                        what you’re talking about.

                                 DONNY
                        God, sometimes I can’t believe you 
                        came outta my penis.  I’ve got two 
                        words for you: Spring. Steen.  
                        Listen to him.

                                 TODD
                        I’ve heard him.

                                 DONNY
                        No, you haven’t.  Cause if you had, 
                        we’d be listening to him right now.  
                        Has anyone ever really sat you down 
                        and played you The Boss?

                                 TODD 
                        No.
                             (Donny hands Todd a TAPE)
                        ...Do you just carry that around 
                        with you all the time?

                                 DONNY
                        You never know when you’re gonna 
                        have to save lives.

           Todd takes the tape and kinda BANGS it against his stereo.

                                 TODD
                        Oh, wait, that’s right, I left my 
                        tape player in 1987.  Can I borrow 
                        your time machine?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 TODD (cont'd)
                             (Donny rolls his eyes)
                        I’ll pick you up another pair of 
                        those jeans.

                                 DONNY
                             (SNATCHES the tape back)
                        Hilarious.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A HUGE, VERY BLOODY CRUCIFIX, AS AN ORGAN DRONES OMINOUSLY.

           INT. MAGNIFICENT CHURCH - LATER

           Todd ANXIOUSLY stares up at the gruesome CRUCIFIX above the 
           altar, as an ANGRY PRIEST (50, angry) prepares to address the 
           WEDDING PARTY (who stand in rigid wedding formation, SILENT).  
           Donny leans in to Todd’s ear and whispers (re: crucifix).

                                 DONNY
                        That’s one dead hippie.
                             (Todd doesn’t respond)
                        He looks like Duane Allman.  After 
                        his motorcycle accident.
                             (Todd SHUSHES him)
                        But, are these people serious with 
                        this thing?  It’s disgusting -- 

                                 ANGRY PRIEST
                             (CLEARS his throat)
                        Todd and Stacey are making a 
                        commitment to each other for all 
                        eternity.  It’s the single most 
                        important decision of their lives --

           Todd EXHALES LOUDLY -- everyone looks at him.

                                 TODD
                        Sorry.

           Donny REGISTERS Todd’s anxiety as the Priest continues.

                                 ANGRY PRIEST
                        So, is it too much to ask that you 
                        act respectfully on Sunday?  Hey, I 
                        get it, it’s Manhattan out there.  
                        Everyone’s having sex and lattes, 
                        God’s a big joke and I’m an idiot 
                        for not having HBO.  But while 
                        you’re in my church, you will 
                        respect Jesus.
                             (Todd SWALLOWS hard)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANGRY PRIEST (cont'd)
                        No giggling, no gum chewing, and no 
                        phones.  You can text your coke 
                        dealer when you get home, okay?  
                        And when the ceremony’s over, no 
                        clapping.

                                 DONNY
                        Is this a funeral or a funeral?

                                 ANGRY PRIEST
                        Best man, is that a real question?

                                 DONNY
                        No, I was just kidding.  You know, 
                        cause you’re so serious.  I just - 
                        Happy occasion, right? 

           The Priest just continues, annoyed.

                                 ANGRY PRIEST
                        Okay, so, on Sunday, the choir will 
                        begin, you’ll come down the aisle, 
                        pause at the altar, genuflect, then 
                        move to where you’re standing right 
                        now.  Everyone got that?

           Donny raises his hand -- the Priest looks at him, annoyed.

                                 DONNY
                        Sorry, just wanna be clear, though.  
                        So, by genuflect, you mean ‘think 
                        about how great it is that they’re 
                        getting married’, right?

                                 ANGRY PRIEST
                        No...by genuflect, I mean bow to 
                        one knee and make the signal of the 
                        cross.

                                 DONNY
                        Right.  Got it.  So, should Todd 
                        and I do that too, though?

                                 ANGRY PRIEST
                        What do you mean?

                                 TODD
                        Wait, Don --

                                 DONNY
                        Cause we’re Jewish.

           Everyone’s STUNNED -- Donny doesn’t know why.
                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        I mean, I don’t care.  I’m a team 
                        player on this thing.

           Everyone LOOKS at Todd -- he LAUGHS NERVOUSLY.

                                 TODD
                        Donny, I’m not Jewish.  I’m 
                        Catholic, remember?

                                 DONNY
                        What?
                             (tries to recover)
                        Oh, yeah...right.  I always get 
                        those two mixed up.  

                                 TODD
                        Okay, thanks Father.  So, we’ll 
                        just catch you on Sunday, then?

                                 ANGRY PRIEST
                             (suspicious)
                        You know, I can’t marry you in my 
                        church if you haven’t been 
                        baptized.

                                 TODD
                        No worries.

                                 ANGRY PRIEST
                        No worries, you’ve been baptized?

                                 STACEY
                        Yes, of course he has.  He’s 
                        Catholic, Father.  Right, Todd?

                                 TODD
                        Totally.  Almost too Catholic.  
                        ...Not that that’s possible.

                                 ANGRY PRIEST
                        When was your last communion?

                                 TODD
                        A couple...times ago.

                                 ANGRY PRIEST
                        What is communion?

                                 TODD
                        You know.
                                 ANGRY PRIEST
                        Yes, I do know.

                                 TODD
                        It’s...like a dance ritual...in the 
                        backyard...of God.  In God’s 
                        backyard.  
                             (beat)
                        Metaphorically.
                             (beat)
                        It’s open to interpretation.

           Off the Angry Priest’s ANGRY LOOK --

           EXT. CHURCH - LATER

           Donny, Chad, and the parents stand to the side as Stacey and 
           Todd ARGUE.  She’s PISSED, he STAMMERS.

                                 TODD
                        I just - You told me how important 
                        it was to your family that you 
                        married Catholic, so I just kinda 
                        went with it.

                                 STACEY
                        You mean you lied.

                                 TODD
                        Yes...but out of love.  It was a 
                        love lie.  Like faking an orgasm.

           Jon GLARES at him.

                                 STACEY
                        We’ve got 300 people coming here 
                        the day after tomorrow, Todd.

                                 TODD
                        Well, maybe we could just do it 
                        somewhere else.

                                 STACEY
                        This is the number one church in 
                        Manhattan!

                                 TODD
                        ...What does that even mean?
                                 STACEY
                        You’ll just have to convert.  He 
                        can baptize you right before the 
                        ceremony.  They did it at my cousin 
                        Jodie’s wedding.

                                 TODD
                        Really?  But...

                                 STACEY
                        What?  You’re willing to lie about 
                        being Catholic but you’re not 
                        willing to actually convert?

                                 TODD
                        No, I guess - It’s just kind of a 
                        major decision, you know...  
                             (looks up at the church, 
                              weighs the cons)
                        I mean there’s the whole abstinence 
                        education thing which is just 
                        really irresponsible.  And don’t 
                        they not let dudes be gay?  That’s 
                        just so...stupid.  And, pro-life?

                                 STACEY
                        Do you really think now’s the time 
                        to make a political stand!?

           Todd hesitates -- Donny comes to his defense.

                                 DONNY
                        He’s got a point about the gay shit 
                        though.  I mean, I’m straight, but 
                        those little guys should be allowed 
                        to do their thing.

                                 STACEY
                             (GLARES at Donny, then)
                        Well, Todd, if you wanna marry me 
                        on Sunday, you’re converting.  
                             (gets in a taxi)
                        You’re ruining our wedding.  C’mon 
                        Chad, let’s go to our facials.

                                 CHAD
                             (glares at Todd)
                        You know how many guys would 
                        literally kill to marry Stacey, 
                        bro? 

                                 TODD
                        I think you mean figuratively...
           Chad FAKES a lunge -- Todd FLINCHES!  Chad gets in the cab.  
           Stacey SLAMS the door!  The taxi goes.  Jon turns to Todd.  

                                 JON HAYWARD
                        I paid a lot of money for this 
                        weekend, guy.  We’re not all 
                        millionaires.

           He STORMS off.  Todd goes after him.  Helen stays with Donny.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        Well...I love Jewish guys.

           Donny’s weirded out -- she GRABS his ass -- he JUMPS away!

                                 DONNY
                        Whoa, Helen.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        Oh, c’mon.  Prancing around all day 
                        in those tight jeans - you’re 
                        practically asking for it!

           Donny’s taken aback -- Todd returns, beaten -- he SENSES the 
           WEIRDNESS between Helen and Donny -- then Helen hurries away.  
           Donny turns to Todd -- Todd puts up a hand (”Not a word.”).

                                 DONNY
                        I’m sorry man, but you didn’t give 
                        me a handbook with all the things 
                        you’re lying about, you know?  And 
                        who lies about being Jewish?  You 
                        know how many people are trying to 
                        get into this thing of ours?
                             (Todd rolls his eyes)
                        Even just from a business 
                        standpoint it doesn’t make a lot of 
                        sense.  You’re leaving a ton of 
                        clients on the table.  

                                 TODD
                             (looks at the HUGE CHURCH)
                        God, am I really gonna be Catholic?

                                 DONNY
                        Well, it seems to be making that 
                        priest pretty happy.

                                 TODD
                        Yeah, and he’s like the most 
                        Catholic you can be.  You’d think 
                        being that close to God would put 
                        you in a better mood.
                                 DONNY
                        Well, in his defense, he hasn’t had 
                        sex in fifty years.
                             (Todd suppresses a smile)
                        Can you imagine the orgasm built up 
                        in his pants?  It would be just 
                        like a beam of pure energy.  And 
                        blood.

                                 TODD
                             (reluctantly laughs)
                        Or just dust.  Like a dry cough.

                                 DONNY
                        Yeah, it could go either way.  
                        Nothing, or like the end of 
                        Caddyshack.

           THEY LAUGH TOGETHER, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A DECADE.

                                 TODD 
                        Yeah, this is ridiculous.  I’m not 
                        converting.  No way.  No way.

           INT. TUX SHOP - LATER

           A TAILOR fits Donny’s TUX as Todd (tux) talks to Stacey on 
           the phone.  He’s SO WHIPPED.  Donny watches, disappointed.

                                 TODD (ON THE PHONE)
                        Stace - I - I’m sorry, but, can we 
                        just discuss this? ...Yeah, I guess 
                        it could be confusing to our kids 
                        if I was the only Jew in the house.   
                        Of course I still want kids - No, I 
                        wasn’t lying about that too - No, 
                        I’m not lying about anything else -  
                             (deflates)
                        Okay, I get it, I’ll convert, okay?  
                        I’ll convert.  ...Alright, I love --

           The line goes dead.  Todd hangs up, a bit FREAKED.

                                 DONNY
                        You mighta been too tough on her.

                                 TODD
                        She’s not really wrong on this, 
                        Don.  I lied.  Besides, what am I 
                        supposed to do?  Everything’s 
                        falling apart.  Surprisingly, since 
                        about the time you showed up.  
                                 DONNY
                        Hey, I don’t care if you’re Jewish 
                        or not.  I mean, the Holocaust, but 
                        whatever.  I just - I get a not so 
                        great vibe off her, okay?  And my 
                        vibes are always right.  I mean, 
                        how well do we really know Stacey?

                                 TODD
                        Uh, you don’t know her at all.

                                 DONNY
                        Right.  It just - It seems like you 
                        do whatever she wants.

                                 TODD
                        Yeah, I love her.  See, in an adult 
                        relationship, you make sacrifices 
                        for each other.  It’s not always 
                        about you.

                                 DONNY
                        Okay.  You’re right.  Sorry.

                                 TODD
                             (to the Tailor, agitated)
                        Are we almost done?

                                 TAILOR
                        Yes, sir.  Almost.
                             (to Donny, re: his pants)
                        What do you think?

                                 DONNY
                        Let’s go a little tighter.  
                             (long beat, then)
                        So, T...have you thought any more 
                        about going out to see your mom 
                        tomorrow?  I’d love a wingman.

                                 TODD
                        God, I don’t know.  
                             (thinks back)
                        I barely remember her.  What was I, 
                        like, 4 the last time you took me 
                        out there?  Why’d we stop going?

                                 DONNY
                        My guidance counselor thought that 
                        having a long distance relationship 
                        with an inmate was affecting my 
                        grades. And my ability to have 
                        normal relationships.
                                 TODD
                        So, what’s your relationship like 
                        now?  Are you cool with her raping 
                        you and everything?

                                 DONNY
                        Yeah, it’s cool.
                             (off the Tailor’s LOOK)
                        Don’t worry, she was really hot. 
                             (to Tailor re: pants)
                        C’mon, man, don’t be shy.

                                 TODD
                        I can’t believe she’s been in jail 
                        this whole time.  Can you imagine?  
                        It can’t be as bad as men’s prison, 
                        though, if you know what I mean...      

                                 DONNY
                             (SO SCARED OF PRISON)
                        Yes, I know exactly what you mean.

                                 TODD
                        Well, I don’t know.  Why don’t you 
                        just go with Ziering or something?

                                 DONNY
                        We had a falling out.

                                 TODD
                             (surprised)
                        You’re not friends with Ziering 
                        anymore?  What happened?

                                 DONNY
                        Nothing specific.  I don’t think 
                        either of us can really put our 
                        finger on it.  Whatever, I don’t 
                        care.

                                 TODD
                        Really?  You guys were so close.  
                        He lived with us for like 12 years.

                                 DONNY
                        I know.  He is pretty awesome.

                                 TODD
                        Well, you should just be a grown- 
                        up, and go apologize.  Be the 
                        bigger man. 
                                 DONNY
                        It’s complicated.  I don’t wanna 
                        make the first move, and...  You 
                        know, he hates you too.  He was 
                        like your uncle, and you just left 
                        and never called.  For 8 years.  
                        That rubs people the wrong way.

                                 TODD
                        I know...  
                             (beat, thinks...)
                        You know what?  Fine, I’ll go to 
                        the prison with you tomorrow.  

                                 DONNY
                        Really?  Wow.

                                 TODD
                        It’s the right thing to do. But you 
                        gotta do me a favor.  Can you just 
                        behave the rest of the weekend? You 
                        know, blend in, don’t sleep with 
                        Stacey’s mom, that sorta thing.  

                                 DONNY
                        She’s pretty hot, but, okay.  Yes.  
                        Done.  Your mom’ll be so happy.

                                 TAILOR
                             (to Donny)
                        ...Are you sure you want these so 
                        tight in the seat?

                                 TODD
                             (looks at Donny’s pants)
                        Whoa, those are way too tight.  
                        It’s a tux, not a wet-suit.  

                                 DONNY
                        I could go even tighter.

                                 TODD
                        Don, I can literally see the rim of 
                        your penis.

                                 DONNY
                        Barely.

           A shot of Donny’s CROTCH -- LIKE A PENIS IN SHRINK-WRAP.

                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        Tell me where it says showing a 
                        little peen doesn’t go a long way? 
                                 TODD
                        You can’t show that much peen, Don.

                                 DONNY
                        I can show as much peen as gets the 
                        job done!

                                 TODD
                        What happened to blending in?

                                 DONNY
                        Fine, take ‘em out a little.  But 
                        you’re letting the terrorists win.    

           The Tailor looks at them ODDLY, then RELEASES the seat a bit.

                                 TAILOR
                        Okay, let’s see you two.

           Todd and Donny look in the mirror, side by side in WEDDING 
           TUXES...Donny puts his ARM AROUND Todd -- Todd SHAKES it off.

                                 TODD
                        C’mon.  We’re gonna get Stacey her 
                        favorite cupcakes and she’s gonna 
                        forget all about everything.

           EXT. MAGNOLIA BAKERY - LATER 

           Todd and Donny wait in a REALLY LONG LINE.

                                 DONNY
                        This line is for cupcakes?  What’re 
                        they made of, blowjobs?  

           Some PATRONS look at Donny oddly.  Todd waves apologetically.

                                 TODD
                        They’re just really good cupcakes.

                                 DONNY
                        God, I hate Manhattan.
                             (notices Todd is ANXIOUS)
                        ...Hey, I don’t wanna talk outta 
                        turn, but for a guy that’s supposed 
                        to be having the happiest weekend 
                        of his life, you’re pretty wound 
                        up.  I mean, when I was your age, I 
                        didn’t have a care in the world.  

                                 TODD
                        Yeah, I remember.
                                 DONNY
                        Right.  So, do you wanna...talk?

                                 TODD
                        With you?  I’m fine.

                                 DONNY
                        You know, you can put on as many 
                        fancy Men’s Wearhouse suits as you 
                        want, but I still know you better 
                        than anyone else.  My vibes can 
                        sense when something’s wrong.  
                        C’mon, I can do this.  The old 
                        father/son talk.  Hit me with it.  
                        One time.

                                 TODD
                             (beat, relents a bit)
                        I’m just...stressed out, I guess.  

                                 DONNY
                        YES!  I knew something was wrong!  
                        Who’s the shitty dad, now!?  YEAH!
                             (off Todd/everyone’s LOOK)
                        Sorry.

           Todd can’t help but smile a bit (DONNY’S LIKE A CHILD).

                                 TODD
                        I’m fine.  It’s normal.  I just 
                        kinda got a lot going on right now, 
                        okay?  Really.  Nothing’s wrong.

           Donny eyes Todd, UNCONVINCED.  Beat.

                                 DONNY
                        Hey, you know what I do when I’ve 
                        got too much going on upstairs?  I 
                        go and just get annihilated.  Just 
                        black out drunk.

                                 TODD
                        That’s your advice?  To get drunk?

                                 DONNY
                        Sometimes if you stop thinking, 
                        answers come to you.  You’ve always 
                        been way too responsible.

           INT. MAGNOLIA BAKERY - CONTINUOUS

           They walk in.
                                 TODD
                        I can’t even remember the last time 
                        I got drunk.

                                 DONNY
                        What about your bachelor party?

                                 TODD
                        I didn’t have one.  I hate 
                        strippers.  I always make up really 
                        depressing back stories for them in 
                        my head.

                                 DONNY
                        God, we’re different.  Well, you 
                        gotta let me throw you a bachelor 
                        party.  It’s bad luck not to have 
                        one.  

           They’re at the counter now.  Todd orders.

                                 TODD
                        We’ll take a dozen red velvets.
                             (to Donny)
                        I don’t think so, Don.

                                 DONNY
                        Please, c’mon, I missed a lot of 
                        stuff in your life.  When you took 
                        your first step, I was at a sleep-
                        over.  Your first day of school - I 
                        also had school.  A different 
                        school.  Had it been the same 
                        school, I coulda worked it out, but 
                        - no excuses - I wasn’t there for 
                        you enough.  I missed your prom --

                                 TODD
                        I didn’t go to prom.

                                 DONNY
                        Well...then I missed that bullshit 
                        conversation where you tell the kid 
                        “Who cares that no one wants to go 
                        to prom with you, you’ll show them 
                        all when you’re rich and famous.”  
                        I missed a lot of big moments in 
                        your life, but here’s a chance for 
                        me to be there for one.

                                 MAGNOLIA CLERK
                        That’ll be 31.55.
           Donny makes a RIDICULOUSLY FAKE “attempt” to find his wallet 
           (patting all over his body, etc.).  Todd just WATCHES him -- 
           which FORCES Donny to KEEP UP THE CHARADE FOR AWHILE.

                                 TODD
                        Alright, Alligator Arms, take it 
                        easy, I got it.

           Todd MOCKINGLY MIMES his SHORT ARMED ATTEMPT to pay.

                                 DONNY
                        What?  I was legitimately looking 
                        for my wallet.

                                 TODD
                             (laughs)
                        It’s too short notice to put a 
                        party together, anyway, Don.

                                 DONNY
                        I could have six girls jammin’ shit 
                        into each other on your front lawn 
                        by the time we get home.  

           Todd (and ALL OF MAGNOLIA) LOOKS at Donny.

                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        We said no on the strippers, right?  
                        We could just grab a drink, then.

                                 TODD
                        Listen, I’d love to be able to just 
                        party whenever I want...but I’ve 
                        got responsibilities, okay?  And I 
                        can’t piss Stacey off anymore.  
                        Maybe another weekend, though. 
                        Okay, pal?

           Donny POUTS like a child, GRABS a cupcake, then --

                                 DONNY
                             (jealous tantrum)
                        Fine!  Stacey, Stacey, Stacey!
                             (takes a BIG BITE)
                        THIS IS THE WORST CUPCAKE I’VE EVER 
                        HAD IN MY LIFE!

           INT. DONNY’S ROOM - LATER 

           Donny FLOPS on the bed; turns the TV ON; FLIPS channels until 
           he STOPS on HBO’s prison show “OZ”.  He watches SO HORRIFIED 
           as an INMATE IS BEATEN AND RAPED!  Donny SLAMS the TV OFF! 
           INT. TODD AND STACEY’S ROOM - SAME

           Todd walks in to find Stacey examining her wedding dress.

                                 TODD
                        Stace...I got you red velvets...
                             (she’s unimpressed)
                        C’mon, I’m sorry okay?  I shouldn’t 
                        have lied to you.  But, I’m really 
                        psyched to be Catholic.  I stopped 
                        masturbating and everything.
                             (she rolls her eyes)
                        I wonder, though - when it’s 
                        official, and I’m no longer Jewish - 
                        do I instantly become not as good 
                        with money?  Like, do you think 
                        I’ll immediately empty our bank 
                        accounts and put it all in ‘a 
                        company my cousin says is totally 
                        not a pyramid scheme’?

                                 STACEY
                        Do you think this is all a big 
                        joke?  This is our wedding.  You 
                        know, ever since Donny - your 
                        mysterious white trash best friend 
                        that I’ve never heard of who saved 
                        your life - showed up, you’re like 
                        a totally different person.  

                                 TODD
                        What?  No, c’mon, I’m sorry.  I’m 
                        just stressed.  With the wedding 
                        and the promotion...

                                 STACEY
                        I just can’t deal with anymore 
                        surprises, okay?  Is there anything 
                        else you’re not telling me?

                                 TODD
                             (long beat)
                        Just...that I love you.

                                 STACEY
                        I’m stressed too, okay?  Listen, 
                        there’s nothing planned wedding 
                        wise tonight.  I’m gonna go out 
                        with my girls and relax.  You 
                        should go out too.  We’ll wake up 
                        tomorrow and everything’ll be back 
                        to normal, alright?
           She KISSES his cheek and walks out with the dress.

           Donny PLAYS WITH GI JOE ACTION FIGURES (making WAR SOUNDS).

           Todd enters, surprised to see Donny playing with toys.

                                 TODD
                        ...Are you playing with GI Joes?

                                 DONNY
                        What?  No, I’m collecting them.  
                        They’re collector’s items.

                                 TODD
                        ...Right.  So, I thought about it, 
                        and you know what?  If I wanna go 
                        out, I’m going out.  I told Stace 
                        I’ll be home when I’m home.  So, do 
                        you still wanna grab a drink?

                                 DONNY
                             (sits up, excited)
                        If by ‘a drink’, you mean ‘wake up 
                        in somebody else’s clothes’, I’m 
                        in.  Call your bros!

                                 TODD
                             (stammers, lying)
                        You know, well, it’s so last minute 
                        - my bros are all probably already 
                        out partying.  That’s how my crew 
                        ...do. So let’s just do you and me.

                                 DONNY
                             (touched)
                        Wow.  A one on one hang.  Yes.

                                 TODD
                        So, where should we go?  Stacey’s 
                        friend Rob promotes at Bungalow 8 
                        and Cliche.  We could probably get 
                        a table and bottle service.

                                 DONNY
                        We could also probably run over our 
                        penises with cars.
                                 TODD
                        Okay... Where do you wanna go?

                                 DONNY
                             (jumps to his feet)
                        Where people don’t wait in line for 
                        cupcakes! 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A HUGE “WELCOME TO THE JERSEY SHORE” SIGN.

           EXT. JERSEY SHORE BOARDWALK - LATER 

           THE LIT BOARDWALK LOOMS ROMANTIC.  Todd sits on the hood of 
           Donny’s Fiero as Donny goes through his garbage bag.

                                 TODD
                        I haven’t been here in forever.  It 
                        seems so much smaller.

                                 DONNY
                        They actually did close down most 
                        the boardwalk.  Tough times.  But, 
                        I know what you mean.  So, before 
                        we do anything, I gotta give you 
                        your wedding present.

           Donny hands Todd an 80s BOOMBOX -- Todd’s curious.

                                 TODD
                        Oh...thanks, Don.

                                 DONNY
                        I’m not giving you my ghetto 
                        blaster, I’m --  
                             (deep breath)
                        When I heard that John Mayer in 
                        your car, I was really angry.  But 
                        then I realized, it’s my fault.  I 
                        shoulda showed you more stuff when 
                        you were young, but I was...also 
                        young.  So, I’m gonna do something 
                        I shoulda done a long time ago.

           He grabs an ARMFUL OF CASSETTES from his bag, takes another 
           BREATH, then begins an EXCITED LECTURE, PACING throughout.

                        So a lot of people have the wrong 
                        idea about Springsteen.

                        They think of him as Bon Jovi or 
                        something and that makes me BARELY 
                        ABLE TO KEEP IT TOGETHER!  You’re 
                        talking about the guy that wrote 
                        Thunder Road, man.  Watch your 
                        mouth!  That really should be your 
                        first wedding dance - it’s 
                        embarrassing that it’s not, but, I 
                        get it, no one’s ever played you 
                        The Boss.  Well, get ready to fall 
                        in love with a man.  
                             (looks through his TAPES)
                        There’s so many ways into this.  I 
                        could hit you with Nebraska - by 
                        the time it was over you’d kill 
                        yourself cause you spent so much of 
                        your life not listening to it.
                             (looks through more TAPES)

                        Innocent - You’re gonna wanna be 
                        buried with all of them, but --

                        Born To Run.  When my Laser Tag 
                        franchise went under and you were 
                        eating all the money I had left... 
                        this is the only thing that stroked 
                        my hair and said, “Shhhhh.”  OOH --
                             (holds up THE RIVER)
                        The year you ran away - not that it 
                        was a big deal or anything - but, I 
                        wore out 3 copies of The River.  
                        Fact, The River is about 
                        everybody’s life ever.  That’s what 
                        The Boss does best.  He writes 
                        about your life.  Literally.  
                             (sings)
                        “I got Mary pregnant, man that was 
                        all she wrote, for my 19th birthday 
                        I got a union card and a wedding 
                        coat...

                        JUDGE PUT IT ALL TO REST” --

                                 TODD
                        C’mon, play me something already!

                                 DONNY
                        Oh, I’m sorry, am I boring you!?  
                        Maybe you don’t want your life 
                        CHANGED FOREVER!

           Todd laughs, puts up his hands in surrender.
                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        Alright, I think it’s gotta be off 
                        The River.  She was my first, now 
                        she’s gonna be yours.  But, which 
                        song?  They’re all so deadly...
                             (looks at it, SMILES)
                        You know what?  I’m gonna start you 
                        with something upbeat.  Perfect.  
                             (PUTS the tape in)
                        The Levine boys have always been 
                        lone eagles.  But, tonight, we’re 
                        not alone...

           He presses PLAY -- the HEROIC intro to “TWO HEARTS” BEGINS. 
           Donny holds his Schlitz out for a TOAST.  Todd smiles.  They 
           TOUCH CANS as the song EXPLODES for the --

           EPIC NIGHT/FALLING IN LOVE MONTAGE [THINK ROMANTIC COMEDY]:

           -- BAR.  A bartender pours booze down Donny’s throat!  Todd’s 
           RELUCTANT.  Donny PULLS him in -- Todd CHOKES down the BOOZE!

           -- BOARDWALK.  Donny THROWS a ball through a stack of bottles 
           -- wins a HUGE stuffed animal!  HE GIVES IT TO TODD!  The 
           CARNIE looks at them funny -- Donny ATTACKS the Carnie!

           -- ALLEY.  They SHOTGUN BEERS!  Todd’s EXPLODES in his FACE!  
           Donny LAUGHS, then TEACHES him -- Todd tries again, SUCCESS!

           -- BASKETBALL COURT.  2-ON-2.  They’re so DRUNK, they just 
           LAUGH.  Todd THROWS in a PRAYER -- THEY HI-FIVE, then DANCE 
           in the OTHER GUYS’ faces -- the guys get PISSED -- they RUN!

           -- BACON AND LEGGS.  Donny PULLS a reluctant Todd inside.  
           The girls POUNCE, TODD SMILES!  Champale SMILES at Donny. 

           -- TODD AND DONNY’S OLD HOUSE.  They TOAST to the HOUSE, then 
           look at the sidewalk -- REVEAL Todd’s old HANDPRINTS under 
           “THE FAT KID”.  DONNY SHRUGS -- TODD LAUGHS FORGIVINGLY!  

           DONNY spots a KID’S BIKE.  Todd shakes his head NO -- CUT TO:  
           Donny HOLDS the seat as Todd RIDES THE BIKE!  Todd smiles 
           HUGE until he realizes Donny’s LET GO -- Todd WOBBLES INTO A 
           PARKED CAR!  He tries it again -- NOW TODD’S RIDING A BIKE!

           -- THEY CREST A BIG FERRIS WHEEL WITH ARMS AROUND EACH OTHER!

                                 SPRINGSTEEN
                        “TWO HEARTS ARE BETTER THAN ONE!”

           -- ZIERING’S MOTEL.  “Two Hearts” FADES DOWN as Todd pulls a 
           RELUCTANT Donny to the door.  Donny doesn’t wanna knock. Todd 
           knocks -- Ziering answers, SURPRISED/UNHAPPY to see them.
                                 TODD
                        ...Hey, Ziering.

                                 ZIERING
                        Yo.  What’s up with you, Han?

                                 DONNY
                        His name’s Todd now.  Long story, 
                        but, he told everyone he’s an 
                        orphan.

                                 ZIERING
                        That’s gotta hurt.

                                 DONNY
                        It’s not what you want.

                                 ZIERING
                        So...you guys are back together?

                                 TODD
                        I’m getting married, man.  And --

                                 ZIERING
                        YOU HAVEN’T CALLED ME IN 8 YEARS!

           Ziering tries to SLAM the door -- Todd HOLDS it open!

                                 TODD
                        I’M SORRY!  I WAS GOING THROUGH 
                        SOME THINGS!  But, I need you at my 
                        wedding!  You’re like my uncle! 

                                 ZIERING
                             (lets go of the door)
                        Really?  I gotta admit, that’s 
                        sweet.  Thanks.  
                             (checks him out)
                        You look great, Tom - Is it Tom?

                                 TODD
                        Todd.  Thanks.  And, hey, Donny has 
                        something he wants to say to you.

           They stand there, awkwardly.  Todd prods him.  Finally --

                                 DONNY 
                        So, I said some stuff. And did some 
                        stuff...to your mom. Sorry, I mean, 
                        she came on really strong, but -- 

                                 TODD
                        You slept with his mom?
                                 DONNY
                        Yeah.  The cougars, man.  They’ve 
                        ruined my life.  But no more.  
                        Ziering, you’re my best friend, and 
                        I miss just being around you.  

                                 ZIERING
                        Wow.  Okay.  Well...I guess I said 
                        some stuff, too.  Of course I still 
                        love The Boss.  I was just trying 
                        to hurt you.

                                 DONNY
                        I’m sorry I punched you.

                                 ZIERING
                        I woulda done the same thing.

                                 DONNY
                        ...Two Hearts?  

                                 ZIERING
                             (smiles at them both)
                        Three Hearts.

           “Two Hearts” RE-IGNITES into the end of the montage!

           -- QUICK SHOTS: Ziering, Todd and Donny SHOTGUN BEERS; LAUGH; 
           POUND SHOTS; HI-FIVE!  They STUMBLE to a CHEESEBURGER STAND.

                                 TODD
                        I usually try not to eat past 7:30.
                             (off DONNY/ZIERING’S LOOK)
                        Okay, gimme a cheeseburger, no bun.
                             (off another LOOK)
                        I mean, with EIGHT BUNS!

           -- They STUMBLE along eating MESSY CHEESEBURGERS.  Todd BUMPS 
           into a DOUCHEBAG.  The guy GLARES at Todd -- Donny DECKS him!  
           Ziering DECKS his friend!  Donny turns and HITS ON the 
           Douchebags’ GIRLS.  TODD DE-PANTSES DONNY!  THEY ALL LAUGH!

           -- BEACH. THEY RUN INTO THE OCEAN IN THEIR UNDERWEAR YELLING!

           EXT. BEACH - DAWN

           Donny and Todd CRASH onto the sand as “Two Hearts” FADES.  
           Ziering FINISHES A BEER -- THEN PASSES OUT COLD ON HIS FACE!  
           Donny PRESSES STOP ON HIS BOOMBOX -- ENDING THE SONG/MONTAGE.

                                 DONNY
                        So...what do you think?
           Slowly PAN to Todd to REVEAL TEARS IN HIS EYES!

                                 TODD
                        It was - I mean, he’s...

                                 DONNY
                        I know.  He’s The Boss.

           Todd falls back onto the sand.  Donny CRASHES RIGHT NEXT TO 
           HIM.  They stare up at the stars, EUPHORICALLY DRUNK/HAPPY.

                                 TODD
                        You know how long it’s been since I 
                        had a cheeseburger, man?  I wasted 
                        my whole life, Don!

                                 DONNY
                        You kidding?  I wasted my life!

                                 TODD
                        At least you had fun.  All I had is 
                        ...responsibility.  And work.  I 
                        feel like Steve Martin in one of 
                        those family movies where he’s got 
                        too many kids.  And I’m only 25.

                                 DONNY
                        Yeah, what about me?  I don’t even 
                        own silverware.  I’m almost 40.  No 
                        forks, knives, nothing.  I still 
                        play with GI Joes.  

                                 TODD
                        I didn’t get laid til I was 22.

                                 DONNY
                        Didn’t I get you laid when you were 
                        13?

                                 TODD
                        Yeah.  But I didn’t do it again til 
                        I was 22.  God, what’s my deal?

           Donny PULLS Todd up drunkenly, points at the PERFECT SUNRISE.

                                 DONNY 
                        That’s your deal.  The future, man.  
                        Look at it.  It’s still yours. 

                                 TODD
                        It’s - spectacular.
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 TODD (cont'd)
                        Can I tell you something, you can’t 
                        tell anyone?  Especially Stacey?
                             (Donny locks his lips)
                        I hate my job.  I don’t wanna be  
                        partner.  Some days I think about 
                        losing everybody’s money so they 
                        have to fire me.  That’s not what 
                        you want in a money manager.  

                                 DONNY
                        Then quit.  I can teach you that.

                                 TODD
                        Yeah...but, Stacey’s gotta have the 
                        latest Jimmy Choo lambskin tanktop.  
                        And why shouldn’t she?  She’s hot.
                             (beat)
                        Do you ever just wanna run away?  
                        Leave everything behind and go open 
                        a bar somewhere, on a beach, like 
                        in Cocktail?  Just hang out, and 
                        flip bottles around behind your 
                        back...you know, like in Cocktail?

                                 DONNY
                             (STUNNED)
                        I love Cocktail!  That is word for 
                        word my dream. Flip bottles, recite 
                        poems, make up your own laws for 
                        life and tell them to people.  
                        “Levine’s Law #47: always put the 
                        top back on the ketchup...bottle 
                        ...of life.”  It needs work.  But - 
                        Hey, you know...I took you to see 
                        that in the theater.

                                 TODD
                        Yeah, I remember.  You got in a 
                        fist fight with the manager cause 
                        it was pretty hard R, and I was 6.  

           They LAUGH.  Then Donny LOOKS at Todd, gets PENSIVE, SERIOUS.  

                                 DONNY
                        I - I gotta tell you something 
                        Todd.  I...I’m - I’m a bad guy.

                                 TODD
                        No you’re not, man.  You’re not.  
                        You just...weren’t ready to be a 
                        dad.  I get it.  You were young.
                                 DONNY
                             (SO TOUCHED, beat)
                        Hey, lets just do it.  Tomorrow 
                        morning, let’s run away.  We’ll 
                        throw on Born To Run and just go.  
                        Open that bar on the beach.  C’mon, 
                        man, ‘Cocktails and Dreams’...

                                 TODD
                             (smiles at the thought)
                        ‘Cocktails and Dreams’...  Nah, we 
                        can’t.  The world won’t let go of 
                        it’s grip on my balls.  It’s cool 
                        though, I’m used to it.

                                 DONNY
                        It doesn’t have to be that way.  
                        You don’t have to live this life if 
                        you don’t want to.

                                 TODD
                        Yeah I do.  I’m in love.

                                 DONNY
                        Are you sure?

           They look at each other LONG...then it gets awkward.

                                 TODD 
                        ...We should probably get going.

           INT. DONNY’S ROOM - LATER

           They stand at Donny’s door, awkwardly, like the end of a 
           really great first date (THEY JUST FELL IN LOVE).

                                 DONNY
                        So...classic night.  I had a great 
                        time, Todd.

                                 TODD
                        Yeah.  Me too, Don.

           Donny hands Todd all his SPRINGSTEEN CASSETTES.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        ...But, I don’t have a tape player.  

                                 DONNY
                        Still, I want you to have them.  I 
                        should probably make the move to 
                        CDs anyway.  It’s time to grow up.  
                                 TODD
                        ...Okay, but, you know, they’re not 
                        really using CDs anymore either.

                                 DONNY
                        I love you - Oh, shit, sorry.  Was 
                        that too soon? 

                                 TODD
                        No, it’s alright.  Thanks, man.

           They stand there awkwardly, not sure how to end it (the 
           “Should I go in for a kiss?” moment at the end of a date).

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        So...good night, Don.  

                                 DONNY
                             (smiles)
                        “Good night, Dad”?  I mean, you 
                        could just see how it feels...

                                 TODD
                             (laughs, smiles)
                        Good night, Don.

           Don goes for the HUG -- AS Todd goes for the HANDSHAKE -- 
           then they SWITCH SIMULTANEOUSLY -- finally, they settle on an 
           awkward BRO HUG THING.  It’s nice.  Todd leaves.  DONNY FLOPS 
           ON THE BED AND SMILES LIKE A TEENAGER IN LOVE!

           EXT. DONNY’S ROOM - SAME

           TODD LEANS UP AGAINST THE DOOR AND SMILES THAT SAME SMILE!  
           Suddenly, his face goes GREEN -- he RUSHES to the bathroom!

           INT. DONNY’S ROOM - LATER 

           Donny undresses to his BRIEFS -- throws his clothes on the 
           FLOOR -- then looks around at his MESSY ROOM.  He shakes his 
           head, then starts to CLEAN HIS ROOM!  BEHIND HIM, Helen (sexy 
           nightie) slips in.  She GRABS him -- STARTLED, he JUMPS AWAY!

                                 DONNY
                        Whoa, Helen, what’re you doing!?

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        Call me Mrs. Hayward.  You know, I 
                        was a sub for 24 years.

           She PURSUES him -- he RETREATS around the room.
                                 DONNY
                        Um, okay, cool, but, Mrs. Hayward, 
                        you gotta get outta here.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        Actually, call me Mrs. Robinson.

           He hits the wall, CORNERED.  She POUNCES.  KISSING, MOANING!  

                                 DONNY
                        SHH!  Wow - okay, Mrs. Robinson - 
                        I’m into role play as much as the 
                        next guy, but Todd specifically 
                        asked me not to have sex with you.  
                        Your husband’s upstairs, it’s your 
                        daughter’s wedding.  This is wrong!

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        I know it is.

           Donny ENJOYS it a second -- then PUSHES her away!

                                 DONNY
                        No!  I do not wanna have sex.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                             (looks down at his briefs)
                        ...Uh, are you sure?

                                 DONNY
                             (looks at his erection)
                        That’s...not what it looks like.  
                        Seriously, no.  No thank you.  

           SHE PUSHES HIM HARD ONTO THE BED!  He’s SURPRISED by that.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        This is happening whether you like 
                        it or not.  So you might as well 
                        try and enjoy it.

           INT. HALL BATHROOM - SAME

           Todd PUKES in the sink!  He BLINDLY grabs what he THINKS IS A 
           TOWEL off the door, WIPES HIS FACE, leaves.  REVEAL the towel 
           was actually STACEY’S WEDDING DRESS -- IT’S COVERED IN PUKE!

           HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Todd stumbles down the hall -- HEARS MOANS from Donny’s room.
                                 TODD
                        Uh, Don, is everything okay?

                                 DONNY (O.S.)
                        Totally.  I’m just...masturbating.  

                                 TODD
                        ...Oh, okay.  I’m sick, man, I’ll 
                        catch you tomorrow.

           INT. DONNY’S ROOM - SAME

           Helen and Donny WRESTLE on the bed as he FENDS her off!

                                 DONNY
                        Shh!  I’m saying no.  No!  Why’s 
                        there such a DOUBLE STANDARD ON 
                        THIS THING!?

           HE PUSHES HER OFF THE BED!  She sits up, laughs defiantly.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        Fine.  You know, I cheated on 
                        Robert Redford.  That’s how hot I 
                        was.  We were dating and I cheated 
                        on him.  In his prime.  

                                 DONNY
                        C’mon, you are hot.  But, this 
                        isn’t right.  I can’t do this to 
                        Todd.  And besides, you’ve got a 
                        perfect family.  You really wanna 
                        throw all that away for one night 
                        of the best sex you ever had? 

           Helen laughs, chokes up a little.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        Perfect?  Me and Jon haven’t slept 
                        together in 11 years.  He doesn’t 
                        even look at me. 

                                 DONNY
                        Well...he’s an idiot.  
                             (being nice)
                        Hey, another weekend, and I’d be 
                        doing some really bad stuff to you.    

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        That’s the sweetest thing anyone’s 
                        ever said to me.  Okay.  Well, 
                        then, another weekend it is.
           Donny didn’t mean a raincheck.  She kisses him and exits.  

           INT. TODD AND STACEY’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           The sun is up out the window.  Todd is fast asleep.  
           Suddenly, a SHRILL SCREAM ERUPTS from downstairs!

                                 STACEY (O.S.)
                        AHHHHHH!!  OH MY GOD!!  HEEELLLP!!

           Todd wakes up, HUNGOVER.  Stacey runs in YELLING, holding her 
           DRESS!  Todd JUMPS up -- TRIPS -- SLAMS into the WALL!  

                                 TODD
                        What happened?  Are you okay!?

                                 STACEY
                        Do I sound okay!?  I’m screaming at 
                        the top of my lungs!  My dress is 
                        covered in PUKE!

           Todd thinks back...REMEMBERS, then -- Donny (in just briefs) 
           RUSHES in wielding NUNCHUCKS and SCREAMING!

                                 DONNY
                        AAAHHHH!
                             (looks around, beat)
                        Whoa, sorry.  I thought someone was 
                        killing Stacey.  What’s going on?

                                 STACEY
                        Oh, I don’t know, Don, I found my 
                        wedding dress in your bathroom 
                        covered in PUKE!  I CAN’T BELIEVE 
                        YOU PUKED ON MY WEDDING DRESS!

                                 TODD
                        Whoa, whoa.  No, Stace.  It wasn’t - 
                        I’m sorry, but, it was...

                                 DONNY
                             (covers for Todd)
                        -- A huge mistake.  I was so drunk 
                        and - I’m really, really sorry.

                                 STACEY
                        DON’T THEY HAVE SCHOOLS IN YOUR 
                        TRAILER PARK!?
                                 TODD
                             (surprised by her anger)
                        Stace, relax.  I mean, it was 
                        clearly an accident, and he --

                                 STACEY
                        DON’T BE SUCH A PUSSY, TODD!

           Todd doesn’t know what to say, then -- ZIERING (NUDE) SPRINTS 
           IN WIELDING A LAMP, YELLING!  They turn to look at him -- he 
           realizes everything’s okay (and that he’s naked).

                                 ZIERING
                        Oh sorry.  You...must be the bride.
                             (uncomfortable beat)
                        Whaazzzuuuuuuup?

                                 STACEY
                             (so confused)
                        Are you Ian Ziering?

                                 ZIERING
                        Thanks.  Yeah.  I could sign 
                        something for you if you want or...

                                 STACEY
                             (to Todd)
                        Why is Steve Sanders cupping his 
                        penis in my bedroom right now?

                                 TODD
                        Um...he’s...

                                 ZIERING
                             (thinking he’s smooth)
                        I’m Tom’s uncle.

                                 STACEY
                        Who’s Tom?

           Ziering’s lost -- Donny jumps in, trying to help.

                                 DONNY
                        Oh, that’s just a nickname he has 
                        for Todd.  

                                 STACEY
                        His nickname for Todd is Tom?

                                 ZIERING
                        Yep.
                                 STACEY
                             (to Todd)
                        And he’s your uncle?

                                 TODD
                        He’s like an uncle...figure.

                                 STACEY
                        So...you never mentioned to me that 
                        Ian Ziering is like an uncle figure 
                        to you? 

                                 TODD
                        It never came up.

                                 STACEY
                        I thought we said no more lies!

                                 TODD
                        Well, this was more of an omission.

                                 STACEY
                        I don’t know what’s going on, but I 
                        don’t have time to deal with this!  
                             (deep breath, crazy calm)
                        Ohhmm.  Here’s what’s gonna happen.  
                        I’m gonna take my dress to the dry 
                        cleaners, go to pilates, meet the 
                        wedding planner, then tonight we’re 
                        gonna go to the rehearsal dinner, 
                        and you’re gonna be the normal Todd 
                        from 3 days ago.  Then tomorrow 
                        we’re gonna get married and live 
                        HAPPILY EVER AFTER!  I’ll yell at 
                        you on the honeymoon.

           She STORMS out.  LONG BEAT, as her yelling sinks in.

                                 ZIERING
                        She reminds me of a young Shannon 
                        Doherty.

                                 TODD
                        I mean, I did puke on her wedding 
                        dress.  But, some of the name-
                        calling seemed excessive, right?

           Long silent beat.  Ziering admires Donny’s nunchucks.

                                 ZIERING
                        Sweet nunchucks, man.  
                             (beat, looks at his WRIST)
                        So I’m gonna throw on some clothes.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ZIERING (cont'd)
                        Gotta get to the rink.  Big Bat 
                        Mitzvah party today.  Thanks for 
                        letting me crash, man.  

           Ziering AWKWARDLY (nakedly) hugs them, then turns and goes -- 
           REVEAL a HUGE SPRINGSTEEN TATTOO on his back as he exits.

                                 TODD
                        Thanks for covering for me, Don.

                                 DONNY
                        No problem.  You know, you can tell 
                        me if she hits you...  

                                 TODD
                        Wow, right?  I don’t...
                             (checks his watch)
                        Hey, we gotta hurry if we’re gonna 
                        make it to the prison.

                                 DONNY
                        What?  You still wanna go?

                                 TODD
                        I told you I would.  And I’m not 
                        gonna make this situation any 
                        worse.  But we should hurry.  If 
                        I’m late to the rehearsal dinner, 
                        Stacey might go on a killing spree.

                                 DONNY
                             (laughs, then TORN)
                        Oh, yeah.  You sure, though?

                                 TODD
                        I could use the drive.  And you 
                        shouldn’t go alone.  And, I mean, I 
                        should see her if she might...die.

           INT. TODD’S MERCEDES - LATER

           Todd stares out the window, MULLING HIS FUTURE.  Donny stares 
           out the window, CONFLICTED.  Donny turns to him POINTEDLY. 

                                 DONNY
                        8 years, man?  8 years?  Didn’t you 
                        miss me at all?  Was I that bad?  

                                 TODD
                             (long beat, sighs)
                        It wasn’t you...only.  I just got 
                        tired of getting called Rape Baby 
                        all the time, you know?
                                 DONNY
                        Yeah, I’m tired of getting called 
                        Donny Levine all the time, I guess.
                             (looks at Todd, sincerely)
                        I’m sorry, Todd.  I know I kinda 
                        just threw you into life.  Like the 
                        pool.  But you learned to swim 
                        pretty good.  Wait, that’s a legit 
                        metaphor.  Nice.  The pool of life.  
                             (Todd laughs)
                        We were kinda just growing up at 
                        the same time, you know?  And I 
                        didn’t really have any good 
                        parenting models to show me how 
                        it’s done.  My mom died when I was 
                        5, and my dad - your grandpa - 
                        always blamed me.  Cause she fell 
                        off a roller coaster at my birthday 
                        party.  
                             (CHOKES UP)
                        That can’t be my fault, right?

                                 TODD
                        ...No, man.  That’s ridiculous.

                                 DONNY
                        Thanks.  That’s what I always said.  
                        Talk about bad dads.  That’s why I 
                        moved us out the second I turned 
                        18.  However messed up you think 
                        you are, you woulda been worse if 
                        he raised you.  Trust me.  You 
                        woulda ended up like...me.  

                                 TODD
                        C’mon...you’re not so bad.

                                 DONNY
                        You and I have a lot in common.  We 
                        barely knew our moms, and we both 
                        ran out on our shitty dads.
                             (they laugh nostalgic/sad)
                        Hey, we had some good times when 
                        you were young, right?  When you 
                        still thought I was your brother?

           QUICK FLASHBACKS:

           -- METS GAME.  6 Year Old Todd RAISES his glove to catch a 
           FOUL BALL...a DRUNK GUY leans in, SNATCHES it away!  Donny 
           TACKLES the guy, BEATS HIM, then hands the ball to Todd!
           -- PARTY.  27 Year Old Donny and his FRIENDS CHEER as 13 Year 
           Old Todd CHOKES DOWN a beer bong -- then HI-FIVES everyone!

           THEN, Donny PUSHES drunk 13 Year Old Todd into a BEDROOM.  AS 
           THE DOOR CLOSES, we see 2 GIRLS smile SEDUCTIVELY and walk 
           toward a VERY SCARED TODD (he’s about to lose his virginity). 

           BACK TO PRESENT, TODD’S MERCEDES:

           They both laugh, NOSTALGICALLY.

                                 TODD
                        Yeah.  You weren’t the best dad, 
                        but you were a great older brother.  
                        And...also, thanks for taking me 
                        out last night.  That was cool.  

                                 DONNY
                        Hey, what’re friends for?  Or 
                        brothers, or fathers - or whatever 
                        we are.  What’re they for?

                                 TODD
                        You know, when you showed up here I 
                        was sure you were just after money.  
                        But - I can’t believe I’m saying 
                        this - I’m really glad you’re gonna 
                        be at my wedding tomorrow.  

           Donny’s SO TOUCHED.  He thinks...then SUDDENLY --

                                 DONNY
                        You know what?  Forget the prison.  
                        Let’s blow it off.  Are there any 
                        good mini-golf courses around here?

                                 TODD
                        What?  I thought this was really 
                        important to you.

                                 DONNY
                             (HIDING SOMETHING)
                        No, I changed my mind.  I don’t 
                        wanna go.  She’ll probably survive.

                                 TODD
                        We’re here already.  We gotta do 
                        this.  It’s the right thing to do.

           Donny looks out the window, SO CONFLICTED, as they pull into 
           the lot of the “NEW JERSEY STATE WOMEN’S PENITENTIARY”.
           INT. JERSEY STATE PRISON - LATER

           They wait for the VISITORS DOOR to open.  They’re both 
           NERVOUS.  Donny’s SO TORN, he looks around ANXIOUSLY.

                                 DONNY
                        Todd.  I - I’m sorry. 

                                 TODD
                        I know.  I’m sorry too. I shouldn’t 
                        have just run out on you like that.

           Todd HUGS him clumsily.  Donny’s SO TOUCHED.  The DOOR OPENS.  
           Todd walks into the VISITORS ROOM.  Donny trails, HESITANTLY.

           THE VISITORS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           REVEAL MARY MCGARRICLE (older now, but still so hot, like if 
           Goldie Hawn had big Jersey hair and TATTOOS).  She SPRINTS to 
           Donny and KISSES him rabidly!  A BIG GUARD PULLS her off him!

                                 BIG GUARD
                        C’mon, Mary.  You know the rules.

                                 MARY MCGARRICLE
                        Gimme a break, Gary.  I’m horny!

           She looks at Todd dramatically.  He’s NERVOUS/SPEECHLESS...

                                 MARY MCGARRICLE (CONT’D)
                        ...Oh my god.  My...baby?

                                 TODD
                        Um...hey, what’s up with you?

           She BEAR HUGS him!  Donny looks around SO ANXIOUS NOW.  

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                             (re: Mary’s full hair)
                        So...at least the chemo hasn’t made 
                        you lose your hair.

                                 MARY MCGARRICLE
                        ...Chemo?  

           Todd notices Donny’s ANXIETY.  Todd looks around and spots 
           MONTEL WILLIAMS AND A FULL CAMERA CREW IN THE CORNER. 

                                 TODD
                        Is that Montel Williams?
                                 DONNY
                        What a weird coincidence.

           Montel RUSHES forward wielding his microphone at Todd.

                                 MONTEL WILLIAMS
                        Hello, Han.  Thanks for giving us 
                        your first ever exclusive.  Can you 
                        describe what you’re feeling?

                                 TODD
                        ...What?

                                 MONTEL WILLIAMS
                        It must be emotional for you to see 
                        your mother after so long.  

                                 TODD
                             (looks at Donny)
                        What is this?

                                 DONNY
                        Before you say anything.  We get a 
                        hundred grand.

                                 TODD
                        I - I can’t believe you...  
                             (re: Mary McGarricle)
                        Is - Is she even dying?

                                 DONNY
                        ...Dying to know where the junior 
                        high kids hang out.  
                             (off EVERYONE’S LOOK)
                        Too soon?

                                 TODD
                        Wow.  I’m actually impressed.  This 
                        is an amazing new low for you.   

                                 DONNY
                        They would only pay big if it was 
                        the whole family.  But, I set this 
                        up before me and you started, you 
                        know...loving each other again --

                                 TODD
                        I NEVER LOVED YOU!  How could you 
                        put me on TV with this shit!?
                                 DONNY
                        I - I’m in a lot of trouble, okay!?  
                        I need 45 grand by Tuesday or I’m 
                        going to jail for 3 years.

                                 TODD
                             (laughs)
                        These are my parents, ladies and 
                        gentleman.  Can you believe I’m 
                        still alive?

                                 DONNY
                        Listen, it makes sense.  I didn’t 
                        wanna just ask you for the money 
                        cause, you know, teach a man to 
                        fish and - so I thought --

                                 TODD
                        -- You’d trick me into doing an on 
                        camera interview with Montel 
                        Williams?  Did you actually think I 
                        wouldn’t be mad!? 

                                 DONNY
                        I DIDN’T REALLY THINK IT THROUGH, 
                        OKAY?!  I DON’T WANNA GO TO PRISON!  
                             (to the Guard)
                        No offense.

           Todd STARTS out -- Donny GRABS him -- Todd DECKS him!  

                                 TODD
                        Every minute I’ve been in this 
                        world I’ve been fighting against 
                        you trying to destroy me.  I can’t 
                        believe I entertained the idea of -- 
                             (stops himself)
                        Really, can you spend just one day 
                        not trying to ruin my life?!

                                 DONNY
                        Yeah, well, you ruined my life!  
                        Don’t you think I had dreams!?  If 
                        you weren’t born I probably woulda 
                        been a pro baseball player.  That’s 
                        what I was planning to do!  But, 
                        yay!  It’s a baby!  WHAT A 
                        BLESSING!  Was I supposed to just 
                        put my whole life aside for you!?

                                 TODD
                        YES!  It’s called parenting!  How 
                        do you live with yourself?
                                 DONNY
                        How do you live with yourself?  Oh 
                        that’s right, you don’t.  You leave 
                        your family, make up a whole fake 
                        self, and LIVE WITH HIM!

                                 TODD
                        GOD, I WISH YOU WEREN’T MY DAD!

                                 DONNY
                        I wish I wasn’t your dad!  Then I 
                        could kick your ass and NOT GET 
                        ARRESTED FOR CHILD ABUSE!

           Todd KICKS Donny -- Donny CATCHES his leg and PULLS him down!  
           They roll around WRESTLING!  Todd gets on top, CHOKES Donny!

                                 DONNY
                        It’s - a really - big moment when 
                        you beat up your dad for the first 
                        time.  Con - gratulations.

                                 TODD
                        YOU’RE NOT MY DAD!

           The Guard TASERS them -- they SEIZURE apart, SHIVER IN PAIN!  

                           TODD
                                                          DONNY
           Oh my god that hurts!
                                              I’m dying!

           Todd recovers, CRAWLS away and out the door.  Donny slumps.

                                 MONTEL WILLIAMS
                        ...Uh, Don, we can’t use anything 
                        without his consent.  You pulled me 
                        away from St. Barts for this shit!?

                                 DONNY
                        Oh, gimme a break, Montel.  My 
                        life’s falling apart right now.

                                 MONTEL WILLIAMS
                        That’s the last time you ever do my 
                        show.  Unless maybe we book you for 
                        ‘The Worst Dads Ever’!

                                 DONNY
                        You wanna hurt feelings?  Okay, you 
                        look like a PENIS WITH A GOATEE!

           Montel STORMS off!  Mary McGarricle CRADLES Donny, PUTS HER 
           HANDS THROUGH his hair.
                                 MARY MCGARRICLE
                        You look smoking hot, Donny.

                                 DONNY
                        Thanks, Miss McGarricle.

           She smiles at him.  Donny KISSES her passionately -- the 
           Guard TASERS him again!  

                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        OH, C’MON GARY!

           INT. DONNY’S ROOM - LATER 

           Donny THROWS his stuff into his GARBAGE BAG.  That old PHOTO 
           of him and Young Todd falls out.  He picks it up, pauses to 
           admire it, SO SADLY.  HE CHOKES UP.  A PHONE RINGS O.S.

           EXT. DONNY’S ROOM - SAME

           Stacey ANSWERS the phone right outside Donny’s door.

                                 STACEY (ON THE PHONE)
                        Hello?
                             (whispers)
                        Bill, I told you not to call me on 
                        this phone. What if Todd picked up?

           INT. DONNY’S ROOM - SAME

           Donny goes to the door, listens to Stacey SUSPICIOUSLY.

                                 STACEY (O.S)
                        No, Todd doesn’t know anything.  I 
                        don’t care if he finds out after 
                        the wedding.  There’ll be nothing 
                        he can do then, anyway.  Bill - 
                        Bill, I’m calling you on my cell.  
                             (yells upstairs)
                        Todd, let’s go!  We’re late!

           Donny hears her walk away.  HE’S FREAKED, then runs out --

           STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER 

           Donny comes up the stairs as Todd hurries down.

                                 DONNY
                        Todd, we gotta talk.  
                                 TODD 
                        No, we don’t.  Pack your shit and 
                        get out of my life forever.

           Todd BLOWS by him and out the front door!

           INT. TODD’S MERCEDES - LATER

           Todd drives, DISTRACTED, DESPONDENT.  Stacey’s curious.

                                 STACEY
                        What’s going on now?

                                 TODD
                        Nothing.  Everything’s awesome.  

                                 STACEY
                        My dad thinks you’re a drug dealer 
                        or something.

                                 TODD
                        Sorry.  Tell him I’m not, please.

           They pull up to the FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT.

                                 STACEY
                        Well, snap out of it.  This is our 
                        rehearsal dinner.  You look like 
                        you just got punched in the ass!

           She gets out, PISSED -- SLAMS the door behind her!

           INT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT - LATER

           A BAND plays.  A formal rehearsal dinner.  200 PEOPLE.  Todd 
           tries to smile as he talks to Bill, in a group of Stacey, 
           Jon, Helen, Chad, Mia and others.

                                 BILL SCOTT
                        So, Todd, I have some news.  I was 
                        gonna wait ‘til tomorrow, but I 
                        can’t hold it in.  I decided...  
                        You’re my new partner!  YOU GOT IT! 

           Stacey CLAPS and SMILES -- then SHE HUGS BILL EMPHATICALLY!

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        Oh my god, honey.  Congratulations!
                                 TODD
                             (not psyched)
                        Wow, Bill I don’t know what to say.  

                                 BILL SCOTT
                        Say you won’t let me down.  It’s 
                        gonna be a lot more responsibility, 
                        but it’s also gonna be a lot more 
                        of that sweet female deer.
                             (off everyone’s confusion)
                        Doe.  Money.  Your name goes up on 
                        the door on Monday!  
                             (puts up his champagne)
                        Here’s to the Scott Peterson Fund!

           Everyone realizes that’s a famous murderer’s name.

                                 BILL SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        We’re gonna work on the name!

           They all TOAST (Todd’s SO DAZED)!  And now in comes Donny -- 
           he spots them -- hurries over.

                                 BILL SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Donny!  There he is!  The best man!

                                 DONNY
                        You wish, Bill!  Todd, can we talk?

           Bill’s confused.  Todd walks away, Donny catches up to him.

                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.  C’mon, 
                        please.  These last few days I’ve 
                        been happy for the first time in 
                        forever, okay?  I don’t want your 
                        money.  I just want you.  And that 
                        sounds so gay, but I don’t even 
                        care.  But forget all that, you’re 
                        marrying the wrong girl, Todd.  
                        She’s cheating on you.  

                                 TODD
                        Really?  That’s what you’re going 
                        with now?  Unbelievable.  Leave 
                        quietly.  If you ruin this, I’ll -- 

           We HEAR CLINKING of a glass.  ON STAGE, Helen takes the mic.  
                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        Family’s the most important thing 
                        there is and - You two are about to 
                        start your own, and...Oh, I’m not 
                        good at this.  I shoulda had Donny 
                        write me something.  His speeches 
                        are so hot - I mean - I just - I 
                        love you both so much!  Yay!

           Helen runs over and HUGS Stacey and Todd.  Donny (SO SAD) 
           looks at Todd PLEADINGLY -- Todd just looks away, SO COLD. 

                                 DONNY
                        That was a beautiful speech, Helen.  
                        Makes me miss my son.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        The private eye?

                                 DONNY
                             (directed at Todd)
                        No, he’s not a dick.  I thought he 
                        was.  But - I’m the dick.

                                 CHAD
                        You’re a private eye?

                                 DONNY
                        What?  No.  I --
                             (directed at Todd)
                        I just wanna be in his life.  I’ve 
                        made a lot of mistakes - but I love 
                        him.  I do.  But, he hates me.  

                                 JON HAYWARD
                        Kids are so unappreciative these 
                        days.

                                 TODD
                             (to Donny)
                        Well, you’re probably a terrible 
                        father.

                                 STACEY
                        Todd.

                                 TODD
                        What?  I’m just saying, usually a 
                        kid doesn’t hate his dad unless 
                        he’s a complete asshole who only 
                        thinks about himself.
                                 DONNY
                        You know, I think maybe he’s gay, 
                        and it’s one of those deals where 
                        it’s tearing him up inside.

                                 TODD
                        Yeah, I don’t think that’s it.  
                        It’s probably that you always cared 
                        more about being on Arsenio than 
                        being there for him.

                                 DONNY
                        I HAD TO PAY THE BILLS, HAN!

           Everyone’s CONFUSED.  Todd turns to Jon.

                                 TODD
                        So, Jon, have you considered what 
                        you want me to call you once me and 
                        Stacey tie the knot?

                                 JON HAYWARD
                        Uh...what do you mean?

                                 TODD
                             (taunting Donny)
                        I was thinking maybe I would call 
                        you Dad.  What do you think of 
                        that, Dad?

                                 JON HAYWARD
                        ...Well, I --

                                 DONNY
                        You know, funny story about my son, 
                        he’s never made a SINGLE MISTAKE IN 
                        HIS LIFE EVER!

           Todd puts his ARM AROUND Jon and SQUEEZES.

                                 TODD
                        Do you think that’s funny, Dad?  I 
                        don’t think it is, Dad.  Wow, 
                        you’re such a great Dad.  I bet 
                        you’d never tie me to my bed 
                        instead of hiring a BABYSITTER!

                                 DONNY
                        I WAS GONE FOR 45 MINUTES!

                                 TODD
                        I PISSED ALL OVER MYSELF!
           Now everyone’s THOROUGHLY CONFUSED.

                                 STACEY
                        Todd, honey...

                                 DONNY
                        Gimme the mic!  I’ve got a toast!

                                 TODD 
                        No you don’t!

                                 DONNY
                        BEST MAN TOAST!

           Donny CLINKS his glass as he climbs on stage -- Todd GRABS 
           his arm -- they WRESTLE for the mic -- Donny SHAKES him off!

                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                             (into the mic)
                        They say that love is blind.  And 
                        when I look at Stacey, then I look 
                        at Todd, I know that must be true.
                             (everyone laughs nervous)
                        I’m just kidding folks.  But I 
                        wanna get serious for a --

           Todd GRABS the mic -- as they WRESTLE for control, Donny gets 
           a few words in.

                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        Love - is not something you - can 
                        turn on and off --
                             (PUSHES Todd away)
                        Han!  I’m sorry!  I just wanna be 
                        your Dad!  Why won’t you love --

           Todd TACKLES DONNY INTO THE BAND -- CRASH!  The whole party 
           is STUNNED as they roll off the STAGE -- THUD!

                                 STACEY
                        WHAT IS GOING ON, TODD?!?!

                                 TODD
                             (PUSHES Donny off him)
                        Great.  Awesome.  It’s - It’s --  
                             (sighs, to Stacey)
                        Okay.  Don’t get too mad.  But... 
                        well, Donny is my dad.  Sort of.

                                 STACEY
                        But...I thought your dad was dead.
                                 TODD
                        Well, technically, he’s dead to me.  
                        I’m sorry, honey, it’s complicated.

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        But you two are so close in age.  
                        How can he be your dad?

                                 CHAD
                             (puts it together)
                        Wait, are you the rape baby?  No 
                        way, bro.  Awesome.

                                 TODD
                        Yeah, it’s been a great ride, Chad.

           Stacey looks around at all the guests, SHE’S SO EMBARRASSED.

                                 STACEY
                        I - I can’t believe you lied to me 
                        about something this big.

                                 TODD
                        Stace, I’m sorry, I was just trying 
                        to protect you from all this.

                                 DONNY
                        Oh c’mon, “Protect you from all 
                        this”?  I had sex with my teacher.  
                        The end.  I still don’t get why you 
                        don’t think that’s cool.

                                 TODD
                        Oh, I’m sorry it was a little weird 
                        for me that my mom raped my dad and 
                        went to prison for 30 years!  

                                 DONNY
                        STATUTORY!  And if this was Greece, 
                        no one woulda said a word.  

                                 TODD
                        What?

                                 DONNY
                        I said ‘if this was Greece, no one 
                        woulda said a word’ --

                                 TODD
                        No, I heard you.  It was just so 
                        stupid.
                                 DONNY
                        Well, I’m SORRY, HAN!  I’m sorry I 
                        did the best I could! 

                                 STACEY
                        Why does he keep calling you Han?

                                 TODD
                        Oh, because my real name’s Han Solo 
                        Levine.  That’s what happens when a 
                        14 year old names you in 1984.  But 
                        it wasn’t that big a deal cause 
                        most the kids at school just called 
                        me RAPE BABY!
                             (to Stacey)
                        I thought it’d never come up.  I 
                        haven’t seen him in 8 years.  The 
                        only reason he’s even here is cause 
                        he needs $45,000.  

           Everyone GASPS/GLARES at Donny -- he tries to defend himself.

                                 DONNY
                        In my defense, I’m looking at 3 
                        years in jail.

                                 STACEY
                        Han Solo Levine?  I - I don’t even 
                        know your real name?  HOW COULD YOU 
                        KEEP SECRETS LIKE THIS FROM ME!?

                                 DONNY
                        You wanna talk about SECRETS, 
                        STACE!?  HUH!?  What about the 
                        secret that you’re having an affair 
                        with Todd’s boss!?

                                 BILL SCOTT
                        What?

                                 DONNY
                        My vibes are always right.  I knew 
                        you were bad news.  Yeah, you 
                        thought no one would catch on to 
                        you.  Well, you didn’t count out 
                        Donny Levine!  I heard you on the 
                        phone.  “Bill, don’t call me on 
                        this number.  What if Todd picks 
                        up?  After the wedding it’ll be too 
                        late.”  YEAH!

           Everyone GASPS.  Bill’s Wife GLARES at him.  Todd looks at 
           Stacey, CONFUSED...she just LAUGHS.  Then --
                                 STACEY
                        OHMIGOD YOU’RE AN IDIOT!  Yeah, I 
                        was on the phone with Bill. 
                        Goldstein.  The New York Times 
                        wedding reporter.  He’s gonna do a 
                        piece on our wedding.  I didn’t 
                        want Todd to know because he 
                        doesn’t like being in the paper.  
                        So yeah, you caught me, I’m a 
                        terrible person.  I’m sorry I 
                        wanted the whole world to know that 
                        I married the perfect guy!  Todd, I 
                        hope you can forgive me for keeping 
                        such a big secret from you!
                             (looks around)
                        GOD, THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING!

           She RUNS OUT!  Todd GLARES at Donny, then PURSUES her!  
           Everyone LOOKS at Donny.

                                 DONNY
                        ...Not my best toast.

           EXT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           IT’S POURING RAIN.  Todd catches up to Stacey in the street. 

                                 TODD
                        Stacey, I - I’m sorry.  Please.  
                        All that’s just my past.  It 
                        doesn’t change anything about us.

                                 STACEY
                        It changes our first kiss.

                                 TODD
                        What?

                                 STACEY
                        Remember?  Central Park?  You told 
                        me how you watched your parents 
                        explode in front of your eyes, how 
                        you couldn’t get their screams out 
                        of your head.  I was crying, you 
                        were crying, then we kissed.  That 
                        was our first kiss.

                                 TODD
                        Okay.  I’m not proud of that.  But, 
                        trust me, the real story would’ve 
                        made you cry too.  Everything else 
                        you know about me is true.

                             (beat)
                        Except my name.  But what’s a name, 
                        really?  Except an existential 
                        ...shackle...meant to - I love you.  

           Stacey looks over his shoulder -- some GUESTS have come out.

                                 STACEY
                        HOW COULD YOU EMBARRASS ME IN FRONT 
                        OF ALL THESE PEOPLE?!

                                 CHAD
                             (walks up)
                        C’mon, Stace, let’s go.

                                 STACEY
                        I need to think.  I’m going to our 
                        honeymoon suite.  DON’T follow me.

           Stacey runs off.  Chad FAKES a punch at Todd -- Todd FLINCHES 
           WILDLY, FALLS backwards over bushes!  Chad RUNS after Stacey.

           AN HOUR LATER

           Todd sits on the curb, DRINKING in the RAIN.  Behind him, the 
           last few GUESTS wait for their cars.  Bill approaches.  

                                 BILL SCOTT
                        Okay, then...good to see you...

                                 TODD
                        Yeah, awesome seeing you.

                                 BILL SCOTT
                        So...we might need to rethink the 
                        whole partnership thing a bit.

                                 TODD
                        Yeah.  I understand.

                                 BILL SCOTT
                        Thanks for...a great night, though.

                                 TODD
                        Are we really pretending like all 
                        that didn’t JUST HAPPEN!?

                                 BILL SCOTT
                        ...No, sorry.  So...you’ll keep us 
                        posted on the status of tomorrow?

                                 TODD
                        YEAH!  CHECK MY BLOG!
           Bill slinks off.  Donny approaches gingerly -- Todd CLAPS.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        Hey-o!  How bout a Lucas clap for 
                        the father of the year, Donny 
                        Levine.  Nicely done!  

                                 DONNY
                        I - I’m sorry.  I don’t know what 
                        to say.  

                                 TODD
                             (swigs the bottle)
                        I don’t know what she was doing 
                        with me in the first place.  She’s 
                        not the best I could do, she’s like 
                        10 times the best I could do.  Her 
                        body with a dragon’s head, is still 
                        like 5 times better than I could 
                        do.  It was like God made one too 
                        many super hot girls and said, ‘ah, 
                        fuck it, give her to the fat kid 
                        that never had anything.’

                                 DONNY
                        That’s bullshit.  You’re Han Solo 
                        Levine - or Todd Peterson, or 
                        whatever.  She doesn’t deserve you.  

                                 TODD
                             (GLARES at Donny)
                        She’s the only person in the world 
                        that loves me.

                                 DONNY
                        Well...then, I’ll take the blame.  
                        Just tell me what to do.

                                 TODD
                        Leave!  My life’s ruined.  You’ve 
                        got a real talent for this.  You’re 
                        the Picasso of crushing my dreams.

           Todd walks off.  Donny stands there in the rain, SO UPSET...  
           Then Donny’s FACE STEELS, and --

           EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS - LATER

           Donny’s Fiero SCREAMS through the RAINY streets!

           He SCREECHES to a HALT in front of THE PLAZA HOTEL -- JUMPS 
           out of his Fiero -- WHIPS his keys at the VALET and RUNS IN!
           INT. THE PLAZA HOTEL, HALLWAY - LATER

           Donny RUNS, following the SIGNS to the “HONEYMOON SUITE”.  He 
           rounds the last corner -- STOPS DEAD IN HIS TRACKS -- Donny’s 
           POV: Stacey and Chad walk to her room -- SHE’S ALL OVER HIM!  

           Donny slinks behind the corner, SPIES AS... THEY KISS!  Then 
           they stumble into her room MAKING OUT AGGRESSIVELY!

           Donny’s STUNNED/HEARTBROKEN.  He PACES, not sure what to do.  
           Finally, he takes a DEEP BREATH, goes and BANGS on the door!  
           Stacey opens -- pulls the door behind her so he can’t see in.

                                 STACEY
                        What’re you doing here?  You wanna 
                        puke on the honeymoon suite, too?  
                        My wedding was perfect til you 
                        showed up!  

                                 DONNY
                        Yeah, real perfect.  Can I come in?

                                 STACEY
                        No.  This isn’t a good time.

                                 DONNY
                        I came here to get you to take him 
                        back, to tell you how bad of a 
                        person I am.  But you’re worse. 

           He PUSHES his way in to find Chad (NAKED, Ed Hardy hat).  

                                 STACEY
                        We’re just talking.  Nakedly.

                                 DONNY
                        I can’t believe you’re cheating on 
                        him.  

                                 STACEY
                        This...was just a mistake, okay?  

                                 CHAD
                        Donny, if you think about it, 
                        there’s no such thing as cheating.  
                        We’re all one.

                                 DONNY
                        Seriously, brosef, the only reason 
                        I’m not fighting you right now is 
                        cause you’ve got your guy out and I 
                        don’t wanna touch it.  
                                 (MORE)

                        But you better sit down before I 
                        life coach your face apart!

           Chad puts his HANDS UP, sits.  Donny turns to Stacey, HURT.

                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        I knew I was right about you.  Do 
                        you even love him at all?

                                 STACEY
                        Oh grow up.  Love isn’t some stupid 
                        Springsteen song.  We’re adults.  
                        Marriage is about partnership.  And 
                        me and Todd make great partners.  
                        This is just sex.  It’s what good 
                        looking people do, they sleep with 
                        other good looking people.  It 
                        doesn’t mean anything.

                                 CHAD
                             (hurt)
                        Really?  I sorta thought we were 
                        having the whole ‘old friends 
                        realize they’re in love right 
                        before it’s too late’ romantic 
                        comedy kinda moment.  I was gonna 
                        break up the wedding tomorrow and 
                        everything.

                                 STACEY
                        Really?  What about Mia?

                                 CHAD
                        She’s just a model I hired to 
                        pretend to be my girlfriend for the 
                        weekend.  To make you jealous.

                                 STACEY
                        Chad, that’s...sweet...and you’re 
                        hot, but, you’re not exactly 
                        marriage material.  You still have 
                        roommates.  

                                 DONNY 
                        You can’t marry Todd tomorrow.  
                        C’mon, you gotta call it off.

                                 STACEY
                        Hey, I want the good life just as 
                        much as you or anyone else.

                                 DONNY
                        ...God, you’re just after his 
                        money?

                        Todd’s not like you...or me.  He’s 
                        actually good.  Well, I failed him 
                        his entire life, I’m not failing 
                        him anymore.

                                 STACEY
                        You’re really gonna ruin this for 
                        him?  I make him happy, and I’m 
                        gonna keep making him happy.  He 
                        doesn’t need to know about any of 
                        this.
                             (off Donny’s reluctance)
                        I WANNA BE A SOCIALITE!

           Donny’s APALLED, he shakes his head and STARTS out --

                                 STACEY (CONT’D)
                        How much?  45,000?
                             (Donny STOPS)
                        In 24 hours, I’m gonna be a very 
                        rich woman.  You don’t wanna go to 
                        jail, do you?  That’s the kinda 
                        rape you don’t write a book about.    

           Donny watches as she grabs her CHECKBOOK, writes a CHECK.

                                 STACEY (CONT’D)
                        I’m writing you a check and dating 
                        it for Tuesday.  I’ll even round 
                        up.  $50,000.    
                             (hands him the check)
                        You keep your mouth shut, disappear 
                        forever, and everybody wins.

                                 DONNY
                        Except Todd.

                                 STACEY
                        Are you kidding?  Todd gets this.

           She motions towards her SUPER HOT BODY.  Donny looks at the 
           CHECK, and then her BODY, then back at the CHECK...

           EXT. CLASSY RICK'S BACON AND LEGGS - NEXT MORNING

           The sun is up on the morning of the wedding.

           INT. CLASSY RICK'S BACON AND LEGGS - SAME

           Donny picks at a plate of stale breakfast, depressed.  REAL 
           ROCK BOTTOM. A stripper in an arm cast, ESCALADE, approaches.
                                 ESCALADE
                        Hey, Donny.

                        Hey Escalade.  How you doing?

                                 ESCALADE
                        Ugh, decent.  Some idiot came on my 
                        favorite costume.

                                 DONNY
                        I know the feeling.

                                 ESCALADE
                             (looks at him odd)
                        ...You want a dance?

           Donny shrugs.  She MOUNTS him...then notices he’s CRYING.

                                 ESCALADE
                        ...Are you crying?

                                 DONNY
                        What?  No.  This is how I orgasm. 
                             (beat)
                        Is Champale here?

                                 ESCALADE
                        She’s not in yet.  Don’t worry, 
                        baby, I’ll take care of you.

           INT. TODD AND STACEY’S BEDROOM - SAME

           Todd wakes up, OPENS his eyes -- surprised to see Stacey.

                                 TODD
                        Are - are you...back?

                                 STACEY
                        Maybe.

                                 TODD
                        I’m sorry I lied.  But he’s gone.  
                        He’s out of our lives forever.  
                             (hugs her legs, begging)
                        Please.  I love you.  Please marry 
                        me.  I literally have no one else 
                        in the world but you.

                                 STACEY
                             (smiles sinisterly)
                        I know you don’t, baby.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 STACEY (cont'd)
                        And I wanna marry you, but you 
                        gotta promise me: no more secrets.  
                        And no more Donny.  Ever.

                                 TODD
                        I swear.

                                 STACEY
                        Okay then, let’s go get married.

           INT. CLASSY RICK'S BACON AND LEGGS - LATER 

           Donny’s really CRYING now.  Escalade’s UNSURE what to do.

                                 DONNY
                        Why does everyone always end up 
                        with the wrong person?  Han and 
                        Stacey?  They’re so wrong for each 
                        other.  On so many levels.  But, in 
                        an hour, they’ll be married.  Yay!    

                                 ESCALADE
                        So, you love her or something?

                                 DONNY
                        What?  No, him.  I love him.  The 
                        groom.  And if he marries her, I 
                        know I’ll never get him back.  We 
                        should be together, not them. 

                                 ESCALADE
                        ...Does he know you love him?

                                 DONNY
                        Yeah.  Sort of.

                                 ESCALADE
                             (confused)
                        Well...is he even gay?

                                 DONNY
                        What?  No.  He’s my son.

                                 ESCALADE
                        This just got weird.

                                 DONNY
                        God, where’s Champale?  I WANT 
                        CHAMPALE!  

           Just then, Champale limps through the door.
                                 CHAMPALE
                        Donny?  What’re you doing here?

                                 DONNY
                             (choking up)
                        Just keeping the party going.

                                 CHAMPALE
                        Aren’t you supposed to be at the 
                        wedding?

                                 DONNY
                        I sorta got dis-invited.

           She pats his back lovingly.  Donny LOOKS UP AT HER SADLY.

                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        She’s cheating on him.  I saw it.  
                        And I didn’t tell him.  All to save 
                        my own ass.  And now they’re 
                        getting married.  I’m the worst 
                        person in the world.  But, I can’t 
                        go to prison, right?  Anyone woulda 
                        done the same thing, right?

                                 ESCALADE
                        You gotta look out for number one.

           Champale GLARES at Escalade -- who shrugs and walks away.

                                 DONNY
                        What do I do, Champale?

                                 CHAMPALE
                        I can’t tell you that.  Especially 
                        if you don’t already know, Don.

           She walks away in a HUFF.  He leans back and thinks...THEN --

           EXT. CLASSY RICK'S BACON AND LEGGS - LATER

           “BORN TO RUN” EXPLODES as Donny SPRINTS to his Fiero!  He 
           SLIDES across the hood -- gets in and PEELS OUT of the lot!

           INT. TODD’S HOUSE - LATER

           “Born To Run” CUTS OUT as Todd puts on his tux -- Donny’s 
           BOOK catches his eye.  He KNOCKS it off the table -- it lands 
           OPEN.  He looks closer at the DEDICATION on the first page:

                        “To Han, wherever you are.  I miss 
                        you.  Call me.”
           Todd smiles.  Stacey walks in.

                                 STACEY
                        Let’s go.

                                 TODD
                        ...Hey, Stace, I was thinking about 
                        our first dance.  Have you ever 
                        heard Thunder Road?  It’s --

                                 STACEY
                        We’re not having our first dance as 
                        a married couple to Bon Jovi.

                                 TODD
                        It’s not Bon Jovi, it’s 
                        Springsteen.

                                 STACEY
                        Same difference.  “Your Body Is A 
                        Wonderland” is our song.  

                                 TODD
                        It’s more your song, though...

                                 STACEY
                        Are you really gonna fight me on 
                        anything right now?  You’re kinda 
                        on thin ice, aren’t you?  

                                 TODD
                             (crestfallen)
                        Yeah.  You’re right.  Sorry.

           INT. DONNY’S FIERO - LATER

           “Born To Run” REIGNITES as Donny struggles to put on his 
           TUX/drive SO FAST/and SCREAM ALONG to the song!  

                                 SPRINGSTEEN/DONNY
                        I GOTTA KNOW HOW IT FEELS...
                        I WANNA KNOW IF LOVE IS WILD, I 
                        WANNA KNOW IF LOVE IS REAL!

           INT. CHURCH - LATER

           “Born to Run” CUTS OUT again -- the CHURCH CHOIR PLAYS as the 
           WEDDING PARTY makes their way down the aisle.
           INT. DONNY’S FIERO - LATER 

           Back on Donny RACING to the Church!  The GREAT MUSIC 
           BREAKDOWN in the middle of “Born To Run” kicks in!  He checks 
           his WATCH -- smiles, HE’S GONNA MAKE IT!  

           BUT AS THE MUSIC BREAKDOWN SPIRALS AND SPUTTERS TOWARD ITS 
           MID-SONG STOP -- THE FIERO SPUTTERS AND CHUGS TOWARD IT’S OWN 
           STOP [Yes, just like “The Graduate”.  Listen to the middle of 
           “Born To Run”, THIS WILL WORK AMAZINGLY]! 

                                 DONNY
                        No, no, no.  C’mon, baby...

           The Fiero STALLS as the song STALLS -- OUT OF GAS!

                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        NO!  Are you kidding me!?  
                             (looks up at god)
                        ONE TIME!
                             (thinking, freaking out)
                        Shit, shit, shit, shit...

           He CHECKS his watch, looks around..............THEN WE HEAR --  

                                 SPRINGSTEEN 
                        ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR!

           DONNY KICKS OPEN THE DOOR AND STARTS RUNNING AS --

                                 SPRINGSTEEN (CONT’D)
                        THE HIGHWAY’S JAMMED WITH BROKEN 
                        HEROES ON A LAST CHANCE POWER 
                        DRIVE!

           HE SPRINTS THROUGH THE STREETS OF MANHATTAN DESPERATELY!

           INT. CHURCH - LATER

           Stacey and Todd stand on the altar.  Todd looks up at the 
           HUGE CRUCIFIX -- he pulls at his collar, ANXIOUSLY.

                                 ANGRY PRIEST
                        Todd will receive two blessings 
                        today.  First, the blessing of 
                        Jesus, then, the blessing of 
                        marriage.

           Todd EXHALES REALLY LOUDLY -- everyone looks at him ODDLY --  
           he just sorta WAVES. 
                                 STACEY
                             (whispers to Todd)
                        Take a Xanax.

           EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS - SAME

           “Born To Run” COMES BACK IN as Donny SPRINTS, GRIPPING his 
           side in pain, really SUCKING WIND, BUT CHARGING!  

           His TIGHT tux pants SPLIT UP THE CROTCH as he ROUNDS the 
           corner onto Park Avenue -- PACKED with people!  He BULLDOZES 
           through the CROWD, PUSHING people aside and SCREAMING!

                                 DONNY
                        GET OUTTA MY WAY YUPPIE SCUM!

           INT. CHURCH - SAME

           The Angry Priest continues.

                                 ANGRY PRIEST
                        Family is the most important thing 
                        in the world.  Because without it, 
                        life has no meaning.
                             (Todd looks where Donny 
                              should be standing, SAD)
                        But before your two families become 
                        one, it’s time for Todd to join an 
                        even bigger family.  Jesus’ family. 
                             (grabs Todd’s head)
                        I’m going to dunk your face in this 
                        basin of holy water.  When you 
                        emerge, you will be saved.  

           The Priest GUIDES Todd’s face toward a small BASIN OF WATER -- 
           Todd RESISTS a bit -- the Priest GUIDES STRONGER -- an 
           AWKWARD TUG O’ WAR, then -- the CHURCH DOORS BURST OPEN!  
           Everyone TURNS -- it’s Ian Ziering!

                                 ANGRY PRIEST
                        ...Uh, are you objecting?

                                 ZIERING
                        No, I’m Ian Ziering.  Just kidding. 
                        Sorry, I’m just late.
                             (smiles at the crowd)
                        “Ohmigod, is that Ian Ziering?”  
                        Yes it is.  Thank you.  Thank you.

                                 ANGRY PRIEST
                        SIT DOWN!
                                 ZIERING
                             (sits)
                        GO GET EM, HAN!

                                 ANGRY PRIEST
                             (sighs, annoyed)
                        Thank you, 90210’s Ian Ziering.  
                        Now, I was saying...it’s time for 
                        Todd to join Jesus’ family.

           The Priest LOWERS Todd’s face toward the water again.  His 
           face draws CLOSER, CLOSER, CLOSER -- 

           THE DOORS BURST OPEN!  Everyone TURNS AGAIN -- DONNY SPRINTS 
           IN, DRIPPING WITH SWEAT, SO OUT OF BREATH!  He TRIES to talk 
           but can barely get words out!

                                 DONNY
                        ...Wait!  I - Ugh.  I -- 
                             (has to TAKE A KNEE)
                        Wow.

                                 TODD
                        What are you doing here, Don!?

           Donny TRIES to talk, but has to put up a FINGER (”One 
           second.”), unable to CATCH HIS BREATH.  Everyone WAITS...

                                 DONNY
                             (explains to the crowd)
                        For the record - it was over a 
                        mile.  Easy.
                             (swallows hard)
                        I - I have something to say...

           Suddenly, Helen JUMPS UP!

                                 HELEN HAYWARD
                        I love you too, Donny!  
                             (everyone looks at her)
                        Let’s run away together!  

                                 DONNY
                        What?  No.  I mean, you’re hot and 
                        all Mrs. Hayward, but, you sorta 
                        tried to rape me. 
                             (OFF the crowd’s GASP)
                        I know, I’m kind of a rape magnet.

           Helen sits down AWKWARDLY -- Jon is MORTIFIED/ANGRY.

                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        Um, so...I OBJECT!
                                 ANGRY PRIEST
                        WE’RE NOT FUCKING THERE YET!

                                 DONNY
                        Whoa.  Do I just grab a seat then, 
                        or how do you wanna do this?

                                 STACEY
                        GOD!  Haven’t you done enough!?

                                 DONNY
                        Shut your mouth DEVIL WOMAN!
                             (the crowd GASPS -- he 
                              tries to explain)
                        It’ll all make sense in a second 
                        and you’ll totally agree with me.
                             (to her parents)
                        Except probably not you guys, cause 
                        she is your daughter.

           Jon CLIMBS over people to get down the aisle to KILL Donny -- 
           Donny CLIMBS down the opposite aisle, FLEEING as he SPEAKS.

                                 DONNY
                        Todd, you can’t marry her!

                                 TODD
                        Why not, Don?  Huh!?

                                 DONNY
                        Well first off, you don’t love her! 
                        And, um...love isn’t about looks or 
                        money or partnerships...love is 
                        about...love is...
                             (thinks)
                        Well, I don’t know what love is.  
                        The only woman I ever loved got put 
                        in jail forever.  But, that’s my 
                        own thing, and - Han, I know we 
                        don’t have the most normal family, 
                        but me and you, and Miss 
                        McGarricle, and Ian Ziering, we’re 
                        still family.  And what’s normal, 
                        anyway?  Look at Stacey’s family.  
                        They suck, and - um, shit, um, I 
                        shoulda written this out a little.  
                        What I’m trying to say is, this 
                        isn’t your life.  You’re 25, you 
                        should be a...bike messenger, or 
                        ...a cameraman for Girls Gone Wild, 
                        you know?  Or something.

           The room is CONFUSED, SILENT.  Todd thinks about it a second.
                                 TODD
                        ...Is that it?

                                 DONNY
                        No, also, something about loving 
                        yourself before you can love 
                        someone else...or, really, not 
                        running away from who you are...

                                 TODD
                        You came in here and broke up my 
                        wedding with that?

                                 DONNY
                        WHO AM I, HUGH GRANT!?  
                             (sighs)
                        Fine, there’s more.  I was just 
                        hoping that might do the trick, 
                        cause I didn’t wanna embarrass you, 
                        but...she’s cheating on you.
                             (everyone GASPS)
                        And this time I’m positive.  With 
                        Chad!
                             (another GASP)
                        I know, right?  Lot going on.  

           Todd doesn’t know what to say....now CHAD JUMPS UP!

                                 CHAD
                        I love you Stacey!  Let’s run away 
                        together!

                                 STACEY
                        What?  Chad, c’mon.  No.  Sit down.  
                        Todd, this is ridiculous!

                                 DONNY
                        Nice one, Life Coach.

           Now Chad CLIMBS over the aisles to KILL Donny -- who 
           continues to CLIMB away from his GROWING PURSUERS!

                                 TODD
                        Donny, do you think making up lies 
                        about my wife at my wedding is 
                        gonna make me love you?

                                 STACEY
                        Thank you!  Will somebody please 
                        ESCORT THIS FREAK OUTTA HERE?!

           More of her FRIENDS and FAMILY go after Donny now!  Ziering 
           POPS UP and starts BLOCKING them from getting to him!
                                 DONNY
                        Todd, I’m not lying!  I --  

           Donny GRABS some BIBLES off a tall stack and starts WHIPPING 
           them at the crowd to keep them back while he talks!

                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        I know I’ve been a terrible father.  
                        But, you gotta trust me.  This is 
                        the worst mistake of your life!
                             (WHIPS a bible)
                        I’m not saying you have to love me, 
                        I’m just saying, don’t love her.  
                        Don’t marry her.

                                 TODD
                             (confused)
                        Am I supposed to just believe you?  
                        Do you have any proof?

                                 DONNY
                        Again, sorta hoping you’d just take 
                        my word on it.  Cause, the proof 
                        doesn’t make me look great...
                             (pulls out the CHECK)
                        She offered me fifty grand to keep 
                        my mouth shut.  And I took it.
                             (everyone GASPS)
                        I’M LOOKING AT 3 YEARS OVER HERE!  
                        But, I’ve learned a lot in the last 
                        few days.  About being a dad.  It’s 
                        about sacrificing yourself for your 
                        kids.  And Todd, to know you’re in 
                        any pain would feel even worse than 
                        getting pounded in the ass in 
                        prison - which is probably what’s 
                        gonna happen - because, well...
                             (chokes up)
                        I love you.

           He hands him the CHECK -- Todd looks at it, AT A LOSS.

                                 DONNY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, man.  She’s just 
                        marrying you for your money.

                                 TODD
                             (to Stacey)
                        Is all this true?

                                 STACEY
                        You’re really gonna listen to him!?
                                 TODD
                             (looks at the CHECK)
                        Is it true?!

           Stacey sighs, FED UP.

                                 STACEY
                        God, sweet, fine, I’m marrying you 
                        for your money.  Big deal.  
                             (the crowd GASPS)
                        “Ohmigod, I can’t believe she’s 
                        marrying him for his money.”  Get 
                        over yourselves, it happens all the 
                        time.  You’re marrying me cause I’m 
                        hot.  Which, if you think about it, 
                        is way more shallow.  At least a 
                        guy can go and work for money. It’s 
                        based on some talent or some drive.  
                        Men base their entire thing on how 
                        someone’s born!  On their genes!  
                        You tell me which is more shallow.

                                 DONNY
                        ...Wow.  I still hate you, but that 
                        is a really good point.  

           The audience NODS, kind of agreeing.  Suddenly, Chad BREAKS 
           FREE from Ziering, and RUNS at Donny -- 

                                 ZIERING
                        DONNY!

           Donny puts up his FISTS, ready for him -- but before he gets 
           there -- TODD KNOCKS CHAD OUT COLD WITH A STIFF RIGHT!

                                 DONNY
                        YEAH!  THE LEVINE BOYS ARE BACK!

                                 TODD
                             (turns to Stacey)
                        ...Goodbye, Stacey.  Goodbye.

           She LAUGHS defiantly.  Donny TAKES THE CHECK back from Todd 
           (not as SUBTLY as Donny had hoped).  Todd looks at Donny... 
           Donny SIGHS, then CEREMONIOUSLY RIPS UP THE CHECK!

           EXT. MANHATTAN - SUNSET

           Donny and Todd walk away from the church.

                                 DONNY
                        I love you, Todd.
                                 TODD
                        Han.

                                 DONNY
                        Really?  Awesome.  I love you, Han.

                                 TODD
                        I hate you...
                             (long beat, looks at him)
                        Dad.

           Donny smiles HUGE.  They walk into the SUNSET, Donny puts his 
           arm around Todd -- CLUMSY as they walk.  He pulls it back.

                                 DONNY
                        Sorry, yeah, too soon, right?  

           Donny just awkwardly SLAPS Todd on the ass like a football 
           player as Springsteen’s “Walk Like A Man” BEGINS...

                                                                CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON A SIGN: “DON AND HAN LEVINE’S COCKTAILS AND DREAMS”.

           INT. DON AND HAN’S COCKTAILS AND DREAMS - 1 YEAR LATER

           A PACKED BEACH BAR.  THE PLACE IS ROCKIN’!  SLOW MOTION: 
           Donny and Todd FLIP and TOSS bottles and glasses in elaborate 
           unison as everyone CHEERS (EXACTLY like the movie 
           “Cocktail”)!  They both SMILE SO WIDE!  

           TWO HOT GIRLS BLOW KISSES at Todd seductively.  Todd WINKS at 
           them, coolly, then SLIDES their drinks down the bar!

           ONSTAGE, Ziering plays guitar as Champale sings back-ups.  
           Then...Mary McGarricle comes around the corner with a tray.  
           She KISSES Donny.  DONNY AND TODD SMILE AT EACH OTHER WIDE!  

                                 SPRINGSTEEN “WALK LIKE A MAN”
                        I remember how rough your hand felt 
                        on mine on my wedding day,
                        And the tears cried on my shoulder 
                        I couldn't turn away,
                        Well so much has happened to me 
                        that I don't understand,
                        All I can think of is being five 
                        years old following behind you at 
                        the beach tracing your footprints 
                        in the sand,
                        Trying to walk like a man...

           THE END
           OVER CREDITS:

           INT. YMCA - DAY

           CLOSE-UP ON A SIGN: “SEXUAL ABUSE SUPPORT GROUP”.

           A group of MEN sit in a circle and listen as a guy, TIM (45), 
           CRIES his way through a story.

                                 TIM
                        So...and now, I mean, I can’t go to 
                        a baseball game without absolutely 
                        breaking down.  Anytime I see a 
                        bat...I - I can feel it.  Inside.  
                        And - I mean, I just start bawling.
                             (chokes up)
                        Sorry.  That’s all I can do today.

                                 MODERATOR
                        It’s okay, Tim, very brave.  Thanks 
                        for sharing.  Okay...who’s next? 
                             (looks at Donny)
                        We’ve got a new member.  Donny, 
                        would you like to share?

                                 DONNY
                        Sure.  I guess.  Hey, I’m Donny 
                        Levine and --

                                 ALL
                        Hi Donny.

                                 DONNY
                        Oh...hi.  It’s really like that?  I 
                        thought that was just in the 
                        movies.  Um, well, anyway...I guess 
                        my thing started when I was 13.  My 
                        teacher came on to me, and well, 
                        you know, I didn’t really know what 
                        was right or wrong I guess.  She 
                        told me that she loved me and --

                                 TIM
                        She?

                                 DONNY
                        Yeah.  She.

                                 TIM
                        Was she...ugly?
                                 DONNY
                        No.  She was hot.  You might’ve 
                        seen pictures of her.  It was all 
                        over the news.  Mary McGarricle.

                                 GUY 1
                        Wait.  You’re Donny Levine?  You 
                        didn’t get molested, you had an 
                        affair.

                                 DONNY
                        Well --

                                 GUY 2
                        Wait a second.  She was really hot.  
                        I used to beat off to her picture 
                        from the paper.  What the hell do 
                        you think you’re doing here?

                                 DONNY
                        Well, I thought this was a safe --

                                 TIM
                        Yeah, I think when other people are 
                        masturbating to pictures of the 
                        person that “raped” you, it doesn’t 
                        really count.

                        Wait a second here --

                                 GUY 2
                        I wish I was raped by her tonight.

                                 DONNY
                        It was actually pretty traumatic --

                                 GUY 1
                             (pissed)
                        Traumatic!?  Try getting fisted by 
                        your dad’s business partner in the 
                        back of his LeBaron for nine years! 

                                 GUY 2
                        Yeah!

                                 DONNY
                             (stands up, CLAPS ONCE)
                        Okay.  I’ve learned a lot.

           BLACK OUT.
