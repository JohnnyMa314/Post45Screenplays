           EXT. WOODS - EAST TENNESSEE - DAWN

           Shadowy figures hustle through the underbrush, armed with 
           rifles, scarves concealing their faces. UNION LOYALISTS. We 
           get a glimpse of their leader, WILLIAM BLOUNT CARTER (35).

       A2
           EXT. STRAWBERRY PLAINS BRIDGE - EAST TENNESSEE - DAWN
                                                                    A2

           A small bridge over a bubbling stream. 2 CONFEDERATE SENTRIES 
           patrol each side. More sleep in a SMALL CAMP on the 
           embankment below.

           SENTRY #1 checks the time and nods to SENTRY #2, who kneels 
           down and puts his ear to the rail. Listening in the silence 
           he senses the VIBRATION of a coming train.

           CRACK!

           Sentry #1 drops dead next to him -- SHOT IN THE CHEST.

           CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!

           Gunfire and shouting erupts all around as a dozen union 
           loyalists ATTACK FROM EVERY DIRECTION, blasting sentries.

           ON CARTER, LEADING THEM

           He picks off the remaining rebels who awake and scramble to 
           arms. One rebel’s blood splatters over a paper that reads: 
           “DIVIDED COUNTRY NEARS END OF FIRST YEAR IN WAR”. 

           The loyalists LIGHT TORCHES and set various points of the 
           bridge ABLAZE. The puff-puff smoke from an approaching train 
           is now visible over the tree tops.

           As the rising fire ILLUMINATES THE SCENE Carter spots SENTRY 
           #2 dash off down the embankment and flee into the woods. 

           Carter takes off after him.

       B2
           EXT. WOODS - DAWN
                                                                    B2

           Sentry #2 runs for his life, branches slapping his face. 
           Carter sprints after, gaining, more accustomed to this 
           geography. He pops a shot off and the rebel pulls up, 
           exhausted. Carter sticks the barrel on the rebel’s face.

                                 CARTER
                        Looking for reinforcements?
                                 SENTRY #2
                        Tennessee’s already gone seesh. 
                        There’s no stopping the rebel 
                        cause.

                                 CARTER
                        Even rebels can have rebels.

           BLAM!

           A shot rings out from behind as a CONTINGENT OF REBELS stalk 
           out of the woods, surrounding Carter. They’re lead by a 
           brutish man on a HORSE, sabre at his side. Meet COLONEL 
           DANVILLE LEADBETTER (35). Carter drops his weapon.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        You know what they say. Bleed the 
                        sickness before the dawn. I expect 
                        you know better than most what we 
                        do to black snake bridge burners in 
                        these parts?

                                 CARTER
                        You kill me, ten Unionists will 
                        rise up in my place.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        I doubt it.

           A NOOSE is slung around Carter’s neck. He’s horrified.

                                 CARTER
                        Stringin’ me up won’t stop it.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Maybe not, but stringing you up 
                        next to your woman and children, 
                        and their women and children, for 
                        every soul in this territory to 
                        see, should go far to doin’ the 
                        trick.

           Leadbetter nods to a rebel, who SLAPS A HORSE. It scares off,  *
           the rope with the noose connected to the saddle, Carter 
           snapped to the ground by his neck and dragged away through 
           the underbrush. Leadbetter looks on, a portrait of zen, the 
           BRIDGE BLAZING BEHIND HIM, insurgents surrounded and shot.

                                 LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
                        Welcome to Chattanooga.

           EXT. BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS - DAY

           Swooping over a rugged peak, we reveal a raw, almost 
           apocalyptic frontier town staked upon a bend of the Tennessee 
           River, the hub of three railroad lines. That’s right, welcome 
           to Chatta-fuckin’-nooga...

           INT. CONFEDERATE HOSPITAL - CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE - DAY

           Crammed with bunk after bunk of howling, suffering men, a 
           horror show of malarial sweats and amputated limbs. Behind an 
           operating curtain...

           A SURGEON cracks a crate marked “BIBLES”. Packed inside are 
           fifty 2-ounce bottles of white powder. QUININE. The Surgeon 
           dips a pinky, tastes and looks to CAPTAIN WHITSITT (28), a 
           dashing young Confederate officer.

           Whitsitt nods to a QUARTERMASTER, who smacks down five 
           thousand Confederate dollars on the operating table next to 
           the crate of medicine.

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        That some kind of joke?

           The voice comes from a man who peruses amputation saws in the 
           corner. A handsome scoundrel of aristocratic bearing, he cuts 
           a striking figure in his black, ankle length duster. If John 
           Wilkes Booth had Sinatra’s panache, he’d be this man and we 
           wouldn’t give a shit if Lincoln were shot twenty times. Meet 
           JAMES ANDREWS (33).

                                 CAPTAIN WHITSITT
                        It’s what we agreed. Hundred ounces 
                        of quinine at fifty an ounce.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Those are bluebacks. Confederate 
                        dollars.

                                 CAPTAIN WHITSITT
                        Where the hell you think you are?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Gold, Captain. That’s what you pay 
                        me in. That or Federal currency.

                                 QUARTERMASTER
                        Our paper is just as good.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Yeah? Tell that to your boys next 
                        door dying of malaria.
           Andrews throws the lid back on the crate. Whitsitt draws his 
           saber and blocks him.

                                 CAPTAIN WHITSITT
                        I’m sure whatever the Union Secret 
                        Service pays you to spy on us while 
                        smuggling your contraband more than 
                        covers the cost of your trouble.

           Andrews smiles.

                                 ANDREWS
                        You would think.

           Viper-quick he bats away Whitsitt’s saber with the lid. 
           Whitsitt draws his pistol, as does the quartermaster. Andrews 
           draws two, ending it in a Mexican stand-off. The surgeon 
           reels back in horror.

                                 SURGEON
                        Gentlemen, please. This is a 
                        hospital for Heaven’s sake.

                                 ANDREWS
                        So, doc, who you wanna attend to 
                        first?

                                 MIRIAM (O.C.)
                        Am I interrupting something?

           At the curtain is MIRIAM LEADBETTER (30), a stunning and 
           stately lady of the south, completely unruffled by the scene. 
           She wears a RED SCARF tied around her neck.

                                 QUARTERMASTER
                        Mrs. Leadbetter! This isn’t a place 
                        for--

                                 MIRIAM
                        What? A little color? These men 
                        have seen enough awfulness, 
                        Corporal. You and I both know 
                        they’d rather be looking at a belle 
                        of the south than what’s left of 
                        each other. Even if it is indecent.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I’d say especially so.

           Miriam looks him up and down, smiles.

                                 MIRIAM
                        And you are?
                                 CAPTAIN WHITSITT
                        Nothing but a double-dealing snake 
                        wants to deny our boys the 
                        treatment they require. We’re 
                        persuading him otherwise.

           Pistols stay raised. Andrews brightens as if this were the 
           most glowing of introductions.

                                 ANDREWS
                        James Andrews.

           Miriam is impressed.

                                 MIRIAM
                        The man on the tip of everyone’s 
                        tongue. I’m surprised someone with 
                        the reputation of being so friendly 
                        with so many could find himself in 
                        such an unfriendly room? Perhaps I 
                        can persuade these gentlemen to 
                        warm up to you.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Not unless you got five thousand in 
                        gold stashed under that dress of 
                        yours.

                                 CAPTAIN WHITSITT
                        Careful sir, that’s a Colonel’s 
                        wife you’re talking too.

           Andrews pretends like he’s impressed.

                                 MIRIAM
                        If it’s gold you want, Mr. Andrews, 
                        I’d be happy to accommodate if it 
                        means relief for our brave soldiers 
                        here.

                                 CAPTAIN WHITSITT
                        You don’t have to do that, Miss. We 
                        can handle this.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Yes, clearly.
                           (to Andrews)
                        What do you say? My husband and I 
                        are hosting a little occasion 
                        tonight. Join us at his compound 
                        for some drinks and we’ll satisfy 
                        your account. You can even stay for 
                        a dance or two.
           Andrews accepts and the guns go down.

           EXT. CHATTANOOGA STREETS - NIGHT

           Andrews strolls down a cruddy, muddy thoroughfare and passes 
           under an array of dangling corpses -- the bridge burners from 
           our opening, among them William Blount Carter, along with 
           their families. Andrews approaches the gauntlet of guards 
           outside LEADBETTER’S HEADQUARTERS, a hotel across from the 
           train station that’s fortified like an embassy in a hostile 
           country. The cream of the crop of Chattanooga society line up 
           to get in.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Evenin’ boys.

           He’s frisked.

           INT. GREAT ROOM - LEADBETTER’S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           We drop in on a grand soiree, where uniformed Rebel officers 
           flirt and dance with local southern belles. Andrews wanders 
           the floor, catching a glimpse of Miriam and Leadbetter posing 
           for a PHOTOGRAPHER in the corner. She sees him just as

           POOF!

           INT. GREAT ROOM - LEADBETTER’S HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           Andrews wanders on, grabbing a passing drink and stopping 
           before a huge framed MAP OF TENNESSEE mounted over the 
           fireplace. Leadbetter’s domain.

                                 LEADBETTER (O.C.)
                        Chattanooga.

           Andrews turns. Leadbetter saunters up, drink in hand.

                                 LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
                        They say that devil Lincoln calls 
                        it the lynchpin to winning this 
                        war. Whoever controls the city’s 
                        junction of rail lines controls the 
                        flow of troops, supplies, and 
                        munitions all throughout the south.

           ON THE MAP: Chattanooga sits at the intersection of three 
           rail lines spurring west to Huntsville, Alabama, south to 
           Atlanta, Georgia, and east to Richmond, Virginia.
                                 LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
                        Pull the pin, and the Confederacy 
                        is strangled in its crib.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Evening, Colonel. That why I see so 
                        many bodies hanging in the streets?

                                 LEADBETTER
                        A signal to any of the locals who 
                        might be inclined to act on their 
                        pro-union sympathies.

                                 ANDREWS
                        How’s it working?

                                 LEADBETTER
                        As long as they show an outward 
                        obedience I could give two shits 
                        what’s in their hearts.

                                 MIRIAM (O.C.)
                        Like a slave.

           Miriam shows at the door, a formidable and ravishing beauty.

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        You two boys got started without 
                        me. Did I miss anything?

                                 ANDREWS
                        The good Colonel was just about to 
                        tell me how long he has you up 
                        here.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Was I now?

                                 MIRIAM
                        Just a night or two I’m afraid. 
                        Given how restive the population 
                        is, Danny thinks it safer for me to 
                        stay back home in Marietta.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Marietta. I have an old friend 
                        there.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Well now you have a new one.

           She smiles. Leadbetter snorts.
                                 LEADBETTER
                        It’s uncanny how you have friends 
                        all over the map. Many of them our 
                        enemies.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I’m a man of enterprise,
                        Colonel. I can’t afford to take a 
                        side in this fight.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        No, you’re too busy playing them.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Everyone benefits. You most of all.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        The only reason I let you exist.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Danny!

                                 ANDREWS
                        Is that a warning?

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Words of wisdom, Mr. Andrews. A man 
                        who doesn’t take sides has nobody. 
                        Is nobody. You don’t want to be 
                        left standing in front of a firing 
                        line when the music stops.

                                 ANDREWS
                        What makes you think you won’t?

           Leadbetter smiles. He would so like to kill this man.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        If the question is why I believe 
                        the Confederacy will prevail, then 
                        the answer is simple. Despite every 
                        Union advantage -- men, money, 
                        industry -- we still have something 
                        they do not: guts. That’s why one 
                        rebel is worth ten bluebellies on 
                        the battlefield. We have the 
                        willingness, the conviction, to do 
                        what the other side can’t or won’t. 
                        Unlike you, our dicks don’t shrivel 
                        into our stomachs at the idea of 
                        spilling blood.
                                 ANDREWS
                        No, they just shrivel at the idea 
                        of freedom for a few million black 
                        folk.

           Leadbetter has had enough. He glares at Miriam.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Get this smuggler what he came for 
                        then get him out. We have real 
                        guests to attend to.
                           (to Andrews)
                        Oh, and one more thing. My wife may 
                        find you charming, but all I see is 
                        a small time smuggler who’s grown 
                        too big a head. You ever point your 
                        gun at one of my men again I will 
                        chop it off and throw you up on a 
                        stake like a bird feeder.

           He goes. Andrews grins to Miriam.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I can see why he’s so well liked.

           INT. ANTE ROOM - LEADBETTER’S HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           A room right off the party continuing outside. Miriam removes 
           a large pouch from a safe and tosses it to Andrews. Inside is 
           $5000 in gold coins.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Satisfied?

           Andrews sees the coins are marked with the character “L”

                                 ANDREWS
                        These coins are marked.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Yes, Danny likes to keep track of 
                        everything that passes through his 
                        hands.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I don’t see anything on you?

                                 MIRIAM
                        We haven’t gotten that far yet.

           She smiles suggestively. There’s definitely heat between 
           them. He pockets the pouch.
                                 ANDREWS
                        And I thought we were done here.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Isn’t that the way with people of 
                        enterprise -- one transaction 
                        always leads to another.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Like what? More relief for your 
                        brave rebels?

           She purrs up to him, smoothing his lapel.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Relief yes, but not for them. Now, 
                        how about that dance?

                                 ANDREWS
                        I appreciate the invitation, Mrs. 
                        Leadbetter, but my dance card’s 
                        full.

           He pulls away and goes.

       A11
           INT. GREAT ROOM - LEADBETTER’S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
                                                                   A11

           Party’s over. Miriam wanders the now empty room, empty 
           champaign flutes everywhere, slave servants cleaning up. 
           Leadbetter, yucking it up with some officers over brandy and 
           cigars, Whitsitt among them, sees her pass by.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        You know you can’t save everybody.

                                 MIRIAM
                        What are you talking about?

                                 LEADBETTER
                        First those boys down at the 
                        hospital, then that smuggler. 
                        They’ll all bite the bullet soon 
                        enough. The only blood a woman 
                        should worry about is what’s coming 
                        from between her legs.

           He turns back to his men, shutting Miriam out. She needs to 
           get out of there and heads for the door.
       B11
           EXT. PORCH - LEADBETTER’S HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS
                                                                   B11

           Miriam steps outside and takes in the night air, her hopes 
           dashed. A flame sparks up in the shadows down the porch. 
           Andrews takes a long draw on a cigarette.

                                 MIRIAM
                        What are you doing?

                                 ANDREWS
                        I thought we still had business.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Then you misjudged the nature of 
                        the opportunity.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I doubt it. Not with you married to 
                        that black-hearted son of a bitch 
                        in there.

           He nods to Leadbetter framed in the window behind him. Miriam 
           catwalks over.

                                 MIRIAM
                        As opposed to what? A double 
                        dealing rogue who negotiates from 
                        behind the barrel of a gun? Or is 
                        what I encountered this morning all 
                        for show.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Everything’s a show, until it’s 
                        not.

           She stops just short of Andrews and sizes him up.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Well I’m looking for a man who can 
                        pull a trigger.

           She looks at her husband right inside, chewing on his cigar. 

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        And if he knew you were out here 
                        with me he’d kill us both.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Then it’s a good thing we stay 
                        quiet.

           He leans in and kisses her -- sexy, gentle, teasing. She’s 
           starved for it.
                                 MIRIAM
                        Gold. That’s what you came for 
                        isn’t it? What you want.

                                 ANDREWS
                        And you.

           He slowly starts to undress her, kissing her neck, shoulder, 
           breasts...

                                 MIRIAM
                        What if I said you could have both. 
                        Not just a taste, but everything. 
                        My husband’s entire fortune.

           Her dress falls, then her corset...

                                 ANDREWS
                        I’d say it’s all been traded in for 
                        war bonds and bluebacks so the 
                        Confederates can buy their allies 
                        overseas. There’s no fortune left 
                        in the south that’s not controlled 
                        by Richmond.

           The last piece falls. She’s nude now. Shivering. Vulnerable.

                                 MIRIAM
                        No fortune they know of.

           Andrews turns her around, pushing her up beside the window, 
           both of them facing Leadbetter.

                                 ANDREWS
                           (whispering)
                        For a Colonel with a key city to 
                        defend that doesn’t show much 
                        confidence in the future of 
                        Confederate money, or the 
                        Confederacy. Some would even call 
                        it treason.

           He presses close, unbuckling his belt, tracing every inch of 
           her smooth body with his hands.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Maybe that’s why he’s kept it a 
                        secret. One he plans to hide in his 
                        fortress here away from prying 
                        eyes.

                                 ANDREWS
                        He’s moving it?
           He presses closer still, almost inside her.

                                 MIRIAM
                        First train next Friday under 
                        cover. 800,000 in unclaimed, 
                        untraceable Confederate gold.

                                 ANDREWS
                        What about your husband’s crest?

           He enters her. She moans.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Heat it up enough, any mark can be 
                        erased.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Then let’s jump into the fire.

           He takes her from behind, quietly, passionately, eyes on each 
           other. Her husband roaring with laughter right inside.

           INT. CHEROKEE BATH HOUSE - DAY

           Andrews enters a steamy shack with a giant tub. Three Indian 
           whores lather down the hotelier HENRY GREEN COLE (45), part 
           time Union spy, full time grifter.

                                 COLE
                        If it ain’t my oldest friend on 
                        God’s green earth.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Who’s your newest?

           Andrews nods to a BODYGUARD by the towel rack, hand on a 
           revolver in his belt.

                                 COLE
                        You can never be too careful around 
                        old friends.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Especially if you’re you.

           Cole grins, guilty as charged. He gestures for the bodyguard 
           to leave them.

                                 COLE
                        So how’s the contraband business?
                                 ANDREWS
                        Losing it’s luster with every 
                        picket I have to cross in the cold 
                        Goddamn rain. I was thinking of 
                        turning respectable. Like you.

                                 COLE
                        Glad to hear it. Who ya gonna screw 
                        to get there?

           Andrews eyes the whores.

                                 COLE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry. These squaw can’t 
                        speak a lick.

                                 ANDREWS
                        What if I told you I got a line on 
                        a fortune in Confederate gold that 
                        if it went missing, nobody but the 
                        bastard it was stolen from, his 
                        wife, and the courier movin’ it 
                        would ever know it was gone. Eight 
                        hundred thousand dollars.

           Cole is very intrigued.

                                 COLE
                        I’d say that’s some serious 
                        respectability. And you’re looking 
                        for a partner.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Cut you in for twenty-five percent 
                        of my take.

                                 COLE
                        Fifty.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Thirty.

                                 COLE
                        Fifty.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Thirty-five.

           Cole flashes his hands. Five, zero. Fifty.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Fine. Fifty. But minus the ten 
                        grand you cheated me out of the 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        last time to buy that Goddamn 
                        respectability of yours.

                                 COLE
                        Actually it was a hotel.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Plus interest.

           Cole entertains this, shrugs.

                                 COLE
                        Okay. Deal. But given our history, 
                        why not just do it yourself?

                                 ANDREWS
                        You’re the only man in Marietta who 
                        can deliver the goods. Guns, 
                        explosives, and bunks for two dozen 
                        men.

                                 COLE
                        What the hell are we robbing? A 
                        Confederate fort?

           Andrews slaps down a time table for the Western & Atlantic 
           Railroad, Atlanta to Chattanooga. Circled is the first train 
           Friday morning.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Try a Confederate Colonel.

                                 COLE
                        Please tell me you don’t mean 
                        Leadbetter?

           Andrews smiles like a fox.

                                 COLE (CONT’D)
                        James, that man’s got a whole army 
                        not a posse. How you gonna rip off 
                        a Confederate train 200 miles 
                        behind enemy lines, lines 
                        controlled by the very guy you’re 
                        stealing from, and move that much 
                        loot far and fast enough before 
                        anyone knows what’s what. Cuz when 
                        Leadbetter gets wind, getting outta 
                        the south’ll be easier for a nigger 
                        with two heads and a white woman 
                        swinging on his cock than it will 
                        be for you. What’s your plan?

           Andrews just smiles.
           EXT. UNION CAMP - SHELBYVILLE, TENNESSE - NIGHT

           LIEUTENANT ARBUCKLE (20s), Mitchel’s Aide-de-camps, dashes 
           through camp, zig-zagging down rows of white tents and past 
           dying fires up to...

       A13
           EXT. MITCHEL’S TENT - NIGHT
                                                                   A13

           BRIG. GENERAL “OLD STARS” ORMSBY MITCHEL (37), who peers 
           through a telescope at the starry sky. An astronomer’s chart 
           is spread across a small table with a lantern on it.

                                 ARBUCKLE
                        General sir, we just stopped a man 
                        entering camp.

           EXT. HORSE CORRAL - UNION CAMP - NIGHT
                                                                   B13

           Arbuckle leads Mitchel to Andrews, who stands under armed 
           guard, amused by the rifles in his face.

                                 MITCHEL
                        I should have known. Whatever 
                        you’re selling I ain’t buying.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Why would you? I sell opportunity, 
                        and that’s shit you gotta act on. 
                        God forbid anyone in this army take 
                        action, especially its generals.

                                 MITCHEL
                        You’ll see action soon enough.

                                 ANDREWS
                        So it’s true. You’re marchin’ on 
                        Huntsville. Four days.

           Mitchel is startled. He gets in Andrews face.

                                 MITCHEL
                        Nobody knows that but me and my 
                        closest officers.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Then lucky I work for you and not 
                        the graybacks. You move in four 
                        days and you’ll catch ‘em sleeping. 
                        But why settle for low hanging 
                        fruit when I can deliver the whole 
                        Goddamn plantation.
           Mitchel is intrigued.

           EXT. MITCHEL’S TENT - NIGHT

           A FIELD MAP of the eastern United States is thrown over the 
           astronomer’s chart. Andrews plants his finger on...

                                 ANDREWS
                        Chatta-fuckin’-nooga.

                                 MITCHEL
                        You can’t be serious.

                                 ANDREWS
                        After grabbing Huntsville all you 
                        gotta do is pile your army into a 
                        troop train and roll on down the 
                        line. Even with half your men 
                        dropped behind to hold points along 
                        the way you outnumber Leadbetter’s 
                        forces three to one. That’s not 
                        even counting the sympathetic 
                        locals who will rise up and greet 
                        you like liberators. The rebels 
                        won’t stand a chance.

                                 MITCHEL
                        Neither will we when the Colonel 
                        calls for reinforcements and that 
                        enormous rebel army comes rolling 
                        up from Atlanta.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I can stop them.

                                 MITCHEL
                        How? You’re one man. A con man. Not 
                        even a soldier.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Maybe I’ve decided to step up my 
                        ambitions.

                                 MITCHEL
                        To what? Magician?

                                 ANDREWS
                        I’m gonna steal a train.

           He points to Marietta, just north of Atlanta, and traces up 
           the Western & Atlantic spur to Chattanooga.
                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Here, in Marietta, and drive it up 
                        the line fast and furious blowin’ 
                        bridges, rippin’ up track, and 
                        choppin’ down telegraph. By the 
                        time anyone has time to catch their 
                        breath your boys’ll be dug in with 
                        one hundred miles of wrecked to 
                        shit railroad between them and the 
                        nearest Confederate with a gun. All 
                        I need are twenty men and your word 
                        you’ll knock out Leadbetter.

                                 MITCHEL
                        It’s a million to one.

                                 ANDREWS
                        23,000 men were just killed at 
                        Shiloh. More Americans than in all 
                        the wars in all the history of our 
                        nation. That was two days. An 
                        accident. And it’s only the 
                        beginning. Lincoln knows if he 
                        doesn’t turn the tide of the war 
                        quickly those sons of bitches in 
                        the South will only get bolder. 
                        Taking Chattanooga can change all 
                        that. With its rail junction 
                        there’s not a better strategic 
                        target. And by liberating a captive 
                        pro-Union population from a brutal 
                        prick like Leadbetter it’s got a 
                        happy ending for everyone.

                                 MITCHEL
                        Especially you.

                                 ANDREWS
                        My plan works you can strike the 
                        first blow that ends this war, and 
                        maybe even see yourself get 
                        measured for a monument.

           Mitchel considers the plan. He likes it. Still...

                                 MITCHEL
                        You’re a good salesman Andrews. But 
                        selling a man isn’t the same as 
                        leading him. For the first time in 
                        your life you’re gonna have to 
                        worry about taking care of more 
                        than your own hide. I’m not sure a 
                        leopard can change its spots.
                                 ANDREWS
                        The south did.

                                 MITCHEL
                        And look where it got them. What if 
                        you fail?

                                 ANDREWS
                        You can always stop short and say I 
                        went ahead without orders. I’ll be 
                        dead anyway.

           Mitchel is starting to see the light.

                                 MITCHEL
                        That’s a perk. What do you get?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Beside the warm and fuzzy feeling 
                        of knowing I served my country?

           Mitchel smiles. He knows Andrews is full of shit.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Fifty thousand if I make it back. 
                        Don’t even have to be in gold.

           Mitchel is sold. He lights a cigar and offers one to Andrews, 
           who pockets it.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        I’ll save it for the next time we 
                        see each other.

           Mitchel gazes up at the last stars still visible in the 
           brightening sky. 

                                 MITCHEL
                        I was an astronomer before all 
                        this. A man who studies stars. If 
                        there’s anything I’ve discovered, 
                        it’s we live in a violent universe. 
                        All fire and brimstone and cosmic 
                        destruction. Yet through it all 
                        comes something else...

                                 ANDREWS
                        What’s that?

           Mitchel takes a long draw of his cigar.

                                 MITCHEL
                        Rebirth.

           EXT. HORSE CORRAL - UNION CAMP - DAY

           Andrews walks a rag-tag line-up of 17 MEN still in their 
           Union blues, not exactly the cream of the crop of the Union 
           army.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Good day gentlemen. My name is 
                        James Andrews. For those of you who 
                        haven’t heard of me I’ve spent more 
                        time under the Confederate skirt 
                        than General Lee’s mustache. And 
                        I’m about to lift it up for you.

           He stops at an effete type, wet and shivering (PVT. DORSEY, 
           23), dripping on his shoes.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Why do you look like a dishrag, 
                        private?

                                 DORSEY
                        Dorsey. Some fellas they-- they 
                        threw me in the duck pond.

                                 ANDREWS
                        And you let them?

                                 DORSEY
                        No I-- they were just havin’ a 
                        little fun is all.

           Dorsey looks at his shoes, embarrassed. Andrews moves on to a 
           big bruiser of a guy not even in uniform (CAMPBELL, 22).

                                 ANDREWS
                        And you? Where’s your uniform?

           Campbell says nothing. A coiled little bicep of a man speaks 
           up (PVT. SHADRACH, 21).

                                 SHADRACH
                        He ain’t enlisted. They found him 
                        hiding out in camp.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Hiding? From what? 
                           (to Campbell)
                        I said from what, big man?
                                 SHADRACH
                        What I hear every marshal east of 
                        the Ohio River. Goliath there took 
                        out four guys in a Louisville 
                        barfight with nothing but a cue 
                        ball and his bare hands.

           Andrews looks Campbell up and down.

                                 ANDREWS
                        That true?

           He stays mute.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Well at least you look like a 
                        solider.

           He turns to Arbuckle, there representing Mitchell, and pulls 
           him out of earshot of the others.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        This is what you give me? Food for 
                        powder?

                                 ARBUCKLE
                        You’re a civilian. Army protocol 
                        dictates that we can only place 
                        under your command men of a 
                        certain... rank. It’s these men or 
                        nobody.

           Andrews gives a look. Yeah, assholes. He turns back to the 
           line up, grabs a box, and tosses each raider a POUCH.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Okay raiders, listen up. In each of 
                        these pouches you’ll find a map, 
                        ten dollars in Confederate 
                        bluebacks, and three gold coins for 
                        emergency only.

           A pickled old geezer cradling The Tempest who can barely 
           stand up (PVT. BUFFUM, 33) opens his pouch and finds exactly 
           that.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Is running out of whiskey 
                        considered an emergency?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Only in Kentucky. Lucky for your 
                        liver, which my guess is floatin’ 
                        somewhere behind your eyeballs, 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANDREWS (CONT'D)
                        we’re headed to Georgia. Marietta 
                        to be precise. 200 miles behind 
                        enemy lines.

           A shockwave of fear riles through the assembled raiders.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        First thing’s first. Who are the 
                        engineers in this group?

           Two hands go up. Portly PVT. SLAVENS (31) and Coarse CPL. 
           LLEWELLYN (32).

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Name and experience?

                                 LLEWELLYN
                        Llewllyn, sir. 15 years for the 
                        P&O. I can launch a barnburner in 
                        my sleep.

                                 ANDREWS
                        And you?

                                 SLAVENS
                        Slavens. I operated a steam engine 
                        for a stint in Buffalo. It was a 
                        mill -- undergarments for ladies -- 
                        but the principle’s the same.

                                 PARROTT (O.C.)
                           (interrupting)
                        Sorry, excuse us, is this the 
                        secret mission or whatnot?

           Two more raiders come bumbling into the corral. Meet PVTS. 
           PARROTT (25) and WOLLAM (20), a preacher and a Scotsman.

                                 ANDREWS
                        You’re late. And how many people 
                        have you been asking that to?

                                 WOLLAM
                        You’re the third. We gotta wee 
                        turned around is all.

                                 ANDREWS
                        All you peckerwoods had to do is 
                        walk a wee two hundred yards 
                        through your own camp.

                                 PARROTT
                        Guess the good Lord pointed us in 
                        the wrong direction.
           He holds up his bible.

                                 WOLLAM
                           (about to crack up)
                        The prick.

           Andrews takes in their goofy grins and bloodshot eyes. High 
           as kites. He tosses them their pouches and carries on.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Marietta, gentleman. The Fletcher 
                        House. That’s our destination. When 
                        we’re done here you will change out 
                        of your Union blues, polish your 
                        best seesh accent, and cross the 
                        nearest Confederate picket in 
                        groups of no more than four. You 
                        have exactly three days to make it 
                        to our rendezvous point.

                                 DORSEY
                        And do what?

                                 ANDREWS
                        I’ll tell you when you get there. 
                        If you get there, which looking at 
                        those two jerk-offs--
                           (re: Parrott & Wollam)
                        Isn’t a sure shot. This mission is 
                        too important to jeopardize if any 
                        one of you shitheels gets caught. 
                        What we’re about to do is both 
                        daring and dangerous. You will be 
                        considered spies if captured and 
                        you will be executed. Anyone wants 
                        to bow out, now’s the time.

           He looks down the line. No one does. He stops at a young 
           farmboy, PVT. WOOD (15).

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        How old are you, son?

                                 WOOD
                        Nineteen, sir.

                                 ANDREWS
                        You’re gonna have to lie better 
                        than that if you want to make it 
                        past the graybacks.

                                 WOOD
                        Seventeen?
           Andrews shakes his head.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Sorry. This is a mission for men. 
                        Such as they are. 
                           (to Arbuckle)
                        Take this one back to camp.

                                 WOOD
                        No! Please. I can do this.

                                 ANDREWS
                        You don’t even know what this is?

                                 WOOD
                        I don’t care. Back in Indiana my 
                        parents warned everyone within 100 
                        miles I didn’t have their 
                        permission to enlist. So I walked a 
                        120 to where nobody knew me and 
                        lied good and well to the 
                        recruiter. I can lie good and well 
                        as anyone, sir. Please. All I ever 
                        wanted to be was a Union soldier.

           Andrews is stirred. Someone snickers down the line. Shadrach.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Find something funny about that?

                                 SHADRACH
                        I find somethin’ funny about this 
                        whole shady operation. Especially 
                        when a smuggler’s running it.

           Andrews grabs Shadrach by the scruff and hurls him into some 
           horseshit. Shadrach looks up, purple-faced with fury.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Make no mistake, private. You might 
                        be shedding your uniform, but 
                        you’re still an enlisted Union 
                        soldier. And I’m in command. 
                           (shouting to all)
                        Got it everyone? Good.

           They all nod, no doubt who’s in charge. The look in 
           Shadrach’s eyes say this is far from settled. Andrews walks 
           back up to Wood.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Welcome to the Andrews Raiders. You 
                        got any last letters to write mom 
                        and dad back in Indiana, I’d get on 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        it. 
                           (to everyone)
                        One hour, gentlemen, we hit the

           Mitchell looks over some NEWS STORY CLIPPINGS. CPL. PITTINGER  *
           (21), a goody-two-shoes type with fancy oval spectacles, 
           stands at attention with Arbuckle.

                                 MITCHEL
                        You’re the young man who’s been 
                        serving as a correspondent for your 
                        hometown newspaper? Corporal 
                        Pittinger?

                                 PITTINGER
                        The Steubenville Herald. Yes, sir.

                                 MITCHEL
                        Arbuckle here has filled you in on 
                        what this mission we’ve placed you 
                        on is all about, yes?

                                 PITTINGER
                        Yes, and I agree there’s an amazing 
                        story in it if it succeeds.

           Mitchel smiles.

                                 MITCHEL
                        Good. Then I’m entrusting you to be 
                        my eyes and ears on the road. Your 
                        leader Mr. Andrews is a man of, 
                        shall we say, nebulous agendas. If 
                        he does anything to jeopardize our 
                        primary objective...

           He hands Pittinger a small snub-nosed Derringer.

                                 MITCHEL (CONT’D)
                        You are authorized to take command.

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           Slavens and Dorsey walk up to an assemblage of raiders, 
           Dorsey in a new shirt but still in blue pants. Buffum, kicked  *
           back by a tree, looks up from his book and grins.
                                 BUFFUM
                        O’ Brave new world that has such 
                        people in it.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Yeah, morons.

           Shadrach leaps up and starts tugging off Dorsey’s pants.

                                 DORSEY
                        What the-- Mr. Shadrach what are 
                        you doing?

                                 SHADRACH
                        Savin’ your life you ninny.

                                 DORSEY
                        I could get a cold.

                                 LLEWELLYN
                        You’ll get worse than that the rebs 
                        see you’re still wearing your Union 
                        blues.

           Shadrach throws them into the muddy road. A man on horseback 
           tramples up over them. It’s Andrews, who looks down on Dorsey  *
           in his long johns. Wood steps up.

                                 WOOD
                        We’re ready when you are, sir.

           Andrews fishes into his pack and throws a pair of pants at 
           Dorsey.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Marietta, three days. Just try not 
                        to get yourselves killed or 
                        captured.

                                 ARBUCKLE (O.C.)
                        You have one more.

           Arbuckle walks up with Pittinger.

                                 ARBUCKLE (CONT’D)
                        Mitchell thought having a reporter 
                        could give color to your exploits.

           Andrews gives ‘em loaded looks.

                                 ANDREWS
                           (re: the raiders)
                        What, they’re not colorful enough?
           He gallops off.

                                 SLAVENS
                        I guess we walk.

           EXT. ROAD - SOMEWHERE IN TENNESSEE - DAY

           Pittinger, Buffum, Wood, and Llewellyn amble down the road. 
           Buffum suddenly high steps it into the woods.

                                 WOOD
                        Seriously, how many times can one 
                        man pee? By the time we get there 
                        the war will be over.

                                 PITTINGER
                        Well, if we’re taking a pause.

           Pittinger retreats into the woods after him. Llewellyn smiles 
           at and nods for them to continue on.

       A19
           INT. WOODS - SOMEWHERE IN TENNESEE - DAY
                                                                   A19

           Pissing there, Buffum spots something that makes him duck: 

           A GROUP OF REBELS patrol through the woods on horseback, lead 
           by Lieutenant Vickers, looking for insurgents. 

           Buffum pssst’s Pittinger and points. Zipping up, Pittinger 
           also ducks.

       B19
           EXT. ROAD - SOMEWHERE IN TENNESSEE - DAY
                                                                   B19

           Wood and Llewellyn walk on, unaware of the rebels emerging 
           from the woods behind them.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS
                        Halt. You two.

           They freeze and slowly turn around. Vickers trots up. He 
           looks them up and down, especially interested in their shoes.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS (CONT’D)
                        Purty sturdy boots there. Where 
                        ya’ll coming from?

                                 LLEWELLYN
                        Kain-tucky sir. Just headed down 
                        to, uh, see some friends in 
                        Georgia. 
                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS
                        What kind of friends?

                                 WOOD
                        Guys to enlist with. We wanna stick 
                        it to them Yankee bastards.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS
                        Do you now? Well then this is your 
                        lucky day. We’re surrounded by all 
                        sorts of Yankee bastards right 
                        ‘round here.

           The two raiders swap oh shit looks.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS (CONT’D)
                        Looks like the good Colonel just 
                        hooked himself some new recruits.

           Llewellyn throws a panicky look in the direction of the 
           woods.

       C19

           Buffum and Pittinger look on, helpless and horrified.

                                 BUFFUM
                        What do we do?

                                 PITTINGER
                        Like Andrews said, the mission 
                        comes first.

       D19
           EXT. MARIETTA SQUARE - DAY
                                                                   D19

           Miriam, holding a parasol, lifts her skirt as she scurries 
           through the street... 

           She wanders through a little flower market, sniffing this and 
           that, then stops in front of a stall of a fancy pigeon 
           breeder, cages stacked everywhere, each showing off some 
           exotic creation. A hand grabs her... 

           ANDREWS PULLS HER INTO THE NOOK BETWEEN STALLS.

           Miriam’s face lights up, both at sight of the man before her,  *
           and the arrival of her partner in crime. He grins assuredly.

                                 MIRIAM
                        I was wondering when the players 
                        were going to enter the stage.
                                 ANDREWS
                        Cue the orchestra.

       E19
           EXT. FLETCHER HOUSE - NIGHT
                                                                   E19*

           An elegant brick hotel just off Marietta Square. Cole stands 
           out front smoking a cigarette and eying rebels as they amble 
           by. He checks his timepiece, looks to a room on the third 
           floor, and ducks inside.

       19-26

                                                                  19-26*

           INT. ANDREWS’ ROOM - FLETCHER HOUSE - NIGHT

           A large corner room on the third floor. A clock reads twenty 
           after midnight. Andrews holds the floor. Pittinger, Shadrach, 
           Campbell, Dorsey, Slavens, Buffum and 10 other raiders (save 
           Parrott and Wollam) are gathered before him. They look 
           scared, exhausted, and on the cusp of mutiny.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Steal a Confederate train?

                                 ANDREWS
                        And run it up the line wreaking 
                        havoc. By the time we roll into 
                        Chattanooga your commander General 
                        Mitchel will have taken the city.

                                 DORSEY
                        What are we -- wild west train 
                        robbers?

                                 PITTINGER
                        We’re soldiers and this is the 
                        mission.

                                 SLAVENS
                        Yeah, a suicide mission. That whole 
                        railroad is crawling with rebels.

                                 ANDREWS
                        This isn’t a discussion gentleman. 
                        These are orders.

                                 SHADRACH
                        So what? We gonna just walk next 
                        door and demand them peckerwoods 
                        hand over their twenty tons of 
                        train? We ain’t even got guns.
                                 ANDREWS
                        You’ll have everything you need. 
                        The train we take further up the 
                        line.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Where?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Big Shanty. It’s the first station 
                        on the line without a telegraph. We 
                        can’t afford any graybacks shooting 
                        off a warning to Leadbetter before 
                        we get rolling. This whole 
                        adventure only works if no one 
                        ahead knows we’re coming.

                                 DORSEY
                        And if they do?

                                 ANDREWS
                        We’re dead as dirt. 

           All the oxygen leaves the room. The raiders begin yammering 
           and arguing amongst themselves. Andrews sees it’s already 
           cracking apart. He pulls a knife sheathed in his boot and 
           flings it across the room. It STICKS A PERFECT LANDING in the 
           opposite wall. 

           Everyone shuts up.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Okay raiders, this is how it is. I 
                        know you’re all pissing in your 
                        boots. But look at the man next to 
                        you.

           They do this.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        If you haven’t noticed, he ain’t 
                        exactly prize of the Union army. 
                        Now look the other way. See a theme 
                        here? You’re shitheels, nobodies, 
                        cannon fodder. If you weren’t down 
                        here right now you’d be put out 
                        front on a skirmish line somewhere 
                        for the express purpose of getting 
                        your heads blown off. At least now 
                        you got the element of surprise. At 
                        least with me you have a chance to 
                        reach for fucking glory. Mitchel 
                        handed me you assholes because he 
                        thinks this mission is a million to 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        one. But guess what? You just did 
                        somethin’ no other Union soldier 
                        has ever done. You marched right 
                        into the heart of the south and you 
                        did it without a shot fired. The 
                        hard part is over, boys. Once we 
                        shanghai that train and cut our 
                        first telegraph it will be smooth 
                        sailing up the line. Not just into 
                        Chattanooga, but the history books. 
                        By tomorrow night the most 
                        important rail link in the south 
                        will be in Union hands, and with it 
                        our boot on the Confederacy’s fat 
                        red neck. And a bunch of shitheels 
                        who no one thought could do 
                        anything will have a whole army, a 
                        whole city, and a whole country 
                        calling you heros.

           He can see them gaining confidence.

                                 PITTINGER
                        What about Wood and Llewellyn? And 
                        the other two we lost.

                                 ANDREWS
                        The clowns I don’t care about. But 
                        the engineer and that boy -- 
                        mission’s still on because they 
                        kept their mouths shut. They’re 
                        probably getting fitted for new 
                        uniforms in Chattanooga as we 
                        speak, holdin’ their breath for 
                        someone to show up and save their 
                        asses. For you, raiders. They 
                        sacrificed. Now its our turn. So 
                        what do ya say? You’ve already come 
                        this far. Let’s go all the way. All 
                        Chattanooga or all hell!

           Buffum, now shitfaced, toasts the mission with his whiskey 
           bottle.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Screw it. All Chattanooga or all 
                        hell!

           Then Pittinger.

                                 PITTINGER
                        All Chattanooga or all hell!

           Then Dorsey.
                                 DORSEY
                        All Chattanooga or all hell!

           Then all of them. Psyched up for battle. Campbell smiles, 
           silent but onboard.

           KNOCK-KNOCK 

           The door. Everyone hushes. Andrews pulls a revolver. So does 
           Pittinger. Mitchel’s Derringer. He and Andrews exchange an 
           awkward, knowing look. At least two of them are armed. 
           Another knock...

           Andrews opens the door. It’s Cole, standing behind a trolly 
           with a tea tray.

                                 COLE
                        Room service.

           He and Andrews exchange sly smiles. The raiders eye Cole 
           nervously as he rolls in with the trolly.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Who the hell is this?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Mr. Cole here is the proprietor of 
                        this establishment. He also happens 
                        to be one of my oldest friends and 
                        a staunch pro-Unionist.

           Cole sets aside the tea tray and yanks off the tablecloth, 
           revealing the trolly to be a crate on wheels.

                                 COLE
                        Welcome to Georgia, boys.

           He cracks the crate, marked “BIBLES.” The raiders gather 
           around and gawk at what’s inside:

           REVOLVERS, RIFLES, GRENADES, DYNAMITE. Everything a man needs 
           for an insurrection. Except a bible.

           INT. BACK STAIRWAY - FLETCHER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Narrow, dimly lit. Andrews and Cole descend to the back door.

                                 COLE
                        Nice speech in there. First class 
                        horseshit. You almost made me 
                        believe you were a patriot.
                                 ANDREWS
                        All part of the show.

                                 COLE
                        You really think that crew is up to 
                        this?

                                 ANDREWS
                        All I need are warm bodies to rip 
                        up track and hands to drive that 
                        train. I can handle the rest. How 
                        do I look?

           Cole tugs straight his friend’s lapel.

                                 COLE
                        Like a thief. You sure she won’t 
                        change her mind?

                                 ANDREWS
                        She does, I’ll change it back.

           Andrews heads off into the night. Cole watches him go. No way 
           do we trust this guy.

       A29
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
                                                                   A29

           Smaller and dingier than Andrews’ suite. Wollam and Parrot 
           loll around on the floor, high as shit, opium stashed away in 
           the hollowed-out compartment of Parrot’s bible.

                                 PARROTT
                           (dead serious)
                        Know what I admire most about our 
                        Lord and savior Jesus Christ?

                                 WOLLAM
                        His sandals?

           Wollam takes a world class toke and passes the opium pipe.

                                 PARROTT
                        Yes! His sandals. Why don’t men 
                        these days wear sandals?

                                 WOLLAM
                           (exhaling)
                        The chinks do. Coal mines, 
                        outhouse. Clop, clop, clop every-
                        damn-where.

           Parrot sucks in, then exhales a cloud of smoke.
                                 PARROTT
                        That’s right. They’re godless 
                        heathens. But their feet are free.

           Wollam looks down to his booted feet, inspired. He yanks one 
           boot off then the other and throws them both out the window. 
           Parrott follows suit and they wiggle their stockinged feet at 
           each other and laugh like maniacs. 

           Suddenly they turn serious.

                                 PARROTT (CONT’D)
                        You sure Andrews or someone’s gonna 
                        come get us?

                                 WOLLAM
                        Sure. This is the hotel right?

       B29
           EXT. MARIETTA SQUARE - NIGHT
                                                                   B29

           Andrews strides past two pair of discarded boots lying in the 
           gutter in front of the Marietta Inn -- aka the wrong hotel.

           EXT. LEADBETTER’S MANSION - NIGHT

           A white mansion fronted by huge Doric columns with a wrap 
           around plantation porch. A COACH sits out front. Andrews 
           slips around back.

       A30
           EXT. BACK PORCH - LEADBETTER’S MANSION - NIGHT
                                                                   A30

           Andrews vaults onto the porch and finds all the doors wide 
           open, sheer curtains billowing out into the moonlight.

       B30
           INT. DOWNSTAIRS - LEADBETTER’S MANSION - NIGHT
                                                                   B30

           Andrews steps inside, finding himself inside The Colonel’s 
           home. A HUGE OIL PAINTING of Leadbetter with his hunting dog 
           hangs over the fireplace. Andrews smiles.

           He heads over to the bottom of a grand “GONE WITH THE WIND” 
           STAIRCASE, where he finds a single gold coin left for him on 
           the balustrade. He pockets it and goes upstairs.

       C30
           INT. UPSTAIRS - LEADBETTER’S MANSION - NIGHT
                                                                   C30

           Andrews prowls down a long candlelit corridor with an array 
           of different doors off it, all shut. He stops at one with a 
           RED SCARF tied to its knob, the same one Miriam wore at the 
           hospital. 

           He unties it and tries the door. Locked. He considers the 
           scarf in his hand, then the door, and KICKS IT OPEN...

           INT. MIRIAM’S BEDROOM - LEADBETTER’S MANSION - NIGHT

           Inside is Miriam, half startled, half excited, wearing 
           nothing but a SILK ROBE. Andrews makes a move forward. Miriam 
           raises a pistol and trains it at his heart.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Blindfold yourself.

           Andrews looks at the red scarf. He’s not sure if she’s double- *
           crossing him or something more... fun.

                                 ANDREWS
                        If this about your door?

           She cocks the hammer. He blindfolds himself, smelling the 
           scarf.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Reminds me of you.

           Miriam prowls over and circles Andrews with the gun, tracing 
           its barrel over him, pressing it against his crotch...

                                 MIRIAM
                        It was the first thing, besides 
                        food, having my own money ever got 
                        me. The only thing I have left that 
                        Danny didn’t strip me of when we 
                        got married. The one possession in 
                        this world that’s truly mine.

           She unbuckles his pants and drops with them to her knees, 
           taking possession of Andrews in a whole different way.

           OMITTED

           INT. MIRIAM’S BEDROOM - LEADBETTER’S MANSION - NIGHT

           They lay post coital among jostled sheets. The scarf strewn 
           between them.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Maybe after all is said and done we 
                        could keep up this little 
                        partnership. Take it to New York.

                                 MIRIAM (CONT'D)
                        Paris even. Get away from this 
                        country before it burns itself to 
                        the ground.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Why? Someone has to pick through 
                        the ashes.

                                 MIRIAM
                        And I thought even a double-dealing 
                        opportunist like yourself has 
                        bounds.

                                 ANDREWS
                        If I did, you wouldn’t have wasted 
                        your time on me. Or your body. In 
                        fact, something tells me I was your 
                        only gambit.

           He grins like the double-dealing opportunist he is. She nods,  *
           acknowledging the obvious.

                                 MIRIAM
                        That gold will end up in someone’s 
                        hands sooner or later. If the 
                        rebels don’t discover it, the Union 
                        will wrench it away. I have no 
                        intention of being left with a dead 
                        or disgraced husband and a home on 
                        the muddy street. Not again. Not 
                        after what I’ve endured. Those 
                        slaves everyone is fighting over. I 
                        can’t pretend to say I know what 
                        it’s like to be them, to walk in 
                        that skin, but I do know what it’s 
                        like to be owned. To have to get 
                        down on your knees if you want to 
                        be fed that night. If this war is 
                        about freedom, then I want mine.

                                 ANDREWS
                        From him?

                                 MIRIAM
                        From everybody.

           She gets up, taking the scarf, and goes to her dresser, where  *
           she sets it down and opens a jewel box, plucking out a card. 
           Andrews comes up from behind and looks at it: It’s stamped 
           with a INK BLOT RAVEN and the words “McClintock Gunpowder”.

                                 ANDREWS
                        You’re kidding me?
                                 MIRIAM
                        Danny’s moving it in six kegs.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Under the watch of the baddest road 
                        agent this side of Pinkerton 
                        himself. You could have told me 
                        this earlier.

                                 MIRIAM
                        You handled me. He should be a 
                        pussycat.

                                 ANDREWS
                        You don’t know McClintock.

           He slips the card into his vest.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Well, you can tell me all about him 
                        when you step off that train in 
                        Chattanooga tomorrow.

                                 ANDREWS
                        That’ll be a neat trick since 
                        you’ll still be riding up in a 
                        coach.

                                 MIRIAM
                        My coach leaves tonight, Mr. 
                        Andrews. If you think I trust you 
                        to get a head start with everything 
                        I have you have a bigger head than 
                        my husband gave you credit for.

           She steps over to a CLOSET, where a travelling outfit is hung 
           up next to PACKED SUITCASES, and starts to get dressed. 
           Andrews has a choice to make. He picks up his jacket and 
           pulls something from the pocket, then goes up behind Miriam.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I really do like you, Miriam. 
                        You’re like me.

           He caresses his hands down her bare arms as he gently kisses 
           her neck, pinning them behind her back. By the time he’s done 
           Miriam’s WRISTS ARE BOUND. She looks back, confused.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Which is why I can’t trust you to 
                        get to Chattanooga while your 
                        husband is still there. 
           Miriam’s heart sinks. Could it be he’s just like all the 
           others?

                                 MIRIAM
                        James, please don’t--

           He GAGS HER and binds her hands and feet.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Sorry, but it’s for both our own 
                        good. If anything goes wrong you 
                        can always say I forced myself on 
                        you. Otherwise meet me at the 
                        Biltmore Hotel in New York in one 
                        week’s time. I’ll keep the bed warm 
                        and your share on ice.

           He kisses her forehead and goes, locking the closet behind 
           him. He throws on his clothes, Miriam pounding inside the 
           closet. On his way out Andrews sees the RED SCARF on the 
           dresser. He takes it, blows out the candles, and goes.

           INT. ANDREWS’ ROOM - FLETCHER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Andrews enters his dark room. Cole sits in the corner eating 
           a peach.

                                 COLE
                        So?

           Andrews flips Cole the card with the ink-blot raven.

                                 ANDREWS
                        He’s moving it in gunpowder. 
                        McClintock.

           Andrews steps over to the sink and fills a glass of water. As 
           he goes to drink the peach pit is tossed into the sink. 
           CLICK. 

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Son of a bitch.

           He sees Cole in the mirror behind him, Remington pointed at 
           the back of his head.

                                 COLE
                        Sorry James, but part of being a 
                        winner in this world is reading the 
                        odds, and I just don’t like yours 
                        makin’ it through alive tomorrow. 
                        It’s too big a bet for a small 
                        timer like yourself.
                                 ANDREWS
                        If this is about renegotiating our 
                        deal?

                                 COLE
                        There’s nothing to negotiate. I 
                        have you and a floor full of Union 
                        spies. The reward for that, saving 
                        Leadbetter’s gold, and keeping it a 
                        secret will be easy money. Not to 
                        mention burnish my rep among the 
                        seesh.

                                 ANDREWS
                        What about Mitchel? You’re gonna 
                        make an enemy of the whole Union 
                        army?

           Cole’s finger licks the trigger.

                                 COLE
                        That’s a problem for after your 
                        time.

           Viper-quick Andrews smashes the glass of water in his 
           friend’s face and bats the gun away. It goes skittering under 
           the bedframe and they both lunge for it, clawing at each 
           other’s faces...

           Cole jams Andrews’ head between the mattress and bedframe, 
           strangling him with the rope support while trying to reach 
           the Remington. Andrews, in serious trouble, sees his knife 
           still stuck in the wall from his speech before... 

           With his last gasp Andrews grabs the knife and plunges it 
           down into Cole’s side. Cole rolls off, getting tangled in the 
           bedding as he goes. Andrews, now with the advantage, wraps 
           Cole up even more and starts stabbing him repeatedly through 
           the sheets... 

           Cole’s thrashing subsides and Andrews reels back. He stares 
           at the white sheets now soaked crimson with his old partner’s 
           blood, his heart beating a million miles an hour, overwhelmed 
           by a feeling of horror, of transgression, of a moral bridge 
           crossed and burned.

           EXT. ATLANTA - DAWN

           The sun rises over a slumbering, downtown street. We push in 
           on a two-story red brick BOARDING HOUSE. Over it, a subtitle 
           appears:

                                 (MORE)

                        138 MILES TO CHATTANOOGA”

           A tall, clear-eyed young man steps out the door wearing the 
           checkered pants and dark indigo coat of a train conductor. 
           This is WILLIAM FULLER (26). His YOUNG WIFE, infant cradled 
           in her arm, runs out the door after him...

                                 FULLER’S WIFE
                        I almost forgot...

           She delivers Fuller a small, wrapped GIFT and kisses him on 
           the cheek.

                                 FULLER’S WIFE (CONT’D)
                        Happy birthday, William.

           EXT. TRAIN YARDS - ATLANTA - DAWN

           Gift in hand, Fuller walks up to the railroad’s roundhouse.

           INT. ROUNDHOUSE - ATLANTA - DAWN

           Fuller enters. There, gleaming in the morning light, is his 
           beloved engine THE GENERAL, nothing less than a melody cast 
           and wrought in metal. A free black man, CAIN, finishes up 
           giving a little extra spit and polish to the 4-4-0 Rodger’s 
           built engine. Fuller’s fireman.

                                 CAIN
                        She’s all spittin’ pretty and ready 
                        for her run, Mr. Fuller.

                                 FULLER
                        Good job, Mr. Cain. Nice to see 
                        someone’s as crazy about this rig 
                        as I am.

           Fuller helps Cain with the last of it. It’s like they’re 
           grooming a thoroughbred.

                                 CAIN
                        I ain’t done scrimped and scraped 
                        for thirty years to buy my freedom 
                        so I could slouch. Is that?

                                 FULLER
                           (re: the gift)
                        From my wife.

           MURPHY (33), the Irish engineer, pops his fat red face out of 
           the cab.
                                 MURPHY
                        Why don’t ya open it?

                                 ANDERSON
                        Yeah, we love getting presents.

           ANDERSON, the young brakeman (19), comes tightwalking down 
           the tender. Everyone eyes the gift, grinning, expectant. 
           Fuller has no choice but to unwrap it. Inside he finds a 
           SHINY SILVER TIMEPIECE.

                                 CAIN
                        I guess your missus knows who 
                        you’re really married to.

           Cain pats the General’s cab and everyone laughs.

                                 FULLER
                        Alright, alright. Let’s get movin’.

           EXT. MARIETTA STATION - DAY

           KEGS OF GUNPOWDER are stacked on the platform by slaves, each 
           keg stamped with an ink-blot raven. A leathery man with a 
           white handle bar mustache oversees them, a real badass. This 
           is THE MCCLINTOCK ROAD AGENT.

           Andrews keeps an eye on McClintock and his kegs of 
           “gunpowder” from across the platform. All around him raiders 
           gather in twos and threes among the passengers, trying to 
           look incognito. Andrews checks the station clock: TEN TO 7. 

                                 PITTINGER
                        Everything still on plan?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Depends what we’re talking about. 
                        The one I got with Mitchel, or the 
                        one he has with you?

           Andrews taps the Derringer in his vest. Pittinger’s face 
           falls. A whistle comes from down the track. It’s the General, 
           right on time. A subtitle reads:

                        “MARIETTA STATION
                        118 MILES TO CHATTANOOGA”

           The train draws into the station, belching steam. Besides the 
           engine, there’s a tender carrying the wood and water that 
           fuels the train, three boxcars, a mail & baggage car, and two 
           passenger cars bringing up the rear. Folks line up to board.
           Andrews watches McClintock pay off the STATION MASTER, who 
           goes up with him to Fuller stepping off the train. Fuller 
           looks to the gunpowder with concern, nods, and points to the 
           empty second boxcar. McClintock tips his hat and snaps at the 
           slaves to load the kegs of gunpowder onto the boxcar.

           Andrews turns to his raiders and nods. It’s time. They begin 
           to board the first passenger car. Shadrach and Buffum slide 
           the “BIBLES” crate onto the last boxcar. He pulls Pittinger 
           and Campbell aside, nodding to McClintock as he boards.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        See that man? He’s a Confederate 
                        road agent. On the look out for 
                        Union spies. Cover him.

           They nod gravely.

                                 FULLER
                        All aboard!

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - MARIETTA INN - MORNING

           Parrott snores in bed. Wollam is splayed out on the 
           floorboards. A train bell ringing outside stirs Parrott to 
           peer groggy-eyed out the window. He sees Andrews and the 
           others stepping onto the General.

                                 PARROTT
                        Wake up! Wake up!

           He kicks his companion awake.

                                 WOLLAM
                        Huh?

           Parrott scrambles around gathering up his shit.

                                 PARROTT
                        It’s Andrews! They’re leaving!

                                 WOLLAM
                        But we just got here?

           Parrott stops, everything in hand. He looks around perplexed.

                                 PARROTT
                        Where the hell are our boots?
           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - MOVING

           Cain feeds wood from the tender into the boiler. Murphy opens 
           the throttle and steam belches, the iron beast lurching 
           forward.

           INT. GENERAL - PASSENGER COACH - MOVING

           Raiders are scattered throughout the car. Pittinger sits 
           right behind McClintock, who’s seated in the first row facing  *
           the boxcars, with Campbell and Shadrach across the aisle. 
           Fuller comes through collecting tickets. He stops at Andrews,  *
           who rides with Buffum further back.

                                 FULLER
                        Mornin’. Headed up to Chattanooga?

                                 ANDREWS
                        I am indeed. You?

                                 FULLER
                        It is my train.

                                 ANDREWS
                           (grinning)
                        Of course.

           Fuller checks the time. Andrews clocks his new timepiece.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Nice timepiece you got there.

                                 FULLER
                        Thank you. Birthday gift from my 
                        wife. Got it just this morning.

                                 ANDREWS
                        She’s a keeper. I’d keep your eyes 
                        peeled if I were you. No doubt 
                        there’s some scoundrel on this 
                        train just itchin’ to steal it.

           The two men hold a look, Andrews smiling like a scoundrel. 
           Fuller senses something off and moves on. He turns to Buffum, 
           who fumbles for his bottle.

           The brakeman Anderson hangs off the roof of the last 
           passenger car and watches Marietta Station fall away. He sees  
           two figures race out onto the platform: PARROTT AND WOLLAM.

           Young Wood, now wearing Confederate grays, is curled and 
           asleep alongside others in his regiment on the muddy ground. 
           He’s collared to his feet by Vickers.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS
                        Wake up, maggot.

           Wood gets his bearings. A dozen rebels surround him. They 
           don’t look happy. He looks around for Llewellyn.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS (CONT’D)
                        Yer friend ain’t here. Coward 
                        deserted. Any idea where he went?

           Wood shakes his head, clearly confused.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS (CONT’D)
                        Well we’ll find him that’s for 
                        sure. And when we do, you’ll see 
                        why you better not be havin’ the 
                        same ideas.

           They go, leaving Wood to take in the unfamiliar, 
           unsympathetic faces of his awakened fellow soldiers. He 
           shutters in the cold.

           INT. GENERAL - PASSENGER COACH - MOVING

           Pittinger, Derringer concealed in his lap, keeps his eyes on 
           McClintock, who himself keeps his eyes on the boxcars ahead 
           of them -- and the gold. Fuller steps in for an announcement.

                                 FULLER
                        Next stop Big Shanty. We’ll be 
                        holdin’ for breakfast fifteen 
                        minutes.

           Andrews looks to Buffum. This is it. Buffum throws back some 
           whiskey. Andrews snatches away the bottle.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I need you clear headed.

           Buffum snatches it back. He takes another, bigger swig.
                                 BUFFUM
                        Exactly.

           We flash across the steeled, anxious faces of the raiders 
           we’ve come to know: Pittinger, Campbell, Shadrach, Slavens, 
           Dorsey, whose eyes bug with terror as he looks out the window 
           at the arriving station, which is surrounded by...

                                 DORSEY
                        Oh my.

           EXT. CAMP MCDONALD - BIG SHANTY - DAY

           A newly erected Confederate encampment, 200 strong, all its 
           soldiers starting to stir. Rebels emerge from tents still in 
           their long johns. Once again, a subtitle appears:

                        “BIG SHANTY/CAMP MCDONALD 
                        110 MILES TO CHATTANOOGA”

           They yawn and watch the General pull up in front of the LACY 
           HOTEL.

           INT. PASSENGER CAR - 5:00 TRAIN TO MARIETTA - MOVING - NIGHT

           Andrews looks too, then back to Buffum, all the blood 
           draining from his face. He does his best not to look 
           thunderstruck.

                                 BUFFUM
                        I guess Hell is empty and all the 
                        devils are here.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Just a little wrinkle. No need to 
                        panic.

           He looks back at Dorsey and Slavens, both clearly panicked.

                                 SLAVENS
                        No one said nothin’ about this 
                        being the middle of a Confederate 
                        camp.

           EXT. BIG SHANTY STATION - CONTINUOUS

           A crowd of passengers and crew step off the train, including 
           Fuller, Murphy, and Anderson. They all head to the hotel for 
           a quick breakfast. Andrews is the last to step off, 
           leaving...
           INT. GENERAL - PASSENGER COACH - DAY

           Only his raiders and the McClintock road agent. Someone 
           COUGHS behind him. McClintock glances back at Dorsey, the 
           culprit, then at the others scattered guiltily throughout the 
           seats, his eyes resting on Pittinger directly behind him, 
           sweat fogging up his glasses. Something’s afoot.

           EXT. BIG SHANTY STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Andrews walks calmly but purposefully up the length of the 
           train, passing the first boxcar with the “BIBLES” crate and 
           the second holding the kegs of gunpowder/gold. He looks back 
           over his shoulder at the Lacy, where...

           EXT. LACY HOTEL - DAY

           Fuller and his crew clean off their greasy hands with soap 
           and water in a battered wash pan by the door.

           EXT. BIG SHANTY STATION - DAY

           Andrews walks up to the engine, checks the cab and finds it 
           empty. He looks ahead for the open switch. All clear.

           INT. GENERAL - PASSENGER COACH - DAY

           McClintock sees Andrews come on back down the platform. He 
           unholsters his gun, suspicion and concern building.

           EXT. BIG SHANTY STATION - DAY

           Continuing to survey the situation, Andrews clocks two rebel 
           pickets patrolling with muskets on the encampment side of the 
           tracks. He stops where the last boxcar car is coupled to the 
           mail and baggage car, itself coupled to the coaches that make 
           up the rest of the train and waits for the pickets to pass.

           INT. LACY HOTEL - DAY

           Fuller and his crew stands in the cafeteria line.

           EXT. BIG SHANTY STATION - DAY

           Andrews sees his opening and quickly uncouples the boxcar 
           from the mail and baggage car, effectively splitting the 
           train in two. It takes five seconds and nobody notices a 
           thing. Nobody except...

           INT. GENERAL - PASSENGER COACH - DAY

           McClintock leaps to his feet, gun barrel turned in 
           Pittinger’s face. The Derringer didn’t even get out of 
           Pittinger’s lap. Shadrach looks at Campbell to do something. 

                                 MCCLINTOCK
                        Who are ya and what are ya 
                        schemin’?

           Everyone is frozen. Everyone but Shadrach, who pounces on 
           McClintock’s back like a rapid dog and bites his hand bloody.  *
           The gun drops and McClintock rips at Shadrach, who hold him 
           in a vice grip. His oxygen cut off, the road agent finally 
           slumps like a ragdoll onto the aisle. A rush of adrenaline 
           surges through everyone as Shadrach jumps up. To Campbell: 

                                 SHADRACH
                        I thought you were a killer, not a 
                        post.

           Andrews hops back aboard and sees McClintock laid out.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Nice work.

                                 PITTINGER
                        You realize we’re outgunned here 10 
                        to 1.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Then this better not turn into a 
                        shootout. Let’s do this, raiders.

           EXT. BIG SHANTY STATION - DAY

           The 16 raiders hop off the passenger coach and herd up the 
           platform to the last open boxcar, where they begin to climb 
           in en masse as if this were nothing unusual. Andrews leads 
           Slavens and Buffum up to the engine...

           INT. LACY HOTEL - DAY

           Fuller and his crew finally sit down with their plates of hot 
           gravy and biscuits. Fuller glances at the platform, sees 
           nothing untoward.
           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - DAY

           Andrews, Slavens and Buffum take over the cab. They’re 
           surprised by Cain in the tender. He drops his breakfast.

                                 CAIN
                        What the--

                                 ANDREWS
                        We’re taking this train, my friend.

                                 CAIN
                        Hell you are.

           Cain drops his breakfast and grabs a stoker. Andrews draws 
           his pistol.

                                 ANDREWS
                        We’re on your side, boy. Union 
                        agents. Now put down that stoker 
                        and let us do our business.

                                 CAIN
                        Boy, huh? I’m loyal to men, not 
                        sides. And the man I’m loyal to, 
                        this engine is like our old lady. 
                        And I ain’t lettin’ nobody touch my 
                        old lady.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Have it your way.

           EXT. BIG SHANTY STATION - DAY

           Cain is thrown from the engine. He lands with thud on the 
           Camp McDonald side of the tracks. The pickets see this, as do 
           other rebels in camp. With a pull, jar and clang the General, 
           tender, and three box cars lurch forward out of the station.

           INT. BOXCAR - THE GENERAL - MOVING

           Shadrach pries open the “BIBLES” crate and hands out weapons 
           like candy on Christmas morning. Dorsey and Pittinger 
           exchange uneasy glances.

           INT. LACY HOTEL - DAY

           Fuller jumps up from his breakfast, shocked at what he sees: 
           Outside the General, tender and three boxcars are skipping 
           the station. Its two coaches and mail/baggage car just sit 
           there on the tracks, left behind.
           INT. PASSENGER COACH - THE GENERAL - DAY

           McClintock comes to on the aisle floor in one of the cars 
           left behind. He hears the rest of the train rumble off and 
           claws to his feet.

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - MOVING

           Buffum feeds wood into the firebox. Slavens presses the 
           throttle and they gain speed. Andrews holds his stove-pipe 
           hat, his eyes shining at Big Shanty falling away behind them.

           EXT. BIG SHANTY STATION - DAY

           Soldiers everywhere come running. Fuller sprints out from the 
           Lacy, sees Cain clutching his leg beside the tracks.

                                 FULLER
                        Mr. Cain? You okay? What happened?

                                 CAIN
                        Theys Union, Mr. Fuller. Three so 
                        far as I could tell.

           Fuller looks at the General building steam and starts running 
           after it down the tracks. The pickets eye Cain with 
           suspicion.

                                 PICKET GUARD
                        Your friends, eh?

           McClintock staggers from the passenger car onto the platform. 
           He sees everyone and their mother running after the train. 
           Fuck that. He looks for a horse.

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - MOVING

           The raiders look ready to celebrate. Pittinger peers out the 
           open door at Fuller racing after them, two dozen pissed off 
           rebels on his heels. Shadrach leans out, little man cocky.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Look at ‘em. Who they think they 
                        gonna catch?

           The trains shutters and starts losing momentum. CRACK! CRACK!  *
           Bullets start slamming into the boxcar. Everyone hits the 
           floor.
           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - MOVING

           Slavens scrambles at the controls.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Mr. Slavens -- why the hell aren’t 
                        we pulling away?

                                 SLAVENS
                        I don’t know. We need more steam. 
                        We need more steam!

           EXT. TRACKS NORTH OF BIG SHANTY - CONTINUOUS

           Still running and shooting, Fuller and the Big Shanty rebels 
           start to gain on the slowing General.

                                 BIG SHANTY REBEL
                        They ours now, boys!

           They give a rebel yell, reload, and blast away.

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - DAY

           Shots crack off the cab around them. Andrews blasts back. 
           Slavens is at a loss.

                                 SLAVENS
                        Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. 

           Buffum shoves him aside and whacks a lever with his elbow. 
           The steam pressure kicks up and the train bursts forward, now  *
           at full steam. They both look at Buffum with surprise.

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - MOVING

           The raiders, pinned down on the floorboards and braced for a 
           firefight, share a sigh of relief as the train picks up speed 
           again. Shadrach glances at Dorsey, who looks terrified.

                                 DORSEY
                        Are we there yet?

           Shadrach cackles like a maniac, loving this.

           EXT. TRACKS NORTH OF BIG SHANTY - CONTINUOUS

           Fuller, still running and oh so close watches the General 
           pick up steam and race away. He finally stops, panting and 
           dejected. The pursuing rebels let loose a last, futile volley 
           of shots at the fleeing train. Fuller turns to their captain.

                                 FULLER
                        You need to get someone on a horse 
                        back to Marietta quick as you can 
                        and telegraph the stations ahead.

                                 BIG SHANTY REBEL
                        And tell ‘em what?

                                 FULLER
                        The General has just been seized by 
                        Union agents who are drivin’ it 
                        north. And William Fuller, the 
                        train’s conductor, is in pursuit.

           The captain looks Fuller up and down, incredulous.

                                 BIG SHANTY REBEL
                        In pursuit? How are you in pursuit?

                                 FULLER
                        Any Goddamn way I can.

           Fuller races off up the tracks after the General. The captain 
           looks back to his men.

                                 BIG SHANTY REBEL
                        You heard the man. There’s a horse 
                        right over--

           He points to the HORSE, which McClintock is in the middle of 
           commandeering. He kicks his heels and the horse tears off 
           down the tracks for Marietta.

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - DAY

           The open countryside streaks by as the raiders whoop it up, 
           savoring their clean(ish) getaway. Dorsey vomits.

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - MOVING

           Andrews holds onto his hat, wind buffeting his face, elated. 

                                 ANDREWS
                        That’s how you steal a barnburner. 
                        Nice work, gentlemen!

           Buffum takes a long pull of whiskey and offers the bottle to 
           Slavens, who refuses.
                                 SLAVENS
                        How’d you know--

                                 BUFFUM
                        Close the damper? Can’t say I ever 
                        ran an engine before, but I have 
                        used a boiler to blow a shitload of 
                        ‘em up.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Blow ‘em up where?

                                 BUFFUM
                        Good ‘ol days back in bleedin’ 
                        Kansas.

                                 ANDREWS
                        You fought for the abolitionists? 

                                 BUFFUM
                        Only cuss who survived Harper’s 
                        ferry. There anything I love more 
                        than whiskey and William S. it’s 
                        blowin’ up slave lovin’ Christian 
                        hypocrites.

           Andrews is impressed. He take Buffum’s bottle and toasts him 
           with a swig of whiskey.

           Miriam pounds away from inside the closet. A female HOUSE 
           SLAVE enters, confused about where the sound is coming from.

                                 HOUSE SLAVE
                        Miss Miriam? Miss Miriam, is that 
                        you?

           She finds Miriam, still gagged and bound.

                        Oh my Lord!

                        Not a word of this to anyone, you 
                        understand?

           Miriam rushes up and sees that her RED SCARF IS GONE.

           EXT. HUNTSVILLE STATION, ALABAMA - DAY

           A city under occupation. General Mitchel mobilizes his troops 
           into boxcars, coaches, flatbeds, anything that can hold them. 
           It’s a massive rolling convoy. A subtitle appears:

                        “HUNTSVILLE, ALABAMA 
                        100 MILES WEST OF CHATTANOOGA”

           Arbuckle comes up.

                                 LIEUTENANT ARBUCKLE
                        Scouts say we’ll meet no resistance 
                        pushing as far as Stevenson 
                        Junction, just outside Chattanooga.

                                 MITCHEL
                        Good. It’s a beautiful sight, isn’t 
                        it Captain? An army on the move.

                                 LIEUTENANT ARBUCKLE
                        Yes, sir. Let’s hope Andrews is 
                        movin’ just the same.

                                 MITCHEL
                        Don’t worry. If he’s captured or 
                        killed we’ll hear at a telegraph up 
                        the line.

                        And if we hear nothing?

                                 MITCHEL
                        That means wires are being cut and 
                        the raiders are on their way.

           ...where the telegraph wire HAS BEEN CUT. The General idles 
           underneath, a gang of raiders prying up rail with shovels and 
           tossing them into the boxcars. Ahead, at the engine, Andrews 
           ties MIRIAM’S RED SCARF to the cowcatcher.
                                 BUFFUM
                        What is it? Mitchel‘s birthday or

                                 SLAVENS
                        Red flag means we’re running an 
                        emergency train. It’s a signal to

                        It’s part of our cover for passing 
                        through stations unscheduled. We’ll

                        Andrews! You’re not gonna believe 
                        this.

           Pittinger points to a man charging toward them up the tracks. 

           FULLER

           Andrews sees Shadrach draws his pistol and set his sights. 

                                 ANDREWS
                        Wait!

           Andrews swats Shadrach’s arm just in time. BLAM! They tussle 
           as Andrews relieves Shadrach of his weapon. Fuller keeps 
           coming.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Did you hear me say shoot?

                                 SHADRACH
                        He’s a rebel.

                                 ANDREWS
                        He’s one man. On foot. We’re 
                        sixteen with a train. You want him 
                        to know your serious, save your 
                        bullets for any real shit ahead. 
                           (shouting to everyone)
                        Okay, raiders. Let’s roll.

           Everyone piles in. Andrews turns back to Fuller, who 
           continues charging toward them, now only 20 yards away. He 
           raises the gunbarrel to Fuller’s chest, deadly serious. 
           Fuller pulls up, the two men now less than six feet apart. 
           Everything that needs to be said is said with that gun.

                                 FULLER
                        I’m not going stop.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Then we better keep good time.

           Andrews steps forward and swipes FULLER’S TIMEPIECE from his 
           waistcoat. 

           He waves ta-ta, then jumps back onto the General, which is 
           already pulling away. Fuller can do nothing with Shadrach and 
           six other guns trained on him from the boxcar, just itching 
           for a shot. When they shut the door...

           Fuller AGAIN TAKES OFF AFTER IT, closing ground only to watch 
           the train pull away out of sight. He pulls up screaming in 
           frustration and gasping for air. Between his legs he spots...

           A POLE CART COMING UP THE TRACKS

           Manned by Murphy and Anderson. They wave and shout.

                                 MURPHY
                        Look at what we found at Boone’s 
                        Station!

           Fuller is so Goddamn happy he could cry.

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - MOVING

           Buffum sprinkles oil into the fire. Slavens holds her steady. 
           They approach a small hamlet sprung around the Etonah Mining 
           & Manufacturing Company. An old, rinky-dink workhorse switch 
           engine sits on the spur with a cart load of coal. This is the 
           YONAH. Again, a subtitle:

                        “ETONAH STATION
                        95 MILES TO CHATTANOOGA”

           They see the engine and look to Andrews with concern.

                                 SLAVENS
                        I thought we weren’t suppose to see 
                        any trains ‘til Kingston?

                                 ANDREWS
                        We weren’t.
                                 BUFFUM
                        So let’s stop and blow it.

           Slavens rolls his eyes.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I don’t wanna risk a skirmish and 
                        break appearances. We play our 
                        cards right we’ll roll into 
                        Chattanooga without another shot 
                        fired.

           EXT. ETONAH STATION - DAY

           The General thunders past the brick platform and the dismayed 
           faces of passengers looking out for the usual train, the 
           Yonah left in its dust.

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - MOVING

           The raiders sit rocking in the dark of the buttoned up 
           boxcar. Campbell peeks out a crack at the world speeding by. 
           Pittinger jots notes in a notebook. Shadrach rummages through 
           the trunks of freight and pulls out a FRENCH VASE.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Wha’cha think someone could get for 
                        this?

                                 PITTINGER
                        Put it down, private. We’re 
                        patriots, not thieves.

           Shadrach pitches it to the floor, shattering. 

                                 SHADRACH
                        Some of us even murderers.

           Campbell lunges at Shadrach, scattering a game of gin rummy, 
           and chases him around the car. He almost has him collared 
           when Shadrach draws his guns.

                                 SHADRACH (CONT’D)
                        What’cha so upset about? I’d wear 
                        that shit around like a badge of 
                        honor.

           By Campbell’s look, that’s the last way he carries it around.  *
           He retreats back to his corner like a big wounded bear.
                                 SHADRACH (CONT’D)
                        Guess the big man don’t like 
                        badges.

                                 DORSEY
                        Leave him alone, Shadrach.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Why? I’m starving. And from what I 
                        tasted about what went down in 
                        Louisville Campbell there’s got 
                        beans. I wanna dig in. So come on, 
                        spill ‘em. Spill your beans. 

           Campbell looks from Shadrach to all the others, all 
           interested in his legend, Pittinger much as anyone.

                                 PITTINGER
                        I will say, Mr. Campbell, we might 
                        all meet our maker today. Be nice 
                        to know who we’re travelling with.

           Campbell eyes burn.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You think one story, ‘bout one 
                        mistake, tells you anything ‘bout 
                        me? I killed one man, not four, but 
                        I ain’t no killer. I ran, but I 
                        ain’t no a coward. I’ll accept my 
                        punishment but I’ll do it on my own 
                        terms. That’s all you need to know. 
                        Now go take that little diary of 
                        yours and stick it up your shitter.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Well ain’t that a cock tease. 
                        Diary, huh?

           He swipes the notebook out of Pittinger’s hands.

                                 PITTINGER
                        Hey! Give that back.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Or what? Stab me with your pencil? 
                        I just wanna see if I’m famous.

           He thumbs through it. MASON (31) Shadrach’s sycophant, 
           laughs. He hands the notebook to Dorsey.

                                 SHADRACH (CONT’D)
                        Dorsey, why don’t you read us some 
                        nuggets.
                                 PITTINGER
                        What, can’t read yourself?

                                 SHADRACH
                        Maybe I like to listen and 
                        visualize what I’m hearin’.

           He snaps at Dorsey to start reading.

                                 DORSEY
                        Right then--
                           (reading)
                        There are many breeds of character 
                        among the raiders. Farmer, clerk, 
                        cobbler. One such man, Mr. 
                        Dorsey...
                           (beat)
                        Is a bumbling type, fragile in 
                        spirit, and always teased by the 
                        others. He doesn’t carry himself 
                        like much of a soldier but then 
                        again not many of us do. I wonder 
                        who among us will step up when we 
                        face the gauntlet.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Well I guess we know who won’t?

           Shadrach cackles, snatching the notebook back. Mason cackles 
           with him. He fobs it off Pittinger, who looks mortified. 
           Dorsey just looks to his boots, embarrassed.

           Miriam, now dressed, hurries past the hotel to the station. 
           She clocks two panicked men who rush past the other way, 
           still in THEIR STOCKINGED FEET -- Parrott and Wollam. 

           Rounding the corner onto the platform Miriam finds it buzzing 
           with chaos and confusion, passengers and soldiers gathered 
           around the STATION MASTER who makes an announcement.

                                 STATION MASTER
                        ...again, ladies and gents, due to 
                        an unexpected, uh, “situation” up 
                        the line, there will be no 
                        passenger service north for the 
                        rest of the day. The Western & 
                        Atlantic Railroad apologizes for 
                        your inconvenience.
           Miriam looks to the TELEGRAPH WINDOW, a horse roped outside. 
           Inside, the OPERATOR furiously clicks out messages, a 
           fearsome man with a mustache standing over him...

                        to do it in person.

           McClintock looks up and sees MIRIAM RUSHING OFF. He knows 
           instantly there’s only one reason she should be there.

           THE FRONT DESK CLERK

           From the Fletcher comes running up and raps on the window.

           EXT. CASS WOOD & WATER STATION - DAY

           The General refuels under a water tower. Slavens draws down 
           the spigot and begins to fill the tender. A subtile reads:

                        “CASS WOOD & WATER STATION 
                        86 MILES TO CHATTANOOGA”

           Andrews hands the STATION TENDER a refueling ticket. The 
           station tender eyes Buffum, who grabs cords of wood.

                        Like I said. We’re in a hurry.

                                 CASS STATION TENDER
                        I see that. Where’s Mr. Fuller?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Who’s Mr. Fuller?

                                 CASS STATION TENDER
                        That there’s the General. They got 
                        plenty ‘a rigs down in Atlanta, 
                        curious they should give you his 
                        favorite.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Yes, well, the Confederate High 
                        Command doesn’t need to run its 
                        missions by railroad employees.

                                 CASS STATION TENDER
                           (eyes narrowing)
                        Maybe not, but if this particular 
                        employee wants to keep his job, he 
                        better know what’s runnin’ through 
                        his station.

           Slavens and Buffum swap looks. The station tender goes to the 
           first boxcar.

                                 CASS STATION TENDER (CONT’D)
                        Open this door please.

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - STOPPED

           The raiders keep still in the dark, listening in. Shadrach 
           ever so quietly cocks his pistol.

           EXT. CASS WOOD & WATER STATION - DAY

                                 CASS STATION TENDER
                        Well? You gonna open her or am I?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Be my guest.
           The station tender throws open the boxcar door. Empty. He 
           looks back to Andrews, not satisfied. He steps down to the 
           second boxcar and flings that door open too. Inside are the 
           ink blot raven stamped kegs of gunpowder.

                                 CASS STATION TENDER
                        Gunpowder, huh?

                                 ANDREWS
                        What did I say?

           The station tender looks to the last boxcar, then back to 
           Andrews, unreadable. Still uneasy the tender steps up and 
           throws open the last door, surprised to see:

           14 ARMED MEN CROUCHED IN THE DARK

           BLAM! Shadrach shoots the tender in the face. He drops like a 
           sack of dirt. Andrews stalks up to the boxcar.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Alright, who shot the bastard?

           Pittinger points a thumb at Shadrach.

                                 PITTINGER
                        Who do you think?

                                 SHADRACH
                        Woo-hoo! Bagged my first Johnny-
                        Reb!

           Andrews looks down at the corpse then to Shadrach, not happy.

           CRACK! A rifle shot splinters the side of the boxcar just 
           missing him. Andrews rolls under the carriage on the tracks, 
           no idea where the fire is coming from.

           CRACK! One of the raiders is tagged. Shadrach and Dorsey duck 
           for cover inside the boxcar. Campbell drags the wounded man 
           away from the door. Pittinger flings it shut.

           CRACK! Aimed somewhere else. Andrews see Slavens smack the 
           ground a few cars ahead. He groans, begins to crawl.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Slavens!

           CRACK! A second shot ends him.

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - CONTINUOUS

           Pittinger pumps his rifle and throws open the door.
                                 PITTINGER
                        For Christ sake, cover the man!

           The raiders shoot blindly into the woods.

           EXT. CASS WOOD & WATER STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Andrews gets his feet and dashes out into the open, covering 
           the forty or so yards to the STATION TENDER’S SHACK -- diving 
           in. There, through a sooty window pane he sees:

           An 8-YEAR-OLD BOY with a Davy Crocket musket, positioned in 
           the woods. The boy sees him and shoots.

           The whole window blows out. By the time Andrews is reassured 
           he still has a head the boy is running off into the woods. 
           Andrews takes chase...

           EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           The boy runs like a jackrabbit, lugging a musket long as he 
           is tall. Andrews, right on his heels, has his pistol out but 
           can’t bring himself to shoot...

           The boy finally trips up on his own gun and goes tumbling. 
           Andrews has him. The boy tries to whack him away with the 
           musket but Andrews catches it, grabs it away, and throws the 
           struggling boy over his shoulder.

           EXT. TRACKS SOUTH OF ETONAH STATION - DAY

           Fuller, Murphy and Anderson roll down on the pole cart. They 
           spot the belched smoke of a locomotive over the treetops.

                                 MURPHY
                        You think that’s them?

                                 FULLER
                        I don’t.

           Fuller breaks a huge smile as the Yonah comes into view.

                                 FULLER (CONT’D)
                        I think that’s our new ride.
           EXT. CASS WOOD & WATER STATION - DAY

           The station BURNS. Campbell, Pittinger, and others heave 
           ripped up rail into a boxcar, the track again sabotaged. 
           Andrews returns with the boy still worming in his arms.

                                 PITTINGER
                        The sniper?

           He glares at Shadrach.

                                 SHADRACH
                        What?

                                 ANDREWS
                        You-- big man.

           He turns to Campbell, entrusting him with the boy.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Put him in the boxcar and keep him 
                        quiet.

           Campbell cradles the kid like he’s holding a live grenade. 
           Andrews checks in on the second boxcar, and the gunpowder, 
           and the gold.

                                 DORSEY
                        What about Mr. Slavens?

           Andrews glances at the body beside the tracks.

                                 ANDREWS
                        He stays here.

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - CONTINUOUS

           Buffum stares at the controls. He looks to his bottle of 
           whiskey then back to the controls then back to the bottle. He 
           takes one last long sweet pull.

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - CONTINUOUS

           The raiders mount up.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Okay, raiders, I don’t want any 
                        more trouble passing through 
                        stations. We need a proper brakeman 
                        riding up top. Any takers?
                                 SHADRACH
                        What about the writer? He likes 
                        bein’ above it all.

           Everyone looks to Pittinger, Dorsey included. They’d be glad 
           to see him go.

                                 PITTINGER
                        They were just impressions, Mr. 
                        Dorsey. I didn’t mean anything by 
                        it.

                                 ANDREWS
                        By what?

                                 PITTINGER
                        Nothing. What do you need me to do?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Just look southern and try not to 
                        break your neck. Let’s roll.

           They jump off, shutting the rest of the raiders in the dark 
           of the boxcar.

           EXT. CASS WOOD & WATER STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Walking to the engine Andrews sees Buffum’s whiskey bottle 
           pitched out and shatter.

           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - CONTINUOUS

           Andrews finds Buffum splashing water on his face and 
           familiarizing himself with the controls.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Think you can handle it?

                                 BUFFUM
                        I’ll try not to blow this one up.

           He pulls a lever and the engine shutters forward.

           EXT. GENERAL - ROOF - DAY

           Pittinger climbs to his perch atop the raiders boxcar as they 
           pull away, two corpses and an embering station left behind.

           McClintock, the sheriff and three deputies unwrap Cole from 
           the blood-matted bedding, his body dumped in the bathtub. 
           They turn to the clerk.

                                 SHERIFF
                        You say a whole gang of men you 
                        never seen before bunked here last 
                        night?

           The clerk nods.

                                 CLERK
                        Same ones boarded the train. Two 
                        overslept.

           Casing the room, McClintock finds something wedged between 
           the floorboards. HIS CARD with the ink blot raven.

           The train barrels ahead. Buffum, behind the controls, looks 
           like he’s getting the hang of it. Andrews checks his recon 
           log, then Fuller’s timepiece.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Not bad for a washed up old 
                        radical.

           of a junction station approaching. Welcome to...

           EXT. KINGSTON STATION - DAY

           Crawling with railroadmen and clogged with rail traffic. A 
           passenger train, the William R. Smith, idles on a spur headed 
           toward Rome, Georgia. A long southbound freight does the same 
           on one of four sidings. The General eases onto an open siding 
           that passes right in front of a stone depot. Subtitle:

           Buffum gets a lay of the land. In an open field directly in

           EXT. KINGSTON STATION - DAY

           Andrews hops from the engine and struts up to a group of 
           railroad men milling around some barrels chewing tobacco.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Mornin’, gentlemen. Know where I 
                        can find the stationmaster?

           A crusty, old SWITCHMAN nods to a dandy over by the depot.

                                 SWITCHMAN
                        That’s him. Stephens.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Thanks.

           The switchman spits and watches Andrews walk off toward 
           STEPHENS.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Stephens.

                        This the ten o’clock? I don’t see 
                        any passenger cars?

                                 ANDREWS
                        The regular train is due behind us. 
                        We’re on a special mission runnin’ 
                        ammunition up to Colonel

                        Ammunition?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Enough gunpowder to blow this 
                        entire station to kingdom come.

           Stephens looks to the boxcars and frowns.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Now I’m sure both of us want to get 
                        this train outta here so if you 
                        could just direct the switchman 
                        with the key to our siding to let 
                        us loose.
                                 STEPHENS
                        You just spoke to him.

           He points back to the crusty switchman.

                                 STEPHENS (CONT’D)
                        But I can’t let you go just yet.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Why not?

                                 STEPHENS
                        A freight coming down the line 
                        hasn’t arrived yet. You’ll have to 
                        wait for it to pass.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Isn’t that the scheduled southbound 
                        right there?

                                 STEPHENS
                        Yes, but there’s another, 
                        unscheduled train. Seems Mitchel 
                        marching on Huntsville has the 
                        whole world scrambling up and down 
                        this line. You included.

           Andrews tries to remain calm.

                                 ANDREWS
                        How long you think it’ll be?

                                 STEPHENS
                        No more than 15, 20 minutes. Come 
                        inside for a coffee.

           Andrews surveys their predicament: the rail traffic, the 
           glaring railroad men, the baseball playing militia, the 
           impatient passengers. They’re sitting ducks. Why not.

           The crusty switchman eyes the General with mounting 
           suspicion. He sees Buffum looking at him. He nods. Buffum 
           nods back. Something’s not right.

                                 FULLER
                        Woah! Woah! Woah! Hold up.

           They grind to a stop just short of a gap in the sabotaged 
           track, right in front of the smoldering remains of...

           EXT. CASS WOOD & WATER STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Fuller jumps off and kneels down next to the dead station 
           tender, a hole in his face. He scopes around the station.

                                 FULLER
                        Eli? You here, son?

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR- DAY

           The raiders huddle there, quiet as mice. ELI, the kid, bites 
           Campbell’s hand and he lets go. Shadrach is right there with 
           a knife to the boy’s throat.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Squeal and I’ll stick ya like a 
                        pig.

           The boy pisses himself. Campbell takes Eli back into his 
           protective fold, gagging him.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You do, I’ll rip out your throat.

           Shadrach stays coiled there, knife up. They face off for a 
           moment: the gentle giant and the sociopath. Shadrach can’t 
           conceal his amusement.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Now them’s the words of a proper 
                        killer.
           INT. DEPOT - KINGSTON STATION - DAY

           Andrews sips coffee in the stationmaster’s office with 
           Stephens and another big man, WILEY HARBIN, engineer of 
           William R. Smith. Harbin checks his timepiece.

                                 HARBIN
                        When you say Fuller’s usual train 
                        was arrivin’ behind you?

                                 STEPHENS
                        Mr. Harbin here runs the connecting 
                        train down from Rome. He’s a 
                        stickler for schedule.

                                 ANDREWS
                           (to Harbin)
                        I didn’t. But I’m sure it’ll come 
                        along soon.

           Harbin is skeptical.

                                 STEPHENS
                        By the way, you happen to see if 
                        any branches might ‘a blown down 
                        and snapped some wires on the 
                        telegraph?

           He gestures to the TELEGRAPH OFFICE next door.

                                 STEPHENS (CONT’D)
                        We haven’t received a message 
                        coming up from Atlanta all morning.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Frankly, Mr. Stephens, the only 
                        thing I’m concentrating on is 
                        delivering Leadbetter his 
                        ammunition.

                                 HARBIN
                        Lil’ strange they wouldn’t 
                        telegraph ahead ‘bout it.

           Andrews, unflappable.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Not if you consider there are spies 
                        among the railroad men.

                                 HARBIN
                        Spies?
           An approaching train’s steam whistle blows. They all look out 
           the window where the second freight pulls into the station. 
           The CATOOSA.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Time to go.

                                 STEPHENS
                        Not just yet I’m afraid.

           Harbin points to a red handkerchief tied to the last flatbed.

                                 HARBIN
                        Looks like there’s a second 
                        unscheduled train comin’ up behind.

           EXT. GENERAL - ROOF - DAY

           Pittinger sketches the layout of the station in his notebook 
           as the Catoosa draws onto yet another siding. The woosh of 
           smoke causes him to fumble his notebook down onto the side of 
           the tracks. Shit. He’s about to climb down when...

                                 RAILROAD MAN
                        I got it, friend.

           A RAILROAD MAN WALKING BY picks up the open notebook. He 
           closes it without looking and hands it back up to Pittinger.

                                 RAILROAD MAN (CONT’D)
                        Lord knows what a pain in the ass 
                        it is to shimmy up and down ‘em 
                        cars all day.

                                 PITTINGER
                        Much obliged.

           The railroad man walks off to the waiting freight train and 
           climbs onto it’s last boxcar, also a brakeman. He waves to 
           Pittinger from his perch. Pittinger waves back.

           EXT. CASS WOOD & WATER STATION - DAY

           Fuller, Murphy and Anderson carefully pry up a section of 
           rail from behind the Yonah and lug it to the gap in the 
           tracks.

                                 MURPHY
                        You ever done this before?
                                 FULLER
                        Mr. Murphy, there’s not much of 
                        anything this morning I’ve done 
                        before.

           They insert the rail in the gap.

       A113
           INT. CONFEDERATE ENCAMPMENT - CHATTANOOGA - DAY
                                                                  A113

           Young Wood’s new regiment stands at attention. Colonel 
           Leadbetter paces before them, a telegraph in hand.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Do you boys know why we refuse to 
                        hand out medals in the Confederate 
                        army? It’s because we are all, each 
                        and every one of us, heroes of the 
                        Southern cause. It would be wrong 
                        to single out one man from any 
                        other.

           He comes up to Llewellyn, who stands naked on a barrel, arms 
           shackled behind him, the word “DESERTER” carved in his chest.

                                 LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
                        That is unless that man wasn’t one 
                        of us at all, but an imposter. A 
                        pretender. A snake. In that case he 
                        gets to be a shining star, the one 
                        everyone talks about, the center of 
                        all our attention.

           The ranks laugh. All but Wood. This is not lost on 
           Leadbetter. He steps up to Wood.

                                 LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
                        You’re his friend, are you?

                                 WOOD
                        Just... just traveling together, 
                        sir.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Well then you won’t mind doing the 
                        honor.

           He hands him a revolver. Wood looks up, horrified. Leadbetter 
           drags him over to Llewellyn.

                                 WOOD
                        I don’t--
                                 LEADBETTER
                        It’s simple son. Deserters we just 
                        shoot. But black snake bridge 
                        burning spies, they we wanna talk 
                        to.

           He nods to Vickers who comes over with a SACK OF SNAKES. They 
           mean to cinch it over Llewellyn’s head.

                                 LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
                        Now-- Hunstville is sacked. General 
                        Mitchel’s army is on the move. And 
                        you two newbies got the stink of 
                        spies on you. You have one shot to 
                        convince me otherwise.

           Wood looks at the thrashing sack of snakes, then Llewellyn, 
           who nods for him to do it.

           Wood lifts the revolver, looks away, and... 

           BLAM!

           Llewellyn blows back from the barrel and smacks down in the 
           mud, dead. Wood, refusing to look, is sick. 

           Leadbetter snatches the gun back and forces Wood to look at 
           his companion, blood oozing from his chest.

                                 LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
                        That’s what a deserter looks like. 
                        Just be grateful he wasn’t a spy.

           EXT. KINGSTON STATION - DAY

           The crusty switchman strolls up to the General’s engine. 
           Buffum sits in the cab, tapping The Tempest against his knee,  *

                        Baldwin. 4-4-0. Mighty fine.
                                 BUFFUM
                        Mighty fine indeed.

                                 SWITCHMAN
                        Only this one here’s a Rogers.

                        Right. Of course.

           Buffum knows he’s just fucked up. The switchman knows it too. 
           He smiles and moseys off, strolling down THE LENGTH OF THE 
           TRAIN, eying each boxcar as he goes. He stops outside the 
           last boxcar, sensing...

           The raiders, just inside. They dare not move or breathe. 
           Campbell has a lock on Eli, gagged and terrified.

           Something catches the switchman’s eye, something around the 
           boxcar doors:

           BULLET GASHES

           He works his finger in one of the gashes. The splintering is 
           fresh. 

           A COUGH

           The switchman stops, certain what he just heard came from 
           inside.

           The switchman looks up at Pittinger, both men knowing the jig

           Andrews sees the smoke of what can only be the switch engine 
           they passed puffing over the treetops. Shit.

           Andrews strides up to the switchman, Stephens on his heels. 
           The switchman blocks his office door, gun in his waistband.
                                 ANDREWS

           Dorsey looks to Campbell, who keeps Eli restrained in his 
           arms. Shadrach loads a revolver and slaps it in Dorsey’s 
           hand.

           Pittinger watches THE TEXAS roll in on the southbound track, 
           its boxcars and flatbeds loaded to the hilt with artillery 
           and Confederate soldiers. It just gets better and better.

           Andrews steps over the groaning switchman and looks for the 
           correct switch key.

                                 STEPHENS
                        This is highly irregular, sir!

           EXT. TEXAS - FLATBED - CONTINUOUS

           A rebel on the train sees the commotion around the 
           switchman’s office. He looks to his commander, who flips 
           through Voltaire next to a CANVAS COVERED GATLING GUN.

                                 REBEL
                        Uh, Captain? I think something’s 
                        stirrin’ by the depot.

           It’s none other than Captain Whitsitt from the hospital.

           INT. YONAH - DAY

           Fuller jumps off behind the William R. Smith. Harbin lopes 
           up, recognizing his colleagues.

           The raiders wait in the dark -- sweating, scared, tense. Out 
           the crack Shadrach sees Whitsitt and five rebels jump off the 
           Texas. They bee-line it to...

                        This has gone far enough.

           Stephens looks down at a revolver pointed at his belly.

           Andrews turns. He can’t fucking believe it. Whitsitt.

           Fuller leads a posse of angry railroad men across the yard. 
           Buffum’s seen enough. He flings open the boxcar door.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Showtime, boys.

           Shadrach thrusts two rifles into Buffum’s hands and a dozen 
           raiders spill out guns blazing...

           The raiders QUICKLY WASTE THE REBELS around Whitsitt, who 
           drops low and fires back...

           Fuller and Murphy find cover behind the cab of Texas, bullets 
           whizzing by...

           Pittinger sees Andrews disappear into the depot after 
           Whitsitt and jumps down off the boxcar...

           He takes off around the backside of the depot...

           INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE - DEPOT - CONTINUOUS

           Captain Whitsitt rushes in, and oddly, shuts the blinds. He 
           finds the telegraph operator cowering under a table:

                                 CAPTAIN WHITSITT
                        We need to send out alarm.

           CRASH! 
           A piece of luggage shatters through the window. Andrews jumps 
           in behind it, SHOOTS WHITSITT, then turns his gun on the 
           operator, frozen at the telegraph. Whitsitt, wounded but 
           alive, HURLS THE LUGGAGE back at Andrews, deflecting the kill 
           shot. The two men grapple with each other, going hand to hand 
           as the operator tries to somehow reach the telegraph...

           Pittinger turns the corner and is WHACKED IN THE CHEST with a

           BLAM! The Texas’ engineer flops down in front of Fuller, shot

           Shadrach drags Dorsey, bleeding but alive, back toward the 
           General, the raiders giving cover fire...

           The rebels finally get the Gatling going on the Texas and 
           begin to strafe the raiders in the open yard...

           ONE, TWO, THREE raiders are wasted, the rest running for 
           cover and hitting the deck behind the General’s chassis...

           Buffum dives into the cab but can’t stoke the engine, the 
           gatling’s hot torrent of lead pinning him down...

           The rebels rip down the length of the General with the 
           gatling, the momentum of the fire-fight reset...

           Campbell hits the deck, his body a shield for the boy as the 
           gatling shreds the boxcar around him. As the lethal spray 
           swings back down the length of the train he sees... 

           A STONE WELL FOR COVER

           INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE - DEPOT - CONTINUOUS

           Andrews and Whitsitt thrash about, grappling over control of 
           the gun. The operator gets to his desk -- BLAM! A bullet ends 
           him just before he can tap anything out. Whitsitt flings 
           Andrews off, raises the pistol, and HAS HIM DEAD TO RIGHTS...

           BLAM!
           Pittinger wastes Whitsitt from behind. Andrews nods, 
           grateful.

           EXT. KINGSTON STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Shadrach, Dorsey and the surviving raiders continue to be

           A dozen of the Texas’ rebels use this cover to advance upon 
           the raider’s position across the open yard...

           Campbell sees the deadly gatling swing back his way. 
           Shielding Eli, he scrambles out of the boxcar to the WELL...

           Almost there, Campbell gets tagged in the back by two 
           militiamen. He collapses to safety behind the stone wall, 
           looks back and wastes the two rebels. Looking back to Eli he 
           finds...

           THE BOY IS DEAD

           The slug that ripped through Campbell has ripped through the 
           boy, their mingled blood between them. Campbell pulls down 
           the gag, heartbroken and enraged.

           EXT. KINGSTON STATION - DAY

           Campbell looks back and also sees the train roll, the focus 
           of rebel fire going with it. This reveals... 

           A CLEAR LINE TO THE GATLING, which the rebels are still 
           trying to unjam... 

           Something in Campbell snaps. He lays Eli to rest and pulls 
           out two shotguns strapped to his back. People think he’s a 
           killer, then he’ll give ‘em what they want.

           EXT. KINGSTON STATION - DAY

           Andrews and Pittinger race out of the depot as Campbell bee-

           The General idles just north of a horseshoe shaped tunnel 
           carved into the side of a hill, the rain continuing to fall. 
           Andrews, Shadrach and Pittinger sprint from the mouth 
           unspooling a wire. Buffum ties it to a detonation box, they 
           all crouch down behind the tracks and Andrews throws the 
           plunger. Nothing.

                                 ANDREWS
                           (to Shadrach)
                        Shit. Go check what’s wrong.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Go your damn self.

           No time to argue. Andrews runs back to the tunnel, its walls 
           strapped with bricks of dynamite. He checks the fuses. 

           SOAKED 

           The rails start to vibrate around him. Someone’s coming.

           EXT. TUNNEL HILL - CONTINUOUS

           Andrews runs back up. A train whistle blows in the distance.

                                 PITTINGER
                        They sure didn’t waste any time did 
                        they.
                                 ANDREWS
                        The fuses are soaked.

                                 SHADRACH
                        What about them gunpowder kegs?

                                 ANDREWS
                        No! Not enough time. The sticks 
                        will blow if we can just keep ‘em 
                        lit.

           A weak voice rasps from the boxcar.

                                 DORSEY (O.C.)
                        I’ll do it.

           All eyes turn to Dorsey, more blood on him than in him.

                                 DORSEY (CONT’D)
                        You need someone right up against 
                        it. I can’t do much, but I can do 
                        that.

           Andrews looks back to the tunnel, their pursuers’ smoke now 
           visible over the hill. He turns to his raiders. All but 
           Pittinger look away. They carry Dorsey over to the tunnel.

           INT. TEXAS - MOVING

           Fuller barrels up the tracks in reverse, pushing a tender, 
           loaded up with a gang of rebels out for blood. Murphy pilots 
           the train while Anderson feeds the firebox. Tunnel’s ahead.

                                 FULLER
                        More steam, Mr. Murphy. I’m not 
                        losing sight of them again.

                                 MURPHY
                        What if they try to blow it?

           Fuller pushes Murphy off the throttle and lays on it harder. 
           Anderson glances back at the WILLIAM R. SMITH, following.

           INT. WILLIAM R. SMITH - MOVING

           Stephens commands the engine, keeping pace, the passenger 
           cars filled with every last armed man from Kingston.
           EXT. TUNNEL HILL - CONTINUOUS

           Dorsey lies in a bed of dynamite. Andrews adds short fuses 
           everywhere. Pittinger rolls a cigarette and lights it.

                                 ANDREWS
                        You sure about this?

                                 DORSEY
                        No one back home thought I’d 
                        survive this war anyway. Or if I 
                        did, it’d only be cuz I bumbled 
                        through. Guess they weren’t wrong.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Bullshit. You’re about to give ‘em 
                        something new to think about.

                                 DORSEY
                           (grimacing in pain)
                        What’s that?

           Andrews grabs the smoke from Pittinger and sticks it between 
           Dorsey’s lips.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Whether they’ll ever do anything 
                        half as brave as what you’re doing 
                        right here and now.

           Dorsey eeks out a proud, toothy, blood smeared smile. He 
           looks to Pittinger.

                                 DORSEY
                        Just make sure the real story gets 
                        out, okay?

           Pittinger nods, acknowledging how wrong he was. They squeeze 
           hands and Andrews and Pittinger run off. Dorsey takes a long 
           last drag, then lights the short fuse with the cigarette.

           INT. TEXAS - MOVING

           They’re almost to the horseshoe shaped tunnel. Murphy looks 
           to Anderson and they both brace themselves. Fuller stampedes

           Dorsey, fading, sees the lit fuse spittle out as the Texas 
           barrels toward him. The whole tunnel shakes... 

           INT. WILLIAM R. SMITH - MOVING 

           The Kingston rebels ready their rifles, no clue about what’s 
           happening ahead. Stephens drives them into the tunnel...

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - MOVING

           Andrews, Pittinger, and the rest look back, holding their

                        C’mon Mr. Dorsey. Do it! Do it!

           They race around a bend and the tunnel vanishes from view, 
           still intact. Shadrach snorts at Pittinger. Of course.

           EXT. TUNNEL HILL - CONTINUOUS

           Dorsey desperately tries to re-light the little nub of fuse, 
           the Texas almost on top of him. Success! The fuse sizzles...

           Fuller and company whoosh past, almost to daylight, almost

           BOOM! 

           EXT. TUNNEL HILL - CONTINUOUS

           The Texas shoots out the other side as the tunnel and 
           mountainside BLOWS TO SMITHEREENS! The William R. Smith is 
           buried in a spectacular avalanche of rocky debris. 

           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - MOVING

           The raiders cheer the plume of dust rising over the treetops. 
           Andrews is ecstatic. Everyone celebrates until Pittinger sees
                                 PITTINGER
                        Look!

           SMOKE FROM A LOCOMOTIVE CHUGS AFTER THEM as the blast cloud

           INT. TEXAS - MOVING

           Fuller hurtles them ahead, Ahab in his eyes. Murphy and 
           Anderson glance back at the blown tunnel, now just rubble.

           Vickers stands at attention as Leadbetter paces anxiously in 
           front of his big map.

                        Still no reply from Atlanta about

           Leadbetter studies the map.

                        Something’s afoot, Lieutenant. I

                        Just do it.

           Vickers goes. Leadbetter looks to a PHOTO OF HE AND MIRIAM on 
           the wall there, posing at the soiree from the opening. 
           Leadbetter notices, maybe for the first time, Miriam gazes at 
           someone off camera. He stares at it, a sinking feeling.
           INT. GENERAL - BOXCAR - MOVING

           The countryside speeds by with smoke and embers, cargo being 
           thrown out the door. The boxcar is a hive of activity. 
           Shadrach and two others punch a hole between the walls of the 
           last and middle boxcars. Andrews barks orders to everyone.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Okay, raiders! We get one shot at 
                        this. Toss everything we need in 
                        that second boxcar and everything 
                        we don’t out the door.

                        Them too. Everything but the rail 
                        ties. You, gimme that shotgun.

           A shotgun is tossed over and Andrews turns it on the back 
           wall BLASTING THREE FOUR BUCK SHOTS to create a hole.

           THE TEXAS CAN BE SEEN RACING UP BEHIND

           Fuller can see the raiders scrambling by the hole. The rebels 
           on the tender open fire. They’re lighter, faster, and closing 
           ground quickly.

           Raiders return gunfire as Andrews, Shadrach and others start 
           heaving out rail ties onto the track in an attempt to derail 
           Fuller’s train. The ties bounce up and smack the tender, or 
           are sawed in half by the wheels, the Texas still coming.

           Fuller watches as more rail ties are tossed out, one bouncing 
           over the lip of the tender and smacking a rebel off the 
           moving train. He’s unfazed, his hand steeled on the throttle.

           They hustle through the hole over the gap between the tracks 
           swapping fire with the rebels coming up behind.

           THE TEXAS’ TENDER SLAMS INTO THE BACK OF THE GENERAL 

           A second raider SLIPS TO HIS DEATH between moving cars. 

           The two trains are now abutted up against each other, that 
           last boxcar a shooting gallery as the rebels swarm into it.

           The raiders fend them off from the boxcar with all the kegs 
           of gunpowder. Andrews looks to Pittinger, who holds a rope.

           Pittinger PULLS OUT THE PIN between them and the last boxcar, 
           separating it from the General. BLAM! Another raider takes a 
           bullet defending him. Andrews lights a stick of dynamite and 
           drops it onto the tracks between the cars.

           The last boxcar is BLOWN OFF THE TRACKS and topples over onto

                                 MIRIAM
                        Jesus, do you two know anything?
                                 PARROTT
                        Well, I do know the good Lord--

           She grabs his bible and tosses it out the window. Parrott 
           gasps.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Shut up. If you’re the caliber of 
                        men Andrews has to pull this caper 
                        off I’m starting not to like his 
                        chances. Which means the wrong man 
                        might be waiting for me in 
                        Chattanooga. 
                           (to the coachman)
                        Stop the coach.

           It stops and Miriam opens the door for them to get out.

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        Out.

                                 PARROTT
                        Wait. Please. Reconsider--

                                 MIRIAM
                        What? You got no shoes and don’t 
                        know shit.

           Wollam clocks something out the window over her shoulder.

                                 WOLLAM
                        True. But we can shoot straight.

                                 PARROTT
                        Enough.

                                 MIRIAM
                        What are you talking about?

           They both point behind them. Miriam looks back and sees DUST 
           KICKED UP down the road behind them, FOUR MEN ON HORSEBACK 
           bearing down. McClintock, the sherrif, and three deputies.

           Andrews finds himself surrounded by Shadrach, Mason, and a 
           third surviving raider, all pissed. Pittinger opens keg after 
           keg, each one packed with gold.
                                 PITTINGER
                        They’re all the same.

                                 ANDREWS
                        I really don’t see what the fuss is 
                        about? I told you men there would 
                        be parts of this mission you 
                        weren’t privy to.

                                 SHADRACH
                        What -- like we were robbing a 
                        Confederate bank?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Hey, least you know you’ll be well 
                        compensated.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Oh, I got no doubt about that.

           Shadrach sticks a pistol in Andrews face.

                                 PITTINGER
                        Shadrach, what are you doing?

                                 SHADRACH
                        What do you think? I’m relieving 
                        our commander here of his post. 
                        Along with the gold.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Stand down, private. This is 
                        treason.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Treason he says? Like throwin’ us 
                        into a meat grinder so you can cash 
                        in? I wonder what Dorsey would have 
                        to say about that shit before he 
                        blew himself to smithereens. Or 
                        Campbell behind that gatling. Or 
                        any other of those suckers thought 
                        they were dying for something 
                        beside the United States of James 
                        Andrews.

                                 ANDREWS
                        They’d say there’s still a mission 
                        to finish.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Not any more. This mission is over.  
                        Shit, this mission ain’t even a 
                        mission. It’s a heist.
                                 ANDREWS
                        You can’t do one without the other.

                                 SHADRACH
                        Watch us.

           His finger teases the trigger. Pittinger has a side to 
           choose.

           BLAM!

           Pittinger drops Shadrach. BLAM! Andrews shoots raider #1. 
           BLAM! Mason tags Andrews. BLAM! Pittinger wastes Mason. In 
           five seconds the boxcar is a scene of blood and gunsmoke, 
           only Andrews and Pittinger left standing.

           Clutching his gunshot wound, Andrews tries to save some of 
           the gold spilling over the edge as the train lurches to a 
           stop. Fed up, Pittinger draws his gun on Andrews.

                                 PITTINGER
                        I should shoot you too you prick. 
                        Shadrach’s right.

                                 ANDREWS
                        If this is about your cut of the 
                        spoils? 

                                 PITTINGER
                        My cut! Of what? Gold?

           He kicks a scattering of gold coins across the floor.

                                 PITTINGER (CONT’D)
                        No one is dying out here for gold, 
                        asshole. They’re dying for you. You 
                        and this mission you sold. Not 
                        because they were suckers, but 
                        because you gave ‘em a shot. You 
                        made ‘em believe they could be more 
                        than the screw-ups and shitheels 
                        the army took ‘em for. And you were 
                        right. Look how they stepped up! 
                        Those raiders we lost were worth a 
                        hundred of any man who cares about 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PITTINGER (CONT’D)
                        gold. Worth a hundred of you, 
                        Goddamn it!

           Andrews lets this sink in. Buffum shows at the boxcar door. 
           Sees all the gold and Andrews bleeding through his fingers.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Well ain’t this just perfect.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Mr. Buffum, why are we stopped?

                                 BUFFUM
                        You tell me. Since when did this 
                        turn into a gold rush?

                                 PITTINGER
                        Mr. Andrews here was just 
                        motivating the men.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Let me guess: All Chattanooga or 
                        All hell.

           A WHISTLE BLOWS. Once again smoke appears over the treetops. 
           Here comes Fuller. And all hell.

           they come upon the MIDDLE BOXCAR abandoned in their path.

           Fuller and the others jump off, weapons up, ready for an 
           ambush. Inside the boxcar they find the carnage of the 
           raiders’ last firefight -- Shadrach and his two turncoats 
           dead on the floor. The gunpowder kegs with the gold are gone. 

                                 MURPHY
                        What happened here?

                        Maybe these snakes are shedding 
                        their skins.

           Fuller finds a STRAY GOLD COIN in the dirt.

           EXT. STEVENSON JUNCTION, ALABAMA - DAY

           A small encampment of Confederate soldiers are on their knees 
           having just surrendered to Mitchel’s massive troop-train. A 
           subtitle reads:

                        “STEVENSON JUNCTION, ALABAMA 
                        44 MILES WEST OF CHATTANOOGA”

           Lieutenant Arbuckle reports to General Mitchel, who walks the 
           line of prisoners.

                                 LIEUTENANT ARBUCKLE
                        I’ve fifty men in place to stay 
                        behind and hold the junction. 
                        Chattanooga is right over that 
                        hill.

           Mitchel’s still not sure. The picket guard from before ushers 
           up a MESSENGER.

                                 PICKET GUARD
                        General Mitchel?

                                 MITCHEL
                        Yes?

                                 PICKET GUARD
                        This man here says he’s from 
                        Marietta.

                                 MESSENGER
                        Henry Green Cole sent me.

           The messenger hands over a sealed letter.

                                 MITCHEL
                        Am I supposed to have heard of this 
                        Mr. Cole?

                                 MESSENGER
                        He’s a friend of the cause. 
                        Proprietor of the Fletcher Hotel 
                        and an associate of a man you’re in 
                        league with -- James Andrews.

           Mitchel and Arbuckle swap disturbed looks. Mitchel opens the 
           letter and reads it. His demeanor blackens. He whips out a 
           pistol and presses it between the messenger’s eyes.

                                 MITCHEL
                        You have thirty seconds to convince 
                        me this isn’t a confederate ploy.
                                 MESSENGER
                        I... I... I...

           The messenger pisses his pants. Mitchel turns to the picket.

                                 MITCHEL
                        Jesus. Get him out of here.

           The picket drags the messenger away. Mitchel looks to 
           Arbuckle.

                                 ARBUCKLE
                        What’s it say?

                                 MITCHEL
                        Whoever this Cole character is, he 
                        knows our every move. He claims 
                        Andrews is working for the 
                        Confederates and has no intention 
                        of carrying out his mission. Simply 
                        put, Chattanooga was meant to be an 
                        ambush.

                                 ARBUCKLE
                        And what if this note is the 
                        ambush?

           Mitchel has a big decision to make.

           Andrews, Pittinger, and Buffum plunge ahead at frightful 
           speed, cannibalizing the last remaining boxcar. They rip off 
           planks and heave wood into the tender, next to the kegs of 
           gold. The Texas is again behind them, now pushing the dropped 
           boxcar.

                        You said we still have a mission to

                        either. The only one that counts.

                        before we can shoot off a warning 
                        to Leadbetter.

           EXT. DALTON - DAY

           The largest town on the line north of Marietta. The General 
           barrels toward the red-brick depot at the center of town, the 
           Texas closing behind. A subtitle appears:

                        “DALTON, GEORGIA 
                        38 MILES TO CHATTANOOGA”

           INT. PAVILION - DALTON STATION - DAY

           Passengers crowd the ornate, covered platform. The General 
           stampedes toward it, showing no signs of slowing down. People 
           begin to nervously backpedal from the edge, then scatter in 
           terror as the raiders blister past in a whoosh of cinders and 
           smoke...
           INT. GENERAL - ENGINE CAB - MOVING

           Andrews looks back, relishing the havoc. He turns to Buffum 
           and Pittinger.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Alright. Soon as we get to the

           The General squeals to a stop just before a fork in the line, 
           about 300 yards north of the station. They all dismount: 
           Andrews running to the telegraph line alongside the track, 
           Buffum pulling the pin on the boxcar, Pittinger covering both 
           their asses with a pistol in one hand, rifle in the other.

           Fuller’s train brakes as it approaches the pavilion...

           Boots strapped into a spiked climbing wedge, Andrews quickly 
           scales the telegraph pole. Buffum jumps back in the cab and 
           gets it ready to roll. Pittinger keeps his eyes peeled as... 

           INT. PAVILION - DALTON STATION - DAY

           The Texas pulls up, slowing just long enough for Anderson to 
           jump off. He dashes along the platform and into...

           INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE - DAY

           Anderson bursts in, causing a young TELEGRAPH OPERATOR to 
           spill coffee on himself.

                        What the heck?

           EXT. SWITCH - JUST NORTH OF DALTON STATION - DAY

           A surly, unarmed RAILROAD MAN stalks up to Buffum in the cab.

                                 DALTON RAILROAD MAN
                        Hey, you maniacs! You can’t come 
                        barreling through like--
           Buffum pops a warning shot at the guy’s boots. The man turns 
           tail and runs.

           Andrews, atop the telegraph pole with the wire in front of 
           him, pulls the knife from his boot. 

           Rifleshots SPLINTER THE POLE inches from his face, causing 
           Andrews to DROP THE KNIFE. 

           The shots come from the Texas, pulling up the track from the 
           pavilion. Pittinger blisters fire back...

           Fuller gives it everything he’s got. Murphy and the three

           The telegraph operator looks over Fuller’s note.

           Pittinger flips the knife back up to Andrews, bullets 
           whizzing by. 

           Buffum blasts back at the Texas, now 150 yards and closing. A 
           slug RIPS THROUGH HIS THIGH from behind, speckling the cover 
           of The Tempest. 

           It’s the railroad man, who Buffum shoots dead.

           INT. DALTON TELEGRAPH OFFICE - DAY

           The operator taps out the message, OUR CAMERA SWOOPING UP the

           Andrews and Pittinger jump aboard under a maelstrom of 
           gunfire, the General already rolling away, yet another boxcar 
           left behind to slow their pursuers.

           Andrews smiles. He can taste victory.

                        Good as gold.

           They look to Buffum, slumped against the boiler, bloody and 
           in pain.

           Wood, miserable, labors alongside others in his regiment 
           digging a trench. Everyone starts scrambling, mobilized for

           Wood’s heart leaps in his chest.

           EXT. COACH ROAD - DAY

           McClintock circles Miriam like a shark. The sheriff and two 
           deputies stay on their horses, guns on their laps.
                                 MIRIAM
                        Like I said, I heard the ruckus and 
                        went to investigate.

                                 MCCLINTOCK
                        And what could possibly be 
                        happening on the railway that would 
                        be worth a woman’s attention?

                                 MIRIAM
                        There’s a war on, Mr. McClintock, 
                        one my husband is very much in the 
                        thick of. That consumes much of a 
                        woman’s attention.

           The third deputy keeps his eye on the black coachman, who 
           does everything he can not to reveal the raiders inside.

           Parrott and Wollam CROUCH DOWN ON THE FLOOR OF THE COACH, 
           guns in hand, undetected.

                                 MCCLINTOCK
                        And what consumes the rest of it?

                                 MIRIAM
                        Excuse me?

                                 MCCLINTOCK
                        A woman’s attention. What else 
                        consumes it? Party dresses, coffee 
                        cakes, gold.

           Parrott and Wollam keep quiet and low. They use Miriam’s 
           powder mirror to decipher’s everyone’s position.

                                 MIRIAM
                        I don’t know what business you have 
                        with my husband, Mr. McClintock, 
                        but I am quite certain he would not 
                        be pleased by your tone with his 
                        wife.

                                 MCCLINTOCK
                        Well then, let’s all journey up and 
                        see him together. Have a little pow 
                        wow about my tone. Or..

           He grabs Miriam roughly by the hair and FLINGS HER into the 
           side of the coach. She bounces off and knocks to the ground.

                                 MCCLINTOCK (CONT’D)
                        You tell me where I can find the 
                        thieves who stole that barnburner.

           Parrott looks ready to go, Wollam stops him.

                                 MIRIAM
                        I have no idea what you’re talking 
                        about.

                                 MCCLINTOCK
                        No?

           McClintock KICKS HER. Miriam rolls over, gasping. The 
           coachman glances at his shotgun.

                                 MCCLINTOCK (CONT’D)
                        I made an oath. An oath to bring a 
                        man what’s rightfully his. And I 
                        intend to keep my oath. Unlike you, 
                        who obviously views your union with 
                        the Colonel as something you can 
                        wantonly break. And for what?

           He KICKS HER AGAIN. Miriam tries to claw away.

                                 MCCLINTOCK (CONT’D)
                        Money!

           AND AGAIN.

                        Gold!

           He winds up for the fatal blow--

                           (rasping)
                        Freedom.

           McClintock stops and smiles and kneels down over her. She 
           quivers and spits up blood.

                                 MCCLINTOCK
                        What was that, little lady?

           Their eyes meet for one long intimate beat, Miriam grappling 
           with what’s about to come as she... 

           STICKS MCCLINTOCK IN THE GUT WITH A KNIFE

           Parrott and Wollam spring to action inside the coach. 

           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! 
           They DROP DEPUTIES #1 and #2 but miss THE SHERIFF, who WASTES 
           WOLLAM. The coachman grabs his shotgun. CRACK! Both he and 
           DEPUTY #3 are blasted off their mounts. 

           The coach horses SPOOK AND RACE OFF, the coach with them. 
           PARROT TUMBLES OUT out onto the ground and is SHOT DEAD BY 
           THE SHERIFF, who himself is BLOWN AWAY BY A SHOTGUN BLAST, 
           Miriam behind the smoking gun. 

           Miriam turns it back on McClintock, who writhes in the mud 
           there, slowly bleeding to death. She looks around her, 
           corpses everywhere next to a scattering of gold coins, A 
           LONELY ROAD in front and behind her.

           She takes McClintock’s gun, mounts his horse, and rides 
           north.

           SMOKE OVER THE TREETOPS

           Buffum slams the breaks. Everything squeals and shutters to a

                                 ANDREWS
                        No! You do and we’ll derail into 
                        that gorge. I didn’t come all this 
                        way to die in some Goddamn train 
                        accident.

           Leadbetter sees the General stop about two thirds of the way 
           across the span, stuck between the hounds and the hunters.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Hold your fire men ‘til I give the 
                        command. I wanna take this engine 
                        intact and these thieves alive and 
                        kickin’.

                        Alive, sir?
                                 LEADBETTER
                        So I can personally gut these sons 
                        ‘a whores.

           Wood, dug in, watches Leadbetter stride by.

           INT. GENERAL - DAY

           Andrews watches Leadbetter walk confidently out onto the 
           trestle, his victory at hand.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Great. Everybody’s favorite 
                        Colonel.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Ain’t he supposed to be gettin’ 
                        whooped by Mitchel’s army right 
                        about now?

                                 ANDREWS
                        That was the plan.

           He looks to Pittinger.

                                 PITTINGER
                        We stepped up. So will General 
                        Mitchell.

           Andrews wants to believe this. He steps off onto the tracks.

                                 BUFFUM
                        Where you goin’?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Where do you think? Let this prick 
                        know who he’s surrendering to.

           EXT. DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Andrews and Leadbetter meet each other half-way. Leadbetter 
           is startled it’s Andrews -- the last person he expected.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        You?

                                 ANDREWS
                        Afternoon Colonel. Fancy meeting 
                        you here.
                                 LEADBETTER
                        Am I to understand you’re the man 
                        behind this... act.

                                 ANDREWS
                        One of ‘em. Shouldn’t you be back 
                        in Chattanooga? Or did General 
                        Mitchel already drive your ass out.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Mitchel? Mitchel’s army stopped 
                        short at Stevenson.

           Andrews can’t conceal the blow. Their last chance. Gone.

                                 LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
                        Is that what this is all about? 
                        Taking my city?

                                 ANDREWS
                        That’s right. You inspired me to 
                        pick any side but yours. On behalf 
                        of the Union Army, me and my...
                           (re: Buffum and Pittinger)
                        ...forces, demand that you and your 
                        men surrender your weapons and give 
                        up Chattanooga immediately.

           Leadbetter smiles, appreciating the joke.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        I warned you your head was getting 
                        too big, Mr. Andrews. Shame you had 
                        to go and lose it so quickly.

           He turns and goes.

                                 ANDREWS
                        You and I both know you have a lot 
                        more riding on that train than a 
                        couple of Union spies.

           Leadbetter stops. Andrews flips him a gold coin. Leadbetter 
           sees his marking: “L”.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Like you said, I have friends all 
                        over the map. Not all of ‘em share 
                        the same high opinion of the 
                        Confederacy’s chances, or yours.

                                 LEADBETTER
                           (realizing)
                        Miriam.
                                 ANDREWS
                        Let’s just say we like each other. 
                        Cut from the same cloth I think. 
                        Might even cut some kids from that 
                        cloth. Name ‘em all Lincoln. The 
                        boys and the girls. What do you 
                        think?

                                 LEADBETTER
                        You’re never getting off this 
                        bridge.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Then neither is your “gunpowder”.

           He spits into the rapids below.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Unless we strike a deal.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        What do you propose?

                                 ANDREWS
                        I hand you the train and the loot. 
                        You get us horses and let us go on 
                        our way.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        I do that in front of all these 
                        men, all the gold in the world 
                        won’t save me from getting strung 
                        up for treason.

                                 ANDREWS
                        That would be a shame, but it’s a 
                        risk I’m willing to take.

           Leadbetter is not amused.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        How about this: I let you go. You 
                        deliver me what’s mine and your men 
                        there, and you can walk away. Given 
                        your reputation to play all sides 
                        I’ll say you were the one who 
                        tipped me off. I’ll even promise 
                        not to slice up that whore I call a 
                        wife next time I see her.

           It’s Andrews turn not knowing what to say.
                                 LEADBETTER (CONT’D)
                        This should be easy for you. You’ve 
                        just been sold out by Mitchel, why 
                        not do the same. You are a man of 
                        enterprise after all.

           Andrews glances back at Pittinger and Buffum, both bloodied 
           and exhausted, heroes all. Andrews grapples with what to do, 
           looking at once genuinely pained and cynically torn, at war 
           with himself. Everything is on the line...

           Andrews walks back and something catches his eye: MIRIAM’S 
           RED SCARF tied to the cowcatcher. He removes it and feels the  *
           weight of it, the truth of it, his expression inscrutable.

           INT. GENERAL - DAY

           Andrews steps back aboard swimming in his own head. Pittinger 
           and Buffum look to him eagerly.

                                 PITTINGER
                        What he say? What’s our next move?

           Andrews needs time to think. He sees Fuller stepping out in 
           front of the Texas.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Gimmie a second.

           EXT. TEXAS/THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Andrews comes sauntering up, the spy and the conductor facing 
           off. Fuller gestures for Murphy and his men to back off.

                                 ANDREWS
                        That wife of yours sure picked 
                        herself a piece of work.

                                 FULLER
                        I try.

                                 ANDREWS
                        A little too hard if you ask me.

           He hands over Fuller’s TIMEPIECE, grinning like a snake 
           charmer. Fuller takes it, wary. He pulls something of his own 
           and flips it to Andrews. One of Leadbetter’s GOLD COINS.
                                 FULLER
                        And I thought I was chasing 
                        patriots.

           Andrews pockets it. He nods to Buffum and Pittinger.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Some of us. When the dust settles 
                        you should get a drink with those 
                        men. If they aren’t dead. I think 
                        you’d like ‘em. They’re like you.

                                 FULLER
                        How’s that?

                                 ANDREWS
                        They’re loyal. And they got grit.

           Fuller is disarmed. Andrews offers his hand. It’s an offer of 
           respect between worthy rivals. Fuller takes it.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        I’m afraid I won’t exactly be 
                        returnin’ your engine in the shape 
                        it was took.

                                 FULLER
                        That’s okay. I’d wish you luck but 
                        I’m glad it’s run out.

           With that, Andrews walks back to the General.

           Leadbetter steps back up to his army. Vickers and some guys 
           pry up track at the edge of the bridge to force a derailment.

                                 LIEUTENANT VICKERS
                        Was that who I think it was?

                        Just get ready to take that train.

           INT. GENERAL - DAY

           Andrews hops into the cab one last time. Both Pittinger and 
           Buffum look to him, expectant.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Help me with those kegs.
                                 BUFFUM
                        Tell us you just bribed ‘em.

           He glances back at Fuller, admiring.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Not that man.

                                 PITTINGER
                        Then what?

           Andrews smiles like a rogue, cracks open one of the gunpowder 
           kegs, and DUMPS THE GOLD OVER THE SIDE INTO THE GORGE.

           EXT. DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - CONTINUOUS

           Leadbetter watches with shock and dismay as thousands of 
           glittering coins go sprinkling down like confetti.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        No!

           INT. GENERAL - DAY

           Andrews looks back to Buffum and Pittinger, their mouths 
           agape. They know exactly what this means. Thus resigned they 
           start cracking open keg after keg, dumping ALL THE GOLD.

           EXT. TEXAS - DAY

           Fuller’s side looks on with amazement as LEADBETTER’S ENTIRE 
           FORTUNE VANISHES IN THE RAPIDS BELOW. The dogged conductor 
           cracks a curious smile.

           EXT. NORTHERN EMBANKMENT - DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Leadbetter let’s out a rancorous, guttural howl. He turns to 
           Vickers.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Get your best shots in position and 
                        shoot to kill. 
                           (to everyone)
                        Nothing gets off that bridge you 
                        hear me?

           Wood watches as Vickers and a couple marksmen hurry along the  *
           ridge to better position.
           INT. GENERAL - CONTINUOUS

           The deed done, Andrews unpockets the cigar given to him by 
           Mitchel and splits it into thirds.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Well, guys, I guess Hell is empty 
                        and all the devils are here.

           They light up like men in victory.

           EXT. TEXAS/THE DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Murphy steps up besides Fuller.

                                 MURPHY
                        What do these renegades think 
                        they’re doin’?

                                 FULLER
                        Finishing what they started.

                                 MURPHY
                        But they lost?

           Fuller looks to his timepiece. He’s not so sure.

           EXT. NORTHERN EMBANKMENT/DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Wood sees Vickers shimmy out onto a tree that leans out over 
           the gorge, rifle slung over his back. A GUSH OF STEAM blasts 
           from the General behind.

           INT. GENERAL - DAY

           The raiders scramble about stoking the engine for one last 
           run. They cannibalize the kegs and throw every last scrap of 
           wood, cloth, belts, you name it in the firebox. Buffum, who 
           looks pale, even flicks in the last nub of his cigars. 

                                 BUFFUM
                        I was really hopin’ this would be 
                        the first train I wouldn’t have to 
                        blow.

           Pittinger is about to throw in his NOTEBOOK when Andrews 
           stops him.
                                 ANDREWS
                        Not that.

           Andrews pulls out Miriam’s red scarf and puts it in 
           Pittinger’s hand.

                                 ANDREWS (CONT’D)
                        Mitchell put you here for a reason. 
                        Everything those raiders did, this 
                        whole mission, will be for shit if 
                        you don’t get their story out. They 
                        stepped up, it’s our turn.

           Pittinger looks to Buffum by the boiler, its pressure gauge 
           red-lines off the charts, dynamite stacked all around. He 
           nods. This is the only way.

           Leadbetter draws his sabre and raises it above his head. 

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Okay boys, on my mark!

           Wood sees Vickers sight his rifle and get a PERFECT SHOT ON 
           ANDREWS IN THE CAB. The young raider jumps up onto a cannon 
           there, turns his own barrel on Vickers before any of the 
           rebels can react and...

           CRACK!

           The SHOT RICOCHETS off the tender, right behind Andrews. They  *
           all look back at the rebel lines and see VICKERS BODY 
           plummeting into the gorge, picked off by Wood just in time.

           EXT. NORTHERN EMBANKMENT - DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Young Wood is surrounded by an angry mob of rebels, who looks  *
           to Leadbetter for a command. He drops his sabre.

                                 LEADBETTER
                        Fire!

           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Wood is blown dead to the dirt. 
           50 rebels unload torrent of lead at the General.

           Pittinger dives into the tender, ducking down, bullets 
           snapping around them. Andrews cuts the water line and pulls 
           the pin. Buffum hits it.

           The General launches off, Pittinger and the tender left 
           behind.

           INT. GENERAL - MOVING - DAY

           Andrews and Buffum plow through a shitstorm of enemy fire, 
           building steam. Andrews looks back at...

           EXT. TEXAS/DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Fuller, who watches them go, a hint of admiration in his 
           eyes. Both he and Murphy are too focused on the stampeding 
           General to notice...

           EXT. SPAN/DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Pittinger climbs under the bridge and finds a perch over a 
           deep pool amongst the raging rapids below. He means to jump.

           EXT. NORTHERN EMBANKMENT/DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Leadbetter and the rebels blister fire as the engine snarls 
           toward them like a missile.

           INT. GENERAL - MOVING

           The cab is riddled with bullets, both Andrews and Buffum 
           getting tagged. Buffum’s hand slips off the throttle. Andrews  *
           grabs it and places it back, holding it there, one hand over 
           another.

                                 BUFFUM
                           (grimacing)

                        Always.
           EXT. SPAN/DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Pittinger tries to muster the courage to jump but can’t.

           EXT. TEXAS/DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Fuller and Murphy spots Pittinger under the span.

                                 MURPHY
                        A rifle! Quick!

           Someone tosses him a rifle.

           EXT. NORTHERN EMBANKMENT/DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Rebels scatter as the General barrels down upon the ripped up 
           section. Leadbetter calmly steps off to the side, not wanting 
           to miss the spectacle of Andrews’ certain death.

           INT. GENERAL - MOVING

           The boiler gauge glass cracks it’s so hot. Buffum nods to 
           Andrews, who shovels all the dynamite they have into the 
           firebox. They brace themselves...

           EXT. SPAN/DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE/RIVER - DAY

           PITTINGER JUMPS! Splashing down in the river below.

           EXT. NORTHERN EMBANKMENT/DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Leadbetter watches the General as it careens on by. The fire-
           breathing locomotive slams into the gap, skips, tips, and...

           Andrews grins to Buffum as they go.

                                 ANDREWS
                        Looks like we’re down to all hell.

           KER-POW! 

           EXPLODES SPECTACULARLY, taking with it Leadbetter, his army, 
           and much of the cliff supporting the bridge.
           EXT. TEXAS/DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Fuller and Murphy look on in horror, their baby destroyed. 
           Fuller feels the bridge start to buckle under their feet.

                                 FULLER
                        Off the bridge! Off the bridge!

           They get the fuck off the bridge.

           INT. RIVER - DAY

           Pittinger pops up from the rushing rapids, spitting out 
           water, alive and kicking. Behind him... 

           THE WHOLE FUCKING BRIDGE COLLAPSES

           EXT. TEXAS/DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Safe on the southern embankment, Murphy spots Pittinger in 
           the river and raises his rifle. Fuller pushes it down.

                                 FULLER
                        That’s enough killing for today.

           Murphy nods, getting it.

           INT. RIVER - DAY

           Pittinger is swept down the rapids, splashing wildly, 
           Leadbetter’s gold twinkling in the sunlight beneath his 
           kicking boots. His voice over rises up:

                                 PITTINGER (V.O.)
                        For their actions...

           He flops onto the rocky embankment, catches his breath, and 
           dashes off into the woods.

           EXT. NORTH EMBANKMENT - DEVIL’S TIGHTROPE - DAY

           Pages of The Tempest swirl about a crater of the devastation, 
           one flapping up against THE GENERAL’S NAMEPLATE.

           INT. HOTEL BAR - NEW YORK - DAY

           At a table, Pittinger sits across from Miriam having said all  *
           that can be said. He rises, takes his hat, and goes. Miriam 
           watches him leave, then turns back to the table -- HER RED 
           SCARF LEFT FOR HER.

                                 PITTINGER (V.O.)
                        As a civilian, James Andrews was 
                        not among the recipients. However 
                        his name became legend, a reminder 
                        of the sacrifice it takes to ensure 
                        the freedom of others.

           At first she’s afraid to touch it, then she takes, smells it,  *
           thinking of Andrews. A slight sly smile overtakes her. He was  *
           thinking of her, he would have shown. 

           EXT. BILTMORE HOTEL - DAY

           Pittinger, a little swagger to his step, walks out under the 
           marquee of the BILTMORE HOTEL and disappears into the 
           bustling New York City traffic.

                                 PITTINGER (V.O.)
                        ‘Course in coloring our story
