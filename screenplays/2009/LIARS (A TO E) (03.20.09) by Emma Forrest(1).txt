           INT.APARTMENT, DAY

           In a bedroom that is small, with 40’s fixtures, BACALL, who 
           is small, with 40’s fixtures (dark brows, wavy hair) , is 
           trying on outfits. She has sad eyes and a luminous smile, and 
           is currently wearing a bunny girl costume that highlights her 
           Golden Age of Hollywood figure. There are floral patterned, 
           vintage cake stands and cake containers everywhere, in every 
           corner of this ground floor apartment. Her best friend, 
           ELISHIA, twenty-one to Bacall’s twenty-nine, and incapable of 
           disguising her cleavage or her thought process, gasps.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Wow.

                                 BACALL
                        Okay, wait, though.

           With the bunny girl outfit still on, she steps into a plush 
           rabbit suit, with a head and ears, only her face sticking 
           out.

                                 BACALL
                        Can you zip me?

           Elishia zips her and then collapses on the bed in hysterics.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Wear it!

                                 BACALL
                        I shouldn’t wear that? 

           She points on the bed to a purple T-shirt dress.

                                 BACALL
                        Because we haven’t seen each other 
                        in a month and that has much easier 
                        access. Obviously, I won’t wear 
                        underwear with it.

                                 ELISHIA
                        No, this is the one.

                                 BACALL
                        Yeah. I always thought it would be 
                        funny to wear a bunny girl costume 
                        underneath a plush rabbit suit. 
                        What’s the post-feminist 
                        perspective?
                                 ELISHIA
                        Subversive yet soft to the touch.

                                 BACALL
                        I think it will make him laugh.

           Her phone buzzes. As she answers, her engagement ring catches 
           the sunlight.

           INT.BEDROOM/INT. AIRPORT

           Matching sad eyes and luminous smile to Bacall’s, MARK, mid 
           thirties, is carrying a guitar through Heathrow airport, 
           sporting black finger-less gloves on his hands. He has long, 
           skinny limbs, a great voice and terrible tattoos. 

                                 MARK
                        I’m getting on the plane, now, 
                        baby. 

           Camera pulls back and we see he is being snapped by paparazzi 
           as he walks through security.

           INT.BEDROOM

                                 BACALL
                        (whispers to Elishia) Unzip me.

           INT.AIRPORT

                                 MARK
                        Oh my God, I can’t wait to see you. 
                        It’s... I swear to fucking Christ 
                        it’s the only thing that’s got me 
                        through this tour: the thought of 
                        being with you again. I’m just 
                        dyin’ to get home to you so we can 
                        get on with our life together, you 
                        know?

           Her heart soars.

                                 BACALL
                        I know. Anything special you want 
                        baked for your return? Carrot cake? 
                        Or tiramisu? I’ve got a lot of 
                        stock to use up.

           She steps out of her outfit and into a large Young 
           Frankenstein T-shirt she picks up off the floor. 
                                 MARK
                        Carrot cake. I’m going to have you 
                        knocked up by January, by the way. 
                        February at the latest.

                                 BACALL
                        So you keep saying.

                                 MARK
                        Yep. I mean it. How fucking cool is 
                        our kid going to be?

                                 BACALL
                        Cool.

           He laughs.

                                 MARK
                        What are you wearing?

           She looks down at her Young Frankenstein shirt.

                                 BACALL
                        Nothing.

                                 MARK
                        Good. Stay like that. I’ll see you 
                        in a few hours, okay?

                                 BACALL
                        Yup.

                                 MARK
                        I love you.

                                 BACALL
                        I love you too.

           EXT.APARTMENT

           Bacall sends Elishia off, holding a book, at her front door.

                                 BACALL
                        Your parents happy you finished the 
                        book?

                                 ELISHIA
                        So-so. It doesn’t have a publisher. 
                        And they still wish I hadn’t wasted 
                        the time trying to break into 
                        comedy.
                                 BACALL
                        But you were so good. They never 
                        came to see you.

                                 ELISHIA
                        I’m a serious author now.

           We see a shot of the book’s title page: ‘My First Book of 
           Feminism’ by Elishia Bennett (Ages 10 and up). The cover art 
           should be (non-deliberately) comical.

                                 ELISHIA
                        A nine year old in Brazil is 
                        pregnant with twins. I’m wondering 
                        if I should make the target age 
                        younger. You think it would help?

                                 BACALL
                        Help the pregnant nine year old?

                                 ELISHIA
                        Help sell it to a publisher? Going 
                        younger works with everything else. 
                        Why wouldn’t it work with feminism? 

                                 BACALL
                        Don’t tell that to a woman turning 
                        thirty.

                                 ELISHIA
                        So I’ll see you for your birthday 
                        and otherwise you’ll be lost in 
                        Loveland.

                                 BACALL
                        Not lost. We know our way 
                        instinctively.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Ugh!!

                                 BACALL
                        Let me be a hopeless romantic. He’s 
                        been on tour forever. It’s the 
                        first time I’ll have seen him since 
                        the bakery went under.

                                 ELISHIA
                        You guys are gonna hibernate.

                                 BACALL
                        We are. He’s coming back in time to 
                        vote. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BACALL(cont'd)
                        But after that, yeah, we’re not 
                        leaving the house for a long time.

           EXT.APARTMENT, EVENING

           On the wall outside her apartment building (oblivious to the 
           stares of passers by, so happy is she) Bacall is sitting in 
           her plush bunny costume, awaiting her beloved’s arrival. 
           Despite her ears, she has the regal posture of Penelope 
           watching the ocean for Odysseus.

           EXT.APARTMENT, EVENING

           Mark pulls up in his un-rock star truck, steps out. Doesn’t 
           smile, despite her get-up. The plane ride seems to have 
           broken him.

           Bacall throws herself into his arms. To her bafflement, he 
           kisses her without tongue and un-peels her.

                                 MARK
                        We need to talk.

           She pulls back and looks at him properly. He skin is grey and 
           his whole body is shaking. He looks like he’s about to faint.

                                 BACALL
                        Of course. Come inside.

           She slips her furry hand into his and leads him up to her 
           apartment.

           INT.APARTMENT, EVENING

           They’re in her bedroom, on her bed and she’s waiting for him 
           to speak. The cake tins that surround them don’t help the 
           apparent gravity of the situation, nor does her costume.

                                 MARK
                        I think I need space.

           She is so confused, she’s reacts like a zombie.

                                 BACALL
                        Okay. Are you going to road trip up 
                        the coast with your cousin?

           She unzips the bunny costume.
                                 MARK
                        No. I mean, I don’t need “some” 
                        space...I need all the space.

           She pulls the costume aside, steps out in her now mournful 
           bunny girl get-up.

                                 MARK
                        Oh, Christ, you look gorgeous.

                                 BACALL
                        Thank you.

           He looks into her eyes, starts to cry. It makes her cry.

                                 MARK
                        I think I have to be alone. I don’t 
                        think I can be in a relationship 
                        any more.

           She twists her engagement ring.

                                 BACALL
                        I don’t understand.

                                 MARK
                        I just can’t do it. I thought that 
                        I could...with you, even though I 
                        never managed it before. Because I 
                        love you so dearly. But I can’t. I 
                        can’t.

                                 BACALL
                        All the things you kept saying, 
                        about wanting us to be a family...

                                 MARK
                        I thought if I said them enough 
                        times, I could make them true. 

           He looks down at his finger-less gloves.

                                 MARK
                        It didn’t work.

           EXT.APARTMENT, EVENING

           He is leaving. She is about to let him, but first asks:

                                 BACALL
                        When did you realize?
                                 MARK
                        That I loved you? Before I even 
                        kissed you.

                                 BACALL
                        No. When did you realize that you 
                        can’t be in a relationship?

                                 MARK
                        On the plane. First quiet time I’ve 
                        had to think in seven weeks.

           She nods.

                                 MARK
                        Will you call someone? I don’t want 
                        you to be alone.

                                 BACALL
                        Yeah. Sure.

           INT.BEDROOM, NIGHT

           When Elishia arrives, toting Philosophy text books from 
           college, Bacall is a puddle on the bed.

                                 ELISHIA
                        What happened?

                                 BACALL
                        I don’t know.

           She looks at the pillow with the indentation of Mark’s head. 
           Elishia sees her fix on it.

                                 BACALL
                        Please leave it there.

                                 ELISHIA
                        NO. This is not the Holy Turin 
                        Break-Up Shroud? No.

           Elishia picks up the pillow.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Ready?

                                 BACALL
                        I’m not.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Tough.
           Elishia violently shakes it out.

           Bacall is crying as she pulls up at her polling station.

           EXT.VOTING STATION

           There are long lines of excited people. Entire families, 
           moms, kids and grandparents.

           INT.VOTING BOOTH

           Bacall is still quietly crying. The tears smear the ballot 
           sheet.

                                 BACALL
                        Shit.

           She steps out, looking for help.

                                 BACALL
                        Can I have a new one? I think I 
                        invalidated this. One of my tear 
                        ducts just voted for Pat Buchanan.

           INT. ELECTION NIGHT PARTY, LOS FELIZ

           With a large screen TV on in the background, a hopping, multi-
           racial coalition of young people in ‘That One’ T-shirts, are 
           watching the results come in. The night is already swinging 
           their way and Elishia is drunk on joy. And also alcohol. 
           Looking around the pan-ethnic group, Elishia trills:

                                 ELISHIA
                        I have black friends! I have black 
                        friends! I win a prize because I 
                        have lots of black friends!

           As another state swings for Obama, their friend, Mario, whose 
           party it is, says:

                                 MARIO
                        I’m never going to have hear about 
                        Sarah Palin again!

                                 ELISHIA
                        Or The First Dude!
                                 MARIO
                        See you, Todd!

                                 ELISHIA
                        Don’t forget your parka, Todd!

           INT.KITCHEN

           Hiding from the happy throng, Bacall is icing a cake. The 
           word she is icing is killing her:

           ‘HOPE’

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. PARTY, NIGHT

           It’s 8 PM and Obama is now the clear winner. Elation, 
           dancing, multiple plays of the amazing reggae song “Barack 
           Obama” by Coco Tea. 

           Suddenly Mario hushes the room.

                                 MARIO
                        Hey, hey, everybody! Attention 
                        everybody!

           They look round.

                                 MARIO
                        The neighbours came up and asked me 
                        to turn off the music now. 

           Ohhhh.

                                 MARIO
                        I said...NO!

           Woooh!

           Cue Coco Tea for the millionth time.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. PARTY, NIGHT

           McCain gives his concession speech whilst Sarah Palin stands 
           beside him, Armani clad.
                                 ELISHIA
                        She’s a disgrace to womankind and I 
                        hope she rots in hell. But, when 
                        she does, I also hope she’ll leave 
                        me all of her jackets.

                                 MCCAIN
                        “The American people have spoken, 
                        and they have spoken clearly...”

           Bacall has her fingers over her eyes.

                                 BACALL
                        I can’t look. He’s like a sad-faced 
                        sock puppet. He looks like a 
                        manifestation of my soul.

           She checks her phone to see if Mark has texted. Nothing.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Have some of your cake.

           Bacall, transfixed by that frosted word, ‘HOPE’, shakes her 
           head.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Come on. Obama cake has no 
                        calories. 

                                 BACALL
                        There’s fudge, cream and chocolate, 
                        but it has no calories?

                                 ELISHIA
                        No. (she looks at her like she’s 
                        five). It’s Obama cake.

           Bacall shakes her head. Elishia’s really a bit worse for 
           wear, now.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Bacall! EAT THE HOPE! 

           Genuinely quite frightened, Bacall puts a fork in it.

                                 MARIO
                        Quiet! Quiet!

           The Obama family are now walking towards the podium, as the 
           assembled watchers, in Chicago and at home, shriek.

                                 OBAMA
                        Hello Chicago!
           Bacall creeps forward to watch. She can’t help it. People in 
           the audience and around her are all gently tear-y.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. PARTY

                                 OBAMA
                        I would not be standing here 
                        without the unyielding support of 
                        my rock of sixteen years, the love 
                        of my life, Michelle Obama.

           Bacall instantly starts to weep, her finger on her lips. The 
           camera cuts to Jesse Jackson in the Chicago audience, who has 
           the exact same expression as Bacall: tears streaming, two 
           index fingers held to trembling lips. Mario looks between 
           Bacall and Jesse.

                                 MARIO
                        Yo, is Jesse Jackson lost in the 
                        moment, or did Mark Friday fuck him 
                        and leave him, too?

           Though Elishia shoves him, Bacall hears, and dissolves into 
           huge gulping sobs. This sobers Elishia.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Honey?

                                 BACALL
                        I want to go. I want to get my 
                        stuff back from Mark’s. Now.

           INT. MARK’S HOUSE, NIGHT

           There’s an infinity pool, a home cinema, a four poster bed, a 
           gym, a sauna.

           Elishia has her back as Bacall collects her various things. 

                                 BACALL
                        He’s waiting at his cousin’s to 
                        give me space.

           Taking her clothes down from the closet and out from drawers, 
           she pauses at a huge Buddha statue with garlands round its 
           neck.
                                 BACALL
                        He still likes him. That’s good.

           She’s in the walk in closet, pulling down her dresses. There 
           are overflowing boxes addressed to Mark that he’s never 
           bothered to unpack, full of denim from Juicy Couture and 
           Helmut Lang.

                                 BACALL
                        You know what his problem is?

           Elishia looks around the closet.

                                 ELISHIA
                        He has too many pairs of free 
                        jeans?

                                 BACALL
                        ...yeah.

           It’s not what she was going to say, but it will do.

           She takes off her engagement ring and places it as an 
           offering in front of Buddha. 

           INT. MARK’S LIVING ROOM

           She notices ‘No Direction Home’, Scorcese’s Bob Dylan 
           documentary, is on the coffee table, as they walk through the 
           living room. Bacall picks it up.

                                 BACALL
                        I gave him that. He can’t watch 
                        that without me.

           She hovers at it, apparently unwilling to put it down.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Well you can’t take it back. 

                                 BACALL
                        He never saw it until I brought it 
                        over. I want him to stop liking it 
                        now. 

                                 ELISHIA
                        Bacall.

                                 BACALL
                        I’m the one who loves Dylan. Why 
                        does he have to like it so much?
                                 ELISHIA
                        Because you knew that he would, 
                        because you know him to his core, 
                        which is why you gave it to him, 
                        which is why he broke up with you.

                                 BACALL
                        Because I know him to his core?

                                 ELISHIA
                        Yeah, yeah. Either that or he just 
                        got bored of you.

           She stares at Elishia with death stare.

                                 ELISHIA
                        You like the first one better, 
                        right?

                                 BACALL
                        Yeah.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Yeah. Come on. 

           INT.BACALL’S ROOM, NIGHT

           Alone with the night, she has a shot of whisky.

           INT.BACALL’S BEDROOM, EARLY MORNING

           The TV is on in the background, non-stop footage of post-
           victory elated voters: joy, joy and more joy.

           She turns it off. Frowns at the sunlight. She’s been up all 
           night. She lays in bed, thinks. Leans over and has another 
           shot.

           Then she gets up.

           EXT.MARK’S HOUSE, EARLY MORNING

           In pajama bottoms and no top, he opens the door. Squints at 
           her. She’s wobbling a little.

                                 BACALL
                        I thought...hey. Sorry, did I wake 
                        you?
                                 MARK
                        Yeah, what’s up?

           His hands are folded across his chest, not so much in anger, 
           more in fear of what might happen if they touched each other.

                                 BACALL
                        I thought I’d just come by and get 
                        my blow jobs back.

                                 MARK
                        Eh?

                                 BACALL
                        Before it gets too late. I just 
                        thought, you know, “I’m in the 
                        area, I’ll stop by Mark’s and get 
                        back my blow-jobs.”

                                 MARK
                        What? Have you been drinking? 
                        You’ve been drinking! You don’t 
                        drink.

                                 BACALL
                        No, I didn’t. Not until you drove 
                        me to it.

                                 MARK
                        Bacall...

                                 BACALL
                        I’ll just hang out here while you 
                        get them. 

                                 MARK
                        You’re being mental.

                                 BACALL
                        I gave them to you because we were 
                        in love! Then you left me! Now give 
                        them back!

                                                            CUT TO:

           SIX WEEKS LATER

           INT.APARTMENT

           Bacall is at the top of a ladder, painting her living room. 
           Pepto-Bismol pink, with red wash over it.
           Elishia, is looking up, appalled.

                                 BACALL
                        I’m trying to cheer myself up. You 
                        know, get out of this funk.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Like, “My heart hurts. It would 
                        make things better if I lived 
                        inside a lung”?

                                 BACALL
                        Yes. Like that.

                                 ELISHIA
                        I don’t care for it.

                                 BACALL
                        It needs my Shephard Fairey 
                        paintings.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Him?

           She points at a print of the famous Obama ‘HOPE’ poster, 
           hanging on one of the walls.

                                 BACALL
                        Yeah. He did that. I own two of his 
                        paintings from eight years ago. 
                        Neil has them. He never gave them 
                        back after we broke up. He never 
                        even came to Mom’s funeral the next 
                        year. Prick!

           She thinks.

                                 BACALL
                        Yeah. Eight years ago. I know 
                        because Neil and I met at a viewing 
                        party the night Bush was first 
                        elected. 

           She qualifies this.

                                 BACALL
                        Sort of elected.

           Flashback:

           EXT. SNOW COVERED NEW YORK CITY, 2000
           INT. DOWNTOWN PARTY

           Bacall, young and with pink hair, is watching the election 
           results come in. Things don’t look to be going how the room 
           wants.

                                 BACALL
                        If Bush gets in, I’m throwing my 
                        shoes out the window.

           They keep watching, waiting for results until she falls 
           asleep. A male hand gently shakes her awake.

                                 BACALL
                        What?! Who won?

                                 MALE VOICE
                        Nobody.

                                 BACALL
                        Somebody has to win.

                                 MALE VOICE
                        Nobody’s won. It’s too close to 
                        call.

           She jumps off the bed and takes off her shoe. Goes to the 
           window and throws it as far as she can.

           Almost instantly:

                                 BACALL
                        I wish I hadn’t done that.

                                                        CUT BACK TO:

           Present day:

                                 BACALL
                        The distress of waiting for those 
                        results made me extremely 
                        impulsive. Not only did I get 
                        together with Neil, who I never 
                        would have gone for normally, but I 
                        spent everything I had earned since 
                        culinary school.
           INT.ART GALLERY

           Portraits of Public Enemy’s Flava Flav and Chuck D, both by 
           Shephard Fairey, hang on the wall of a small, downtown art 
           show.

                                 BACALL
                        I’ll take them both.

                                 GALLERISTA
                        Are you a big Public Enemy fan?

                                 BACALL
                        (cheerful) Not especially.

           She writes out a check for $2000.

           The artist watches her in surprise.

                                 SHEPHARD FAIREY
                        Thank you. Wow.

                                                            CUT TO:

           Present day

           INT.HOME

                                 BACALL
                        Neil! What a jerk. Those paintings 
                        would look great there. Or by the 
                        door. 

                                 ELISHIA
                        Hey, I want to do another round of 
                        mail to publishers before the post 
                        office closes. You okay?

                                 BACALL
                        Yup. 

           INT.HOME

           As soon as she’s gone, Bacall starts to weep again.

           Reaching for a high spot whilst sobbing, she tumbles off the 
           ladder.
           INT.EMERGENCY ROOM

           Bacall is delirious with pain killers.

                                 NURSE
                        It’s broken pretty badly.

                                 BACALL
                        (just coming to) My heart?

                                 NURSE
                        No, dear. Your nose.

           INT.HOSPITAL

           Elishia is in a corner with the nurse.

                                 ELISHIA
                        She doesn’t have health insurance.

                                 NURSE
                        Who does?

                                 ELISHIA
                        Not her. She owns her own bakery.

                                 NURSE
                        Yum-o!

                                 ELISHIA
                        It was foreclosed last month. I 
                        worked there.

                                 NURSE
                        Oh.

           The nurse looks at her paperwork.

                                 NURSE
                        Her emergency contact number is 
                        Mark Friday. 

                                 ELISHIA
                        Um. That’s out of date.

                                 NURSE
                        Mark Friday, like the musician?

                                 ELISHIA
                        Like the musician.
                                 NURSE
                        Oh, I don’t like him. He looks 
                        dirty!

                                 ELISHIA
                        Yes. Yes, he does.

           INT.HOSPITAL

           She gets off the phone.

                                 BACALL
                        What did he say?

                                 ELISHIA
                        Mark says that he would...prefer to 
                        support you from a distance. 

                                 BACALL
                        What does that even mean?

                                 ELISHIA
                        I guess it means...um, if you had 
                        an annual charity telethon drive, 
                        he would make a large anonymous 
                        donation?

                                 BACALL
                        He knows I don’t have insurance.

                                 ELISHIA
                        He knows.

                                 BACALL
                        He doesn’t want to help with the 
                        bill?

                                 ELISHIA
                        He does not want to help. He 
                        doesn’t think it will help to 
                        clarify the separation.

                                 BACALL
                        You know he’s worth, like...

                                 ELISHIA
                        I know. He doesn’t want to pay.

           Bacall nods her head.
                                 BACALL
                        He knows I have no family. Six 
                        weeks ago he wanted me to have his 
                        children, what’s his..Ow! Ow!

                                 ELISHIA
                        Quiet down there, lady.

                                 BACALL
                        It hurts so bad.

           She is talking about two separate things. Elishia sits on the 
           end of her bed. It’s hard for a younger woman to try and 
           emotionally comfort an older woman, and they both know it.

                                 ELISHIA
                        I don’t know what to say to make 
                        you feel better.

                                 BACALL
                        Please try.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Well.

           She digs deep into herself for the right thing to say.

                                 ELISHIA
                        His finger-less gloves are both an 
                        affectation and an affliction.

                                 BACALL
                        Thank you.

           INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA

           Elishia has the final bill in front of her and Bacall, 
           dressed, and with a cast on her nose and two black eyes, is 
           too frightened to look.

                                 BACALL
                        I can’t. Just tell me. Is it more 
                        than 5000?

           Elishia points her finger upwards.

                                 BACALL
                        More than 10,000?

           She points her finger upwards.
                                 BACALL
                        How much?

                                 ELISHIA
                        You want me to tell you?

                                 BACALL
                        How much?

                                 ELISHIA
                        Eighteen thousand.

           EXT.STREET

           Bacall discharged, they are walking past rows of Obama HOPE 
           posters.

                                 BACALL
                        My Shepard Fairey paintings have to 
                        be worth so much more now because 
                        of Obama winning.

                                 ELISHIA
                        And?

                                 BACALL
                        I can sell those and cover the 
                        bill. I’ve got to get them back.

                                 ELISHIA
                        That’s a great idea. You need a 
                        lawyer?

                                 BACALL
                        No. I can’t afford a lawyer. I’m 
                        just going to go to New York and 
                        get them.

           She looks at her.

                                 BACALL
                        Neil lives in Brooklyn still. You 
                        said you wanted to go to D.C for 
                        the inauguration. You could 
                        distribute your book along the way. 
                        No-one relies on conventional 
                        publishing anymore. We’ll drive 
                        from here to the east coast and 
                        push your books the whole way. 
                        You’ll create word of mouth.
                                 ELISHIA
                        So a publisher will hear about the 
                        buzz and buy it.

                                 BACALL
                        Exactly. Swing over to New York to 
                        get my paintings and be down in DC 
                        by January 3rd. I mean, 
                        technically, we could probably do 
                        the trip in fourteen hours. But 
                        let’s stretch it out for ten days. 
                        See the country. Get the book out 
                        there.

           Elishia looks unconvinced.

                                 BACALL
                        Come on, you’ve finished school. 

                                 ELISHIA
                        Yeah. 

                                 BACALL
                        You don’t need to be in LA because 
                        you’ve decided not to try and break 
                        into comedy anymore.

                                 ELISHIA
                        No more.

                                 BACALL
                        You don’t have a boyfriend.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Don’t want one.

                                 BACALL
                        And you don’t have a job right now 
                        ‘cos I took that from you with my 
                        bad financial planning.

                                 ELISHIA
                        It wasn’t your fault it closed...

                                 BACALL
                        We got nothing but time.

           She thinks.

                                 BACALL
                        Time and debts. 

           Elishia still looks uncertain.
                                 BACALL
                        The pre-adolescent feminists need 
                        you. Come with me!

           EXT. BACALL’S APARTMENT

           It’s a sunny day and the rental car is loaded up with boxes 
           of books. They just have rucksacks of clothes. She looks at 
           her apartment as she revs the car, stalling as she speaks:

                        The nights I told Mark we should be 
                        apart last summer, to maintain some 
                        semblance of independence, he’d 
                        drive over at 2 or 3 in the 
                        morning, just to watch me sleep. 
                        Through that window. He admitted 
                        that right before he went off on 
                        this tour.

           Should Elishia say this or not? Fuck it.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Maybe, next time, instead of 
                        picking someone who watches you 
                        through the window while you 
                        sleep...maybe next time you should 
                        pick someone who just shows up when 
                        they’re supposed to.

           Bacall says nothing, still stalling.

           INT.DINER, OUTSKIRTS OF L.A

                                 BACALL
                        Now. Since we’re bothering to do 
                        this, I went ahead and made a list 
                        of all of my exes and what each of 
                        them owes me. This is the list of 
                        what I’m going to get back from 
                        each of them. They’re all stops 
                        along the way. 

                                 ELISHIA
                        Why bother?

                                 BACALL
                        I’m gonna turn thirty before we get 
                        to D.C. I want my shit back.

           Elishia reads it.
                                 ELISHIA
                        You’ve had lovers everywhere. What 
                        are you, a pirate?

                                 BACALL
                        A buccaneer. A pioneer. I spent 
                        most of my twenties running hither 
                        and thither.

                                 ELISHIA
                        And yon.

                                 BACALL
                        And also yon. What do you think?

           Elishia spreads out a map.

                                 ELISHIA
                        It’s the “yon” that pushes it into 
                        post-feminist territory. This is do-
                        able. It doesn’t make a lot of 
                        sense to curl over there and curve 
                        back on ourselves. But we can do 
                        it. 

                                 BACALL
                        What if we fly from Louisiana up to 
                        Ohio? I have enough air miles for 
                        that part. I can cover both of us.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Okay, wait, but first we could take 
                        the 101 up to...wait. When we get 
                        to here we could take the 90 to the 
                        11. But after that we’d have to...

                                 BACALL
                        You don’t have to tell me how. Can, 
                        we, can you just get us there?

           Elishia folds up the map.

                                 ELISHIA
                        I am really glad I’m not your 
                        boyfriend.

           Bacall takes back her list.

                                 BACALL
                        Yeah, well, so are they.
                                 ELISHIA
                        I think you’re going to have a hard 
                        time getting some of these 
                        returned. I mean, the second guy?

                                 BACALL
                        I know.

                                 ELISHIA
                        What are you thinking?

                                 BACALL
                        I’m going to try. Really, it’s this 
                        one I’ve lost the most sleep over. 

           She points at a name on the list.

                                 BACALL
                        We don’t talk. I just don’t like 
                        him having it. 

                                 ELISHIA
                        So we’ll start there.

                                 BACALL
                        It’s been bothering me for years.

           Flashback:

           A swirl of pink hair, a flash of alabaster skin. The sound of 
           heavy breathing. The unmistakable whir of an old fashioned 
           Polaroid camera as flash whites out the screen. 

           When the picture comes back, we’re in:

           peanut M and Ms into her mouth as she drives, Bacall quotes 
           ‘Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas’:

                                 BACALL
                        We were somewhere around Barstow on 
                        the edge of the desert when the 
                        drugs began to take hold...

                                 ELISHIA
                        No!

                        But..Bette.

                                 ELISHIA
                        No Bette for you, fatty.

                                 BACALL
                        That’s meaner than the thing you 
                        said at the rest stop, and that was 
                        the meanest thing I ever heard.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Jesus Christ, you’re annoying!

                                 BACALL
                        Should have thought of that before 
                        you went on a ten day road trip 
                        with me.

           Arizona’s beautiful scenery flashes by in the heat, as we 
           hear the V.O of Bacall writing a letter:

                                 BACALL V.O
                        Dear President Obama,

           I am writing to complain, in the strongest possible terms, 
           about what I have come to interpret as your failure to 
           consider the feelings of people who might currently be 
           experiencing a broken heart. Whilst I am glad to hear that 
           Michelle is your best friend of sixteen years and that you 
           would be nothing without her, your complete lack of tact in 
           parading your adoration of your wife is causing considerable 
           pain to me and many like me. In addition, why are you so good 
           looking? This only makes things harder as we are forced to 
           imagine an attractive couples happy home life, as opposed to 
           the relative joy brought to one another by two homely people. 
           I know it is said that Kennedy was our most handsome 
           President but, in my opinion, he was a good man with too many 
           teeth. Your elegant bone structure is making my recovery 
           harder. In conclusion, I cannot help wishing your children 
           were slightly less adorable. Every time I see Malia or Sasha 
           in a bold fashion choice, my heart dies a little more. I had 
           been promised kids by my fiance - parentheses, asshole, close 
           parentheses - and even though the names he’d picked were 
           retarded - Steinbeck if it was a boy, Chevrolet if it was a 
           girl - they would have been very attractive children. Like 
           yours.

           Hoping this issue will be dealt with sooner, rather than 
           later.

           Kind regards,

           Bacall Loomis.

                        You can’t send this.

                                 BACALL
                        I wasn’t actually going to mail it.

           Beat.

                                 BACALL
                        I was going to hand deliver it. 
                        Since we’re driving all the way to 
                        D.C.

                                 ELISHIA
                        We’ll be arrested.

                                 BACALL
                        No we won’t. It’s a new era. He 
                        wants to listen to his people. He 
                        said so.

                                 BACALL
                        Okay, you’re right.

           Elishia takes it and folds it into the glove compartment.

           Beat.
                                 BACALL
                        Maybe I should address it to 
                        Michelle. She’s a woman. She’ll get 
                        it.

                                 ELISHIA
                        No, I mean Barack’s definitely 
                        sensitive and evolved enough to get 
                        these things...

           Opening the glove compartment, Bacall grabs the letter back, 
           adds to it with biro.

                        Sensitive and evolved. Not helping

           As they get into town, Elishia puts a tick against the first 
           name on the list Bacall made.

                                 BACALL
                        What’s the post-feminist 
                        perspective?

                                 ELISHIA
                        There’s diverse opinion.

                                 BACALL
                        I mean, everyone has a porno 
                        picture in their past, right?

                                 ELISHIA
                        I don’t think so. Not everybody 
                        does. I don’t. 

                                 BACALL
                        Look, he was older than me, I was 
                        trying to keep up. You know, I 
                        trusted him. I just admired him so 
                        much. He’s a human rights lawyer. 
                        It was just one Polaroid. We were 
                        totally in love.

                                 ELISHIA

                        Mambazo.

                        But you can’t sing.

                                 BACALL
                        I know. It was weird. I just fell 
                        into it.

           They get to his law offices, sweating a little in the heat. 
           Bacall goes in whilst Elishia waits in the car. She comes

                        going to start doing what I

                                 ED
                        I have to be honest: my heart 
                        wasn’t really in it. You know: 
                        “Ooh, so and so doesn’t want to die 
                        by lethal injection” and “So and so 
                        at least wants to understand his 
                        Miranda rights before he’s bitten 
                        by German Shepherds”. It just 
                        seemed like a lot of work. 

           He looks over at Bacall, who still has the cast on her nose.

                                 ED
                        You know, I have a friend whose 
                        interested in broken bones.

                                 BACALL
                        A surgeon?

                                 ED
                        Ha, that’s funny! No, I mean 
                        sexually...interested. Get a good 
                        price for certain photos 
                        with...that...on.

           The doorbell rings. Ed goes out of the room to accept a 
           package.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Ugh!

                                 BACALL
                        He was younger and less creepy when 
                        we dated. Okay, where would it be? 

                                 ELISHIA
                        There are filing cabinets here.
           We see one of the cabinets and the drawers marked: “The 
           Disappeared”, “DNA switch” etc.

           Elishia is at the other cabinet.

                                 ELISHIA
                        I think this is the one you’re 
                        looking for. Okay, it’s by 
                        category. ‘Asian Eyelid Fetish’. 
                        ‘Puerto Rican Toe Fucking’.

           Gagging, Bacall sees a file marked ‘Punk Rock Chicks’. She 
           flicks through it until she sees a flash of bright pink hair.

           Ed walks back in.

                                 ED
                        Hey. What are you guys doing?

           He’s always hopeful things will devolve into a photo-shoot. 
           One senses this carries him at the gym, at the supermarket, 
           through the library.

                                 BACALL
                        I was getting my Polaroid back.

           He looks at it.

                                 ED
                        That’s you?

                                 BACALL
                        Yes. That is me.

                                 ED
                        Woah! I forgot about that. I can 
                        use that. That’d sell to Amateur 
                        Magazine for a couple hundred.

                                 BACALL
                        I’m taking it with me.

           He steps back politely.

                                 ED
                        Did you sign a release? I’m sorry 
                        Bacall, but that’s standard with my 
                        shoots.

                                 BACALL
                        No, I didn’t sign a release. We 
                        were in love. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BACALL(cont'd)
                        We had just come back from a sit in 
                        at City Hall that morning.

           Ed looks baffled.

                                 ED
                        In love, in love, in love.

                                 BACALL
                        (outraged) It’s not a sub-genre!

                                 ED
                        (Dismissive) No. It wouldn’t work.

           He looks at the Polaroid again.

                                 ED
                        Let me think about it.

           She snatches it away.

                                 BACALL
                        No!

           He raises his eyebrows.

                                 ED
                        You’re just hurt that I forgot 
                        about it. That I haven’t spent the 
                        last six years whacking off to it.

                                 BACALL
                        No. I’m hurt that I was put in that 
                        position.

                                 ED
                        In that position?

           She ignores his double entendre.

                                 BACALL
                        In the position of being exploited 
                        like this, by an older boyfriend, 
                        who then keeps the picture in a 
                        filing cabinet next to Puerto Rican 
                        Toe Fucking!

                                 ED
                        Well...I mean...why else would you 
                        have a twenty-three year old 
                        girlfriend? You know? It wasn’t for 
                        the conversation.
                                 BACALL
                        GOD you’re a prick!

                                 ED
                        (primly affronted) I don’t think I 
                        want you in my place of work.

                                 BACALL
                        I don’t want to be in your place of 
                        work. 

           She adds as she storms out.

                                 BACALL
                        And I really don’t want to be in 
                        your past.

           INT.CAR

           Bacall is driving. Fast. Furious.

                                 ELISHIA
                        They say that pornography makes men 
                        hate women. But equally, it really 
                        makes women hate men. 

           Bacall looks over to see Elishia putting a magazine in the 
           glove compartment.

                                 BACALL
                        What’s that?

                                 ELISHIA
                        It was in his mail. I picked it up 
                        on the way out. It’s too crazy. I 
                        couldn’t resist.

           She shows her the title. It’s a porn magazine called ‘Suck It 
           Or Leave!’

                                 BACALL
                        Oh my God!

                                 ELISHIA
                        Do you think there are any pictures 
                        of people leaving?

           Bacall doesn’t answer. They drive in silence for a spell.
                                 ELISHIA
                        Are all your ex boyfriends raging 
                        assholes?

                                                       FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. MARK’S HOUSE

           Bacall is wearing a cat costume. Mark is in his pajama 
           bottoms, no top and finger-less gloves. They are spooning in 
           front of the television, eating red velvet cake whilst 
           watching ‘Key Largo’. He absentmindedly strokes her cat ears.

           Cut back to the car, present day:

           INT.CAR

                                 BACALL
                        No.

           Elishia turns on the car radio. With perfect timing, the D.J 
           introduces a song by Mark.

                                 BACALL
                        Turn it off. I can’t listen to him.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Is that...is that passion in his 
                        voice? Or does he sound like a 
                        trust fund kid whose daddy just 
                        confiscated his credit card? 

                                 BACALL
                        Stop it!

           She waits.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Mark Friday looks like the best 
                        looking guy who works at Starbucks, 
                        who wants to be a rock star, but 
                        can’t because he isn’t any good. 

                                 BACALL
                        I’m hurting, here!

                                 ELISHIA
                        Why do we even have relationships, 
                        anyway?

           Bacall looks at the cars behind in the side mirror.
                                 BACALL
                        My dad once gave me a book of 
                        poetry by Art Garfunkel. 

                                 ELISHIA
                        Oh dear.

                                 BACALL
                        It really illuminated for me the 
                        importance of being part of a 
                        partnership.

                                                        CUT BACK TO:

           FLASHBACK:

           INT. MARK’S BATHROOM

                                 MARK
                        BACAAAAAALL!!!

           She comes running up the stairs, dashing from room to room.

                                 BACALL
                        What is it?

           He points into the toilet. She looks down. We don’t see in 
           there.

                                 MARK
                        If you eat red velvet cake, the 
                        next day you do a red velvet shite.

           She puts her arms around him from behind. He kisses her 
           shoulder.

                                                        CUT BACK TO:

           INT. CAR

           Bacall zones out of her memory and back into the present. 
           Blinking:

                                 BACALL
                        I think, having rescued me from 
                        Puerto Rican Toe Fucking, now would 
                        be an opportune moment to try and 
                        sell feminism to pre-teens.
           INT.BOOK STORE

           As Bacall hangs back in the cook book section, Elishia is 
           taking a rather dubious store manager through her book. He’s 
           audibly gasping as she flicks through the pages.

                                 ELISHIA
                        I chose the illustrator from scores 
                        who wanted to work on this. It’s 
                        important, with a project like 
                        this, to have really honest 
                        depictions...of body parts. Don’t 
                        you think?  

                                 BOOK STORE MANAGER
                        What is that?

           She points to a verbal description beneath it, that we 
           haven’t time to read.

           He slams the book shut, just missing her fingers.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Well, uh, I leave it with you.

           INT.HOSPITAL ROOM, EDGE OF NEW MEXICO

           Bacall has the cast on her nose removed and is left with two 
           black eyes.

           Elishia, eating a Kit-Kat, is looking dejected.

                                 BACALL
                        That town was too conservative. 
                        It’s not a good representation of 
                        how the stores will be as we get 
                        further along.

           Elishia doesn’t want to talk about it. As the nurse swabs off 
           the traces off glue, Bacall keeps looking at her nose in the 
           mirror.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Will you stop? It looks exactly the 
                        same. Why do you care so much? 
                        Whose next?

                                 BACALL
                        Patrick - the poet, who got 
                        religion.

                        Must be working for him: he was 
                        awarded a place at the New Mexico 
                        writer’s workshop. Just moved here 
                        for it a few months ago.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Him? And you’re trying to make him 
                        give you back...

           Elishia takes out the sheet of paper with the list on it, 
           checks Patrick.

                                 ELISHIA
                        You’re not going to get it back off 
                        him. No way.

                                 BACALL
                        Gonna try.

           EXT.SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO

           As they pull beside him in their car, the man Bacall knows as 
           Patrick is walking along the side of the road. He is an 
           Orthodox Jew, with pais, tallis, a yalmulke and an enormous 
           beard. They’re warm just in their T-shirts.

                                 BACALL
                        Patrick? Patrick?

           She sighs.

                                 BACALL
                        Moishe?

           He answers automatically, in the thickest Dublin accent you 
           have ever heard on screen:

                                 MOISHE
                        Shabbat shalom. 

           He looks at her.

                                 MOISHE
                        Bacall Loomis, as I live and 
                        breathe. What are you doing here? 
                        What happened to your eye?

                                 BACALL
                        Huh?

           She has to reacquaint herself with his accent.
                                 MOISHE
                        What...happened...to..your...eye?

                                 BACALL
                        I broke my nose. 

                                 MOISHE
                        Ow. You look less Jewish now. More 
                        Roman.

                                 BACALL
                        Can we give you a ride?

                                 MOISHE
                        No, darlin’, I’ve to walk. It’s the 
                        sabbath.

                                 BACALL
                        Your real name is Patrick O’Reilly.

                                 MOISHE
                        So it is. Like Muhammad Ali, I tink 
                        of dat as my slave name.

           She huffs and gets out of the car making a “five minutes” 
           sign at Elishia.

           She walks alongside Moishe.

                                 BACALL
                        I’m here because I’m on this road 
                        trip to Obama’s inauguration and 
                        I’m stopping at all my ex-
                        boyfriends, getting something back 
                        from each of them.

                                 MOISHE
                        Ah, deadly! Fecking poetry, that 
                        is. And what did you want from me?

           She stops walking. Faces him.

                                 BACALL
                        I want my religion back. It’s mine. 
                        And you can’t have it.

                                 MOISHE
                        You never fecking used it!

                                 BACALL
                        But I might have wanted to.
                                 MOISHE
                        Why can’t both of us have it?

                                 BACALL
                        Why did it have to be such an 
                        extreme? Couldn’t you just have 
                        gone from being Irish to, I don’t 
                        know, Welsh?

                                 MOISHE
                        The Welsh? They’re not as good as 
                        the Irish. But it’s nice that they 
                        keep trying. Seriously, darlin’, 
                        I’m still Irish. Thru and thru. I’m 
                        just not a Catholic anymore.

                                 BACALL
                        Look, isn’t your Mom upset?

                                 MOISHE
                        No, me Mam is just so happy I’m not 
                        wit’ you any more, I can do 
                        whatever I like.

                                 BACALL
                        Was she anti-Semitic?

                                 MOISHE
                        What? No! God, no. She just didn’t 
                        like you.

                                 BACALL
                        Why??

                                 MOISHE
                        She said you were stuck up.

                                 BACALL
                        Was I?

                                 MOISHE
                        A little bit. A bit. It suited you 
                        grand. You weighed a bit more then. 
                        It was very cute. I was gutted when 
                        you left.

                                 BACALL
                        When you started being busy every 
                        Friday night, I assumed you were 
                        seeing a new girl.
                                 MOISHE
                        On my father’s grave, I was at 
                        fecking shabbat dinner. You didn’t 
                        want to come!

                                 BACALL
                        I didn’t believe you.

                                 MOISHE
                        It’d be a boring fecking lie!

                                 BACALL
                        It’s actually pretty interesting.
                        Why did you do it? Because you 
                        loved me so much?

                                 MOISHE
                        Oh I don’t know...I was young and 
                        there were...big...beards. It went 
                        from there. And, yeah, I missed ya.

                                 BACALL
                        But you’d already headed that way, 
                        before we broke up.

                                 MOISHE
                        But I already knew I was losing ya. 
                        Listen. You brought me to it. And 
                        I’ll always be grateful to you for 
                        that.

                                 BACALL
                        But...you were, really good at 
                        being Irish Catholic. It’s the main 
                        reason I was attracted to you.

                                 MOISHE
                        Really? Ah, that’s sweet. Come to 
                        sabbath services with me. 
                        Synagogue’s just up there. We have 
                        live music. It’s a right craic!

                                 BACALL
                        No tanks. I mean, thanks. So how’s 
                        the poetry going?

                                 MOISHE
                        Ah, ya know, melancholy paeans to a 
                        lost way of life. Didn’t have to 
                        change at all.

           She smiles.
                                 MOISHE
                        Well, it was good to see your 
                        punim.

                                 BACALL
                        Yours too.

           She starts to crack up.

                                 BACALL
                        I’m sorry. That’s just..not a 
                        Jewish face you have.

           He puts his hand in hers.

                                 MOISHE
                        It’s a Hebrew heart though, angel.

                                 BACALL
                        Okay. Okay. I’m not going to take 
                        your heart from you. I know what 
                        that feels like.

                                 MOISHE
                        Here. I want you to have this. 
                        Guard you on your travels, Dorothy.

           He gives her a star of David from around his neck. With his 
           mane of facial hair, he does look straight out of ‘Wizard of 
           Oz’.

                                 BACALL
                        Thank you, Cowardly Hassid

           She tucks it under her T-shirt.

           INT.CAR

           Elishia is driving now.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Did you get what you wanted from 
                        Feargal O’Finklestein?

                                 BACALL
                        No. But I got this.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Pretty.

           Bacall holds it to the light, surprised at how much she likes 
           it.
                                 BACALL
                        Yeah. It is. Kind of.

           INT.BOOK STORE, SANTA FE

           Elishia is trying again, this time in a hipper Santa Fe book 
           store with a turquoise wearing man. As he flicks through it:

                                 BOOK STORE MANAGER 2
                        The language is a little harsh 
                        don’t you think?

                                 ELISHIA
                        Oprah said “va-jay-jay” on her 
                        show. 

                                 BOOK STORE MANAGER
                        She did?

                                 ELISHIA
                        She did, and it’s a start. But I 
                        want to use the correct 
                        terminology. Life doesn’t have time 
                        for va-jay-jays. I don’t want my 
                        genitals to sound like a Motown 
                        group whose best songs were stolen 
                        by Gladys Knight.

           She looks hopeful as the manager keeps flicking through.

           INT.CAR

                                 ELISHIA
                        That was a good one, actually. He 
                        took ten copies.

                                 BACALL
                        You didn’t give him much choice.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Exactly. Next?

                                 BACALL
                        You didn’t know Martin, did you?

                                 ELISHIA
                        I didn’t meet him. 
                                 BACALL
                        Yeah, it’s when I was here, working 
                        as a housekeeper for Terrence 
                        Malick.

           Elishia makes a “What the hell?” face at her.

                                 BACALL
                         I just fell into it.

           She sighs.

                                 BACALL
                        I’m not a great housekeeper.

                                 ELISHIA
                        I know.

                                 BACALL
                        I used Windex on this roll of film 
                        and, accidentally ruined an hour of 
                        a movie he’d been working on for a 
                        decade.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Why the hell would you clean a roll 
                        of film?

                                 BACALL
                        I was trying to be meticulous. I 
                        just thought I should wipe down 
                        everything. 

                                 ELISHIA
                        Why did it end with Martin? Did you 
                        wipe him down with Windex?

                                 BACALL
                        He was kind of a jerk.

                                 ELISHIA
                        He broke up with you?

                                 BACALL
                        No. I broke up with him.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Because he was a jerk?

                                 BACALL
                        Mmm, he was, but that’s not exactly 
                        the real reason I left him.
           She looks at her lap.

                                 BACALL
                        This is something I’m really not 
                        proud of.

           Elishia’s face says “Yeah?”

                                 BACALL
                        He’s too good looking. 

                                 ELISHIA
                        Really.

                                 BACALL
                        He’s a personal trainer - that’s 
                        how we met, at the gym - and he is 
                        so freaking beautiful. Incredible 
                        blue eyes. And his body - I 
                        couldn’t relax during sex. I’d look 
                        up at him, and...it’s just no fun 
                        to feel less pretty than your 
                        boyfriend. He had these wall to 
                        floor mirrors in his apartment, not 
                        just the bedroom. It was crazy.

                                 ELISHIA
                        So he could watch you during sex?

                                 BACALL
                        So he could watch himself during 
                        sex. And when he made toast. I’m 
                        not gonna flatter myself. I mean, I 
                        was cute, I got attention. But this 
                        guy is an adonis. On the inside, 
                        not so much going for him. And not 
                        that great in bed, either. Never 
                        had to try because girls are just 
                        so dazzled by his body.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Wait, what are we getting from him?

                                 BACALL
                        He kept my mother’s recipe for 
                        kugel, just to spite me. I cooked 
                        it for him every sunday. He’d be 
                        working out, and whilst I was 
                        getting it ready, it’s like I was 
                        alone with my mom. It was sort of 
                        my meditation after she died. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BACALL(cont'd)
                        I have my dad’s old movies and my 
                        mom’s recipes. The kugel was a good 
                        one. 

                                 ELISHIA
                        Aren’t there other recipes for 
                        kugel? 

                                 BACALL
                        They aren’t my mother’s. They don’t 
                        have the secret ingredients.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Which are?

                                 BACALL
                        That’s the thing. I’m so good at 
                        keeping secrets, I forget them 
                        entirely. I’ve been trying to 
                        remember that for five years.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT.MARTIN’S HOUSE, AUSTIN, TEXAS

           With cardigans over their T-shirts now, they buzz the 
           intercom.

                                 MARTIN
                        Yeah?

                                 BACALL
                        Martin, it’s Bacall. And my friend 
                        Elishia. You ready for us?

           The door buzzes. They go up the stairs.

                                 BACALL
                        God, this is just the same as I 
                        remember it. That was there. This 
                        was here. Wow, still here from two 
                        years ago.

           A fat man with very blue eyes opens the door.

                                 MARTIN
                        Hi, Bacall.

                                 BACALL
                        Hi.

           A beat, as she waits for him to introduce himself. He just 
           stares at her. It suddenly dawns on her:
                                 BACALL
                        Martin?

           His voice is monotone and unfriendly.

                                 MARTIN
                        Yes. You wanted to see me.

                                 BACALL
                        Martin.

                                 MARTIN
                        Yes. Hi. How are you. Good to see 
                        you. What’s going on?

                                 BACALL
                        We’re doing a road trip...

           He waits. She looks at him. He admires his blue eyes in the 
           ceiling to floor mirrors.

                                 BACALL
                        Everything in here is exactly the 
                        same as it’s always been. It hasn’t 
                        changed at all.

           Except him. It’s overwhelming. She’s trying not to say 
           anything. But it’s like she has Tourettes.

                                 BACALL
                        Are you hungry?

                                 MARTIN
                        No. I ate.

                                 BACALL
                        I’m hungry.

                                 MARTIN
                        There’s a diner down the street.

                                 BACALL
                        You don’t have anything here?

                                 MARTIN
                        Not really. I’m kinda busy, so...

                                 BACALL
                        Well...

           The phone rings.
                                 MARK
                        Excuse me.

           As he leaves the room, she runs into the kitchen, opens the 
           fridge.

           Rows and rows and rows of kugel. Kugel to the max. Nothing 
           but kugel.

           She goes through the cupboards looking for the box containing 
           all the recipes. 

                                 BACALL
                        Distract him.

           INT.LIVING ROOM

           Elishia leans against the wall, flaunting her cleavage at 
           Martin.

                                 ELISHIA
                        You must get hit on a lot?

                                 MARTIN
                        Quite a lot. 

           He’s still looking at himself in the mirror, though. Without 
           looking away from himself he asks:

                                 MARTIN
                        Why? You want some?

           INT.KITCHEN

                                 BACALL
                        Score!

           Recognizing her mom’s handwriting, Bacall finds the recipe 
           card, puts it in her pocket.

           She goes into the living room.

           INT.LIVING ROOM

           Martin drags his eyes away from himself.

                                 BACALL
                        I just wanted to see you and now 
                        that I’m seeing you, I feel over-
                        whelmed.
           Monotone:

                                 MARTIN
                        I could have told you that would 
                        happen.

           EXT.AUSTIN

           They are both sort of shell shocked as they walk, fast and 
           faster.

                                 BACALL
                        I...don’t think he knows. Is that 
                        possible?

                                 ELISHIA
                        It’s admirable. The most hideous 
                        man in the world looks in the 
                        mirror and sees a God and the most 
                        beautiful woman looks and sees a 
                        pig.

                                 BACALL
                        That would have happened anyway, 
                        wouldn’t it? I mean, we all age.

                                 ELISHIA
                        I don’t know. He seems pretty happy 
                        with himself.

                                 BACALL
                        Memory is an interesting thing.

           She pulls the recipe out of her pocket.

                                 BACALL
                        I’m scared of this, now.

           EXT.TEXAS

           They’re in a motel, enjoying the TV

                                 ELISHIA
                        I want to hit the road by 6 a.m. 
                        We’ll be in New Orleans by your 
                        birthday.

           As they’re talking, the Grammy nominations are being 
           announced on screen. 
           “In a surprising upset, Mark Friday is nominated for song of 
           the year.”

           Both their heads whip around.

                                 ELISHIA
                        What?

                                 BACALL
                        What?

           The TV show then plays a clip of the video for ‘Movin’ On Up’ 
           which is really by Primal Scream but for the purposes of this 
           story is a Grammy nominated song by Mark Friday.

                                 BACALL
                        Wow. That’s amazing. That record 
                        didn’t sell well. How cool to get 
                        the recognition.

           She’s working really hard to sound happy for him.

                                 BACALL
                        Do I send a text to congratulate 
                        him? 

                                 ELISHIA
                        What were you raised to do?

                                 BACALL
                        My parents would have said 
                        congratulate him.

                                 ELISHIA
                        So that’s what you do. You haven’t 
                        changed.

           She looks at the TV again.

                                 ELISHIA
                        He looks like he drives a crane.

           INT.MOTEL, NIGHT

           As Elishia reads magazines, Bacall checks her bank statement 
           and goes through the hospital bill.

                                 BACALL
                        I’m fucking thirty tomorrow.

           She looks over, but Elishia is asleep.
                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. NEW ORLEANS, EVENING

           They drive through the city, seeing both the elegance and 
           beauty of the buildings and the remaining devastation.

                                 BACALL
                        It’s interesting to be here for my 
                        thirtieth birthday since, I too, 
                        feel ruined.

           Elishia isn’t listening.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Look.

           A sign above a bar says ‘Amateur Karaoke Night $500!’

                                 ELISHIA
                        I’m gonna win that.

                                 BACALL
                        I won’t go into a karaoke bar. It’s 
                        against my...I’m against it.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Me too. Let’s go in.

           INT.KARAOKE BAR, NEW ORLEANS

           Elishia’s already drunk and hassling the man with the karaoke 
           clipboard:

                                 ELISHIA
                        Sign me up! Sign me up! I drove all 
                        the way from Los Angeles just to be 
                        here tonight for your contest!

           Meanwhile, poor Bacall is being hit on but a positively 
           strange old guy in a cravat.

                                 LARS
                        I want you to come and live with me 
                        in Monte Carlo.

                                 BACALL
                        Oh.
                                 LARS
                        You must never mention me to the 
                        Duchess of York.

                                 BACALL
                        Okay.

           She gets away from him, sliding up to the bar against TOM, 
           late twenties, a skinny, long lashed, very adorable African-
           American man with the best smile ever.

                                 BACALL
                        Don’t mention him to the Duchess of 
                        York.

                                 TOM
                        Too late.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Elishia? Elishia?

           Bacall yells:

                                 BACALL
                        You’re up.

           But Elishia, chatting to a cute guy, is distracted. 

                                 BACALL
                        How much does the winner get again?

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Five hundred.

           Bacall has a spur of the moment thing.

                                                       FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. ELECTION NIGHT PARTY 2000, NYC

           Bacall throws her shoe out of the window and down into the 
           snow.

                                                        CUT BACK TO:

           INT. KARAOKE BAR

           She goes over to the DJ. Too late, Elishia sees her do it.

                                 BACALL
                        Do you have...
           She whispers to him.

           Across the room:

                                 ELISHIA
                        No. Please no.

           But yes. 

           Bacall hoists herself onto the stage. As the thrashing guitar 
           of the Grammy nominated ‘Movin’ On Up’ by Mark Friday starts 
           up, she looks out at the audience.

           And sings it subversively, tenderly, as a Patsy Cline torch 
           song, sometimes only able to speak-sing, tears streaming 
           silently down her face. She is lit beautifully up on that 
           stage. It is a “moment”.

           INT.CLUB

           As she’s counting out the winner’s cash, Tom reappears.

                                 TOM
                        Hey. I prefer your version. You 
                        have a lovely voice. Really heart 
                        felt.

           How little he knows.

                                 BACALL
                        Thanks.

           She looks up.

                                 BACALL
                        (she jokes) I’m very shy. I’m 
                        Bacall.

                                 TOM
                        Like Lauren Bacall?

                                 BACALL
                        Yes, but far shyer.

                                 TOM
                        What do you do? When you’re not 
                        doing that.

                                 BACALL
                        I don’t do that. 
                                 TOM
                        So...

                                 BACALL
                        I’m a caterer. My specialty is 
                        baking. I opened a cupcake shop 
                        last year. I figured, you know, the 
                        recession, so much money fear, 
                        people want comfort food from their 
                        childhood. 

                                 TOM
                        Awesome! Where is it?

                                 BACALL
                        Um, it closed last year. It was on 
                        Fairfax. Turns out a recession 
                        isn’t the best time to start a new 
                        business.

                                 TOM
                        No.

                                 BACALL
                        What do you do?

                                 TOM
                        I recently graduated Harvard 
                        Business school.

                                 BACALL
                        You’re not from here?

                                 TOM
                        My family is here, which is why I’m 
                        here for the weekend. But I live 
                        and work in D.C.

                                 BACALL
                        What? We’re going there for the 
                        inauguration. We’re on our way 
                        right now.

                                 TOM
                        That’s awesome. Maybe we can meet 
                        up.

                                 BACALL
                        As a Harvard educated black man, 
                        are you getting a romantic bump in 
                        the wake of Obama’s election?
                                 TOM
                        It’s hard to measure. As a Harvard 
                        educated black man, I was fairly 
                        popular in the first place. But I 
                        have thought about it.

                                 BACALL
                        It’s where my mind went when I saw 
                        you. Obama. What do you do?

                                 TOM
                        I work for Obama.

                                 BACALL
                        What?

                                 TOM
                        Yeah. I work for his Chief 
                        Strategist. I really shouldn’t be 
                        here so close to inauguration, but 
                        I hadn’t had a day off in a year.

                                 BACALL
                        It’s my 30th birthday. In case 
                        you’re wondering how old I am. 
                        Thirty.

                                 TOM
                        Let me buy you a beer.

                                 BACALL
                        And my fiance dumped me the night 
                        before the election.

                                 TOM
                        Let me buy you a shot.

           They do the shots.

                                 TOM
                        My friends dragged me in here, by 
                        the way.

                                 BACALL
                        My friend dragged me in here. Oh 
                        look, our friends are friends. This 
                        is my drunk friend’s demented book. 
                        We’ve been trying to start a 
                        revolution.

           He looks at it.
                                 TOM
                        Wow.

           She smiles over at Elishia who is on a table shouting:

                                 ELISHIA
                        Hey everybody! Look at me!

           Cut back to Bacall and Tom:

                                 BACALL
                        She’s actually really smart. (She 
                        pulls a book out of her purse) 
                        Here, take one.

           Cut back to Elishia who is asking her crush:

                                 ELISHIA
                        If you were a My Little Pony would 
                        you want to have a pink tail and a 
                        rainbow on your ass or a unicorn 
                        horn and a shamrock?

           Cut back to Tom and Elishia:

           He folds the book away.

                                 TOM
                        Since you’re going to be in D.C, if 
                        you want, I can probably get you 
                        into the pre-inaugural ball, you 
                        know, the MTV one for the young 
                        folk.

                                 BACALL
                        The night before?

                                 TOM
                        Yes. I can get you tickets, if you 
                        want.

           She blinks.

                                 BACALL
                        Are you...are you my Magical Black 
                        Man?

                                 TOM
                        Eh?
                                 BACALL
                        In movies, when a white person is 
                        lost there’s sometimes a Magical 
                        Black Man, you know like in The 
                        Shawshank Redemption and The Green 
                        Mile.

                                 TOM
                        Are you on death row?

                                 BACALL
                        No, I’m just going across the 
                        country from ex-boyfriend to ex-
                        boyfriend, trying to get my stuff 
                        back.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. KARAOKE BAR

           Elishia leaves the hot dude to barrel up to Bacall.

                                 BACALL
                        He works for Obama! He can get us 
                        tickets for the MTV ball the night 
                        before inauguration! Mark will 
                        totally be there, you know that, 
                        right?

                                 ELISHIA
                        Screw Mark! You should totally f 
                        that dude!

                                 BACALL
                        Really? 

                                 ELISHIA
                        Of course!

           EXT.KARAOKE BAR

           Elishia teeters off with her guy.

           INT.ELISHIA’S ROOM, NIGHT

           Amazing sex, all over the place.
           INT.TOM’S ROOM, NIGHT

           Bacall and Tom are kissing gently. He opens his eyes and sees 
           she’s looking out the window at the moon whilst they kiss.

                                 TOM
                        Can you close your eyes when I kiss 
                        you?

           She pulls away, flustered. Thinks about it.

                                 BACALL
                        No.

           She smiles so as not to cry.

                                 BACALL
                        My heart’s just...my heart’s just 
                        closed.

           She brings her hand down in front of her chest like a 
           guillotine.

                                 TOM
                        It’s okay. I understand. Would you 
                        like me to go?

                                 BACALL
                        Can you stay? Please? I turn thirty 
                        in six minutes. I don’t want to do 
                        it alone.

           He strokes her hair, the moon watching through the window, 
           whilst she cries and cries.

           INT.MOTEL ROOM

           Bacall creeps back into their room and finds Elishia asleep 
           with her guy. Curiously, Elishia is under the covers, but the 
           guy is sleeping over the covers.

           INT.CAR

           Elishia is slumped in the passenger seat, waiting, dark 
           glasses on top of a terrible expression.

                                 ELISHIA
                        So did you have hot sex?
                                 BACALL
                        Yes. It was just like the sex scene 
                        in Thelma and Louise. Um, but with 
                        weeping. And without sex.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Oh, man.

                                 BACALL
                        So, thanks for that.

           Elishia tips up her glasses as she remembers what night it 
           was.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Mark didn’t call?

                                 BACALL
                        No.

                                 ELISHIA
                        No text?

           Bacall shakes her head.

                                 BACALL
                        I just, I mean, to be fair to him, 
                        I suppose it’s always an ex-
                        girlfriend’s birthday somewhere. If 
                        you started, where would you stop? 
                        It’s like how you’re not supposed 
                        to feed Gremlins after midnight. 
                        It’s always after midnight, isn’t 
                        it? So maybe you’ve got to just not 
                        feed them.

           Elishia waits to make sure she’s done.

                                 ELISHIA
                        No. It’s not like that. There’s a 
                        lot about this break up that I 
                        don’t understand - that’s okay, 
                        it’s not my job to. But, actually, 
                        I cannot get past his failure to 
                        wish you well on your thirtieth 
                        birthday. Sorry. Wherever he was, 
                        whatever he was doing, he was too 
                        cowardly or just didn’t care. It 
                        was a failure of decency, and a 
                        failure of basic humanity. 

           She pulls her dark glasses back down.
                                 ELISHIA
                        I had to say that.

           As they drive to the airport, Bacall stares out into broken 
           New Orleans, the boarded up houses left to rot, the ghosts of 
           people left to drown.

                                 BACALL
                        When I came in, you were sleeping 
                        under the covers, but Tom’s friend 
                        was asleep over them.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Of course. I never let guys sleep 
                        under the covers.

           INT. AIRPORT, NEW ORLEANS

           They are reading crappy magazines in the departures lounge. 
           Suddenly Mark’s face is looking at her from one of the pages. 
           An older African-American lady in a fabulous hat, whose been 
           reading over Bacall’s shoulder, blurts:

                                 HAT WOMAN
                        Ooh, Mark Friday. He looks like he 
                        smells bad!

           Not batting an eyelash:

                                 BACALL
                        Heard that one.

                                 HAT WOMAN
                        I read that he likes to...

                                 BACALL
                        That one too.

           Elishia leaps in to change the subject:

                                 ELISHIA
                        If you like dirty things, you’ll 
                        love ‘My First Book of Feminism’. 
                        You have grandchildren?

           The woman flicks through.

                                 HAT WOMAN
                        Ooh! Look at that! I lost my books 
                        when Katrina hit. I’ll take this. 
                                 BACALL
                        Did you lose anything else in 
                        Katrina?

           Hat woman looks at her, perfectly pleasant:

                                 HAT WOMAN
                        Everything! My house survived the 
                        water, thank God. But not the 
                        looters. Didn’t find that out until 
                        I got the bus back from 
                        Mississippi.

           She smiles.

                                 HAT WOMAN
                        I bused out of here again a few 
                        months ago when they said the new 
                        hurricane was coming through. Some 
                        of my neighbours wouldn’t leave.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Even after losing everything you 
                        owned, then making it home and 
                        rebuilding, you still got on a bus 
                        and rode the bus out all over again 
                        when they told you to?

           She turns to her.

                                 HAT WOMAN
                        Of course I did. 

           She shrugs her shoulders.

                                 HAT WOMAN
                        Ain’t nobody got time for all that 
                        drownin’.

           Elishia and Bacall look at each other in amazement. As they 
           leave her she’s looking at the book and laughing merrily 
           away.

           INT.PLANE

           They sit at the back of the plane, still flummoxed by her can 
           do spirit.
                                 ELISHIA
                        The only way Katrina could have 
                        been worse was if it was Jews that 
                        had to get out of the way, instead 
                        of African-Americans.

                                 BACALL
                        Can you imagine the kvetching? That 
                        would not have worked out well.

           INT.PLANE

           As snacks are being served, Bacall is going through her list.

                                 ELISHIA
                        The next one is?

                                 BACALL
                        The next one is the fuckface who 
                        has my dog. You know, the ass who 
                        works as a tour guide at the Rock n 
                        Roll Hall of Fame museum they 
                        opened in Cleveland.

           EXT.CLEVELAND, ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME MUSEUM

           The spectacular I.M.Pei designed glass building, looms before 
           them like a cross between a greenhouse and a Transformer.

           INT.ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME MUSEUM

           Enormous portraits of Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix and Janis 
           Joplin.

           They tag alongside a group of tourists as the guide intones:

                                 GUIDE
                        Every year, the Rock and Roll Hall

                        fifty states and over a hundred 
                        countries...

           Bacall takes him aside.

                                 BACALL
                        Hi. Um, I’m looking for Jeff Wisby?

           The guide doesn’t answer, poker faced.
                                 BACALL
                        Smoked a lot? Always had a cute 
                        little poodle with him? 

                                 GUIDE
                        He doesn’t just smoke now.

           He looks at her.

                                 GUIDE
                        Jeff doesn’t work here anymore. 

                                 BACALL
                        Really? He loved this job.

           The guide considers whether or not to share the following 
           information:

                                 GUIDE
                        He loved it too much. The lifestyle 
                        really got to him. He just went to 
                        the dark side. 

           EXT.HOUSE, CLEVELAND

           As they pull up at an address she has scribbled, they look 
           doubtful. Not a good neighborhood. Not a good looking home. 
           Sketchy as all fuck.

                                 ELISHIA
                        He’ll never give you that dog back. 
                        People go to court for that.

           As Bacall creeps up the over-grown yard, a dog comes 
           lolloping towards her.

                                 BACALL
                        Sonny!

           As he gets closer she sees something isn’t right with him, 
           his gait is off. He gets closer still. He only has three 
           legs.

                                 BACALL
                        What the fuck?

           INT.HOUSE, CLEVELAND

           She pushes open the door of the house. It’s dark and smelly. 
           There’s a sheet being used as a curtain. Guitars everywhere. 
           The dishes are stacked high in the sink. 
           There are a couple of half naked females who look like 70’s 
           Led Zep groupies, sprawled out on a mattress. 

           She realizes that Jeff is on the sofa, staring straight 
           ahead, off his head, Jim Morrison hair and leather pants, a 
           mirror lined with coke in front of him, a crack pipe on the 
           coffee table. 

                                 BACALL
                        Hello, Jeff.

                                 JEFF
                        Hey.

           He squints at her, trying to place her.

                                 BACALL
                        Bacall.

                                 JEFF
                        Of course. Yeah, I knew it was 
                        Bacall or Monroe or some shit.

                                 BACALL
                        We dated for a year!

                                 JEFF
                        Ummm...did you used to be black?

                                 BACALL
                        No. I was always white. We got this 
                        dog together.

                                 JEFF
                        I remember, I remember. Did you 
                        used to have really long nails, so 
                        long they curved over themselves 
                        like the head of a violin?

                                 BACALL
                        No. (beat) You know Sonny our dog?

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah?

                                 BACALL
                        You know how many legs he had when 
                        we got him?

                                 JEFF
                        Like, four or some shit?

                                 BACALL
                        How many does he have now?
           Sonny dances before them.

                                 JEFF
                        Like, three?

                                 BACALL
                        Mmm, what happened?

           She picks up Sonny.

                                 JEFF
                        Oh.

           He thinks.

                                 JEFF
                        He was hot by a car.

                                 BACALL
                        He overheated?

                                 JEFF
                        I mean he was “hit” by a car. 

                                 BACALL
                        Okay. I’m taking him now.

                                 JEFF
                        No, don’t.

           Jeff doesn’t get up, because he can’t.

                                 BACALL
                        That was easy.

           She turns to Sonny.

                                 BACALL
                        Hola.

           He dog-smiles at her.

                                 BACALL
                        Wow. What a waste. Jeff was really 
                        hot.

           (under her breath)

                                 ELISHIA
                        Hot, like crack cocaine.
           INT.BOOK STORE, CLEVELAND

           Bacall watches as Elishia takes an older, female manager 
           through the book. She has long grey hair with fancy 
           chopsticks tucked in it. 

                                 BOOK STORE MANAGER 3
                        How marvellous to have such clear 
                        language and illustrations. 

           The manager points at one:

                                 BOOK STORE MANAGER 3
                        Yes, it’s a beautiful flower.

           Elishia pulls the book back from her.

                                 ELISHIA
                        No. It’s disgusting. They should 
                        know that early on. Be realists 
                        about their bodies.

           INT.CAR RENTAL

           Having witnessed Elishia’s self-destruction in the face of 
           actual interest, Bacall is cross:

                                 BACALL
                        Girls don’t need to hear that about 
                        their bodies. Why don’t you say it 
                        about men instead?

                                 ELISHIA
                        Because everyone knows that penises 
                        are repulsive. That’s just a given.

                                 BACALL
                        So why do you put them inside you?

                                 ELISHIA
                        So I won’t have to look at them! 
                        Obviously.

           As if feeding off their discord, the car splutters and 
           coughs.
                                 BACALL
                        Christ’s sake!

           She rattles the stick shift.

                                 BACALL
                        I’m doing my best here, but this 
                        car is not going to last much 
                        longer. I don’t think we’ll even 
                        make it to the car rental and I 
                        don’t have triple A anymore. 

                                 ELISHIA
                        Me neither. Ah, we’re screwed.

           A thought occurs:

                                 BACALL
                        Not necessarily. There’s someone 
                        else who has something of mine.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Not on the list?

                                 BACALL
                        A foot note. 

           EXT.GARAGE, CLEVELAND

           Bacall is pushing Elishia in the car the last few metres.

                                 BACALL
                        I betcha it’s still here.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Eh?

                                 BACALL
                        Tell it to you straight: I brought 
                        my bike in to be fixed a couple 
                        years back. The mechanic seduced 
                        me. 

           She sees Elishia’s expression.

                                 BACALL
                        They seduced me. Anyway. It didn’t 
                        work out too well and I left town 
                        post haste. 

                                 ELISHIA
                        They probably sold it.
           INT.GARAGE

           There’s no-one there, or so it seems.

                                 BACALL
                        Nobody in their right mind would 
                        sell this bike. It’s a collector’s 
                        item.

           She looks round the back as Elishia holds Sonny.

                                 ELISHIA
                        All the more reason...

                                 BACALL
                        That’s mine!

           A beautiful Ducati. She kicks it, revs it up. It still works.

           At the sound of the engine, a mechanic suddenly slides out 
           from where they’ve been working under a Chevy, like Bruce 
           Springsteen in the video for ‘I’m On Fire’.

           This is Bacall’s mechanic. Denims and flannel. Covered in 
           grime. Unbelievably gorgeous. A female. The most beautiful 
           boy-girl, sullen and loping, dirty brown hair chopped at the 
           jaw and falling in her eyes. 

                                 MIA
                        Well, fuck me!

           Bacall still quakes a little in her presence. Anybody would - 
           man, woman, gay, straight. 

                                 BACALL
                        Nice to see you, Mia. 

                                 MIA
                        Nice? NICE? We never did nice, you 
                        and me. Don’t start now.

                                 BACALL
                        Okay, I won’t. I’ve come back for 
                        my bike.

           Mia laughs.

                                 BACALL
                        Seriously.

                                 MIA
                        Nu-uh, toots.
                                 BACALL
                        Let me have my bike.

           Mia boomingly addresses Elishia, whose melting a little 
           herself.

                                 MIA
                        This girl...this girl told me she 
                        loved me!

                                 BACALL
                        (shame faced) I did love you. In 
                        the moment.

                                 MIA
                        Oh, in the moment was it? See, I 
                        remember it being in the back of a 
                        57 Chevy.

                                 BACALL
                        Old Chevy’s make you feel things.

           She turns to Elishia for support. Mia lollops closer to her.

                                 BACALL
                        Old Chevy’s make you feel things, 
                        right?

                                 ELISHIA
                        No.

           Mia leans in as if to kiss Bacall, stopping just short of her 
           lips, and staying there. She puts her hand on Bacall’s boob. 
           Looks up at her in disgust.

                                 MIA
                        You don’t have a gay bone in your 
                        body.

           Bacall looks down at Mia’s hand.

                                 BACALL
                        I didn’t realize the “gay bone” was 
                        located in the breast.

           Bacall leaps onto her Ducati.

           As she revs it, Mia yells:

                                 MIA
                        Dilettante straight girl! You were 
                        just another time waster. Tourist!
                                 BACALL
                        I’m sorry you feel that way. I 
                        really enjoyed it.

           She jump starts the bike and zooms up to Elishia, who is 
           holding Sonny.

                                 BACALL
                        Get on! 

                                 ELISHIA
                        Hell no!

                                 BACALL
                        Get on!

           EXT.BRIDGE 

           They’re both wearing helmets now. All of this takes place as 
           yelling, in order that they can hear each other.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Jesus, all that resentment from a 
                        one night stand? 

                                 BACALL
                        Yup.

           She thinks.

                                 BACALL
                        A three night stand. I don’t know. 
                        It might have been a week.

                                 ELISHIA
                        You met her when you brought your 
                        bike in?

                                 BACALL
                        Yeah. (beat) And she was my 
                        boyfriend’s sister.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Huh?

                                 BACALL
                        Jeff. That’s Jeff’s sister. Jeff 
                        from the Rock and Roll Museum.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Jeff the burn out? Jeff you got 
                        your dog with??
                                 BACALL
                        C’mon it’s not so weird. You’re 
                        attracted to the brother why 
                        wouldn’t you be attracted to the 
                        sister? It’s all the same genes. 
                        You know, the mom was really 
                        beautiful as I recall.

           INT.AMTRAK TRAIN

           The Ducati is in the hold with people’s luggage.

           Across the aisle from them, a very attractive, polished, late 
           thirties woman is talking extremely loud into a cell phone.

                                 BOOK EDITOR
                        I told him we’re making the deal in 
                        trade paperback because he may 
                        think it brings him greater 
                        literary prestige but hardcover 
                        just won’t sell for him.

           Elishia’s ears prick up.

                                 BOOK EDITOR
                        I’ve been his editor for ten years 
                        and it’s the college kids who buy 
                        his books. They don’t want to pay 
                        for hardcover.

           When she ends her call, Elishia totters towards her, her 
           confidence somewhat subdued in the face of a real industry 
           player. She stands before her until the woman looks up.

                                 ELISHIA
                        You’re a book editor.

                                 BOOK EDITOR
                        How could you know that?!

                                 ELISHIA
                        We heard you. You were loud.

                                 BOOK EDITOR
                        Oh.

           The woman looks down at her blackberry. Elishia looks 
           vulnerable.

                                 ELISHIA
                        I write books. I wrote a book. I’m 
                        looking for a publisher.
           She hands her book across to the woman, waits for her to take 
           it. She doesn’t take it, so Elishia puts it down in front of 
           her. Then sulks back to her seat, somewhat mortified.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Bitch.

           Elishia and Bacall are opposite each other in the carriage.

                                 ELISHIA
                        And you.

                                 BACALL
                        What did I do?

                                 ELISHIA
                        You didn’t give me the full 
                        picture. No wonder Mia hates you. 
                        No wonder Jeff ended up a crack 
                        addict and Martin ate himself into 
                        a frenzy and Ed drifted into 
                        pornography. You left everybody. 
                        That’s why Mark has spun you so 
                        bad. He’s the first one to leave 
                        you. 

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT.TRAIN CAR, EVE

           Elishia is asleep, her words haunting Bacall who is wide 
           awake, as they arrive in New Jersey.

           EXT.STREET, NEW JERSEY

           They’re walking Sonny. The weather has morphed, as they’ve 
           travelled the country, from warm, to sweater weather, to cold 
           to fucking freezing. And the mood is frostier between the 
           girls. Elishia is eating a doughnut.

                                 ELISHIA
                        I can’t believe we had to come to 
                        Dirty Jersey for you to get this. 
                        Like you really need it.

                                 BACALL
                        I do! It’s a hundred bucks on Ebay.

                                 ELISHIA
                        And it’s important to you because?
                                 BACALL
                        He didn’t give it back and I miss 
                        it. I wake up in the night, 
                        sometimes, missing it.

           Elishia finishes the last of the doughnut and instantly says:

                                 ELISHIA
                        Ugh. I feel fat.

                                 BACALL
                        You always say you’re fat. Your 
                        ‘First Book of Feminism’ is really 
                        your first book of feminism. You 
                        want to help girls figure out who 
                        they are because you’re trying to 
                        figure out who you are. Which is 
                        right, at twenty-one.

                                 ELISHIA
                        You’re reading too much into it. 
                        I’m just saying I feel fat. 

                                 BACALL
                        So stop eating doughnuts. 

                                 ELISHIA
                        You don’t understand. You have a 
                        perfect body.

                                 BACALL
                        So if you had my body you could 
                        have had my life that you judge so 
                        hard. These men you disapprove of, 
                        they were just Kit-Kats, right? 
                        Eaten round the edges. They’re junk 
                        food. 

           She’s upset herself now.

                                 BACALL
                        I don’t know what I was thinking.

                                 ELISHIA
                        You weren’t. You were just 
                        consuming.

           INT.HEALTH FOOD STORE

           A man hands them each a green vegetable smoothie.
                                 ELISHIA
                        Thank you.

                                 BACALL
                        Thanks.

           On their way out of the health food store, they pass a 
           freezer of fake meat: Tofurkey and Un-Chicken.

                                 BACALL
                        I thought Mark was a real meal. 
                        Like I had to cook him,

                                 ELISHIA
                        You had to cook your boyfriend?

                                 BACALL
                        Cook the relationship. Braise it 
                        and preheat the over, watch to make 
                        sure it didn’t burn, and gently 
                        garnish it and then when it was all 
                        ready, he threw it in the trash so 
                        he could have the peanut butter 
                        sandwich he’d been craving all 
                        along.

           Elishia points at the ‘Un-Chicken’.

                                 ELISHIA
                        You were in an un-relationship.

           Even though she started it, now Bacall is really pissed off.

                                 BACALL
                        It’s easy to be funny and cynical 
                        about love when you haven’t ever 
                        tried. You make the men you fuck 
                        sleep over the covers. You put 
                        penises inside you so you don’t 
                        have to look at them. What do you 
                        know about love?

           They leave the store.

           The conversation continues...

                                 ELISHIA
                        I don’t know. (beat) I take my joy 
                        and pain from my girlfriends.
           She pulls up her hood.

                                 ELISHIA
                        And I don’t have many good female 
                        friends. They think I’m weird.

           Bacall softens.

                                 BACALL
                        You are.

                                 ELISHIA
                        You think I’ll ever find my path?

                                 BACALL
                        Yeah. This is it. You’re on it.

           They look out at Dirty Jersey stretching before them.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Why the hell were you dating 
                        someone in New Jersey.

                                 BACALL
                        I answered a Craiglist ad for this 
                        woman who wanted models for 50’s 
                        Cheesecake art. I just fell into 
                        it.

           INT.DRIVE IN THEATRE, NEW JERSEY

           BILL is kind of out of shape, but not fat. He has glasses, 
           but they’re actually good on him. His face is sort of smushy, 
           but his eyes are pretty. He’s the guy you could see yourself 
           having a rather decent life with. 

           He and Bacall are in his car, watching a movie on the huge 
           drive in screen, whilst couples in other cars make out. The 
           movie sound comes through their car radio. The film is ‘To 
           Have And Have Not’ starring, of course, Lauren Bacall.

                                 BACALL
                        I’m so relieved you still own this 
                        place. I was afraid it might have 
                        gone under.

                                 BILL
                        (nonchalant) It probably will.
                                 BACALL
                        You seeing anyone?

                                 BILL
                        I was. Total sweetheart but she 
                        bored the shit out of me. I guess, 
                        after you, I was looking to get as 
                        far away as possible from 
                        “interesting”.

           They have an ease and rapport she hasn’t had with anyone else 
           on the trip.

           INT. BOOKSHOP

           Elishia is pitching her book whilst being chatted up by the 
           young, adorable book store manager. There’s a sweetness to 
           her in this meeting. She’s blushing!

                                 ELISHIA
                        So we’ve been driving across the 
                        country, stoking word of mouth.

                                 BOOK STORE MANAGER 4
                        I did hear word of mouth about it. 
                        I heard really bad things.

           She laughs.

                                 ELISHIA
                        AWESOME. That is exactly what I 
                        hoped would happen when I set out 
                        on this trip.

                                 BOOK STORE MANAGER 4
                        Really?

                                 ELISHIA
                        No.

           Her cell rings.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Excuse me.

           Whatever the person on the other end is saying, it causes her 
           jaw to drop.

                                 ELISHIA
                        You read it? That fast? Oh. I’m 
                        just...surprised. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELISHIA(cont'd)
                        No, of course, we’re coming to New 
                        York. I’ll be there.

           She hangs up and looks at the boy.

                                 ELISHIA
                        A publisher just called me back. 
                        She’s a total bitch who I met on 
                        the Amtrak train. But she read my 
                        book and she wants me to come in 
                        and see her next week.

           They’re still in the car, watching the movie.

                                 BILL
                        I heard you were dating Mark 
                        Friday.

                                 BACALL
                        How did you know that?

                                 BILL
                        Saw it in my girlfriend’s tabloid. 
                        That guy is awful. His music is 
                        sonic torture. 

                                 BACALL
                        No it’s not!

                                 BILL
                        Those pictures from Abu Ghraib, of 
                        Sergeant Lyndie England, with the 
                        dogs and the human pyramid? You 
                        know, where she’s pointing at the 
                        prisoner’s genitals? Mark’s music 
                        is off camera.

                                 BACALL
                        Fuck you!

                                 BILL
                        “Mr.Mark Friday will now play a 
                        medley of his hit!” Seriously, that 
                        is the luckiest guy on earth.

                                 BACALL
                        Don’t talk about him like that.

                                 BILL
                        I heard that he likes to..
                                 BACALL
                        BILL! Not appropriate.

                                 BILL
                        Did you fall in love with him?

                                 BACALL
                        He was very kind to me. Very kind.

                                 BILL
                        Which is why you’re on some crazy 
                        road trip, because he didn’t fuck 
                        you up.

                                 BACALL
                        He was the best boyfriend I’ve ever 
                        had. In the relationship.

                                 BILL
                        I wasn’t that good but I was great 
                        when it ended. 

                                 BACALL
                        Yeah.

                                 BILL
                        It’s the ease out that counts.

                                 BACALL
                        You can’t have everything.

                                 BILL
                        You and I were what I like to call 
                        the “curtain call” relationship. 
                        It’s over - no wait, they’re back. 
                        Keep clapping. We were like the 
                        Springsteen of relationships.

           He pauses.

                                 BILL
                        Huge social conscience and stamina. 

           He sighs. 

                                 BILL
                        It all got lost in the squalor of 
                        good intentions.

           Then starts to sing Springsteen:
                                 BILL
                        “Hey little girl, is your daddy 
                        home, did he go away and leave you 
                        in your home...”

                                 BACALL
                        Why would it say “home” twice in 
                        one sentence? That’s not how it 
                        goes. What was it really?

                                 BILL
                        Bacall. As Lee Harvey Oswald said 
                        to the police: “You’re a cop. You 
                        figure it out”.

           She resumes watching the movie, her namesake fifty feet high. 
           Just when she’s getting into it:

                                 BILL
                        By the way, did you know that 
                        Mathew McConaughey is the voice of 
                        meat?

                                 BACALL
                        What?

                                 BILL
                        He is. Whenever you see an advert 
                        for the American meat council, 
                        that’s his voice-over.

           She frowns and tries to concentrate on the film again.

                                 BILL
                        So who are you hitting up next?

                                 BACALL
                        Neil. In New York. The one before 
                        you. He started this. I just want 
                        my Shepard Fairey paintings back. 

                                 BILL
                        How did it end?

                                 BACALL
                        Totally fine, so I don’t get why 
                        he’s been such an ass about this. 
                        Never returned a call or E-mail, 
                        ever. Ah, the guy was just so 
                        direction-less, you know?

                                 BILL
                        How did you leave him?
           Bacall looks at her shoes.

                                 BACALL

           Flashback:

           INT.LOFT, BROOKLYN, EVENING

           Bacall is in a freezing cold, patchy old half renovated loft, 
           frosting a cake. She looks at the framed ‘happy couple’ 
           photos of her and Neil as the clock ticks. He’s late. And she 
           just isn’t feeling it. Impulsively, she wipes off the‘Happy 
           Anniversary’ she’d been writing in frosting and replaces it 
           with ‘It’s over’.

                                 BACALL
                        Fine. I mean. Yeah. We just didn’t 
                        speak again.

           They watch the movie some more. Bill is looking over at the 
           other couples.

                                 BILL
                        Wanna make out?

                        Sure.

           They make out, kissing and slithering. He takes her top off. 
           Then they stop at exactly the same time, just not into it. 

                                 BACALL

                        No, it’s weird right? It’s like 
                        kissing my Aunt Tilly.

                        Ugh. You’re such a great guy and 
                        yet you always say the wrong thing.

                                 BACALL
                        Exactly.

           She pulls her sweater on. He helps her with it.

           EXT.HOTEL

            As he drops her at the door he says

                                 BILL
                        Good luck, sweetheart.

           He kisses the top of her head.

                                 BILL
                        You look great.

                                 BACALL
                        Thanks.

                                 BILL
                        Hey. You almost forgot...

                                 BACALL
                        Shit! Thank you!

           He hands her a battered VHS copy of The Dark Crystal.

                                 BILL
                        It won’t be as good as you 
                        remember.

           EXT.BRIDGE

           Bacall, Elishia and Sonny arrive in Manhattan on the Ducati. 
           That skyline unfolding before them....What Truman Capote 
           called “The only real city city”.

           INT.MOTEL 6, NEW YORK

           Sonny is snuggling on the bed with Elishia. As Bacall goes 
           towards the television with her VHS of The Dark Crystal, an 
           advert for meat flashes on.
                                 BACALL
                        Did you know that Mathew McConaghey 
                        is the voice of meat? Hey. There’s 
                        nowhere to watch the video!

                                 ELISHIA
                        Of course there’s nowhere to watch 
                        the video. Nobody has VHS. I don’t 
                        know what you were thinking.

           The ad ends and her heart lurches as she sees Mark being 
           interviewed on the Late Night sofa. He is wearing a hat with 
           his finger-less gloves and has sort of a neckerchief 
           situation going on. Elishia is delighted.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Dude! He looks like he’s in a Dexys 
                        Midnight Runners tribute band. 
                        That’s amazing!

                                 BACALL
                        Stop.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Come on Eileen.

                                 BACALL
                        Can you not...

           Elishia shuts up.

           For a minute. Then says as fast as she can:

                                 ELISHIA
                        Too-rye-aye. 

           ..before biting her lip.

                                 ELISHIA
                        That’s all I’m saying.

           She shrugs.

                                 ELISHIA
                         I’m compelled. It’s a compulsion

                                 BACALL
                        Turn it off.

           Bacall goes into the bathroom with Sonny and slams the door.
           INT.MOTEL 6, NIGHT

           Bacall looks across Central Park at a very grand hotel on the 
           other side, as Elishia sleeps.

           EXT.CENTRAL PARK, NIGHT

           She runs through Central Park with Sonny, fast as she can, as 
           fast as her layers will allow.

           EXT.FANCY HOTEL, MIDNIGHT.

           Bacall and Sonny look up at it. It’s such a beautiful hotel.

           INT.FANCY HOTEL, MIDNIGHT

           The desk clerk sits up straight as Bacall, holding Sonny, 
           tentatively enters.

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Well, hello!

                                 BACALL
                        You remember me?

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Of course Miss Loomis! And how is 
                        Mr.Friday?

                                 BACALL
                        He’s kind of a narcissistic prick. 

           Catches herself.

                                 BACALL
                        No. That’s not fair. He’s...No, he 
                        just doesn’t want to be with me 
                        anymore. It’s unrelated to his 
                        being a narcissist.

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Um. Are you staying with us?

                                 BACALL
                        I’m at a Motel 6. 

                                 DESK CLERK
                        I see.
           God, she and Sonny look pathetic.

                                 BACALL
                        I’m just curious: is room 60 open?

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Yes. It has been for a while now. 
                        So few people can afford that room 
                        in the current economic climate.

           She smiles, starts to walk out with sad, three legged Sonny.

           The desk clerk looks out after her. We see below his desk he 
           has a copy of a trash magazine, with a story about her and 
           Mark’s break up. He tucks it away.

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Miss Loomis...

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT.ROOM 60, NIGHT

           Bacall is luxuriating in room 60, leaping about like she’s in 
           ‘Home Alone’.

           INT.MOTEL 6, NIGHT

           A bleary eyed Elishia answers the ringing phone.

                                 BACALL
                        Wake up!

           INT.ROOM 60, NIGHT

           Elishia walks around the incredible suite.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Did you fuck here?

                                 BACALL
                        Yup.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Here?

                                 BACALL
                        Uh-huh.
                                 ELISHIA
                        The shower?

           She nods.

                                 ELISHIA
                        What’s this?

                                 BACALL
                        A sort of walk in closet? Yes, yes 
                        there.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Well, it was never going to last. 
                        Too much sex.

                                 BACALL
                        We were never in the same room. Of 
                        course we were all over each other.

                                 ELISHIA
                        How much time did you actually 
                        spend together? 

                                 BACALL
                        Just under a year.

                                 ELISHIA
                        No, I mean, actually in the same 
                        room.

                                 BACALL
                        Oh. I don’t know.

           INT.BATHROOM

           Bacall sits in the incredible tub, with a notebook, working 
           it out. The result shocks her.

                                 BACALL
                        Damn.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT.CEMETERY, UPSTATE

           In a Jewish cemetery on the outskirts of the city, Bacall 
           lays with her head against her mother’s grave, cradling Sonny 
           at her chest.
                                 ELISHIA
                        When were you last here?

           She sits up.

                                 BACALL
                        A year ago. With Mark. He wanted to 
                        “meet” her. 

           Looking at Sonny as he stands up on his three legs:

                                 BACALL
                        I think sometimes you love 
                        something more for what it’s 
                        suffered. A dog or a cat or a 
                        person. Or a city. But sometimes 
                        you feel contempt. How does it 
                        flip? What causes the shift?

                                 ELISHIA
                        I don’t know.

                                 BACALL
                        Do you blame someone for shifting 
                        from loving you more for it, to 
                        that contempt?

                                 ELISHIA
                        It’s a million dollar question.

                                 BACALL
                        And all I need is eighteen 
                        thousand.

           She stands up.

                                 BACALL
                        Time to get my paintings.

           EXT.WILLIAMSBURG, BROOKLYN

           They are staking out the loft, and from across the street 
           they can see, through the window, the paintings hanging just 
           as she left them.

                                 BACALL
                        Fucker still has them up! In the 
                        same place!
                                 ELISHIA
                        How petty.

                                 BACALL
                        Are you ready?

                                 ELISHIA
                        Yes, you crazy bitch. 

           INT.LOFT, WILLIAMSBURG

           A frazzled, sweet looking woman answers the ringing door 
           bell. Bacall and Elishia stand on the other side.

                                 BACALL
                        Hey. Are you Neil’s wife?

                                 WIFE
                        (nervous) Yes.

                                 BACALL
                        I’m Bacall. His ex. I’m here to get 
                        my paintings. Those.

           She walks in, and straight towards the far wall.

                                 WIFE
                        No, wait.

           After the long, strange trip, Bacall is itching for a fight.

                                 BACALL
                        What? They’re mine.

                                 WIFE
                        Look, he’ll be home any minute...

           But Bacall and Elishia are unhooking the paintings. Bacall 
           calls, rudely, over her shoulder:

                                 BACALL
                        So is he still working 
                        construction?

                                 WIFE
                        He owns his own construction 
                        business. Look, I really think...
           Neil walks in. He is carrying two adorable children, one on 
           each arm. He is super cute, a puppy whose expression turns 
           hangdog when he sees Bacall.

                                 NEIL
                        What’s going on?

           Elishia is in “I got my friend’s back” mode.

                                 ELISHIA
                        We’re getting her paintings.

           Bacall attempts a hello to the children, reaching out a hand.

                                 BACALL
                        Hey there, guys...

                                 NEIL
                        Don’t touch them!

           He places them in the arms of his wife. He is Paul Rudd like, 
           so adorable, you can’t be mad at him for having kept her 
           things.

                                 NEIL
                        Can you give us time alone? 

           EXT.HALLWAY

           Elishia and the wife look at each other as Elishia holds

                                 WIFE
                        Hello.

                        Did you know that Mathew 
                        McConaughey is the voice of meat?

           (beat)

                                 WIFE
                        Yeah. I knew.
           INT.NEIL’S LOFT

           Bacall and Neil are facing off, her hands across her chest, 
           his hands on his hips.

                                 BACALL
                        So you got married.

                                 NEIL
                        Yup.

                                 BACALL
                        And you had kids.

                                 NEIL
                        Uh-huh.

                                 BACALL
                        I thought you were probably gay.

                                 NEIL
                        All ex-girlfriends are crazy and 
                        all ex-boyfriends are probably gay. 
                        (beat) Why would you do this now?

                                 BACALL
                        I’ve been trying to get them back 
                        from you since we broke up!

                                 NEIL
                        You broke my heart.

                                 BACALL
                        I did?

                                 NEIL
                        How do you think I felt? You left 
                        me out of nowhere because I was 
                        late coming home on our 
                        anniversary.

                                 BACALL
                        You were direction-less. I just 
                        didn’t think we were going 
                        anywhere. I broke your heart?

                                 NEIL
                        I bought you an engagement ring. 
                        That’s why I was late. I had a big 
                        plan. I was holding...balloons.
                                 BACALL
                        The helium kind?

           He nods. Her face falls.

                                 BACALL
                        When I didn’t hear from you again 
                        after I left...

                                 NEIL
                        I couldn’t speak.

                                 BACALL
                        ...I thought you were just 
                        depressed about Bush’s re-election.

                                 NEIL
                        I was depressed about Bush’s re-
                        election. I was also depressed 
                        because my girlfriend fucking left 
                        me by cake frosting after three and 
                        a half years!

                                 BACALL
                        Hey. You got successful.

                                 NEIL
                        Yes. It was after our break-up. The 
                        pain made me extremely focused.

           EXT.LOFT

           Bacall comes barrelling out of the loft and down the stairs 
           as Elishia and Sonny struggle to keep up.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Where are they?

                                 BACALL
                        I can’t take them.

           INT.CAR DEALERSHIP

           Bacall sells her Ducati. Counting the money:

                                 BACALL
                        This’ll do.

                                 ELISHIA
                        It doesn’t cover your hospital 
                        bill. Not even half.
                                 BACALL
                        It’s a start.

           But you can see she’s riven with anxiety.

           EXT.STREET, NEW YORK

           They are all three - Bacall, Elishia, Sonny - slouched 
           against the cold as they walk, all beaten into a kind of 
           submission. Passing a TV in a Radio Shack window, an 
           entertainment program blares “The Grammys tonight!”

           A light bulb goes off in Bacall’s head.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT.BETTING OFFICE

           Bacall lays out the cash she made from selling her bike and 
           instructs the teller:

                                 BACALL
                        ‘Song of the Year’. Put everything 
                        on Mark Friday.

                                 ELISHIA
                        You’re crazy.

           She looks at her with cloudy eyes.

                                 BACALL
                        I have nothing to lose. I already 
                        lost everything on him.

           INT.TERRIBLE MOTEL

           Suddenly terrified, Bacall has her fingers in her ears and 
           her eyes squeezed shut as Elishia and Sonny watch The 
           Grammys.

           We don’t see who wins the category. We only see Elishia pull 
           Bacall’s fingers out of her ears and pry her eyelids open.

                                 ELISHIA
                        You’re an idiot.

                                 BACALL
                        Shit! Shit! Shit! That was 
                        everything I had.
           (beat)

                                 ELISHIA
                        And now you have ten times as much.

                                 BACALL
                        He won?

           Elishia nods.

                                 BACALL
                        Then why am I an idiot?

                                 ELISHIA
                        Because you want to be. Let’s go 
                        celebrate.

           INT.NIGHTCLUB

           As Talking Heads ‘Burnin’ Down The House’ blares to a packed 
           room, they dance like motherfuckers, totally for themselves, 
           shrieking:

                                 ELISHIA
                        Thank you Mark! Thank you sonic 
                        torture man!

                                 BACALL
                        Thank you, traitorous fuck! Thank 
                        you undeserving cunt! Thank you 
                        thank you, thank you!

           They are lost in the moment, desired by every man in the 
           club, envied by every woman, happy to be themselves.

           EXT.NIGHTCLUB, 4 AM

           As they run for a taxi, Bacall breaks a heel and doesn’t 
           care.

           INT. 24 HOUR DINER, 4 AM

           Every other straggler in the diner looks terribly sad. Not 
           them. They drink coffee, eat pancakes and eggs, dressed in 
           their dancing duds. A thought occurs to Elishia as she holds 
           a fork of pancake in front of her mouth.

                                 ELISHIA
                        How did you know he would win?
           Bacall holds her own fork of eggs mid air.

                                 BACALL
                        Because the moon was full. And the 
                        award is the exact color of his 
                        piss.

           Elishia, tipsy, cracks up laughing. But Bacall looks past her 
           at the moon, and you know she is dead serious. She rattles 
           her heel-less stiletto.

           INT.HOTEL

           Bacall, who has spent another sleepless night, prods a 
           slumbering pile of sheets that passes as Elishia.

                                 BACALL
                        You’re meeting with the book editor 
                        today. It’s in an hour.

           Elishia sits bolt upright.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Crapzilla!

           INT.PUBLISHING HOUSE

           Elishia, having pulled herself together, walks past rows and 
           rows of books by acclaimed authors. The editor’s office is 
           huge. As gorgeously groomed as before, she steps up, perky as 
           she was grumpy the last time they met. She extends a hand to 
           Elishia.

                                 BOOK EDITOR
                        Carlotta Valdes. Nice to meet 
                        properly. I feel it’s proper now 
                        I’ve read your work.

                                 ELISHIA
                        I’m just so amazed that you 
                        actually read it.

                                 BOOK EDITOR
                        Are you kidding? I couldn’t stop. 
                        This is one of the funniest things 
                        I’ve read in years.

                                 ELISHIA
                        What?
                                 BOOK EDITOR
                        With some tweaks I think it can be 
                        even funnier. I’m very excited. 
                        Your humour is completely original, 
                        Elishia. And I think I could do 
                        very well with your book. Get you 
                        in The Onion. Book you on Jon 
                        Stewart.

                                 ELISHIA
                        I don’t quite understand. I wrote a 
                        book about post-feminism for pre-
                        teens.

                                 BOOK EDITOR
                        The satire is whip-smart, just 
                        completely hilarious and spot on.

           INT.CAR

           A luxurious rental car, Sonny stretched out in the back. They 
           are quiet now, as they follow the signs for D.C, sobered by 
           their success in having actually raised the funds. 

                                 ELISHIA
                        This is insane. I gave up writing 
                        comedy.

                                 BACALL
                        Except you didn’t.

                                 ELISHIA
                        I didn’t mean to.

                                 BACALL
                        You can’t help it. You’re just 
                        funny. Whether you try or not. 

                                 ELISHIA
                        But it’s not what I wanted to do 
                        anymore. I didn’t have any success 
                        writing comedy.

                                 BACALL
                        Except for now, you’re having 
                        success writing comedy.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Shit! I feel like I’ve been having 
                        an affair with myself behind my own 
                        back.
                                 BACALL
                        Hot. P.S: you should take the 
                        contract.

                                 ELISHIA
                        I feel insulted. I gotta think 
                        about it.

           In her peripheral vision, Bacall sees a poster on a derelict 
           building.

                                 BACALL
                        Dylan’s playing in Philly tonight! 
                        We have to go.

                                 ELISHIA
                        What?

                                 BACALL
                        Yes! We can make it, we can make 
                        it! I want to see Bobby play, it’s 
                        been years. I’ll buy tickets off a 
                        scalper, I have the money. I bet 
                        you we can get back stage too!

                                 ELISHIA
                        Aw, c’mon, I wanna get to D.C. 
                        You’re gonna make us late and then 
                        I’m going to kill you. 

                                 BACALL
                        Don’t be dramatic.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Bacall. Unless we’re there to 
                        personally witness it, Barack can’t 
                        get sworn in, thus forfeiting his 
                        Presidency, which will remain with 
                        Bush in perpetuity.

           Bacall isn’t listening, head in Dylan-ville:

                                 BACALL
                        We can get back stage, I bet we 
                        can! And then I can tell Bob Dylan 
                        how Mark ripped off his chord 
                        change from ‘Ballad Of a Thin Man’. 
                        He totally did!

           She’s quite self-righteous now, to mask her mania:

                                 BACALL
                        ...and Bob should know.
                                 ELISHIA
                        I’m so mad at you right now. I wish 
                        I’d done this trip alone. 
                        Seriously, Bacall. Seriously, fuck 
                        you.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT.CAR, LATE

           Something has rendered her completely silent. Shocked, even. 
           They both look straight ahead at the road as they leave 
           Philadelphia. Finally, Elishia, who is driving, breaks the 
           silence.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Did you just tell on your ex to Bob 
                        Dylan?

                                 BACALL
                        Yeah. Yeah, I did.

                                 ELISHIA
                        I thought that you did.

           They keep driving. Bacall is deep in thought.

                                 BACALL
                        He liked me. I could have had him.

                                 ELISHIA
                        I saw that.

                                 BACALL
                        It was a technical pull.

                                 ELISHIA
                        No question.

           They keep driving.

                                 BACALL
                        I think we should go back and I 
                        should have sex with Bob Dylan. You 
                        know: to spite Mark.

                                 ELISHIA
                        I get that. It’s reasonable.

           Beat. She pulls the car into a vicious U-turn.

                                                            CUT TO:
           INT.CAR

                                 ELISHIA
                        It had to happen. You had to break 
                        the spell by sleeping with someone.

                                 BACALL
                        It’s true.

                                 ELISHIA
                        I just knew it would either be Bob 
                        Dylan or Leonard Cohen.

                                 BACALL
                        Yeah, I kind of knew it, too.

           She looks in the rear view mirror at Sonny, snoring 
           contentedly.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Do you feel better?

                                 BACALL
                        Yes, actually. I do. Will we make 
                        it in time for the ball?

                                 ELISHIA
                        We gotta motor now, Cinders. 

           She coaxes the car into full throttle.

                                 ELISHIA
                        (yelling to Bacall above the 
                        engine’s roar) They didn’t tell you 
                        this would end with an inauguration 
                        action sequence. 

           EXT. D.C

           Arriving into D.C is as climactic as it ought to be. The 
           camera shows us the throngs of excited people, the enormous 
           police presence; we see the National Mall, the Washington 
           Monument, the National Shrine, the Jefferson Memorial and, 
           right when we truly have a sense of the incredible place and 
           even more amazing occasion we cut to a close up of:

           a T-shirt with a super blinged out, ghetto picture of the 
           whole Obama family being admired by Bacall, who is eating 
           green apple sour candy.
                                 ELISHIA
                        That’s, like, super Sears photo 
                        studio style but with an 
                        embellished, bedazzled crest. That 
                        is ugly.

                                 BACALL
                        All of it selling like hot cakes.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Say “hot cakes” again. I am so 
                        freezing. And I dropped my gloves 
                        in New Jersey. 

                                 BACALL
                        But it’s the ideal place to drop 
                        gloves.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Of course. But now I’m unhappy. My 
                        fingers are frigid with malaise.

           EXT.UNION STATION, D.C

           They’re on foot, just two of two million gathered people, 
           people spontaneously weeping, hugging, singing.

           Outside Union Station a mega sketchy dude is selling a box of 
           gloves, which Elishia examines gingerly.

                                 SKETCHY DUDE
                        Ten bucks.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Dude, that is a huge box you are 
                        trying to get rid of. I’ll give you 
                        five bucks.

                                 SKETCHY DUDE
                        But they’re thinsulate.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Five bucks is the highest I’ll go.

           Claps his hands together.

                                 SKETCHY DUDE
                        Sounds good to me.

           Elishia puts them on.

                                                            CUT TO:
           EXT.D.C

           As they inch - literally inch - through the crowd of people:

                                 ELISHIA
                        Woah! I am wearing glove shaped 
                        brillo pads. I never knew gloves 
                        could hurt. What are these?

           She looks inside for a label. It says ‘Thinsulatto’.

                                 ELISHIA
                        I got had!

           INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL, EVE

           Dressed in black tie, both Elishia and Bacall look incredibly 
           beautiful. Passing through security as they enter the pre-
           inaugural ball, the tickets are indeed waiting under Bacall’s 
           name, as Tom promised.

           She takes them with a heavy heart.

                                 ELISHIA
                        We’re going to this thing to have 
                        fun and to try and see Tom. Not 
                        because you’re hoping Mark’s gonna 
                        be here. Okay?

                                 BACALL
                        He’s gonna be here. He gave so much 
                        money to the campaign.

                                 ELISHIA
                        It doesn’t matter. You don’t care. 
                        You ignore him if you see him.

           INT. PRE-INAUGURAL BALL

           Bacall and Elishia enter, looking around them, wide eyed at 
           the glitz. Spotting Obama’s speechwriter, Bacall whispers:

                                 BACALL
                        Jon Favreau.
                                 ELISHIA
                        Jon Favreau who was in ‘Rudy’? When 
                        Sean Astin wanted to play football 
                        for Notre Dame but he couldn’t 
                        because he was the same exact size 
                        and shape as a football?

                                 BACALL
                        No. Jon Favreau the super hot 
                        twenty-six year old Jew who helped 
                        get Obama elected.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Jon Favreau the director of...

                                 BACALL
                        STOP IT. I’m concentrating.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Don’t look for Mark. Stop looking 
                        for Mark.

           Elishia sees him. Shit! How to distract Bacall?

                                 ELISHIA
                        La la la.

           But Bacall’s seen him, now. He’s in a booth, surrounded by 
           admirers. Her heart is going to beat out of her chest.

           Before Elishia can stop her, she’s over there and, literally 
           squishing someone aside.

                                 BACALL
                        Hey.

                                 MARK
                        Hey! You’re in D.C!

           He looks at her like they’re neighbours gossiping over the 
           garden fence, like there’s never been a morning’s break in 
           their conversation, and that is has never run deeper than 
           chit chat.

           Okay. So she’s here. And he’s here. He looks great in a tux 
           and she looks great in a floor length gown. Now what?

                                 BACALL
                        You won a Grammy.

                                 MARK
                        I did.
                                 BACALL
                        It doesn’t mean anything, though.

                                 MARK
                        What are you talking about? It 
                        means everything!

           He’s joking, self-deprecating. She remembers this about him.

                                 BACALL
                        You’re very charming.

           He searches her eyes to see if he’s being mocked. She looks 
           down and sees they’re holding hands.

                                 BACALL
                        How did that happen?

                                 MARK
                        I’m not sure.

                                 BACALL
                        Don’t let go.

           He doesn’t.

           Just then a beautiful woman comes over.

                                 WOMAN
                        I’m so sorry, I didn’t realize you 
                        had a girlfriend, Mark, or I 
                        wouldn’t have hit on you so hard.

                                 MARK
                        Oh, no, it’s...

                                 WOMAN
                        There’s such strong energy between 
                        you two! There’s such love here!

           He can rectify it all, the break up was just a terrible 
           mistake, he can make it right now.

           He looks at Bacall. He looks at the woman. And then he says:

                                 MARK
                        There’s nothing here. Nothing at 
                        all.

           Bacall looks down and sees they are no longer holding hands.

           She forces a smile. The woman walks away, wanting no part of 
           whatever’s about to go down.
           Bacall turns to him and on him.

                                 BACALL
                        How could you say that?!

                                 MARK
                        What was I supposed to say?

                                 BACALL
                        I think I’m going to vomit.

                                 MARK
                        Metaphorically.

                                 BACALL
                        Yes.

           She looks at him.

                                 BACALL
                        No.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. MARK’S HOTEL ROOM

           Mark, covered in green puke, is holding her hair for her as 
           she heaves into the toilet of his five star hotel room.

                                 MARK
                        This is the ideal plan to win me 
                        back.

           She hurls again. He notices a patch behind him where she 
           didn’t make it in time.

                                 MARK
                        What did you eat?

                                 BACALL
                        Green apple sour candy. And then 
                        spinach dip.

           She hurls again. He looks back at the mess behind him.

                                 MARK
                        Bacall! You puked South America.

           Camera flashes to the green puke in exactly the shape of 
           South America.
                                 MARK
                        You are definitely my most talented 
                        ex-girlfriend.

                                 BACALL
                        Don’t say that word.

           She gets her breath. Wipes her mouth.

                                 BACALL
                        I’ve spent every day, since that 
                        day, trying to understand why I’m 
                        your ex.

                                 MARK
                        There’s nothing to figure out. I 
                        told you: if I could be with 
                        anyone, I would be with you. 

           They are sitting opposite each other on the cool tile floor.

                                 BACALL
                        There was nobody else?

                                 MARK
                        No!

           He sighs.

                                 MARK
                        When I said that I can’t be in a 
                        relationship, what I meant by that, 
                        the subtext, if you will, is that I 
                        can’t be in a relationship.

                                 BACALL
                        But...

           He’s really pleading his case now, as if in front of judge 
           and jury.

                                 MARK
                        I haven’t had a girlfriend in ten 
                        years. I thought I’d broke the 
                        pattern with you. But I haven’t. I 
                        left you because of me. I wasn’t 
                        expecting you when I walked into 
                        your shop. I just fell into it.

           This phrase, her phrase, chills her.

           From the look on his face you can believe, in this moment, 
           that he is sadder than her.
                                 MARK
                        But I am not fit for the job. Do 
                        you understand?

           She doesn’t answer. Straightens her dress.

                                 BACALL
                        You didn’t wish me well on my 
                        birthday.

                                 MARK
                        Of course I wished you well. I 
                        thought about you all day. 

                                 BACALL
                        But how could I have known that?

                                 MARK
                        Bacall. I love you to fucking 
                        pieces and I am sorry for the pain 
                        and confusion that I’ve caused you. 
                        But there’s nothing else I can do. 
                        Except let you get on with your 
                        life. 

           He watches as her mind goes somewhere very far away. And when 
           she comes back to land:

                                 BACALL
                        I won’t get back my blow-jobs. And 
                        I won’t get back my worn underwear 
                        that you made me fedex you on tour. 
                        And I won’t get the photos you took 
                        for me of my Grandfather’s 
                        birthplace in Russia. And I won’t 
                        get back the cakes I baked you...so 
                        many cakes. I won’t get them back, 
                        will I? 

           This shatters his heart.

                                 MARK
                        Do you really want your underwear 
                        back?

           She thinks. She truly thinks about this. The answer surprises 
           herself.

                                 BACALL
                        No.

           He smiles weakly at her as she leaves him where he is, still 
           sat on the bathroom floor. 
           When she gets to the door, she turns around.

                                 BACALL
                        Can I ask you one more thing?

                                 MARK
                        Of course.

                                 BACALL
                        Do you like to...?

           An explosion of inauguration fireworks go off, and we don’t 
           hear the rest of the sentence. He looks mortified.

                                 MARK
                        Jesus, why would you ask me that? 
                        Now?

                                 BACALL
                        I just heard that you liked it. So 
                        I was wondering why you never tried 
                        it with me?

                                 MARK
                        It’s alright, I suppose. I’m not 
                        really that bothered, to be honest. 
                        More into old fashioned missionary.

           (beat)

                                 BACALL
                        That’s what I thought. Thanks. Bye.

           She leaves. 

           He sits there, scratching his head.

           EXT.MARK’S HOTEL ROOM

           He opens the door.

                                 MARK
                        Bacall!

           She stops. Is he going to change his mind. Still, still, her 
           heart leaps with hope. She turns around.

                                 BACALL
                        Yes?
                                 MARK
                        I did get you something for your 
                        birthday.

           He walks towards her, barefoot. He hands her a slip of paper.

                                 MARK
                        I met him at the Grammys.

           She looks at it. Because she doesn’t say anything, he adds:

                                 MARK
                        It’s Bob Dylan’s autograph.

                                 BACALL
                        I see that. 

           She takes a deep breath.

                                 BACALL
                        Thank you.

                                 MARK
                        You’re welcome.

           INT.HOTEL

           Lobby, outside the main party goings on.

           In her beautiful ball-gown, she rests herself against a 
           massive HOPE poster and puts her head in her hands. I want it 
           to look as iconic as Audrey in her Givenchy dress, eating a 
           Danish outside Tiffany’s.

                                 TOM
                        Bacall?

           She looks up.

                                 TOM
                        I was looking for you.

           He kisses her on both cheeks.

                                 TOM
                        I googled you.

                                 BACALL
                        Great.

                                 TOM
                        I know who your boyfriend was.
                                 BACALL
                        Awesome.

                                 TOM
                        He gave a lot of money to the 
                        campaign. 

                                 BACALL
                        I know. I was there.

           She wonders whether to tell him...

                                 BACALL
                        I ran into him tonight. It wasn’t 
                        very nice.

                                 TOM
                        I’m sorry. (beat). Listen, you 
                        tried. You know, you try until you 
                        can’t. 

           She nods her head.

                                 TOM
                        You took your perfect hopes and 
                        dreams and you put them into 
                        someone else’s heart, pumping 
                        someone else’s blood. It didn’t 
                        cross your mind that harm would 
                        come to it, his blood lined in your 
                        dreams. But it did. And now you 
                        close yourself to love forever. 
                        Or...

           He looks at her. Is she listening? Is she really listening?

                                 TOM
                        ...you take back your heart and 
                        just do it all again. 

           She’s floored. All she can say is:

                                 BACALL
                        Yeah. 

           He helps her to her feet.

                                 TOM
                        How was your trip? How are your 
                        exes?
                                 BACALL
                        They’re different from how they 
                        were. One’s a museum guide who 
                        succumbed to rock excess, one was 
                        this crazy Irishman and he became 
                        this crazy religious Jew, one was a 
                        human rights lawyer and he became a 
                        pornographer. One became a success, 
                        which he was not supposed to be. 
                        One kept everything exactly the 
                        same except he became...really fat. 
                        They all changed so much.

                                 TOM
                        But if you don’t ever change, if 
                        you pick one thing, decide on one 
                        thing and then stick to it no 
                        matter what...you’re George Bush. 
                        Aren’t you?

                                 BACALL
                        You are blowing my mind.

           He points at the Obama poster she’s leaning against.

                                 TOM
                        Well, it’s a Magical Black Man 
                        theme night. Look, I have to be 
                        back at headquarters in seven 
                        minutes. I’ve got to go. If there 
                        were ever a time you could kiss me, 
                        with your eyes closed...would you 
                        let me know?

           He hands her his card. It’s like he’s handing her HOPE.

           INT.PRE-INAUGURAL BALL, WASHINGTON

           They are back in the heaving throng. Elishia is pissed off at 
           her for having gone off with Mark. She sees her glower.

                                 BACALL
                        Don’t tell me the post-feminist 
                        perspective on what just happened.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Can I tell you the ass-hole 
                        perspective? You’re making yourself 
                        look like an ass-hole. You have 
                        this great new guy trying to get 
                        your attention and your wasting yet 
                        more tears on this little pisher? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELISHIA(cont'd)
                        What is wrong with you? You’re too 
                        old for this! 

                                 BACALL
                        You hit the nail on the head, 
                        darling.

                                 ELISHIA
                        What?

                                 BACALL
                        Remember your last break up?

                                 ELISHIA
                        Yeah. I was nineteen. It’s why I 
                        don’t do relationships.

                                 BACALL
                        So. It will be harder to get 
                        through when you’re twenty four. 
                        And harder than that at twenty-
                        seven. And at thirty, you may feel 
                        like you just can’t do it at all.

           Elishia looks a little stung, actually, so Bacall shows her 
           the Dylan autograph.

                                 BACALL
                        How much do you think this is 
                        worth?

                                 ELISHIA
                        We’ll check online when we get back 
                        to the room.

           INT.HOTEL ROOM

           In their pajamas now, Elishia is on the computer whilst 
           Bacall writes the check, in full, to the hospital.

                                 ELISHIA
                        A Dylan autograph will get $1000 on 
                        Ebay.

                                 BACALL
                        We need that gas money to get home.

                                 ELISHIA
                        That’ll cover most of it. With 
                        motels, we probably need another 
                        four hundred bucks.
           Bacall goes into her bag. Pulls out the pornographic Polaroid 
           of herself.

                                 BACALL
                        I look amazing here.

           She taps the Polaroid on the table a few times.

                                 ELISHIA
                        No! Are you crazy?

                                 BACALL
                        You can’t actually tell that it’s 
                        me. My tits don’t look like that 
                        anymore. And I just...don’t give a 
                        fuck.

           Things change.

                                 ELISHIA
                        You can’t sell that. Don’t you have 
                        any pride?

                                 BACALL
                        Are you crazy? After the last two 
                        months? No. I don’t have pride.

           She loses it. Elishia puts her arm around her. Bacall gathers 
           herself together, takes a few breaths, wipes away the tears.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Hey. You’re nose looks completely 
                        healed.

                                 BACALL
                        Yeah. Sometimes it feels kind of 
                        good to have something tangible to 
                        recover from.

           She puts the picture in an envelope.

                                 BACALL
                        Sold.

           EXT.WASHINGTON

           Inspired by Bacall’s action, Elishia is yelling into a phone 
           as the masses engulf them.
                                 ELISHIA
                        Yes, I know. Yes! We’re here. I 
                        just wanted to tell you that, I’d 
                        like to take the deal. If it’s 
                        still on offer.

           She listens for a moment, nods.

                                 ELISHIA
                        Terrific. I think I have some new 
                        material to add. I think I can make 
                        it funnier.

           EXT.WASHINGTON, D.C, INAUGURATION DAY

           It is jam packed and they are freezing as they stand, sardine 
           packed, into the national mall. Bacall has Sonny strapped to 
           her chest in a Baby Bjorn. Almost none of Elishia’s face is 
           visible, she’s so tightly bundled up. Most of the people 
           immediately around them are African-American and it seems 
           like everyone’s been standing there for a good while, making 
           friends.

           They all look up at the jumbotrons as the camera pans across 
           various famous faces in the special seating section. Oprah! 
           Hooray! Bono! Hooray! Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon! Huh?

           And then...

           Mark’s face is enormous, in close up, across the jumbotron. 
           His hair is long and flowing and he’s wearing a large 
           keffiyeh against the cold. It takes Bacall’s breath away. 
           Elishia sees and tries to distract her.

                                 ELISHIA
                        He looks like the world’s gayest 
                        terrorist.

           Bacall stares at his face, 50 feet high.

                                 BACALL
                        He looks like someone I loved. And 
                        he looks like someone who loved me. 
                        He looks like a man who promised me 
                        the world. And then let me down. 
                        Worse than I’ve ever been let down 
                        before.

           When the camera blessedly moves off him and onto Quincy 
           Jones, Bacall’s face says “Leave it. Just leave it. Because I 
           am going to fucking cry again”. She gulps it back and forces 
           a smile that somehow becomes a true smile.
                                 BACALL
                        That’s really all he looks like.

           Elishia seems chastened for once and a lot goes between them 
           without being said, as she takes Bacall’s hand.

           We hear the first notes of ‘America’ by Simon and Garfunkel, 
           which will keep playing through this final scene.

           On the jumbotron behind them, the ascent of the Obama family 
           to the world stage (depicted just in flashes of colour - 
           Malia and Sasha’s awesome winter coats, Michelle’s citrus 
           dress and flippy hair, Barack’s ears) is marred as George 
           Bush comes out of the White House.

                                 ELISHIA
                        It’s over.

                                 BACALL
                        Yeah.

                                 ELISHIA
                        You’re free of him. You know that?

                                 BACALL
                        I know.

           Bush walks up the stairs of the waiting helicopter. As he 
           does, a man by Bacall and Elishia yells out:

                                 ANGRY MAN
                        I want my eight years back! I’m 
                        going to stand here UNTIL YOU GIVE 
                        ME BACK THE LAST EIGHT YEARS.

           A jolly man says, almost thrilled by the stark truth:

                                 JOLLY MAN
                        Ain’t no getting those years back. 
                        He fucked them up. And now they’re 
                        gone. Forever. 

           The jolly man waits a beat as those around him shiver.

                                 JOLLY MAN
                        Now, let’s all do the electric 
                        slide!

           Bacall breaks the silence.

                                 BACALL
                        I don’t know how to do that one. 
                        But I’m willing to try.
           EXT.WHITE HOUSE

           As the helicopter containing Bush revs up, the crowd erupt 
           into a spontaneous chant of:

           “Na na na na! Na na na na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye!”

           EXT.WHITE HOUSE

           Bacall looks at Tom’s business card and you feel pretty 
           confident that she will call just as soon as she’s ready. She 
           looks around her. It occurs to her, really for the first 
           time, that every single person here has loved and lost. And 
           will again. Simon and Garfunkel are singing:

           “Kathy I’m lost I said 

           (though I knew she was sleeping)

           I’m empty and aching

           And I don’t know why”

           Bacall looks up as the now ex-President, as if plucked out of 
           the world stage by some celestial hand, is pulled back up 
           into the sky. Sonny, strapped to her chest, looks up, too. 

           The sound cuts out as:

           Bacall looks around at everybody’s faces, trained upwards, 
           hypnotized by his departure. The endless sea of bodies as far 
           as she can see, and on each face, such catharsis, for 
           everything that’s ever been unfair in their lives, rectified, 
           just for today. She’s about to start crying. She knows it. We 
           know it. But, instead

           ...she smiles. 

           And looks back up at the helicopter as it gets smaller and 
           smaller, as if the eight years had all been nothing more than 
           a bad dream.

           When the screen goes black, the sound returns full volume as 
           we hear real audio from inauguration day, of the crowd, 
           chanting as one:

           “Na na na na! Na na na na! Hey hey hey! GOODBYE!”

           THE END
           Credit sequence over the real version of ‘Kiss Him Goodbye’ 
           by Steam.

           For those who stay for the credits, a V.O midway:

                                 BARACK V.O
                        Dear Bacall,
                        I received your letter of December 
                        20th. First of all, let me thank 
                        you for your support. Both Michelle 
                        and I can assure you we wish you 
                        only the best in your romantic 
                        endeavours and appreciate your 
                        drawing this matter to our 
                        attention. In conclusion, Mark 
                        Friday’s music blows and he looks 
                        like a 1930’s hobo who lives in a 
                        haunted amusement park. I have to 
                        go now. Rahm Emanuel is sulking. 
                        Sincerely,
                        Barack Obama

           More credits...

           And later:

           In an unnamed city...

           INT.LIVING ROOM, EVE

           The last scene of The Dark Crystal flickers across a TV set. 
           Behind them is the 50’s cheesecake portrait of herself Bacall 
           posed for in New Jersey.

           Tom and Bacall, spooning together on the sofa, Sonny beside 
           them, look at each other in amazement.

                                 BACALL
                        That was not at all how I 
                        remembered it.

                                 TOM
                        That...was amazing.
