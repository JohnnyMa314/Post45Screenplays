           INT. RANGOON RACQUET CLUB - BEER GARDEN - NIGHT

           SUPER: AUGUST 2, 1976  FORT WORTH, TEXAS 

           Filled with late night drinkers, the Rangoon Racquet Club is 
           at full capacity.  Thick cigarette smoke fills the air. 

           Seated at a table are BEVERLY BASS, 18, sporting a deep, late 
           summer tan. BUBBA GRAVEL, 19, a heavy-set Texan, finishes off 
           his beer.   

           Moving through the gauntlet of drinkers, a huge plume of 
           platinum blond hair appears majestically - it belongs to  
           PRISCILLA DAVIS, 35, slim, womanly, with Hollywood good looks 
           and a presence that lights up the dark room.  Beside her 
           lopes STAN FARR, 30, a huge man; 6’10” tall, a former 
           basketball player dressed in far out 1970’s western wear.

                                 BUBBA
                        Man...Stan is huge.  Look at him! 
                        How tall is he?  Seven foot?  

                                 BEVERLY
                        More or less.

                                 BUBBA
                        And she’s so little...how do 
                        they...do it?  I mean...the  
                        geometry of it doesn’t work, does 
                        it?

                                 BEVERLY
                        You know what Priscilla told me? 
                             (whispers)
                        She said some cocks are for 
                        fucking, and others are for 
                        sucking.

           Priscilla waves to Beverly. Beverly joins Priscilla.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Ya’lls party break up early?

           Priscilla peers over to Bubba, pulls Beverly close.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Who’s that you’re with?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Bubba.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        That’s why your waterbed’s leakin’?  
           Beverly laughs.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I got what I wanted in court today.  
                        Rell you about it later...you’re 
                        still comin’ over, right?  

                                 BEVERLY
                        Of course!

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Anything you need. If you ever need 
                        a place to stay, you got a home 
                        with us.  Come to think about it, I 
                        believe Andrea made some brownies 
                        for us.

           Beverly’s eyes widen - eager.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Not those kind...naughty girl.

           Priscilla smiles - a beauteous grin that makes women feel at 
           ease and men dream of magnificent ecstacies.  She gulps two 
           big, blue pills, washes them back with a margarita.  

           SUPER: PRISCILLA CHILDERS WILBORNE DAVIS 

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (V.O.)
                        If someone tapped me on the 
                        shoulder that night and told me 
                        “your entire life is about to take 
                        a turn for the worse, Priscilla, so 
                        get ready to walk through Hell” I 
                        woulda laughed.  Life was just too 
                        damned good to think that way.

           Priscilla sees an enormous bouquet of roses on a table. She 
           gently picks them up.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Andrea would love these!

                                 STAN
                        Sweetie...you can’t take those. 

                                 PRISCILLA
                        They won’t mind.

           EXT. DAVIS MANSION - MOCKINGBIRD LANE - NIGHT

           The Davis Mansion sleeps atop a bluff overlooking the Trinity 
           River.  A half moon bathes cold, summer light on the 
           structure that looks more like a modern art museum than a 
           mansion.  
           Stan’s black Ford Thunderbird stops in the driveway.  They 
           get out and trudge to the back door. 

                                 STAN
                        My belly hurts.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Why’d you drink so much?  

                                 STAN
                        It tastes too good not to. 

           They both weave as they stroll to the house.  

           INT. KITCHEN - DAVIS MANSION - NIGHT

           The kitchen is enormous - modern - breathtaking.  Chrome 
           gleams.  The air conditioner whispers. Freshly cooked 
           brownies in the shapes of animals are displayed in a baking 
           pan.  

           Priscilla unlocks the door and steps in with Stan, who 
           brushes past her.  She sets down the roses.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Why’re all the lights on?

           She glances to the alarm panel.  It’s been turned off.  She 
           regards the animal shaped brownies. 

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Andrea?  

           INT. HALLWAY - DAVIS MANSION - SAME

           Stan clunks up the stairs, his enormous weight causing the 
           stairs to groan.  

           INT. KITCHEN - DAVIS MANSION

           Priscilla glances around the commanding kitchen.  Something 
           is wrong - she can feel it.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Andrea, honey?

           She steps into an alcove - and sees that the basement door is 
           ajar.  Priscilla reacts - beside the open basement door - a 
           bloody handprint.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Stan!   
           A SLENDER MAN dressed in black appears behind her. A dark, 
           curly wig spills off his head.  

                                 MAN IN BLACK
                        Hi!

           He raises his right hand - it’s wrapped in a black, plastic 
           garbage bag concealing a gun.  

           THE GUN FIRES!  Wisps of black plastic rip into the air.  

           Priscilla goes down fast - blood rushes from her chest.  She 
           gasps; 

                                 PRISCILLA
                        But...

           All sound fades.  We only hear the sound of labored breathing 
           and her quiet voice;

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (whisper)
                        ...I love you.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           EXT. - TENNIS COURTS - COLONIAL COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

           SUPER: 1967

           Priscilla, younger, with darker blond hair and just as 
           breathtaking, warms up.  She scans players on other courts, 
           and laps up the lustful looks thrown her way.

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (V.O.)
                        I met Cullen Davis on the tennis 
                        court at Colonial Country Club in 
                        the summer of 1967.  Texas was 
                        different then; there was no other 
                        political party than Democrat, no 
                        cell phones, no fax machines, no 
                        home computers, no pagers, no text 
                        messages...and no Internet porn.  
                        Makes you wonder how people used to 
                        live.

           Another woman, SANDRA DAVIS, 30, extremely attractive and 
           shapely, steps onto the tennis court.  

                                 SANDRA
                        Ready, Pris?

           She serves, and Priscilla returns the ball with ease.  
                                 PRISCILLA
                             (V.O.)
                        I worked hard to get here...on the 
                        tennis court of Fort Worth’s best 
                        country club, bein’ that I grew up 
                        poor, from the wrong side of the 
                        tracks.  I got married to a car 
                        dealer, we were well off, but I 
                        wasn’t happy.  Three kids, the so-
                        called perfect husband, but I still 
                        wasn’t... satisfied.  There’s 
                        always been this hunger in me that 
                        I can’t begin to explain.  I wanted 
                        things that I was told I couldn’t 
                        have.  My thinking has always been, 
                        if someone else has it, why can’t 
                        I?

           A slight, young man watches them play.  He reclines in a 
           chair on the side of the court.  He seems odd - with 
           unfocused, far away eyes, and a smile that doesn’t upturn on 
           the ends.  

           The girls finish their set.  Priscilla sips a cup of water. 
           Sandra jogs over to Cullen.

                                 SANDRA
                        How’d I do?

                                 CULLEN
                        Who’s that?

                                 SANDRA
                        The blond with the big tits?

           Cullen’s eyes flick to Priscilla.

                                 SANDRA
                        Jack Wilborne’s wife.

                                 CULLEN
                        The Cadillac dealer?  

                                 SANDRA
                             (whispering)
                        He’s twenty years older than she 
                        is, you know.  And...I hear she’s 
                        never even met her own father.  
                        White trash.

                                 CULLEN
                        You’re not exactly Vanderbilt 
                        material yourself.

           Sandra opens her mouth to reply to the insult, but Cullen’s 
           cold eyes make her think better of it.
                                 PRISCILLA
                             (shouting)
                        Another set?

           Cullen watches them play another set, his eyes focused on 
           Priscilla’s enormous “rack”.  She glances up to him, then 
           turns her back and concentrates on the game.

           BILLIONAIRE

           When they finish their game, Cullen hops out of his seat and 
           strolls over to them.  He reaches a well manicured hand out 
           to Priscilla.

                                 CULLEN
                        Hi! I’m Cullen Davis.  

           Priscilla looks to him with doe eyes as she takes his hand.  

           Sandra’s eyes become razor blades.

           INT. COLONIAL COUNTRY CLUB BAR - SAME

           Priscilla lounges in her booth with her girlfriends, KAY-
           LINN, 25, and SKEETER, 29.  She has her hands apart, 
           gesturing.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        It was that big.

                                 KAY-LINN
                        Was he black?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Maybe a quarter black...but you 
                        never can tell in the dark.  

           They laugh.  Priscilla’s big eyes look across the dining 
           room, and there he is -

           PRISCILLA’S POV

           Cullen seated at the head of a large table.  He passes a 
           small pornographic picture furtively to the man beside him, 
           who guffaws when he sees it, then he passes it on. 

                                 CULLEN
                        You ever seen one that big before?

           Their haircuts and clothes smell of money, and they all 
           listen to Cullen, the only one talking.  Suddenly, he stops, 
           and looks Priscilla’s direction.  He strolls over to her 
           table, not breaking his gaze.
                                 CULLEN
                        Did I say something to offend you?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        What?  Um...no, no you didn’t.

           He smiles that weird grin, turns and goes back to his table.  
           The other girls look to Priscilla, who regards her wedding 
           ring.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        This thing gets tighter every day.

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (V.O.)
                        And just like that, I couldn’t get 
                        him off my mind.  I didn’t know his 
                        father was so wealthy...or anything 
                        about him, really. He had a good 
                        haircut, he was polite, and he had 
                        good manners.  Where I come from, 
                        that’s somethin’ to consider.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - WILBORNE HOME - DAY

           Priscilla traipses through the house dressed in pink 
           lingerie.  Her two daughters are crying, and her son, JACK, 8 
           months, crawls on the floor wearing a dirty diaper.  

           A big Curtis Mathis television blares cartoons in the 
           background.  Priscilla kneels down, and dumps a plate of 
           scrambled eggs onto a blanket on the floor.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Here you go, angels.  

           In front of the kids, she steps out of her pink lingerie and 
           quickly slips into tennis whites.  

           THE BLACK HOUSEKEEPER, ROSIE, rolls her eyes.  

           JACK WILBORNE, 45, a rugged, all-Texas car dealer, watches 
           from the kitchen.

                                 JACK
                        Priscilla!  Feed those kids at the 
                        table like a civilized human being! 

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I’m late.

                                 JACK
                        Late for what?  These are your 
                        kids!  
                                 PRISCILLA
                        Gotta go!  Bye!

           She blows him a kiss, and runs out of the house.

           Jack watches her back out of the drive in her 1966 pink 
           Cadillac.  

                                 JACK
                             (V.O.)
                        I never could...for the life of me, 
                        my wife out.  Never.  I loved 
                        her...I did.  But only to a point.  

           EXT. TENNIS COURTS - COLONIAL COUNTRY CLUB - SAME

           Priscilla plays, but not well - her mind somewhere else.  Her 
           opponent, Kay-Lynn, fires a ball her way.  

                                 KAY-LYNN
                             (O.S.)
                        Forty - love!  Come on, Priscilla!  
                        Planet earth to Priscilla?

           Priscilla smiles, then spots Sandra Davis making her way to 
           the tennis courts.  Priscilla returns a serve, then looks 
           around again - Cullen gazes at her in the distance.  He 
           throws a slight wave, that inscrutable smile on his face.  

           The ball whizzes past her.  She doesn’t even try for it. 

                                 KAY-LYNN
                             (O.S.)
                        Game!  

           She puts down her racket, and walks Cullen’s way when she 
           sees Sandra begin a game in a different court.  

           EXT. PARKING LOT - COLONIAL COUNTRY CLUB - SAME

           Priscilla leans against her Caddy, Cullen stands close by. 
           They murmur in hushed tones.  

           EXT. PARKING LOT - COLONIAL COUNTRY CLUB - EVENING

           The sun sets, they still talk, then nod goodbye.  She gets in 
           her car, starts it up, and drives away. 

           INT/EXT. CADILLAC - SAME

           Priscilla glances into her rearview - Cullen watches her.  
           INT. BEDROOM - WILBORNE HOME - NIGHT

           Priscilla hunkers on her large bed, magazines laid out before 
           her, a huge, glass ashtray overflows with Parliament 
           cigarette butts.  She stares at her telephone, picks it up, 
           dials, then hangs up.

           She leafs through Life Magazine.  She leafs through Reader’s 
           Digest.  She picks up her telephone, dials, the Colonial 
           Country Club members listing beside her.  She hangs up.  

           She leafs through National Geographic, looking at pictures of 
           naked African men.  She dials the number again.  

                                 CULLEN
                             (through telephone)
                        Hello?

           Priscilla takes a deep breath.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Remember me?

                                 CULLEN
                             (through telephone)
                        Yes.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        This sounds kinda crazy...but I 
                        figured it was worth a shot; can 
                        you get me tickets to the Dallas - 
                        Green Bay exhibition game next 
                        week?

           Long pause.

                                 CULLEN
                             (through phone)
                        You don’t want much, do you?

           He laughs.  She does, too.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I don’t normally ask for small 
                        favors...only big ones.

                                 CULLEN
                             (through phone)
                        I’ll see what I can do.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAVIS HOME - NIGHT

           Cullen hangs the phone up. His two young SONS, 3 and 5, play 
           on the bed next to him.  Sandra scans “Reader’s Digest”.  She 
           has a big, blue bruise screaming on her right shoulder.  
           He hangs up the telephone, a quizzical expression crosses his 
           face.

                                 CULLEN
                             (V.O.)
                        At that second, it hit me.  I 
                        wanted her.  And...I didn’t want 
                        the other one anymore.

           He glances to Sandra, her face covered in night cream.  

           MONTAGE:

           EXT. COTTON BOWL STADIUM - DALLAS COWBOYS FOOTBALL GAME - DAY

           Priscilla waits in the concourse.  Cullen appears.   The 
           Cowboys score a touchdown on the field below, and Cullen goes 
           in for a kiss.  Priscilla returns it.  

           INT. DALLAS RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Cullen sits across from Priscilla.  They stare at each other, 
           dreamy eyed. Below the table, Priscilla gropes Cullen’s 
           privates.  

           EXT. TEXAS REGENCY HOTEL - NIGHT

           Rain falls.  Cullen leads Priscilla, who hides her face with 
           dark glasses, out of a hotel room.  He opens an umbrella to 
           hide both of them.  

           INT. DALLAS LOVE FIELD AIRPORT - NIGHT

           SUPER: JANUARY 2, 1968

           The airport is packed with Texan A&M fans, still cheering on 
           their upset victory over favored Alabama at the championship 
           game.

           Cullen grabs his Samsonite luggage off the carousel that 
           reads: PAN AM FLIGHT 391 FROM ACAPULCO.

           Priscilla lurks behind him, huge sunglasses obscuring her 
           face.  They both hotfoot it out of the airport.  

           EXT. GREEN OAKS INN - NIGHT

           The Green Oaks Inn - upscale, 1968 modern.
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME

           Cullen and Priscilla kiss on the bed.  She has the sheets 
           pulled up to her chin, and she’s shivering with fever.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Cullen...sweetie...this flu is 
                        killin’ me.  

                                 CULLEN
                        I been lookin’ forward to this.

           He strips down to black, bikini underwear.  

                                 CULLEN
                        Wore these just for you.

           She sneezes.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I gotta sleep, Cullen.  Feel like 
                        shit.

           He crawls into bed next to her.

                                 CULLEN
                        Can’t we do...somethin’?  Anything?

           The door SMASHES OPEN -

           Mace sprays into the room. Cullen and Priscilla choke.  

           THREE BURLY PRIVATE DETECTIVES flank through the door, old 
           time flashbulbs popping.  

           Cullen hops out of bed, lunging for the private detectives.  
           Behind them stands Sandra Davis and Jack Wilborne.

           Priscilla leaps up, and sprints into the bathroom wearing 
           only panties and a bra.  She locks herself in.

                                 PRIVATE DETECTIVE
                        Smile, you two.

           Cullen reaches for the man’s camera.  AN ENORMOUS PRIVATE 
           DICK slams Cullen’s lithe 150 pound frame against the wall.

                                 PRIVATE DICK
                        Calm down, feller.  Just breathe 
                        deep...and calm down.  

                                 SANDRA
                        It’s over, Cullen.  Over!

           She storms out of the room. 

           Jack Wilborne waits in front of the locked bathroom door.  
                                 PRISCILLA
                             (through door)
                        Wilborne!  You son of a bitch!  I’m 
                        calling the police!

                                 JACK WILBORNE
                        Open the door...and I’ll dial them 
                        myself for you.

           INT. PARIS COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Cullen sits at a table at the Paris Coffee shop, his lawyer 
           WAYNE EUBANKS, 36, a bookish man, sits stiffly beside him.  
           Rain pats against the window.  

           Jack Wilborne enters with another man, J.O. STEELE, a fifty-
           something ex-Marine.  They sit down.

                                 CULLEN
                        Jack...(he nods to the other) Hope 
                        you don’t mind but I brought my 
                        lawyer.  

                                 JACK
                        Not at all.   I brought my 
                        bodyguard.

                                 CULLEN
                        I’m gettin’ a divorce from Sandra.

                                 JACK
                        I’d imagine you would be. 

                                 CULLEN
                        Let’s get down to it.  How much of 
                        my money are you lookin’ to get out 
                        of this?

           Jack and J.O. exchange looks. 

                                 JACK
                        I don’t want a cent of your damned 
                        money.  

           Cullen seems surprised - pleasantly so.

                                 CULLEN
                        Priscilla?

                                 JACK
                        You can have her.  I’ve filed for 
                        divorce.

                                 CULLEN
                        So what do you want?
                                 JACK
                        Keep the hell away from my kids.  
                        They’re stayin’ with me.  

           Cullen breaks into a smile.

                                 CULLEN
                        I don’t see a problem with that.  
                        Wayne?

                                 WAYNE
                        Sounds fair to me.  

           Cullen reaches over to shake Jack’s hand.  Jack hesitates, 
           then offers his hand.

                                 CULLEN
                        Well...all right then.  
                        Gentlemen...

           He gives a curt nod to Jack and J.O.  Cullen and Wayne leave.  

                                 J.O.
                        When you told him you weren’t after 
                        his money...he became downright 
                        friendly.

           Both men share a laugh. Thunder rattles the old coffee shop.  

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. ALCOVE - DAVIS MANSION - NIGHT

           SUPER: AUGUST 2, 1976

           Priscilla sits up - blood dribbles down her shirt. 

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Andrea?  

           The Gunman leaps up, and pivots to see Stan Farr charging 
           down the stairs.  

           He fires - black plastic strips whiff into the air. 

           The bullet cleaves into Stan’s shoulder - he winces, and 
           slams the door shut before the Gunman.  The Gunman fires 
           through the door - four more times.  

           Heavy weight slumps against the closed door.

           The Gunman opens it, and empties his gun into Stan’s huge 
           body.  He flicks open his revolver, empties the spent shells 
           into a small bag, then reloads and snaps it shut.
           Priscilla glances to Stan, looking him right in the eye - 
           Stan loudly exhales one last breath, and his eyes go blank.  
           The Gunman lifts Stan’s heels and effortlessly drags his huge 
           body into the next room.

           Priscilla jumps to her feet and dashes to the back sliding 
           glass door.  She sprints through it - 

           EXT. COURTYARD - SAME

           - and out into the courtyard.  She trips on a paving stone, 
           directly in front of a faux Greek statue of Aphrodite.

           The Gunman appears behind her, grabs her and gets her to her 
           feet.  

                                 GUNMAN
                        Come on, come on!

           He drags her across the courtyard toward the house.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Stop it!

           EXT. MANSION - SAME

           Beverly Bass pulls up the long drive in her white Chevy 
           Blazer. Bubba gets out.  

           Bubba peeks his head over the top of the garden wall - he 
           sees the Gunman dragging Priscilla through the courtyard.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (O.S.)
                        Please!  You’re hurting me!  I’ve 
                        never loved anyone else but you!  
                        Stop!  I love you!

                                 BEVERLY
                        What’s goin’ on? 

                                 BUBBA
                        I dunno.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Someone tryin’ to rob the house?

           EXT. COURTYARD - SAME

           The Gunman stops, and cocks his head, listening. He can hear 
           Bev talking - he releases Priscilla.  She dashes to a dark 
           corner of the courtyard and hugs the earth.
           The Gunman heads straight for Priscilla, who balls up into a 
           fetal position. He passes by her, and creeps to the front 
           gate.  She gets to her feet, unsteady, and scampers out of 
           the courtyard.   

                                 BUBBA
                        Hey!  What’s going on?

           The Gunman treads toward Bubba.  His face can’t be seen in 
           the darkness. 

                                 BUBBA
                        Where is everybody?

                                 GUNMAN
                        Right this way.  Let’s go inside.

                                 BUBBA
                        What are you doin’?

           Bubba turns to Bev - 

                                 BEVERLY
                             (whispering)
                        I think he’s taken something from 
                        the house.  Looks like he broke in.

                                 BUBBA
                             (whispering)
                        I’m gonna take this son of a bitch.

           Bubba follows the Gunman, and Beverly behind him.  The Gunman 
           quickens his pace, leading them toward the back door of the 
           house.

           EXT. FIELD - ADJACENT TO THE MANSION - SAME

           Priscilla sprints barefoot as fast as she can through a 
           grassy field, her denim dress gathered around her bleeding 
           chest wound.

           EXT. COURTYARD - DAVIS MANSION  - SAME

           Bubba steels himself - he reaches his hand to the Gunman just 
           as they pass under a pool of light.  The Gunman turns, gun in 
           hand.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Bubba!  Watch out!

           The Gunman fires.  Bubba crumples to the sidewalk. The Gunman 
           calmly walks over to him, aims at Bubba’s head. 

                                 BEVERLY
                        No!
                                 BUBBA
                        Run!  

           The Gunman looks directly at Beverly, just feet away from her 
           - his face is still unseen, shrouded in shadow.

                                 BEVERLY
                        It’s me...Bev.

                                 BUBBA
                        Run!

           Beverly runs.  The Gunman chases her.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        Cullen...please don’t shoot me!  

           Beverly looks over her shoulder - the slender Gunman 
           silhouetted against the white mansion.  He aims his plastic 
           wrapped gun.

           Beverly sprints, darting across the enormous lawn that sweeps 
           in front of the mansion.  Her sandals fly off. Another 
           gunshot - a bullet whizzes by.  Beverly looks over her 
           shoulder - the Gunman has vanished.  She dashes out into the 
           street that snakes before the mansion.  She screams at the 
           passing cars - 

                                 BEVERLY
                        Help me!  My boyfriend’s just been 
                        shot!

           A car slows.   

           EXT. NEIGHBOR’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Priscilla bangs on the front door.  Lights come on.  Her eyes 
           wild, crazy, unfocused.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Help me!  Please...please...I live 
                        in the big house on the 
                        hill...Cullen’s up there killing 
                        everybody!

           A voice sounds through the door.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                             (O.S. )
                        I know who you are and we’re not 
                        gonna let you in.  My husband’s 
                        called the police.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Let me in!  Please!  He’s coming 
                        after me!  
                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                             (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry...but I don’t trust you. 
                        The police are on their way.

           EXT. BACK OF DAVIS MANSION - NIGHT

           Emergency vehicles are lined around the back of the mansion, 
           all the way down the driveway.  

           Beverly Bass sits in the back of an ambulance. Two Fort Worth 
           PD officers listen to her.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        It was Cullen...I saw him...

                                 POLICE OFFICER #1
                        How do you know it was him?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Because I saw his ugly fucking 
                        face!

           The cops look to each other with “that look”.  A skeptical 
           EMT rolls his eyes, then mimics smoking a joint to the cops.   

           EXT. HULEN STREET - FRONT OF DAVIS HOUSE - NIGHT

           Priscilla shouts from another ambulance.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Someone’s gotta find my little 
                        girl!  Andrea!  She’s still in 
                        there!  Please!

           They close the door and the ambulance wails away.  

           INT. ALCOVE - DAVIS MANSION - SAME

           Two Homicide detectives examine Farr’s huge body.  They’ve 
           circled and flagged all of the blood stains on the white 
           carpet.  A Police Photographer flashes pictures of the 
           gruesome scene.

           TWO UNIFORMED COPS look at the collection of strange, modern 
           art sculptures in the house.  

                                 COP #1
                        Do you get this?  I don’t.

                                 HOMICIDE DETECTIVE
                        I hate to interrupt your critique, 
                        but could you guys check out that 
                        basement? Thank you, gentlemen.
           INT. BASEMENT - DAVIS MANSION - SAME

           Two Fort Worth PD cops step down into the basement.  

                                 COP #1
                        Let’s see if there’s any of that 
                        art down here.  

                                 COP #2
                        We might find ourselves a modern 
                        masterpiece.

           The cops look at the walls, which are lined with a series of 
           doors.  Cop #1 opens the first, but it’s simply a small 
           storage area.    

           He opens the second one - a 12 year old girl, ANDREA 
           WILBORNE, lies dead, her eyes open.  A large gunshot wound 
           yawns open in her chest. 

                                 COP #2
                        Oh, no.  

           He fights back tears and nausea.  

           INT. BEDROOM - KAREN MASTER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           SUPER: 4:00 AM

           A telephone rings in the darkened bedroom of a modest 
           bungalow in southwest Fort Worth.  Cullen, looking older and 
           grayer since last time we saw him, lies beside KAREN MASTERS, 
           33, the perfect, Texas prom queen beauty.  She answers the 
           telephone, then hands it to Cullen.

                                 KAREN
                        Who the heck calls at this hour?

                                 CULLEN
                        Hello?

                                 VOICE
                             (through telephone)
                        It’s your brother,Ken.  Cullen, 
                        what the hell is going on?

           Cullen yawns.

                                 CULLEN
                        I don’t know.  You tell me.

                                 KEN
                             (through phone)
                        Police just called me lookin’ for 
                        you.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 KEN (CONT'D)
                        Four people got shot up at your 
                        house tonight...two of ‘em are 
                        dead.  What are you gonna do about 
                        it?

                                 CULLEN
                        Nothing much I can do except go 
                        back to sleep.  

           A commanding voice breaks in on the line:

                                 VOICE
                             (through phone)
                        This is the Fort Worth Police 
                        Department breaking in on this 
                        line...am I speaking with Cullen 
                        Davis?

                                 CULLEN
                        Yes.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                             (through phone)
                        You have exactly five minutes to 
                        come outside, sir.  Five minutes.  

           EXT. KAREN MASTERS HOUSE - NIGHT

           High intensity floodlights burn at the modest Masters home.  
           Nervous police officers have taken up positions, weapons 
           drawn and aimed at the front door.  

           The door opens, and Cullen steps out with a spring to his 
           step, shielding his eyes from the light.

                                 COP WITH MEGAPHONE
                        Hands in the air!

           Cullen complies, and walks toward the source of the light.  
           Hulking Cops put him in the backseat of the cruiser without 
           cuffing him.  The car darts away, siren blaring.  Davis 
           reclines in the back, looking as if he didn’t have a care in 
           the world.  

           INT. DOWNTOWN FORT WORTH POLICE HEADQUARTERS - EARLY MORNING

           Cullen sits on a plastic chair in front of the booking 
           officer, SERGEANT DAVIS, 45, (no relation), who reads the 
           report and then looks to Cullen.  He looks back to the 
           report, then to Cullen again.

                                 SGT. DAVIS
                        Cullen Davis, before I formally 
                        arrest you, I must ask if you would 
                        like a lawyer?
                                 CULLEN
                        I don’t need a lawyer.

           His weird, far off eyes scan the room.

                                 SGT. DAVIS
                        All right.  What do you know about 
                        the shooting at your place?

                                 CULLEN
                        Perhaps I’d better talk with my 
                        lawyer first.

                                 SGT. DAVIS
                        I don’t want you to sign 
                        anything...I just want you to tell 
                        me why two people got killed 
                        tonight up at your house? What 
                        would be a good enough reason for 
                        those two people to end up dead?

           Cullen looks the Sergeant in the eye.

                                 CULLEN
                        Sometimes a man doesn’t need a 
                        reason.  

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MEDICAL PLAZA HOSPITAL - DAY

           Priscilla, sweaty and broken, lies in a hospital bed. IV’s 
           snake from her arms. 

           Christy DAVIS, 18, her daughter, looks like a brunette 
           version of her mother. She stands vigil beside her.  

           AN OLDER NURSE and two FORT WORTH PD HOMICIDE DETECTIVES 
           stand by in the background. 

           Priscilla screams. AN OLDER NURSE hurries in, closes the 
           drapes.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Where is she?

                                 NURSE
                        Who?  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Andrea?

           Priscilla burns a stare into Christy, who can’t meet her 
           gaze.

           The Nurse turns up the Demoral.
                                 NURSE
                        She’s dead.  

           The Nurse leaves the room..  

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MEDICAL PLAZA - DAY

           The Older Nurse whisks by TWO DETECTIVES. 

                                 COP #1 
                        Some bedside manner.

           A heavy-set attorney from the DA’s office, JOE SHANNON, 34, 
           waits with the detectives.  

           Christy steps out of the partition.

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        Christy Davis?

           Joe reaches his hand out to her.

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        Joe Shannon.  I’m with the DA’s 
                        office.  I’m so sorry for your 
                        loss. 

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (O.S.)
                        I hear you talkin’ outside!  
                        Christy!  Bring ‘em in here.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Priscilla glances to the two detectives and the prosecutor.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        She’s really gone?  

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        I’m so sorry for your loss, ma’am. 

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Is Cullen in jail?

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        He was released on $50,000 bail 
                        this morning.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        $50,000?  That’s how much money he 
                        puts down on a crap table in an 
                        hour. 

           The detectives and the ADA look to each other, alarmed.
                                 PRISCILLA
                        He’s got a Learjet out at Meachum 
                        Field, ready to go whenever he 
                        wants to, twenty-four seven. He’s 
                        especially fond of Venezuela.

           EXT. MEACHUM AIR FIELD - DAY

           The jet engines on a Gates Learjet 24D are turning.  The 
           pilots up front are going through their checklist.

           Wheeling onto the airfield is a 1976 two-tone Cadillac.  It 
           stops short of the jet.  Cullen leaps out, grabs a suitcase, 
           hoofs to the whining jet.  Just as he’s at the gangway, FORT 
           WORTH POLICE OFFICERS come running from all directions, guns 
           drawn and aimed at Cullen.  

                                 COP
                        Taking a trip Cullen?  Get on the 
                        ground!  Spread eagle on the 
                        ground!

           Cullen does what he’s told.

           INT. LEARJET - COCKPIT - DAY

           A Detective bursts in the cockpit.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Where you goin’?

                                 PILOT 
                        Nashville...Mr. Davis has business.

           The Co-Pilot shakes his head “no”, and hands the manifest to 
           the Detective.  It reads: CARACAS, VENEZUELA.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MEDICAL PLAZA - NIGHT

           Priscilla wakes up.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Andrea?  Andrea?  

           Christy leaps up from the chair she was sleeping on beside 
           her mother.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        She’s at home...could you check on 
                        her?

           Christy shakes her head, tears blinding her.  
                                 PRISCILLA
                        She’s supposed to be at home.  She 
                        told me she would be okay.  She 
                        told me it would be all right. 

           She snaps back to reality.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        She’s gone, isn’t she?  

                                 CHRISTY
                        Mommy...I’m so sorry.  

           Christy hugs her mother.

                                 CHRISTY
                        I was supposed to be with her.  

           Priscilla hugs her tighter.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Good thing you weren’t...or he’d 
                        have killed you, too.

           EXT. FOREST PARK CEMETERY - FORT WORTH, TEXAS - DAY

           Andrea’s funeral.  People in black, melting in the oppressive 
           August heat. An older Jack Wilborne cries openly.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (V.O.)
                        She was gone.  

           Priscilla sits in a wheelchair, her head buried in her hands.  
           Christy pushes her away from the grave site.  Andrea’s small 
           coffin lowers into the ground.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (V.O.)
                        What did I do to deserve this?  
                        Yeah, I’m a crazy girl sometimes 
                        ...I like attention...I like 
                        men...I like livin’.  I love 
                        people.  But...to pay this price 
                        for just bein’ me? 

                                                            FLASHBACK -

           INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - FORT WORTH - DAY

           SUPER: 1968

           Cullen and Priscilla kiss before a minister - she in a huge, 
           white wedding dress and Cullen wearing a black tuxedo.  The 
           sanctuary is full of Fort Worth’s A-list.  
           KEN DAVIS, 39, Cullen’s older brother, stands next to him, a 
           worried expression on his face.  

           Cullen and Priscilla march down the aisle together and out of 
           the sanctuary.  People look to each other, exchanging bemused 
           expressions.  

           EXT. FRONT OF CHURCH - SAME

           Cullen and Priscilla smile and wave to the society 
           photographers.  Ken leans toward Cullen while flashbulbs pop.

                                 KEN
                             (whispering)
                        I need a word with you.

           INT. SIDE ALCOVE - FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - SAME

           Cullen playfully punches his brother, who doesn’t respond.

                                 CULLEN
                        I know you don’t like her...but 
                        she’ll grow on ‘ya.  She’s 
                        great...I love her to death...and, 
                        she’s terrific in the sack.

           Ken puts his hand on Cullen’s shoulder.  

                                 KEN
                        Daddy died this morning.

           Cullen’s smile disappears.  

                                 KEN
                        I didn’t want to spoil your 
                        wedding.  

           Priscilla pokes her head in the room.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Cullen...everything okay?

           Cullen goes over to Priscilla, hugs her, and pulls her close;

                                 CULLEN
                             (whispering)
                        Ken just told me we’re gonna be 
                        billionaires.  

           Priscilla cocks her head. What?

                                 CULLEN
                        Daddy died this morning.  It’s 
                        terrible.
           MONTAGE:

           Cullen and Priscilla at the Spanish Steps in Rome.  She’s got 
           a handful of shopping bags with the big names; Givenchy, 
           Pierre Cardin, Gucci, Yves St. Laurent.  She kisses Cullen 
           lustfully.

           Cullen and Priscilla stand at the top of the Eifel Tower, 
           over looking Paris.  They kiss lustfully.

           the gore, Priscilla winces from it.  They kiss lustfully.

           INT. NEIMAN MARCUS - DALLAS - DAY

           Priscilla at the Neiman Marcus in Dallas, Texas.  She 
           fashions a new dress for Cullen - a miniskirt.  He watches 
           her pose before him, mesmerized by her beauty. 

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (V.O.)
                        He took me to a world I could never 
                        have imagined...a world where you 
                        never had to think about lacking 
                        money.  Ever.  We lived like rock 
                        stars that didn’t have to worry 
                        about their next hit song, because 
                        the engine that drove the Davis 
                        fortune was oil...and in the 
                        1970’s, oil wasn’t going 
                        anywhere...oil was the blood that 
                        pumped through the heart and veins 
                        of the world.  Oil was everything.

           IN THE JEWELRY SECTION OF NEIMAN MARCUS

           Cullen gently places a necklace on Priscilla that spells in 
           diamonds: RICH BITCH.  She turns to the mirror, sees what it 
           says, and laughs. 

           EXT. BLUFF OVER TRINITY RIVER - DAY

           Cullen marches along the bluff with AN ARCHITECT and A 
           CONTRACTOR.  He’s laying out the groundwork for the mansion.  

                                 ARCHITECT
                        Okay...I think I got it.  
                        Money’s....

                                 CULLEN
                        No object.  Whatever you need.  
                        Checkbook’s open.  

           Priscilla watches in the background.  He smiles at her.  
           INT. PRIVATE BOX - TEXAS STADIUM - DAY

           SUPER:  1970

           Priscilla places a syrupy lava lamp on the bar.  She’s just 
           finishing decorating a private box overlooking the fifty yard 
           line of Texas Stadium - below the blessed Dallas Cowboys 
           stand at attention on the sidelines.  The Star Spangled 
           Banner plays.

           TWO CONSERVATIVE COUPLES, JACK AND DOROTHY SPRATLIN, and WADE 
           AND BARBARA HEARN, step into the box, and take in the decor; 
           pink satin wallpaper lines the walls. Mauve fur drips from 
           the ceiling, and big, white beanbag chairs dot the lime green 
           shag carpet. It’s as if Liberace, Zsa-Zsa Gabor, and Bootsy 
           Collins conspired with Priscilla to choose this decor.

                                 CULLEN
                        What do ya’ll think?

           Barbara and Dorothy look horrified; Wade and Jack seem 
           bemused. 

                                 JACK
                        It’s different, Cullen.  You pick 
                        out the wallpaper?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I did.  I think it’s sexy.  

                                 WADE
                        By God, that’s what it is!

           Priscilla lounges on a beanbag chair, a low cut top and mini-
           skirt showing off her best assets.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Ya’ll like it?  Really?

                                 DOROTHY
                        Well...it’s different, Priscilla.

                                 BARBARA
                        Which isn’t a bad thing.  

                                 DOROTHY
                        No, it’s not bad.

                                 WADE
                        Different’s good.

           He takes a long look at Priscilla’s rack.

                                 WADE
                        I like it.  
                                 PRISCILLA
                        I see you do.  

           Cheers from below.  The game begins.    

                                 CULLEN
                        Sit down, people, or we’ll miss the 
                        game.  The real show’s down there.

           He squeezes Priscilla’s shoulder.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Or up here.  Take your pick.

           She winks at them.  

           INT. ART DEALER - NEW YORK CITY - DAY

           Modern art sculptures and paintings festoon a sterile art 
           gallery.  AN ART DEALER with a thin moustache follows Cullen 
           around the place as he gives each painting a cursory glance.  
           Priscilla, dressed in a short skirt, go-go boots, and a low 
           cut blouse, chews gum and looks bored.  

                                 ART DEALER
                        Sir...you should seriously take a 
                        look at each one of these pieces 
                        and take in their individual 
                        grandeur.  This Rothko, for 
                        example...

           Cullen takes a look at it, then nods.

                                 CULLEN
                        Priscilla, what do you think of 
                        this one?

           He lays on the Texas accent.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Looks good to me.

                                 CULLEN
                        Just looks like a picture of a 
                        damned box.

                                 ART DEALER
                        I see.  If you’re truly serious 
                        about...

                                 CULLEN
                        How much for all of ‘em?  

                                 ART DEALER
                        Sir?
                                 CULLEN
                        The whole bunch.  How much?  

                                 ART DEALER
                        How....?

                                 CULLEN
                        There’s another gallery across the 
                        street with pretty much the same 
                        junk in it.  I bought all those, 
                        too.  Name your price.  

           He looks to Priscilla and winks.  She loves it.  

           INT. FORT WORTH AMERICANA HOTEL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           An audience of stockholders listens.  On the stage the board 
           members of Alco Corporation are seated.  Cullen slouches, 
           bored, with the other board members.

           At the dais, an old CHAIRMAN stands, reading off statistics 
           to stockholders.  

                                 OLD CHAIRMAN
                        We had a big day on the Dow today, 
                        which brings our numbers up a good 
                        2 percent.  With the Dow at 956, we 
                        can’t go wrong.    

           Priscilla enters the room, wearing a white mini-skirt, a low 
           cut, psychedelic blouse, and go-go boots.  Huge, round 
           sunglasses obscure her face.  She waves broadly to Cullen.  

                                 OLD CHAIRMAN
                        Our January billings are...

           He stops, peers over his glasses.

                                 OLD CHAIRMAN
                        Who the hell is that?

           Cullen stifles a smile.  

           The stockholders all turn and look Priscilla’s way.  She 
           curtseys, then takes a broad, stage bow.

                                 OLD CHAIRMAN
                             (covering microphone)
                        Who invited the hippie?

                                 CULLEN
                        That’s my wife, sir.  She’s no 
                        hippie.  She’s a registered 
                        Republican.  
           Gasps throughout the audience.  Cullen soaks in their shock 
           and revels in it.

           INT. DAVIS MANSION - FORT WORTH, TEXAS - NIGHT

           SUPER: 1972

           The Davis mansion as completed - far-out sculptures and 
           modern art oil paintings are displayed throughout the 
           enormous architecture.  

           OIL TYCOONS, older Texas men, hold their cocktails awkwardly 
           as they take in the moderne effrontery of the Davis mansion.  
           These people are used to Remingtons and Russells - this kind 
           of art is beyond them.

           Their WIVES, dripping with expensive jewelry and reeking of 
           perfume and hair spray, whisper to each other as Priscilla 
           makes her way around the party.  She laughs loudly at one red-
           faced OIL MAN’S joke.  She rests her hand on his shoulder.

           Cullen watches this exchange with sharp eyes.  Priscilla 
           looks up, catches his scornful gaze, and she backs away from 
           the red-faced Oil Man.

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (V.O.)
                        Cullen used to watch me... 
                        carefully...to make sure there 
                        weren’t any other men that caught 
                        my fancy.  It was times like these 
                        that...well, he scared me.    

           Cullen nods to her, then points toward the dining room.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        They’re tellin’ me it’s time for 
                        dinner! So ya’ll come on in!

           They file in to the dining room.  

           INT. DINING ROOM - DAVIS MANSION - SAME

           The well dressed guests take a seat. Priscilla sits at the 
           head of the table and regards a crystal dinner bell that 
           rests before her.  She picks it up, examines it.  A SOCIETY 
           MATRON, 55, smiles to Priscilla.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Could you tell me what’s this for?

           She rings it and laughs.
                                 CULLEN
                        Priscilla...?  I’d like to 
                        introduce you to one of our 
                        guests...

           Cullen points to a man with piercing brown eyes, a pin 
           striped suit, and a playful grin.  This is RICHARD 
           ‘RACEHORSE’ HAYNES, 47.  

                                 CULLEN
                        If you ever get in any 
                        trouble...he’s a hell of a defense 
                        attorney...just got a man off 
                        accused of killing his wife.  

           Priscilla laughs.  She holds up a glass of champagne to him.  

           EXT. COLONIAL COUNTRY CLUB - NEAR GOLF PRO SHOP - DAY

           A Winnebago RV squats near the pro shop, cream colored and 
           ugly.  Men dressed in golf wear file in to the Winnebago, 
           craning their necks to see what’s inside.  

           INT. WINNEBAGO RV - SAME

           Cullen holds court next to a clattering 16mm movie projector 
           which shines the X-rated movie “Deep Throat” onto a bedsheet.  

           DAVID MCCRORY, 29, a fat bully boy, slurps back Schlitz beer 
           and hangs on Cullen’s every word.

                                 CULLEN
                        I told him son, you married up.  
                        Way too far up.

           Everyone in the room keeps their eyes glued on the lewd 
           action unfolding on the screen.  David falls over himself 
           laughing, slapping his knee. 

                                 CULLEN
                        It wasn’t that funny, David.  

           David stops laughing, ashamed.  

                                 DAVID
                        I thought it was funny.

                                 CULLEN
                        Really?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah.

           Cullen scrutinizes him.  
                                 CULLEN
                        Why’d you laugh so hard?  

                                 DAVID
                        I dunno.

                                 CULLEN
                        Tryin’ to make me happy?

                                 DAVID
                        It was funny.

                                 CULLEN
                        It was?  Then why didn’t anyone 
                        else laugh as hard as you did?

                                 DAVID
                        I dunno.

                                 CULLEN
                        You “dunno”?  

           David’s eyes turn downward.

                                 CULLEN
                        Don’t look at the floor...look at 
                        Linda Lovelace gettin’ nasty up 
                        there on that screen, son.  I was 
                        just funnin’ with you.

           Cullen smiles. David laughs.  The others in the room feel 
           free to laugh, too.

                                 CULLEN
                        That nude guy up there looks like a 
                        Jew.  A dishonest one.  They have 
                        Jews actin’ in porn movies?

                                 DAVID
                        If you call that acting.

                                 CULLEN
                        You know...I can tell the 
                        difference between an honest Jew 
                        and a dishonest Jew just by the 
                        shape of the head...you know that?  
                        The dishonest Jew has a look about 
                        him a man can spot a mile away.  
                        It’s the shape of their head...the 
                        really round headed Jews?  You can 
                        trust them.  It’s the ones with the 
                        oval shaped heads are the ones 
                        you’d better watch your ass around 
                        ‘cause they got no morals to speak 
                        of.  Big, oval heads with a long 
                        nose.

                                 CULLEN (CONT'D)
                        That’s scientifically proven to be 
                        a warning sign...of a crooked Jew.

           Everyone else in the Winnebago exchanges puzzled looks.   

           INT. FORT WORTH PETROLEUM CLUB - NIGHT

           A big soiree - powerful, rich people sport evening wear and 
           talk big business.  

           Cullen strolls with Priscilla, who wears a white, gravity 
           defying cocktail dress with holes cut out to display her well 
           toned abdomen.  She drags her mink stole on the floor as she 
           sashays beside Cullen. Every eye is on her - and her 
           dishonored mink. 

           A FORT WORTH SOCIETY MAVEN looks to Priscilla with 
           undisguised revulsion. Priscilla smiles at her.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I’m doin’ great tonight...how about 
                        you?

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (V.O.)
                        The thing about marrying Cullen...I 
                        pretty much started at the top of 
                        the social register.  And when it 
                        was over...and I mean really 
                        over...

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MEDICAL PLAZA - DAY

           Priscilla cries in her bed, Christy crying beside her.  She 
           stares out the window, at the summer inferno that is Fort 
           Worth in late summer.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (V.O.)
                        ...I didn’t care anymore.  I just 
                        wanted my little girl back.  

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           INT. KITCHEN - DAVIS MANSION - IGHT

           Andrea, 12 years old, with a child’s face and a teenager’s 
           body, pulls a hot cookie sheet out of the futuristic oven.  
           She hears a knock at the kitchen door.  She takes off her 
           oven mitt, and goes to the door, her brow furrowed.  She 
           reaches to deactivate the alarm system.

                                                         FADE TO WHITE:
           EXT. FOREST PARK CEMETERY - FORT WORTH, TEXAS

           Andrea’s small casket lowered into the earth. 

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (V.O.)
                        ...and she was never comin’ back, 
                        which is something that I can’t 
                        ever get used to.  No one can.  
                        They say that’s why we have 
                        religion, but religion doesn’t help 
                        me.  Me and God aren’t on speaking 
                        terms...and never will be.

           EXT. DAVIS MANSION - DAY

           Christy pulls the big, white Lincoln into the drive.  She 
           helps her mother get into a wheelchair.  

           Wind blows - bits of thin, black plastic flutter past and 
           circle in the air. Priscilla sees the wisps of black plastic 
           skipping across the lawn in the wind and shudders.

           INT. ENTRYWAY - DAVIS MANSION - SAME

           Christy wheels her mother in.  Air conditioning whispers.  

                                 CHRISTY
                        Everything’s okay, Mommy...they 
                        have bodyguards here...

           Priscilla looks around the giant structure - yellow police 
           tape hangs limply from the door to the basement.  She reaches 
           into her side bag and takes out more Percodan, dry swallowing 
           three.  

                                 CHRISTY
                        You sure you should...?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I need ‘em.

           Christy wheels Priscilla into the mansion, and Priscilla 
           looks up at an enormous painting of Cullen and Priscilla; 
           done in a pseudo-Norman Rockwell style, it features Cullen in 
           a business suit, Priscilla behind him, and all around the 
           painting are vignettes from their life.  Cullen behind a desk 
           on the telephone, Cullen shooting pool, Cullen at an oil rig 
           wearing a hard hat, while all the pictures of Priscilla 
           display her posing in mini-skirts and short-shorts.

           FLASHBACK - 

           SUPER: 1973 
           Priscilla stands before the same painting, admiring it.  The 
           house is full of FORT WORTH SOCIETY TYPES.  A WELL DRESSED 
           WOMAN behind Priscilla sniffs;

                                 WELL DRESSED WOMAN
                        It looks like Cullen’s got all 
                        kinds of things going on here.  
                        What is it that you do?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I do Cullen.

           Her “Rich Bitch” necklace gleams as bright as her smile.

           EXT. SWIMMING POOL - LA MANCHA PRIVATE RESORTS - DAY

           SUPER: PALM SPRINGS 1973

           Priscilla sits out by the pool in her bikini, sipping a 
           Bloody Mary and smoking a cigarette in the hot, clean desert 
           air.

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (V.O.)
                        There were times, though, that 
                        Cullen did me.

           Cullen steps out to the pool deck dressed in a suit and tie.

                                 CULLEN
                        I told you...I don’t like cigarette 
                        smoking!

           He grabs hold of her, yanking her to her feet, and pulls her 
           inside.

           INT. VILLA - LA MANCHA RESORT - SAME

           He throws her across the Spanish tiled floor.  Her head 
           smashes into the bar.  Bottles rattle.  He kicks her as she 
           crawls away.

                                 CULLEN
                        How...many...times...do 
                        I...have...to....tell...you?

           He kicks her in the gut with his sharp dress shoe.

           INT. WHITE ELEPHANT SALOON - FORT WORTH - NIGHT

           Cullen lines up a pool shot.  David McCrory gloats beside 
           Cullen.  
                                 DAVID
                        You’re gonna miss, sport.

           Priscilla, seated at the bar with Margie McCrory, watches 
           with fear in her eyes.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Margie...could you tell your 
                        husband to turn down the gloating a 
                        notch?  And...

           Margie leans in.

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (whispering)
                        ...tell him to start losing...or 
                        I’m gonna pay for it later.

                                 MARGIE
                        What are you saying?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Just do it.  Please.  

           Margie slides off her bar stool and whispers something to 
           David.

           Cullen watches this exchange, then glances over to Priscilla.  
           She smiles to him.  He doesn’t return it.  

           INT./EXT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

           Cullen drives, his face a mask of white lipped rage.  
           Priscilla cowers as far away from him as possible.  

                                 CULLEN
                        What’d you say to Margie?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Lots of things.  We talked about 
                        Watergate, we talked about the 
                        selection committee at the country 
                        club, we talked about...

                                 CULLEN
                        The truth. 

                                 PRISCILLA
                        What do you mean?

                                 CULLEN
                        Did you ask her to tell David to 
                        throw that game?

           Priscilla’s eyes confess.
           He smacks her across the mouth so hard the band on his gold 
           Rolex snaps.

           INT. SKI LODGE HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           SUPER: ASPEN, COLORADO - 1974

           Cullen throws Priscilla against a wall.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Stop it!

           Cullen smacks her in the face. 

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I think you broke something!

           Cullen punches her in the stomach.

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAVIS MANSION - DAY

           ANDREA WILBORNE, 9, sits in her bed, Priscilla next to her.  
           She reads aloud;

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Good night, good night to all.  

           Andrea, who looks very much like Christy, smiles and stares 
           off into the distance, dreamy eyed. 

                                 ANDREA
                        Thanks, Mom.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Thank you for coming over tonight 
                        angel.  

           Cullen bursts into the room, holding up a kitten. It 
           struggles in his grasp.  

                                 CULLEN
                        This yours?

           Andrea looks to her mother with frightened eyes.

                                 CULLEN
                        Yes or no? 

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Put that thing down...you’re 
                        scaring it.  
                                 CULLEN
                        If you’re gonna come stay here on 
                        weekends, you have to follow my 
                        rules.  Got it?

           Cullen regards the kitten, then throws it on the floor with 
           such force the animal goes into convulsions.

                                 CULLEN
                        I thought I made it clear...no 
                        animals in the house!

           He stomps on the dying cat, killing it.  Priscilla and Andrea 
           scream.  Cullen reaches to Andrea, grabs her by the hair, and 
           forces her to look at the dead animal.  

                                 CULLEN
                        This’ll happen to any other animal 
                        that sets foot in my house.  Got 
                        it?

           INT. HALLWAY - DAVIS MANSION - DAY

           Cullen walks into the hallway, Andrea and Priscilla wailing 
           after him.  He waits for a long time, staring ahead, then his 
           face relaxes.  He seems at total peace with himself.

           INT./EXT. PRISCILLA’S LINCOLN - NIGHT

           SUPER: FORT WORTH, TEXAS 1974

           Priscilla speeds, Margie McCrory beside her.  Margie glances 
           at the speedometer - they’re going over 100 mph.

                                 MARGIE
                        Priscilla...I’d like to live to see 
                        tomorrow.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Gotta get home.  Cullen’ll kill me 
                        if I’m...

           She glances at the digital clock.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Shit I’m late!

                                 MARGIE
                        I know it’s none of my 
                        business...but why do you put up 
                        with it, girl?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Put up with what?
                                 MARGIE
                        Living your life in terror?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        And give up all this?

           Priscilla gestures around the plush interior of the Lincoln, 
           a half smile on her face.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        A black eye every once in a while 
                        is a small price to pay for living 
                        like a queen.  

                                 MARGIE
                        What are you gonna do when the 
                        price goes up?  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I’m making this up as I go along.

           INT. POOL ROOM - DAVIS MANSION - NIGHT

           Cullen plays pool alone.  The digital clock on the wall reads 
           1:24 AM.  Headlights sweep across the large picture window.  

           Keys rattle, Priscilla giggles, and enters with Margie.  

           Cullen holds up his pool cue.  His face tightens.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Hi, Cullen.  Judy’s car broke down 
                        and I had to go out and get her...

                                 CULLEN
                        I smell smoke.  Cigarette smoke.  

           His impassive face registers nothing.  He stalks over to 
           Priscilla, grabs hold of her hair, and smashes her face 
           against the side of the pool table.  

           She collapses to the floor. Margie gasps.

                                 CULLEN
                        You know I don’t like smoking.  

           He swings the pool cue again and Priscilla catches it.  He 
           tries to pull it back but she holds on fast.  She uses it to 
           get back on her feet.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        We’re finished, Cullen.  

                                 CULLEN
                        What the fuck did you say?
                                 PRISCILLA
                        We’re over. 

                                 CULLEN
                        Been down that road before.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Not with me you haven’t.

           Margie helps Priscilla out of the house.  

           INT. BERK RITCHIE’S LAW OFFICE - DAY

           Priscilla lounges across from BERK RITCHIE, 43, a burly 
           divorce attorney.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        You don’t mind if I smoke, do you?

           Ritchie lights her Eve cigarette, and then shakes out a 
           Marlboro red for himself.

                                 RITCHIE
                        I need to go through some 
                        preliminaries with ‘ya...so we can 
                        get a decent number as a 
                        settlement.  Okay?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Sure.

                                 RITCHIE
                        What’s the approximate value of 
                        your house?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        About six million dollars.

           Ritchie frowns.

                                 RITCHIE
                        I’m a busy man, Mrs. Davis...I got 
                        plenty of people waitin’ outside, 
                        so let’s stay within reason.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        It was worth that when we built it 
                        four years ago.  It’s probably 
                        worth more now.  

           Ritchie puts down his pen, and leans back skeptically.

                                 RITCHIE
                        So what is it exactly your husband 
                        does for a living?
                                 PRISCILLA
                        You name it.

                                 RITCHIE
                        No.  You name it.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Okay...he’s president of about a 
                        hundred corporations all over the 
                        world...he’s the CEO and owner, 
                        with his brother, of Kendavis 
                        Industries...

                                 RITCHIE
                        Is your husband T. Cullen Davis?

           Priscilla nods.

                                 RITCHIE
                        Well...at the very least, this 
                        should be damned interesting.

           INT./EXT. VOLKSWAGEN MICROBUS - DAY

           SUPER: CONNECTICUT, SUMMER 1974

           A scruffy hound dog of a man, W.T. RUFNER, 34, drives.  He 
           passes a joint to David McCrory, who sits beside him.  
           Rufner’s a country western song come to life -  a hard luck 
           story etched in every line on his face.  

           Priscilla and Margie sit in the back.  Priscilla pops a  
           Percodan.

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        Why don’t you lay off them pills 
                        and go natural with some Mother 
                        Mary?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        No thanks.  

                                 DAVID
                        Awww, come on.  I won’t tell 
                        Cullen.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I’m sure you won’t.  He’d kill you 
                        if he knew you were here with me.  

           David nods, shaken.  W.T. gives Priscilla a wink in the rear 
           view.  She appreciates it.   
                                 MARGIE
                        Priscilla...the whole point of this 
                        trip to forget about that man for a 
                        while.  Could you at least try?

           Priscilla pops open a beer and takes a gulp.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Here’s to forgetting.

           INT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL - D/FW AIRPORT - DAY

           Priscilla goes to get her bags.  Rufner walks with her, and 
           gives her ass a squeeze.  

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        Wanna come by my place later?

           Priscilla reaches for her pink Samsonite that comes round on 
           the carousel - Cullen suddenly appears and snatches it for 
           her.

                                 CULLEN
                        Here you go, darling.

           Priscilla startles but quickly recovers. 

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Cullen...how’d you...?

                                 CULLEN
                        David gave me a call...told me what 
                        ya’ll were up to.  

           He reaches a hand out to Rufner. 

                                 CULLEN
                        Cullen Davis. Haven’t had the 
                        pleasure.

           W.T. grins and takes Cullen’s hand.

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        W.T. Rufner.

                                 CULLEN
                        What’s W.T. stand for?

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        I forgot a long time ago. 

                                 CULLEN
                        Let me give you a ride home, W.T.  
                        Priscilla...

           He hands her a roll of Bennies.
                                 CULLEN
                        ...this’ll get you a cab.

           Priscilla throws a frightened glance W.T.’s way.  He pretends 
           not to see it.  

           INT.EXT. CULLEN’S CADILLAC - NIGHT

           Cullen drives his Caddy - fast.  Rufner slouches beside him.

                                 CULLEN
                        You’re a motorcycle racer?

                                 W.T. RUFNER 
                        Ten star flat track.

                                 CULLEN
                        That means nothing to me.

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        It’s the kind of racing I do...not 
                        motocross, or any of that kind of 
                        horseshit.  What about yourself?

                                 CULLEN
                        What about me?

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        What do you do?

                                 CULLEN
                        I’m in oil.  

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        Make a right up here.  

           EXT. W.T.’S HOME - EAST FORT WORTH

           Cullen’s Cadillac looks totally out of place in W.T.’s 
           dilapidated neighborhood. W.T. climbs out, pulls out his 
           ratty suitcase.

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        Thanks, Cullen.  Let me know what I 
                        can do to repay the favor.

           Cullen stares at him.  

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        Just let me know.

           Cullen stares ahead.  

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        Good night.
           Cullen doesn’t respond.  W.T. walks up to his house, and 
           turns.  Cullen sits in his car, still staring ahead. W.T. 
           unlocks the door and goes inside.

           INT. W.T. RUFNER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           W.T. enters, shaken.  His ROOMMATE, BIG AL, a huge, 400 pound 
           black man, sucks up smoke from a bong, soaking in the cold 
           light of late night television.

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        What’s that son of a bitch doin’?

           Big Al doesn’t respond.  W.T. peeks out a window.  Cullen 
           stares at Rufner’s house, engine idling.  

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        What the hell is wrong with that 
                        guy?

           Finally, he slips his car in gear and drives away.  

                                 BIG AL
                        Who?

           EXT. W.T.’S HOME - DAY

           FORT WORTH PD OFFICERS in yellow raid jackets kick in 
           Rufner’s rickety front door.  Black and whites are lined up 
           in the street, lights flashing.

           INT. W.T.’S HOUSE - SAME

           A POLICE OFFICER holds up a baggie of white cocaine powder.  
           ANOTHER COP holds up a bag of pot.

           Rufner, his shirt off and looking forlorn, sits handcuffed on 
           the floor.  He watches what’s going on with tired eyes.

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                             (V.O.)
                        It didn’t take a rocket scientist 
                        to figure out who dropped the dime 
                        on me.  That woman, as sweet as she 
                        was, she was poison.  She had some 
                        dangerous company around 
                        her...sure...but I couldn’t get her 
                        off my mind. When it comes to 
                        thinking with the little head and 
                        the big head, with me, the little 
                        head always wins. 

                                                       FLASH FORWARD - 
           INT. COURTROOM - TARRANT COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           SUPER: TARRANT COUNTY COURTHOUSE SEPTEMBER 2, 1976 

           Priscilla, in a wheelchair, shrunken and tiny, sits before 
           the court.  

           SUPER: STATE OF TEXAS VS. T. CULLEN DAVIS BAIL HEARING

           Cullen, at the defense table, slouches beside PHIL BURLESON, 
           55, his defense attorney.

           SUPER: PHIL BURLESON - THE LAWYER THAT DEFENDED JACK RUBY

                                 BURLESON
                        Objection, your honor.

           The judge, TOM CAVE, 48, shakes his head.

                                 JUDGE CAVE
                        Overruled, Mr. Burleson.

           DISTRICT ATTORNEY TIM CURRY, 41, curly headed and intense, 
           nods to Priscilla.

                                 TIM CURRY
                        Go ahead.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        He jumped out of a corner...by the 
                        laundry closet, and he had a wig 
                        on...

           She looks over to Cullen, who returns her look with a tight 
           lipped, know-it-all smile.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        ...and he shot me.  

           She reaches down and turns up the IV drip of painkiller that 
           flows into her veins.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Right here...

           She points to her chest.  

                                 TIM CURRY
                        Who is “he”?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        T. Cullen Davis...sitting right 
                        there.  

           Cullen stares ice daggers at her.  She returns the favor.
           INT. OUTSIDE OF COURTROOM - DAY

           LONG HAIRED NEWS REPORTERS lugging huge, 1970’s era camera 
           equipment and microphones, smoke cigarettes and wait.

           GASPS and EXCLAMATIONS ERUPT in the courtroom.  

           A REPORTER pokes his head out from the double doors; 

                                 REPORTER
                        He’s been denied bail for the 
                        duration of the trial!

           REPORTERS scramble to the pay phones.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAVIS MANSION - DAY

           Priscilla lounges propped up on pillows on a huge, fairy 
           tale, pink super-duper king sized Elvis-like bed, wincing 
           when she moves.  Christy helps her sit up.  

                                 CHRISTY
                        You okay, Momma? 

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I’m good...pass me those...

           She points to a brown, plastic bottle and Christy takes out 
           one pill.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Three.  I need three.

                                 CHRISTY
                        Here’s two.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I need three.  Three.  

           Christy shakes her head.

                                 CHRISTY
                        You should be careful with that 
                        stuff.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I need it.

           Two Tarrant County prosecutors, FRED GRUBER, 50, who looks 
           like a worn out church deacon, and Joe Shannon. 

           Gruber can’t bring himself to look at Priscilla - keeping his 
           eyes glued on the white, shag carpet at his feet.
                                 GRUBER
                        Priscilla...let’s go over this 
                        witness list again, if we could. 

           Priscilla pops the two Percodan and dry swallows them.  
           Gruber watches her.

                                 GRUBER
                        Those aspirin?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Percodan.

                                 GRUBER
                        I’m just a little worried about 
                        this list of witnesses to Cullen’s 
                        behavior.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Why?  Christy, one more.

                                 GRUBER
                        To be quite honest, some of these 
                        people are low-down, no good 
                        criminals with long records.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        What does that matter?

                                 GRUBER
                        It matters.  

           Gruber shoots a look to Joe Shannon.

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        Priscilla?  Could I ask you 
                        some...um...delicate questions? 

           Priscilla nods, then looks to Christy.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        You don’t need to hear this stuff, 
                        baby.  Just give me my other pill, 
                        and let us talk here...you know, 
                        privately?

           Christy hands over the sought after Percodan, smiles a 
           knowing grin and leaves the room.  

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        Okay...Mrs. Davis, we’ve hearin’ an 
                        awful lot of...rumors...about drug 
                        use and sex orgies here in this 
                        mansion during the period after 
                        Cullen moved out?
                                 PRISCILLA
                        Well...there were some crazy 
                        times...how’d you hear about that?

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        Our sources are pretty reliable.  
                        You don’t exactly keep a low 
                        profile.  Remember, the defense is 
                        gonna know what we know.

           Tolly Gruber looks like he’s about to throw up.

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (V.O.)
                        They hated me.  I could see it in 
                        their holier than thou Baptist 
                        faces. He killed my little girl. So 
                        what does it matter that I had some 
                        good times? 

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAVIS MANSION - DAY

           SUPER: SUMMER 1975

           Rock and roll music blares.  Marijuana smoke fills the room.  

           TEN Naked and half naked HIPPIES loll on the oversized 
           pillows and carpet.  ONE YOUNG GIRL fellates a bong smoking 
           naked BIKER who lounges on a beanbag chair.  

           Looking down at this bacchanal from the balcony, Priscilla 
           holds a Margarita and smokes.  She’s naked.  Behind her, in 
           the bedroom, W.T. Rufner sits up in the bed, also naked.  

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        Priscilla, come over here and let 
                        me do a rail off your ass so’s I 
                        can get in the mood.  

           He holds up a vial of cocaine.  Priscilla turns and walks in 
           the room.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        You’re always so romantic.

           She kisses him.  

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        Lay down on your stomach, sweetie.  

           She lies on her stomach as he sprinkles cocaine on her rear.
                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        I know you know I’m a drug addict 
                        and an alcoholic...but maybe, just 
                        maybe...you’ll learn something from 
                        me.

           He sniffs it up through a children’s silly straw.  

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        Aw, hell...that’s good!  

           He mounts her, peering down at the orgy below.  

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        Damn...that’s hot!

           Priscilla giggles.  

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAVIS MANSION - DAY

           The prosecutors both stare at her, mouths agape.  They can’t 
           believe what they’re hearing.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        So, yeah...we had some crazy times.  

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        Were there actual sales of 
                        narcotics going on here in this 
                        house?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Maybe.  Yeah.  I think so.  I mean, 
                        they don’t give that stuff away for 
                        free. 

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        Did you take any illegal narcotics?

           Priscilla shakes her bottle of Percodan.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        These aren’t illegal... they’re 
                        prescribed.  I started takin’ them 
                        when Cullen beat the shit out of me 
                        in 1973 and broke my ankle, nose, 
                        femur, shattered my 
                        cheekbone...want me to go on?

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        I think we get the picture.

                                 GRUBER
                        So the answer’s no?
           EXT. FRONT OF MANSION - NIGHT

           Gruber and Shannon close the front door, and look to one 
           another.  Gruber falls to his knees in mock prayer;

                                 GRUBER
                        Oh, Lord, please let me off this 
                        case...I hate that woman!

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        What the hell’s wrong with you?

                                 GRUBER
                        Just ‘cause they’re victims... 
                        doesn’t mean we have to like ‘em.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAVIS MANSION - NIGHT

           Priscilla staggers into the kitchen, inebriated from the 
           combined effects of the massive amounts of Percodan and the 
           margarita she carries.  She glances down to see a baking 
           sheet on the counter.  

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           Andrea sets out a baking sheet of animal shaped brownies.  
           The back door knocks furiously.  Alarmed, she looks up, and 
           then relaxes when she sees who it is. She reaches to the 
           alarm panel and turns it off.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Priscilla collapses onto the floor, weeping.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (V.O.)
                        The worst thing about all of this 
                        was...I really missed her... and it 
                        was my fault she got killed. 

           INT. CARRIAGE HOUSE RESTAURANT - WEST FORT WORTH - NIGHT

           Tolly Gruber devours a steak and baked potato.  Across from 
           him Phil Burleson nurses a Scotch and soda.  

                                 BURLESON
                        I gotta be honest with you, 
                        pardner...I think I bit off a 
                        little more Cullen Davis than I can 
                        chew.  That man is one hell of a 
                        billion dollar piece of work.

                        Wasn’t it F. Scott Fitzgerald that 
                        said “let me tell you about the 
                        very rich...they are different than

                        That sounds right.

                        I know we can’t talk about the 
                        case, but...well, bein’ old 
                        friends, maybe you could recommend 
                        another attorney we could bring on 
                        our team.  Seriously, Tolly...I 
                        need all the help I can get on this 
                        one...take some of the pressure off 
                        me.

                        Not that I can tell.

                        Get him.  If anything, maybe we’ll 
                        both start to have a little more 
                        fun with this thing havin’ him on

                        That’s not lost on me and I think 
                        that’s our best angle.  We won’t 
                        try Cullen for Stan Farr’s murder.

                        That’s a tough one.  That big

           INT. TARRANT COUNTRY JAIL - NIGHT

           A stocky man in a dark gray three piece suit marches into the 
           jail and opens his briefcase for inspection.  His brown eyes 
           beam intensity at the Deputy who’s inspecting his case. This 
           is RICHARD RACEHORSE HAYNES, 49, the same man who was at the 
           Davis’s dinner party earlier.  
                                 DEPUTY
                        Who’re you here to see?

                                 RICHARD RACEHORSE HAYNES
                        Cullen Davis.  I’m Richard Haynes, 
                        one of his attorneys.

                                 DEPUTY
                        The Racehorse Haynes?  Wow.  
                        Pleased to meet you, sir.  Come on 
                        in.  

           Haynes happily shakes the Deputy’s hand and walks past the 
           inspection point.  He heads into the visitor’s room.

           INT. PRIVATE VISITATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Davis waits for him.  Haynes steps in.  The Deputy won’t 
           leave.

                                 HAYNES
                        Deputy, could you give us some 
                        privacy please, sir?

                                 DEPUTY
                        My orders are to be here.

                                 HAYNES
                        Your orders are in direct violation 
                        of the Constitution of the United 
                        States.  I’d hate to have to report 
                        you as an unpatriotic American that 
                        disrespects our grand Constitution. 

           Haynes fixes a steely gaze on the Deputy, who exits.  

                                 HAYNES
                        Mr. Davis?  Richard Haynes.  

           He gives Cullen a bone crusher handshake.

                                 CULLEN
                        Two questions, Mr. Haynes.  Can you 
                        get me out of here on bail?

                                 HAYNES
                        No can do.  A judge’s order like 
                        that is perfectly acceptable and 
                        nothin’ I can do to change it.

           Cullen looks like he’s about to reach across the table and 
           strangle Haynes. 

                                 HAYNES
                        What’s the second question, Mr. 
                        Davis?
                                 CULLEN
                        Can you get me off these charges?

                                 HAYNES
                        You can bet your life on it, only 
                        if; you stop whining about being in 
                        jail and do exactly as I say.

           Priscilla, flanked by TWO BEEFY BODYGUARDS, rushes out of the 
           courthouse.  Behind her, shouting and excited voices shout 
           questions to her.  

           Priscilla looks over her shoulder, and ONE REPORTER bellows 
           down to her;

                                 REPORTER
                        Can I get a reaction to the change 
                        of venue?

           Priscilla doesn’t respond, and gets whisked into a waiting 
           Lincoln.  

           INT. COURTROOM - TARRANT COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Haynes beams to Davis, who stares ahead, thin-lipped.  

                                 HAYNES
                        Your honor, may I commend you on 
                        your decision.  

           Judge Tom Cave nods, resigned.  Phil Burleson and Racehorse 
           Haynes shake hands.  

                                 JUDGE CAVE
                        I would like to remind the 
                        defendant that this ruling does not 
                        allow him to post or seek bail.  By 
                        moving the trial to Amarillo, Mr. 
                        Davis you shall remain in the 
                        custody of the State of Texas until 
                        the conclusion of the new trial.  

           Davis glares at Judge Cave.  Haynes puts a hand on Cullen’s 
           knee - “easy”.

           Racehorse paces, a fireball of energy. Phil watches him. Ken 
           Davis is also present.

                                 HAYNES
                        They don’t have any real evidence, 
                        Mr. Davis.  Nothing.

           Haynes struts over to a dry erase board, starts scribbling.

                                 HAYNES
                        Do they have a murder weapon?  No!

           He illustrates a gun and draws an “x” through it.

                                 HAYNES
                        Do they have fingerprints?

           He does the same, this time with a clumsy drawing of a 
           fingerprint.

                                 HAYNES
                        No!  They don’t have anything 
                        substantial except the word of two 
                        ladies of ill repute...and one guy 
                        who didn’t see who it was that shot 
                        him.

                                 KEN DAVIS
                        May I ask what your strategy is 
                        going to be?

                                 HAYNES
                        I have the same strategy for every 
                        case I take on.  Say you sue me 
                        because you say my dog bit you.  
                        Well, this is my defense; my dog 
                        doesn’t bite.

                        If that doesn’t work, my dog was 
                        tied up that night.  If that 
                        doesn’t work, then we go to number 
                        three, I don’t believe you really 
                        got bit. If that doesn’t succeed, I 
                        just say I don’t have a dog.  

           Haynes lights his pipe.  

                                 HAYNES
                        Cullen didn’t kill that little 
                        girl.  No, sir.  And we’re gonna 
                        prove it.  

                                 BURLESON
                        Race, is it true that you were 
                        defending some Hell’s Angels one 
                        time who allegedly crucified a man 
                        to a tree and you injected your 
                        hand with Zylocaine, ‘cause you 
                        were gonna nail it to the defense 
                        table to prove to the jury that it 
                        didn’t really hurt that much?

           Haynes smiles.

                                 HAYNES
                        Yeah...everything you just said is 
                        true, except the part about the 
                        Zylocaine.

                                 HUGE DEPUTY
                        Anything but that.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN AMARILLO TEXAS - DAY

           A big Cadillac pulls to a stop near an Amarillo diner.  FOUR 
           HARD LOOKING MEN climb out.  These are private detectives.  
           INT. DINER - AMARILLO, TEXAS - SAME

           PRIVATE DETECTIVE #1 strolls over to a table where a lone 
           diner, a SKINNY MACHINIST sits.

                                 PRIVATE DETECTIVE #1
                        Hey, Puddin’.  You ready to go to 
                        work?

           The Private Detective takes out an envelope stuffed with 
           cash.

                                 SKINNY MACHINIST
                        Yes, sir.  

                                 PRIVATE DETECTIVE #1
                        Spread this stuff around.  
                        Especially at church.  Which church 
                        you go to?

                                 SKINNY MACHINIST
                        Cavalry Baptist.

                                 PRIVATE DETECTIVE #1
                        Make sure everyone you know is 
                        aware that Priscilla Davis is a 
                        lying whore who takes illegal drugs 
                        and is after her husband’s money.

                                 SKINNY MACHINIST
                        Consider it done.

           SUPER: THAT DAMNED BITCH

           INT. FELLOWSHIP HALL - CAVALRY BAPTIST CHURCH - NIGHT

           A deacon’s meeting is in progress - about thirty people are 
           in the room, none of them under 65.

           AN OLD WOMAN shakes her head.

                                 OLD DEACON WOMAN
                        I heard she took drugs...

           INT. AUTO REPAIR SHOP - AMARILLO - DAY

           A BIG MAN in a cowboy hat leans on a Ford and smokes.  TWO 
           BLACK MEN beside him listen.  
                                 BIG MAN
                        Rich people don’t murder little 
                        girls themselves...they hire a hit 
                        man. Besides, if he did hire a hit 
                        man to kill that damned bitch...

                                 BLACK MAN
                        ...he’d be within his rights.  

           INT. BOWLING ALLEY - AMARILLO - NIGHT

           A BOWLING LEAGUE plays.  AN OLDER WOMAN stands drying her 
           hands over the blower.

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        ...she’s just after Cullen’s money.  
                        Women like that are all the same...

           INT. POOL HALL - AMARILLO - NIGHT

           A COWBOY sucks down a Lone Star.  A TRUCK DRIVER lines up a 
           shot.

                                 COWBOY
                        Sex orgies...drugs...and from what 
                        I hear, that damned bitch is a

                                 TRUCK DRIVER
                        A what?

                                 TRUCK DRIVER
                        Really?

                                 COWBOY
                        Really.

           INT. AMARILLO MARRIOT HOTEL - AMARILLO, TEXAS - DAY

           Joe Shannon and Tolly Gruber at the front desk, checking in.

           THE HOTEL MANAGER hands the two men their keys.

                                 HOTEL MANAGER
                        If I were on that jury...I know 
                        just what I’d do...I’d let that 
                        Cullen off.  That damned bitch just 
                        wants his money.  That’s what this 
                        whole thing is about.

           The two prosecutors look to one another with astonishment.
                                 HOTEL MANAGER
                        Ya’ll with the defense or the 
                        prosecution?

           INT. MARRIOT HOTEL - CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME

           Haynes paces before the TWO OTHER DEFENSE LAWYERS and Phil 
           Burleson.  

                                 HAYNES
                        We got it covered, Phil.  We’re 
                        ready to go.

                                 PHIL BURLESON
                        I’m not so sure...damn, this thing 
                        is nerve wracking.  You wanna order 
                        up some drinks?

                                 HAYNES
                        Normally, I’d say yes, but I 
                        can’t...I read somewhere that 
                        alcohol impairs the memory, and I 
                        need all the memory I can get.  
                        I’ve made a vow to abstain...for 
                        the duration.  Abstinence of any 
                        kind is an ugly concept for me.  

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           Priscilla looks at herself in the mirror.  Christy lounges on 
           the bed, watching “Good Morning, America”. Priscilla places a 
           large, silver cross around her neck, then looks at her 
           reflection for a long time.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        That bulldog lawyer Cullen’s got is 
                        gonna eat me alive.  

                                 CHRISTY
                        Mama!  Why’re you worried?  You 
                        have the truth on your side.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        And he’s got the law on his.  

           INT. COURTROOM - POTTER COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           JUDGE GEORGE DOWLEN, 38, youthful and hardly imposing, 
           watches Haynes with undisguised amazement at the bench.  

           Joe Shannon stands.
                                 JOE SHANNON
                        Your honor, we’d like to call 
                        prosecution witness Priscilla Davis 
                        to the witness stand.

           Priscilla walks into the courtroom.  Her cross gleams.  

           SPECTATORS scowl at her entrance.  They nudge each other with 
           contemptuous winks.  

           The jury notices her as well, and if they could nudge and 
           wink, they’d do it.  

           She takes the stand, and winces with pain.  No one buys her 
           painful grimace.  

           Pricilla looks out over a sea of faces;

           ONE FAT WOMAN shakes her head at her.

           A RED FACED MAN licks his lips.

           RACEHORSE HAYNES squints, sizing her up.

           CULLEN’s dark eyes bore into her soul.

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        Hello, Mrs. Davis.  If you could, 
                        state your name for the jury?

           All sound goes away.  

           Priscilla glances around the room as she talks.  Every stare 
           leveled her way is filled with loathing.  

           The sound returns.

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        Could you please go over the events 
                        of August 2 and 3rd, 1976 for us, 
                        please?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I was with my friend Stan Farr...

                                 HAYNES
                        Objection!  Not responsive.

           Dowlen nods.

                                 JUDGE DOWLEN
                        Sustained.  

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        Go on.
                                 PRISCILLA
                        We were coming home...

                                 HAYNES
                        Objection, your honor.  Leading.

                                 JUDGE DOWLEN
                        Leading?  I’m not following you.

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        That’s because there’s nothing to 
                        follow, your honor.

                                 HAYNES
                        Who is we?  She said “we”.  Who is 
                        “we” referring to?  Who is the “we” 
                        she’s assuming we know?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Stan...

           Judge Dowlen shoots her an angry look.

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        Let me rephrase.  Priscilla, you 
                        came home...

                                 HAYNES
                        Objection.  Leading.

                                 JUDGE DOWLEN
                        Sustained.  

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        Mrs. Davis...please tell us about 
                        what happened when you arrived home 
                        on the night of August 2, 1976.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I walked in...the house...and I 
                        noticed the alarm was off.  Stan 
                        went upstairs...

                                 HAYNES
                        Objection.  Not responsive.  The 
                        defendant is not on trial for the 
                        murder of Stan Farr.  Why does she 
                        keep mentioning his name, Your 
                        Honor?

                                 JUDGE DOWLEN
                        Sustained.  
                                 TIM CURRY
                        Your Honor, Mrs. Davis is simply 
                        trying to tell us what happened 
                        that night.  Why can’t we just let 
                        her tell the story?

                                 HAYNES
                        Your Honor...the defense feels that 
                        Mrs. Davis is trying to interject 
                        her, um, story...

           Haynes shoots a skeptical look to the jury and rolls his 
           eyes.

                                 HAYNES
                        ...with information not pertinent 
                        to this case in an attempt to 
                        misled the jury as to the facts.  

                                 JUDGE DOWLEN
                        Sidebar, gentlemen, please.  

           Both attorneys approach the judge.  Priscilla’s eyes sweep 
           the jury - not one friendly face returns her gaze.  

           The attorneys speak with the judge in whispers, and then they 
           return to their seats.

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        Mrs. Davis, if we could, let’s 
                        return to what happened once you 
                        returned home on the night of 
                        August, 2, 1976. You walked in, and 
                        what did you notice?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I noticed the alarm was turned off.  

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        And why was that important to you?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        It was normally turned on at night.  

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        Who could have turned that alarm 
                        off?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Andrea...or...um...

           Haynes’s eyes narrow.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Cullen.
                                 HAYNES
                        Objection!  Assuming facts not in 
                        evidence.  

           Priscilla keeps talking - all the sound goes away - Haynes 
           keeps objecting. 

           Priscilla looks to the prosecution table.  Not one of the 
           lawyers can look at her.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           Priscilla and Christy wait in the lobby.  Priscilla smokes.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        This is bullshit.

                                 CHRISTY
                        That bastard won’t even let you 
                        talk!

           Joe Shannon pokes his head out of the courtroom.  

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        Priscilla?  It’s the defense’s turn 
                        to cross examine.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        This sucks, Joe.

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        He’s tryin’ to rattle you.  Just go 
                        up there and tell the truth.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I’m trying to.

           Priscilla on the witness stand.  Haynes stands up at his 
           table and smiles at her. 

                                 HAYNES
                        Good afternoon, Mrs. Davis.  I’d 
                        like to ask you a few 
                        questions...if I may?

           Priscilla nods at him.  She looks to Cullen, who grins at 
           her.  

                                 HAYNES
                        I’d like to talk about your 
                        painkiller prescriptions, if I 
                        could.  

           The prosecutors look to each other - oh, shit.
                                 HAYNES
                        You are on painkillers now, I 
                        believe?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I am.

                                 HAYNES
                        What kind, may I ask?

                                 TIM CURRY
                        Objection...this is immaterial, 
                        your honor.

                                 JUDGE DOWLEN
                        Overruled.  Go ahead, answer the 
                        question.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Percodan.

                                 HAYNES
                        And you’ve been taking this...how 
                        long?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Since 1973...a skiing accident.  

                                 HAYNES
                        I don’t care why you’re taking it, 
                        I just want to know how long.  You 
                        answered the question, thank you. 

           Haynes pauses a long time.  

                                 HAYNES
                        Percodan, really?  Hmmm.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Yes.

                                 HAYNES
                        Were you on Percodan the night of 2 
                        and the 3rd of August 1976?  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I suppose I was.

                                 HAYNES
                        Suppose?

                                 TIM CURRY
                        Objection.  Badgering the witness.

                                 JUDGE DOWLEN
                        Um...sustained.  
                                 HAYNES
                        Let me rephrase.  Were you in pain 
                        that night?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        No.

                                 HAYNES
                        So you had taken Percodan?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Yes.

           Haynes shoots a “fuck you” look to Curry.  

                                 HAYNES
                        How many Percodans had you taken 
                        the night of 2 August?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I don’t know.

                                 HAYNES
                        No further questions.  

           LATER -

           Priscilla still on the witness stand.  Haynes gives her a 
           look that says “get ready” and then he scowls at the jury.

                                 HAYNES
                        Mrs. Davis, is your personal 
                        attorney in the courtroom?  I mean, 
                        someone other than the DA’s from 
                        Tarrant County?

           Priscilla glances to the prosecution table.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Uhhhhh....

                                 HAYNES
                        We’re waiting for an answer and I 
                        don’t think the lawyers at the 
                        prosecution table can answer it.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Uhhhhh....I’m not....

           The jurors cross their arms.  She’s lost them.

                                 HAYNES
                        Could we please mark this answer 
                        down in the record as unresponsive?  
                        Thank you.  I have a picture here 
                        I’d like you to identify...
           Haynes reaches into a pile of papers, and then a large photo 
           of Priscilla flutters out.  Beside her is W.T. Rufner, naked, 
           with a sock covering his genitals.  

                                 TIM CURRY
                        Objection!

                                 HAYNES
                        Sorry about that...this just 
                        slipped out.  I’m sorry Your Honor.

           Judge Dowlen cranes his neck to see the photo.

                                 JUDGE DOWLEN
                        Mr. Haynes...put that away.  That 
                        photograph has not been submitted 
                        into evidence and is therefore I 
                        will not allow it.

           The jury, like a bunch of ostriches, also crane to see the 
           obscene photograph.  

                                 HAYNES
                        I don’t suppose you’ve seen that 
                        photo before, Mrs. Davis?

           He hides it away.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Never.  That’s a doctored photo.

                                 HAYNES
                        Quick answer.

                                 JUDGE DOWLEN
                        I instruct the jury to stricken 
                        that last question and answer.  Mr. 
                        Haynes, don’t make me have to fine 
                        you for contempt.  

                                 HAYNES
                        Yes, sir. 

           Haynes sneaks a grin at the jury.  They eat it up. Tim Curry 
           and Tolly Gruber look to Priscilla with disgust.  

                                 HAYNES
                        No further questions.

           Priscilla walks off the stand.  

           INT. FOYER -- POTTER COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Priscilla walks out with Christy.  TWO FAT WOMEN carrying big 
           Bibles hiss at her.  
           EXT. POTTER COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Priscilla walks out of the ancient limestone building.  A 
           waiting Lincoln idles.

           Christy opens the door for her.  

           TWO OLDER COWBOYS shout at her across the courthouse lawn;

                                 OLDER COWBOY
                        Get outta Amarillo you gold digging 
                        bitch!

           INT. COURTROOM - POTTER COUNTY COURTHOUSE

           The EMT who treated Beverly Bass on the witness stand.  

                                 EMT
                        She was high on something, if you 
                        know what I mean.

                                 TIM CURRY
                        Objection!  Assuming facts not in 
                        evidence.

                                 HAYNES
                        You are a Emergency Medical 
                        Technician, are you not?

                                 EMT
                        I am.

                                 HAYNES
                        Does that qualify you to judge if a 
                        person were inebriated?

                                 EMT
                        Yes.

                                 JUDGE DOWLEN
                        Objection overruled.  

           Haynes nods a “thank you” to Dowlen.

                                 HAYNES
                        You said “you know what I mean”.  
                        No, I do not know what you mean.  
                        Could you elaborate?

                                 EMT
                        Ms. Bass...her eyes were all 
                        red...like...she was high on pot.
                                 HAYNES
                        Pot?  And what is that a vernacular 
                        for?

                                 EMT
                        Marijuana.

           INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - POTTER COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Cullen strolls the hallway, his hands in his pockets, 
           whistling a cheerful tune.

           A telephone rings in the bailiff's office, and Cullen picks 
           it up.

                                 CULLEN
                        Courthouse.  This is Cullen Davis.

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                             (through telephone)
                        They got you answerin’ the phones 
                        now?

                                 CULLEN
                        Just tryin’ to help.

           INT. COURTROOM - POTTER COUNTY COURTHOUSE

           Cullen sits at the defense table, and TEN OLDER, HEAVY WOMEN, 
           lean over to him, handing him a plate of chocolate cookies.  

           These are Cullen’s Groupies.

                                 CULLEN GROUPIE #1
                        We made these just for you, Mr. 
                        Davis.  

                                 CULLEN
                        Why, thank you, ma’am.

           He takes a cookie and eats it.

                                 CULLEN
                        Just delicious.  It really is.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Beverly Bass on the stand. Haynes sizes her up. 

                                 HAYNES
                        So, it was in the summer of 1975 
                        that Priscilla helped you out with 
                        your...ahem...situation?
                                 BEVERLY BASS
                        Um...

           She looks to the prosecution table.  They look away.

                                 HAYNES
                        Don’t look at them...they can’t 
                        help you.  Just answer the 
                        question.  You had a medical 
                        procedure done in the summer of 
                        1975 that was paid for by Priscilla 
                        Davis, correct?

           Tears spill out of her blue eyes.

                                 BEVERLY BASS
                        Yes.

                                 HAYNES
                        One might say you were indebted to 
                        Mrs. Davis.

                                 BEVERLY BASS
                        It’s not like that.

                                 HAYNES
                        Um...in your deposition taken last 
                        year, you stated you’d had no 
                        medical procedures.  Did you 
                        suddenly remember?  

           She looks to the jury.  They return her glance with piercing 
           expressions of repugnance.  

                                 BEVERLY BASS
                        I didn’t want to...you know...

                                 HAYNES
                        It’s okay...you perjured yourself, 
                        but unless the DA’s office wants to 
                        pursue that...

           Haynes flashes a quick grin to Joe Shannon.

                                 HAYNES
                        You’ve cleared it up for us.  Thank 
                        you.  

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           Haynes still questioning her.  Beverly is tired, her face 
           ashen.

                                 HAYNES
                        You said you heard shots inside the 
                        house, correct?
                                 BEVERLY BASS
                        Yes.

                                 HAYNES
                        But you said you saw a man in black 
                        outside the house?  Correct?

                                 BEVERLY BASS
                        I...um...yeah...I heard...yeah, I 
                        saw the man outside...

                                 HAYNES
                        Gunshot inside, but you saw a man 
                        outside.  Hmmmmmm.

           Haynes turns to the jury and gestures with an exaggerated  
           mock shrug.  

                                 HAYNES
                        No further questions.  You may 
                        excuse the, uh, witness.  

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           Bubba Gravel on the witness stand.  

           Haynes stands at his table, glasses in hand.  

                                 HAYNES
                        Before we proceed with you, Mr. 
                        Gravel, I’d like to ask; do you 
                        have a pending personal injury suit 
                        against the defendant, Mr. Davis?

           Bubba nods, sheepish.

                                 HAYNES
                        I didn’t hear you.  Speak up for 
                        the court transcript, please sir.

                                 BUBBA GRAVEL
                        Yes.

                                 HAYNES
                        No further questions, your honor.  
                        I’d hate to sully Mr. Gravel’s 
                        personal injury suit with 
                        testimony.  Good luck with your 
                        lawsuit, Mr. Gravel.  

           Haynes winks at Bubba.  

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           W.T. Rufner on the stand, wearing dark glasses, a sports 
           coat, and a T-shirt.  
                                 HAYNES
                        Did you have sex orgies at the 
                        Davis mansion in the summer of 
                        1975?

                                 W.T. RUFNER 
                        How many people have to be involved 
                        to make it a orgy?

           The prosecutors bow their heads - defeated.  

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        More than two?

           Haynes grins to the jury.  

                                 HAYNES
                        How many times did you sell drugs 
                        in the Davis mansion during that 
                        summer?

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        I plead the fifth.  

           INT. JAIL CELL - POTTER COUNTY COURTHOUSE - NIGHT

           Cullen sits alone in his cell, talking on the telephone.  The 
           television runs in the background.  

                                 CULLEN
                        Karen...this thing should be 
                        wrapped up before Thanksgiving.  
                        I’m not worried.  So go ahead and 
                        make those reservations at Aspen.  
                        For two.  Nice way to celebrate.  

           INT. COURTROOM - POTTER COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           W.T. Rufner, looking hungover and spent, on the witness 
           stand.  

           Haynes suppresses a smile.

                                 HAYNES
                        Let’s go over this again...you and 
                        Priscilla broke up, amicably...

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        Yes...amicably.

                                 HAYNES
                        ...and you talked with her about 
                        this...how long?
                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        Well, let’s see...over a six pack, 
                        so I’d say an hour or so.  

                                 HAYNES
                        Over a six pack?  

                                 W.T. RUFNER
                        Yes, sir.

           Haynes nudges Burleson.

                                 HAYNES
                        Your Honor, I request we take a 
                        break.

                                 JUDGE DOWLEN
                        Let’s call a break...ten minutes.

           People stand up, stretch.  Jurors file out.

                                 HAYNES
                        I’m gonna go easy on this guy.  
                        This ain’t your killer.

                                 BURLESON
                        This guy’s a druggie...Race...what 
                        the hell?

                                 HAYNES
                        Any man who measures time with a 
                        six pack can’t be all bad.  

           INT. BEDROOM - DAVIS MANSION - NIGHT

           Priscilla sits alone on her enormous bed, chain smoking.  She 
           knocks back 4 Percodans and washes them down with a tumbler 
           full of tequila.  Old movies play on TV.    

           INT. COURTROOM - POTTER COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Haynes stands before the jury - closing arguments.

                                 HAYNES
                        Are you gonna believe her?  She’s 
                        the corruptor of young people, the 
                        Machiavellian influence behind this 
                        whole thing...the lady in the la-di-
                        dah pinafore.

           All eyes and hears are on Haynes, except one man, who sits at 
           the back of the courtroom openly weeping; Jack Wilborne.  He 
           shakes with grief.  

           SUPER: NOVEMBER 17, 1977
           The jury foreman stands; 

                                 JURY FOREMAN
                        We the jury find the defendant, 
                        Thomas Cullen Davis, not guilty of 
                        the charge of capital murder.

           The courtroom erupts with rebel yells and cheers.  

           EXT. COURTHOUSE - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Joe Shannon stalks out, lugging a huge briefcase.  

           Jack Wilborne, face red from grief, reaches his hand out to 
           Shannon.

                                 JACK WILBORNE
                        Thank you so much, sir, for 
                        everything you did.  You did a 
                        great job.  No jury in Texas will 
                        ever convict Cullen Davis...but I 
                        appreciate your trying.  

           Joe can barely look him in the eye.  Wilborne slowly walks to 
           his Cadillac in the distance.  Joe watches him, and then 
           climbs in his car.

           Joe Shannon cries bitter tears of shame.  

           INT. RHETT BUTLERS BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

           Judge George Dowlen sits alone at the bar, drinking a Scotch 
           and soda in the upscale Amarillo watering hole.  He stirs his 
           Scotch with a celery stick.  

           Haynes, Davis, Burleson, and the others on the defense team, 
           as well as Cullen’s Groupies, bound in to the bar.  They 
           cheer and whoop it up.  

           Dowlen gets up to leave.  

                                 HAYNES
                        Judge...hold up, mister.  You gotta 
                        join us.

                                 JUDGE DOWLEN
                        I really can’t...it’s unethical.

                                 HAYNES
                        Yes you can, sir.  I’m off the 
                        wagon as of...
           Haynes reaches for a cognac that’s offered him.

                                 HAYNES
                        ...now.  

           He knocks back the drink and downs it in one gulp.  

                                 HAYNES
                        Damn...that tastes good! One 
                        forgets...how perfect that stuff 
                        is.

           He motions for a refill and gets it.  Dowlen reluctantly 
           joins the victory party.  

           TV CAMERAS with their bright lights invade the bar.  Haynes 
           gulps the drink down, then motions for another refill. His 
           cheeks are flush.

                                 TV REPORTER
                        Could we have a word with you Mr. 
                        Haynes?

           Haynes bounds forward, eyes gleaming, expensive cognac 
           sloshing out of the snifter.

                                 TV REPORTER
                        Congratulations on your victory, 
                        sir.

                                 HAYNES
                        Thank you.

                                 TV REPORTER
                        Do you have any comments?

                                 HAYNES
                        Yes, I do.  Priscilla Davis is the 
                        dregs of the earth! She’s probably 
                        shooting up right now...she’s the 
                        most shameless, brazen hussy of all 
                        humanity!  She’s a charlatan, a 
                        harlot, and a liar!  She is a 
                        snake, unworthy of belief under 
                        oath!  A dope fiend...a habitué of 
                        dope!

           Phil Burleson, seeing Haynes in the bright lights, tries to 
           pull him away.  Haynes resists.  

                                 HAYNES
                        She is the most sordid person in 
                        the entire United States...no, the 
                        world!  Someone ought to wrap 
                        barbed wire around her house and 
                        not let her out!
           Haynes goes back into the party, grinning to the TV crew and 
           giving them a thumbs up.  Cullen and Karen walk over to 
           Haynes, who hugs Cullen, and then both men do “the bump”.  
           Someone hands Haynes a guitar, and he starts strumming, 
           singing “The Ballad Of Cullen Davis”

                                 HAYNES
                             (singing)
                        There was a man named Cullen 
                        Davis...a man accused of a 
                        crime...he was a good man, with 
                        lots of money!  

           And then Haynes laughs.

                                 HAYNES
                             (singing)
                        And that no good woman wanted it 
                        all.  She tried to take his 
                        reputation...

           LATER - 

           The party winds down. Haynes sways over to Cullen, sits next 
           to him. 

                                 HAYNES
                        Tell me, pardner...

                                 CULLEN
                        Yes?

                                 HAYNES
                        Did you change while in jail?

                                 CULLEN
                        No...not at all.  I’m the same man.  

           INT. BEDROOM - DAVIS MANSION - NIGHT

           Priscilla chain smokes and watches television.  The telephone 
           rings, she picks it up - 

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Hello?

           INT. POOLROOM - DAVIS MANSION - NIGHT

           Priscilla walks into the cavern-like poolroom, reaches for 
           one of Cullen’s pool cues, and smashes it into kindling.  She 
           takes another, and smashes it to pieces, screaming with 
           frustration.  She smashes another, then another.  She throws 
           all of them in the fireplace and watches them burn, the 
           flames reflected in her tears.

           SUPER: CHRISTMAS 1977

           Cullen Davis, Karen Masters beside him, stroll onto the 
           promenade deck at Texas Stadium.  Other rich people swarm 
           around him the minute he steps in - he’s a rock star.  Papers 
           are thrust at him, men and women ask for autographs.  

           Cullen obliges. Big, Texas OIL MEN grab for meaty handshakes.  

                                 OIL MAN #1
                        Congratulations on beating down 
                        that damned bitch!

                                 CULLEN
                        Cowboys are gonna win today.

                        We were always with you, Cullen.

           INT. PRIVATE BOX - TEXAS STADIUM - DAY

           Cullen Davis takes a seat in his now refurbished box - all 
           done in Laura Ashley dullness.  

           Ken, Cullen’s brother, sits beside him.  

                                 KEN
                        How’re you doin’?

                                 CULLEN
                        Fine. Merry Christmas.  Think we 
                        can win today?

                                 KEN
                        We’re goin’ all the way this year.

           Cullen’s friends mingle politely in the box.  Karen passes 
           out cocktails and lays out chips and dip.   

           The game roars below.  

           Cullen glances from the game to the activity going on around 
           him.  He watches his brother sipping his cocktail.  Dark 
           thoughts cloud his expression.  

           TWO OIL MEN lean in to Cullen.  

                                 OIL MAN #2
                        Cullen, tell me...how high do you 
                        think we’re gonna go a barrel this 
                        year?
                                 CULLEN
                             (annoyed)
                        I dunno.  

                                 OIL MAN #2
                        You don’t?

                                 CULLEN
                        Don’t care, either.  

                                 OIL MAN #2
                        Why not?

                                 CULLEN
                        Why should I?  All the oil’s gonna 
                        be gone by 1990. 

           The entire room goes quiet.  

                                 CULLEN
                        That’s right.  Mark my 
                        words...it’ll all be gone.  No 
                        future in that business.   

           Ken looks to his brother with an astonished expression.  
           Cullen turns back to the game, enjoying the results from the 
           verbal stink bomb he just unleashed.  He stares at all of the 
           people in his private box with killer’s eyes.  

                                 CULLEN
                        No future at all.  

           INT. BEDROOM - DAVIS MANSION - DAY

           SUPER: SPRING 1978

           Priscilla paces the room, chain smoking and carrying a white, 
           princess telephone with a super long cord attached.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        What do you mean he’s coming over?  
                        What happened to that restraining 
                        order?

                                 RITCHIE
                             (through telephone)
                        The judge has rescinded it 
                        temporarily so he can do an 
                        inventory of the contents of the 
                        mansion.  

           Priscilla stubs out her cigarette and lights another.  She 
           downs two Percodans.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Absurd!
                                 RITCHIE
                             (through telephone)
                        It’s considered perfectly 
                        acceptable.  And this judge, 
                        Eidson...he’s on your side.  I can 
                        tell.  Cullen’s argument is that he 
                        has a lot of valuables in the home 
                        that he wants to check on to insure 
                        that they’re still...uh...valuable.  
                        Isn’t there some kind of gold and 
                        jade chess set in a safe upstairs?  
                        That’s what he’s got his panties in  
                        a bunch about.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        When’s he comin’ over?

                                 RITCHIE
                             (through telephone)
                        In an hour or two.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Damn!  Ronald!  You gotta delay 
                        this!

                                 RITCHIE
                             (through phone)
                        The judge has already made his 
                        decision. I’d suggest you go 
                        somewhere for a few hours...get the 
                        hell outta there.  And make 
                        sure...double sure...that gold and 
                        jade chess set is in that safe.  

           She throws the receiver across the room.  Christy appears, a 
           worried expression on her face.  

                                 CHRISTY
                        I was listenin’ on the extension.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        So you know.  Come on, girl.  Let’s 
                        get the hell outta Dodge.  

                                 CHRISTY
                        How many pills did you take today?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I don’t remember.

           Priscilla shakes two more out of the bottle.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I gotta get a refill.
                                 CHRISTY
                        Mama...you gotta be careful with 
                        that stuff.  Remember what happened 
                        to Elvis?   

                                 PRISCILLA
                        If Cullen’s bullets can’t kill me, 
                        how can these little, old pills 
                        hurt me?  

           She looks around the bedroom - it’s a mess.  Clothes 
           everywhere.  An ashtray full of cigarettes.  Empty pill 
           bottles.  Christy helps her clean the place up.

           INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - DAVIS MANSION - SAME

           Priscilla goes into the cavernous closet - her clothes 
           hanging on both sides.  She goes to the distant safe, turns 
           the dial, takes out the jade chess set and dumps it in a 
           pillow case.  She then spends more time in front of the safe, 
           and slams it shut.

           She carries the pillowcase laden with the golden-jade chess 
           set out of the bedroom.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAVIS MANSION - DAY

           Christy drives the white Lincoln, and Priscilla slouches in 
           the seat, hidden behind huge sunglasses. 

           A fleet of three black Cadillacs swoop into the driveway just 
           as Christy leaves.  

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAVIS MANSION - DAY

           Cullen and Wayne Eubanks enter.  FIVE LAWYERS come in behind 
           them, along with TWO PRIVATE DETECTIVES.  

           Cullen strolls around - examines the pool table.  Cigarette 
           burns scar the wood finish.  The pool cues, gone, what’s left 
           of them in the fireplace.  He sniffs the air, shakes his 
           head.

                                 CULLEN
                        I smell cigarettes.

           Cullen also examines the walls - handprints and grime 
           everywhere.

                                 CULLEN
                        Get pictures of all this damage, 
                        will ya?

           Cameras flash.  
                                 CULLEN
                        Wayne, you see this?

                                 WAYNE EUBANKS
                        I do, indeed.  

           Cullen lightly bounds up the stairs.

           INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - DAVIS MANSION - SAME

           Cullen enters, stalks over to the safe, spins the dial, opens 
           it.  He looks inside.

           In the safe are framed portraits of Stan Farr and Andrea 
           Wilborne.  

           Cullen stares at both pictures with a blank expression. 

           INT. BEDROOM - DAVIS MANSION

           Cullen leaves the cavernous closet, then walks over to a 
           night stand beside the bed.  He looks down at the ashtray 
           overflowing with Eve cigarette butts surrounded by empty 
           bottles of prescription pain killers.  He kicks the table 
           over, and an ugly cloud of ashes floats down, marking the 
           spot where the table used to be.  

           INT. RESTAURANT - COLONIAL COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

           Cullen holds court at a table full of ADMIRERS.  

                                 CULLEN
                        I’m thinkin’ about financing a 
                        movie about the murder case.  You 
                        know...tell it like it really 
                        happened.  

           Karen hangs on his every word.  She wears sunglasses that 
           barely cover the new shiner that stains her left eye.

                                 CULLEN
                        I want Ann Margaret to play 
                        Karen...and I was thinkin’ Phyllis 
                        Diller for Priscilla.

           Everyone laughs - a little too loudly. David McCrory, 
           Cullen’s sycophantic friend, leans in;

                                 DAVID 
                        Who’s gonna play Racehorse?

                                 CULLEN
                        Mickey Rooney.
                                 KAREN
                        Here’s the real question...Cullen, 
                        who plays you?

                                 CULLEN
                        Al Pacino.  

           INT. SWISS HOUSE STEAK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Cullen and Karen enjoy a steak dinner.  All eyes in the Swiss 
           chalet style restaurant are on Cullen, who bathes in the 
           attention.  

           ANOTHER PARTY is seated at a far away table.  Suddenly, the 
           attention on Cullen shifts.  Cullen cranes his neck to see 
           who it is that just stole the spotlight away from him.

           Actor JAMES GARNER, looking like he just stepped out of an 
           episode of “The Rockford Files”, sits with his WIFE.  

                                 CULLEN
                        Why didn’t I think of him?

                                 KAREN
                        What?

                                 CULLEN
                        James Garner, sittin’ right over 
                        there.  He’d be perfect to play me 
                        in my movie.

           Cullen gestures to a passing WAITRESS in Swiss National 
           Costume.  

                                 CULLEN
                        Miss...could you send a bottle of 
                        your best champagne over there to 
                        Mr. Garner?

           She nods.

                                 CULLEN
                        And give him this.

           Cullen pulls out a notepad from his jacket and scribbles 
           something down.  He signs it with a flourish.

           TWO WAITERS wearing lederhosen arrive with a chilled bottle 
           of Dom Perignon and set it at James Garner’s table.  The 
           Waitress hands him the note.  Garner glances over to Cullen, 
           who is beaming his way, and then he whispers to the waitress.  

           The Waitress summons up courage, then heads back over to 
           Cullen.
                                 WAITRESS
                        Mr. Davis, Mr. Garner thanks you 
                        for the champagne but...he told me 
                        to tell you he wants nothing to do 
                        with your movie.  

           Cullen’s smile evaporates. 

           INT. PARIS COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Priscilla sits at a table sipping coffee, wearing her 
           enormous sunglasses.  TWO BEEFY BODYGUARDS flank her.  

           A KXAS TV REPORTER and his camera crew approach her table.  
           She gestures to the bodyguards - “it’s okay”.  

                                 TV REPORTER 
                        Mrs. Davis...how are you?

           She shrugs, flying on Percodan.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        You?

                                 TV REPORTER
                        Can’t complain. Could we get an on-
                        camera comment from you?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Go ahead.

                                 TV REPORTER
                        Cullen wants to make a movie about 
                        the murders and the trial.  

           Priscilla takes off her sunglasses, a bemused expression on 
           her face.

                                 TV REPORTER 
                        He has stated he wants Ann Margaret 
                        to play Karen Masters and Phyllis 
                        Diller to play you.

           Without skipping a beat - 

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Did you ask him who’s going to play 
                        Andrea?

           INT. WHITE ELEPHANT SALOON - NIGHT

           Cullen and David McCrory play pool.  McCrory misses easy 
           shots.  Cullen gloats.  
                                 CULLEN
                        Guess today’s not your day, David.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s not a good time for me.  

           Cullen makes a shot, sinks a six ball.

                                 CULLEN
                        Well...maybe I can turn that 
                        around.  How’d you like to work for 
                        me?

                                 DAVID
                        You gotta be kidding!

                                 CULLEN
                        Why?

                                 DAVID
                        I thought you were still pissed off 
                        at me for not testifying on your 
                        behalf in Amarillo.

                                 CULLEN
                        There’s a lot I’m pissed off about 
                        from that Amarillo trial...

           David eyes scream panic.  

                                 CULLEN
                        ...because of that...because you 
                        were a friend that didn’t help me 
                        out...you owe me.  You know that, 
                        don’t ‘ya?

                                 DAVID
                        I know.  

           David watches Cullen sink more balls.  He lines up the eight 
           ball.

                                 CULLEN
                        Here we go...

           He sinks it.

                                 CULLEN
                        That’s four games to nothing.  Want 
                        to keep playin’?

                                 DAVID
                        You serious about that job?

           Cullen racks up.  
                                 DAVID
                        ‘Cause I could use one.  Hell, I 
                        got overdue bills to pay since I 
                        lost my last job.  Kids over there 
                        at the private school, I got two 
                        tax liens on me...

           Cullen shoots the break shot.

                                 CULLEN
                        I’d like to hire you to be the 
                        assistant to the guy that runs Jet 
                        Air...a company I just bought.  Job 
                        pays $20k a year, plus a car and 
                        benefits.  

                                 DAVID
                        Twenty!  That’s huge!  Thank you, 
                        Cullen!  Thank you!

           Cullen misses his next shot, and David lines up his.  He 
           deliberately misses.  Cullen pulls out his wallet, and flips 
           out a picture.  He shows it to David, who grimaces.

                                 DAVID
                        What the fuck?

                                 CULLEN
                        What do you think of that?

                                 DAVID
                        Why do you carry somethin’ like 
                        that?

                                 CULLEN
                        I dunno.

           EXT. MID-CONTINENTAL BUILDING - FORT WORTH, TEXAS - DAY

           Establish the Mid-Continental Building, headquarters of 
           Kendavis Industries.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MID-CONTINENTAL BUILDING - SAME

           Cullen slouches in his chair, Ken sits at his, and AN 
           ACCOUNTANT goes over paperwork.

                                 KEN
                        When’s it gonna stop?

           Cullen shrugs with his eyes.  
                                 KEN
                        You’ve unloaded half of our company 
                        assets into what I believe to 
                        be...if you don’t mind me saying 
                        so...questionable investments that 
                        have yet to pay off.  

           Cullen stares off into space.

                                 KEN
                        And this divorce of yours...this 
                        goddamned divorce judge has his 
                        hand up our ass!  We can’t do 
                        anything with the company without 
                        informing him!  We’re frozen 
                        without this bastard’s permission.

                                 CULLEN
                        What do you want me to say?

                                 KEN
                        Just tell us...when’s this 
                        craziness gonna end?  At the rate 
                        we’re goin’...we’ll be broke by...

           The Accountant holds up a paper.

                                 KEN
                        1987.  Think about it.  A billion 
                        dollars down the commode. And for 
                        what?

           Ken storms out of the conference room.  

           INT./EXT. LINCOLN TOWN CAR - DAY

           SUPER: DAVID’S BIG JOB

           David McCrory drinks beer and drives his huge, Lincoln Town 
           Car around Fort Worth.  He’s living large and loving it. A 
           huge car phone rings - loudly.

                                 DAVID
                        McCrory.

                                 CULLEN
                             (through phone)
                        Come to my hotel.  

                                 DAVID
                        Yes, sir!

           David accelerates at his master’s beckoning.
           INT. CULLEN’S SUITE - GREEN OAKS INN - DAY

           David slurps beer and listens as Cullen paces before him.

                                 CULLEN
                        Side work.  An addendum to your 
                        current job.  

                                 DAVID
                        Yes, sir.

                                 CULLEN
                        I’m gonna pay you for this work in 
                        cash.

           Cullen peels off several hundred dollar bills.  

                                 CULLEN
                        This’ll get your started.  

                                 DAVID
                        Can I have another beer?

           Cullen throws a beer his way.  David struggles with the cap, 
           twisting it to no avail.

           Cullen’s snake eyes size David up.

                                 CULLEN
                        The real work begins...now.

                                 DAVID
                        What do you want me to do?

                                 CULLEN
                        Keep an eye on Priscilla’s 
                        attorney...I don’t trust that fat 
                        snake. That big bastard is feeding 
                        his fat ass with my money.  He’s 
                        got an “in” with that son of a 
                        bitch judge...Eidson.  See if 
                        they’re meeting up...colluding.

                                 DAVID
                        Why?

                                 CULLEN
                        If they are in collusion, then we 
                        get that judge off the case.  I 
                        need another judge...that’s a 
                        little more business friendly.  I 
                        want this goddamned divorce over 
                        and this motherfucker is draggin’ 
                        it out. 

                                 DAVID
                        Got it.
                                 CULLEN
                        There’s ten grand in this if you 
                        get this all figured out for me.  
                        Can you handle it?

           Cullen watches the Dallas Mavericks play on TV.  A long 
           silence. Then - 

                                 DAVID
                        Cullen, I’ve always wondered about 
                        something...

                                 CULLEN
                        What?

                                 DAVID
                        Those shootings at the mansion.  
                        Ever wondered who did it?

           Cullen shakes his head “no”.

                                 DAVID
                        I mean, it’s weird.  I read 
                        somewhere that when Priscilla came 
                        home that night...all the doors 
                        were left open.

           Cullen watches the game with interest.

                                 CULLEN
                        I didn’t leave any doors open.

           David gulps.

           INT. BILL MARTIN’S SEAFOOD RESTAURANT - DAY

           Priscilla picks at fried oysters, cigarette in hand.  Berk 
           Ritchie sits across from her.

                                 RITCHIE
                        Judge Eidson really has the screws 
                        down on Cullen. 

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Good.  The man needs to be 
                        watched...on the loose like he is. 

           Ritchie tries to calm her down.

                                 RITCHIE
                        They can’t retry him for Andrea’s 
                        murder.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Why don’t they try him for Stan’s? 
                                 RITCHIE
                        I don’t work in the District 
                        Attorney’s office...I can’t 
                        elucidate on their decision making 
                        process.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        It makes no sense to me...letting a 
                        sick son of a bitch like Cullen off 
                        for murder.  Two murders. And I got 
                        a funny feeling he’s not 
                        finished...you know...he’s still 
                        got unfinished business with me. 

           Priscilla sets down her fork.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        How come everything’s gotta be 
                        fried? Fried oysters, fried shrimp, 
                        fried clams...and then I’ve got 
                        indigestion for hours. Why do they 
                        do it that way?   

                                 RITCHIE
                        We’re not in a coastal region... 
                        it’s hard to keep seafood fresh 
                        here.  So...they fry it.  Otherwise 
                        it tastes like shit.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Whoever’s gonna figure that out 
                        someday will make themselves a 
                        mint.

                                 RITCHIE
                        What’s that?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        How to keep fish fresh...for inland 
                        seafood restaurants like this one.  
                        Let’s try to figure it out, Berk.  
                        We’ll get rich.  

           EXT. PARKING LOT - COCO’S FAMOUS HAMBURGERS - DAY

           David steps out of his Lincoln and crosses the parking lot.  
           Cullen sits in his huge Cadillac Eldorado, the engine idling.  
           Cullen motions for David to come in.

           INT./EXT. CULLEN’S CADILLAC - SAME

           David, sweating profusely, plops down beside Cullen in the 
           front seat.  David shivers - Cullen’s got the a.c. on full 
           blast.  
                                 CULLEN
                        What you got?

                                 DAVID
                        There is absolutely no evidence of 
                        collusion between Judge Eidson and 
                        Priscilla’s attorneys.  I been 
                        watchin’ ‘em for days.  

           Cullen turns up the radio to stun volume. He pulls David 
           close to him, talking in his ear.

                                 CULLEN
                        Change of plan.  You say you know 
                        reliable, trustworthy people?

                                 DAVID
                        I do.

                                 CULLEN
                        Good.  Then I’d like you to get 
                        Beverly Bass and Bubba Gravel 
                        killed. 

           David’s jaw drops.

                                 CULLEN
                        Make it look like a drug deal gone 
                        bad.  

                                 DAVID
                        Why do you want to do a crazy thing 
                        like that?

                                 CULLEN
                        Beverly Bass was the only one that 
                        anyone believed at that trial.  I 
                        can’t have that, David.  I just 
                        can’t.  

           David doesn’t know what to do - so he laughs.

                                 DAVID
                        Anyone else you want killed?

                                 CULLEN
                        Yeah...fifteen people.  Don’t worry 
                        about money...I’ll take care of 
                        that.  I got a list together.

           David can’t believe what he’s hearing.

                                 CULLEN
                        That fucking judge...Eidson...I 
                        want him dead.  Along with 
                        Priscilla.  
           David sweats despite the a.c.

                                 DAVID
                        Really?

                                 CULLEN
                        Really.

                                 DAVID
                        I can’t go along with you on this 
                        one.

           Cullen’s eyes go ice cold.  

                                 CULLEN
                        If you turn around on me this 
                        time...betray me again...I will 
                        have you and your entire family 
                        killed in the nastiest way I can 
                        come up with.  I have the money and 
                        the power to make you disappear and 
                        seem like you were never born.

           David nods.

                                 CULLEN
                        You on board with me?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah...

                                 CULLEN
                        I’ll call you with further 
                        instructions.  

           David stumbles out of the car.  Cullen starts up and zooms 
           away.  David lurches over to his car, and vomits.

           INT. DAVID MCCRORY’S HOME - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           SUPER: AUGUST 1978

           David McCrory’s wife, Margie, stands at the bedroom door 
           listening.  

           HIS DAUGHTER, PICKEL, walks up.

                                 PICKEL
                        Is Daddy okay?

                                 MARGIE
                        Go back to your room, sweetie.  
                        Daddy’s fine.

           Through the doorway, David can be heard blubbering.
                                 DAVID
                             (O.C.)
                        I don’t know what I was 
                        thinkin’...goin’ to work for Cullen 
                        again...I shoulda known.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAVID MCCRORY HOME - NIGHT

           Daddy is not fine.  David sits on the floor, a half empty 
           bottle of Jack Daniels in front of him.  He chain smokes, and 
           tears wet his face.  He’s on the telephone.

                                 DAVID
                        I done fucked it up bad this 
                        time...real bad...that mean ass son 
                        of a bitch is comin’ after me if I 
                        don’t hire a hit man for him...

                                 DAVID’S FRIEND
                             (through phone)
                        Hold up...what’d you say? Cullen 
                        Davis wants you to hire a hit man?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah...and he wants to kill 
                        everyone who testified against him 
                        at that trial...

                                 DAVID’S FRIEND
                             (through phone)
                        Whoa!  Whoa!  Hold on, buddy!  He 
                        wants to kill...well, who else?

                                 DAVID
                        Some judge...his divorce 
                        judge...his wife...and his brother, 
                        man.  His brother!  Isn’t that a 
                        sin against God...?

                                 DAVID’S FRIEND
                             (through phone)
                        What’s wrong with you?  Right now, 
                        get your act together, start goin’ 
                        back to church, and get right with 
                        God.  I’m gonna call the FBI when 
                        we hang up.  Hiring a hit man is 
                        bad enough...hiring a hit man to 
                        kill a judge is bad as hell.  
                        David, go back to church.  God’s 
                        the only one that can help you now.  

                                 DAVID
                        Okay...okay...

           He hangs up, swigs more Jack, then opens the bedroom door.  
           Margie gives him a hard look.
                                 DAVID
                        Not a word of this to anyone.  Not 
                        one, single word.  

           He embraces her.  She does not return it.  

           INT./EXT. CULLEN’S CADILLAC - NIGHT 

           Cullen drives, a.c. on high, his eyes scanning the night.  

                                 CULLEN
                             (to himself)
                        I like to drive.  See things.  
                        Quiet, perfect, peaceful.  A 
                        cloudless horizon.  Let’s see 
                        here...   

           Cullen slows and looks toward a large, residential home that 
           sits quietly.  Cullen checks out the neighborhood, then 
           drives on.

                                 CULLEN
                             (to himself)
                        This is easy.  

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           AN FBI AGENT, clean cut and all business, tapes a microphone 
           to David’s enormous torso.  His body pours sweat.  

                                 FBI AGENT
                        You okay?  You seem kinda nervous.

                                 DAVID
                        I am.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Don’t let him see your nervous.

                                 DAVID
                        I’ll try.  

           EXT. PARKING LOT - COCO’S FAMOUS HAMBURGERS - DAY

           Cullen and David sit in Cullen’s Cadillac. 

           INT. CULLEN’S CADILLAC - SAME

           Cullen admires a .22 Ruger resting on his lap.

                                 CULLEN
                        That’s nice...just what the doctor 
                        ordered.  
           He picks up the gun, balances it in his hand, and aims it at 
           McCrory.

                                 CULLEN
                        Isn’t that sweet?

                                 DAVID
                        Hey!  Don’t aim that son of a bitch 
                        at me!  We’re friends now, aren’t 
                        we?  You’re not gonna do something 
                        stupid with that gun, are you?

                                 CULLEN
                        Self protection.

                                 DAVID
                        Self protection my ass.

           Cullen hands him back the gun.

                                 CULLEN
                        I want a silencer.

                                 DAVID
                        Will do.  Hey...I gotta tell 
                        you...we got somewhat of a problem.  
                        The man is in town to put the judge 
                        away...he’s the first target you 
                        know...

                                 CULLEN
                        What’s the problem?

                                 DAVID
                        The man found out he was a judge 
                        and now he wants a lot more money.

                                 CULLEN
                        How much?

                                 DAVID
                        One hundred thousand dollars.

                                 CULLEN
                        Bullshit.

                                 DAVID
                        I told him bullshit, too, but he 
                        says it’s a judge and it’s gonna 
                        bring a lot more heat.  It’s in the 
                        fucking paper every day...he’s on 
                        TV...what more can I do?

           Cullen clenches his jaw.
                                 DAVID
                        Priscilla is a different story.  
                        He’d rather do Priscilla than do 
                        the judge, so if you give me a 
                        price on Priscilla, I can lay it in 
                        his lap.

           INT./EXT. FBI VAN - SAME

           FBI agents focus their cameras and listen to the tape.  

                                 CULLEN
                             (through speaker)
                        Like hell!

           INT./EXT. CULLEN’S CADILLAC - SAME

           Cullen turns the a.c. on higher.  

                                 CULLEN
                        She’s always got people around her. 
                        The judge doesn’t.  I’ve checked it 
                        out.  If the judge is too hard...go 
                        back to the original plan, Beverly 
                        Bass.  Have him kill her and 
                        Gravel, cut them up, and make it 
                        look like a drug hit.

                                 DAVID
                        What about paying him?  The guy 
                        wants his money up front.

                                 CULLEN
                        Get him to do a hit first...then I 
                        pay him.  

           David’s eyes grow wide.

                                 DAVID
                        If that motherfucker goes to work 
                        tonight...or tomorrow...and I don’t 
                        have the money...he’ll kill me 
                        next.  He will.  Don’t leave me 
                        hanging.

                                 CULLEN
                        I won’t.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME

           David comes into the hotel room - SIX FBI AGENTS wait for 
           him.  David is drenched in sweat.  He takes his shirt off.  
           The FBI men recoil from his body odor.
                                 DAVID
                        Good, huh?

           THE FBI AGENT takes the recorder off him. It’s dripping with 
           sweat.

           David’s hands tremble.

                                 FBI AGENT 
                        Tell him you got the hitman down to 
                        $25k.  Got it?  And get him to say 
                        he wants people dead.  On tape.  He 
                        has to say “I want them dead” or we 
                        don’t have a case.  

                                 DAVID
                        He’s gonna find out...I know it.  
                        He’s gonna find out and kill me and 
                        my family.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Quit whining, sport.  Remember; you 
                        came to us.  If you didn’t want to 
                        do this, you shoulda kept your 
                        mouth shut and let your boss kill 
                        fifteen people and then you woulda 
                        gone to jail as an accessory.  You 
                        think you made the right choice?

           INT./EXT. CULLEN’S CADILLAC - NIGHT

           Cullen drives at high speeds, the a.c. blowing so cold his 
           windows have fogged.  Cullen slows as he drives by the 
           mansion.  No lights are on.  He stares at it.  

                                 CULLEN
                             (to himself)
                        One, two, three.  Four, five.  Five 
                        first, then another six.  That 
                        makes eleven.  Eleven.  Twelve, 
                        thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. 

           He drives away.  

           INT. BEDROOM - DAVIS MANSION - NIGHT

           Priscilla sits alone in bed, high as a kite on painkillers, 
           watching old movies on TV.  The a.c. whispers.  She sits up, 
           feels something outside.  A worried expression crosses her 
           face.  She fishes out five Percodan from the bottle, dry 
           swallows them. 
           INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

           FIVE FBI AGENTS stand around the opened trunk of a Ford LTD.  
           JUDGE JOE EIDSON, 54, climbs in the trunk.  An FBI agent 
           smoking a cigarette burns holes in a T-shirt, then he hands 
           it to Eidson, who puts it on.  He climbs in.

           ANOTHER AGENT dabs ketchup on Eidson’s T-shirt.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Raise your arm a little.  Yeah.

           The FBI Agent flashes pictures of Eidson. 

                                 FBI AGENT
                        You okay, judge?

                                 JOE EIDSON
                        Okay enough.  Let’s get this over.  

           They snap more pictures.  

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Just a few more.  

           The Agent snaps several other pictures from different angles.   
           TWO AGENTS help the judge out of the trunk.  He shivers.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Thank you, Your Honor.

                                 JOE EIDSON
                        I did not like doing that...for 
                        obvious reasons.  

                                 FBI AGENT
                        We’ll get him.  

                                 JOE EIDSON
                        I’m not worried about you guys.  
                        I’m sure you’ll arrest him. It’s 
                        the trial that comes after that 
                        concerns me.  

           INT./EXT. CULLEN’S CADILLAC - NIGHT

           The digital clock on the dash reads 2:10 AM.  Cullen speeds 
           over the empty Texas plains.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAVID MCCRORY HOME - MORNING

           David McCrory slumps over the toilet, vomiting.  His face is 
           puffy, his eyes almost swollen shut.  He wipes his mouth, 
           sprays shaving foam on his hand, lathers up, and shaves.  
           He nicks himself.  He stares at the dripping blood, then 
           punches the mirror, shattering it.

           He pulls down the shower curtain. He kicks over the trash 
           can. He takes the lid off the toilet tank and smashes it on 
           the ground.  He empties every bottle of shampoo in the 
           bathtub.  

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

           FBI Men tape the recorder to David’s huge torso.  David 
           reaches for a morning bottle of beer, chugging it down.

           On a desk near David are the black and white photographs of 
           Judge Eidson face down in the trunk of the car, ketchup 
           smeared on his T-shirt.  

                                 FBI AGENT
                        You feel up to this?

                                 DAVID
                        As long as that gun isn’t loaded.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Um...let’s see.  Did I remember to 
                        take the bullets out or not?  
                        Sometimes, I forget in all the 
                        confusion. 

           The other agents laugh.  David doesn’t share their humor.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        It’s from “Dirty Harry”.  

                                 DAVID
                        What’s “Dirty Harry”?

           EXT. PARKING LOT - COCO’S FAMOUS HAMBURGERS - DAY

           SUPER: AUGUST 20, 1978  9:05 AM

           Cullen pulls into the lot with his Cadillac.  He steps out, 
           and then looks across the lot to a parked van with blacked 
           out windows.  He walks over to it.  He taps on the windows - 
           tries to peer in.

           INT. FBI VAN - SAME

           FBI MEN lay flat on the floor, their hands on their weapons.  
           EXT. PARKING LOT - COCO’S FAMOUS HAMBURGERS - SAME

           Cullen kicks the van.  He turns, then strolls over to David’s 
           car.  David McCrory sweats.  He opens his trunk.  

                                 DAVID
                        Got that silencer for you.

           He shows Cullen the .22 Ruger, this time with a silencer 
           attached.  

                                 CULLEN
                        Beautiful.  

                                 DAVID
                        Got something here...

           He hands Cullen the photos of Judge Eidson in the trunk.  
           Cullen peruses them. Cullen hands the photos back to McCrory, 
           who won’t take them.  

                                 CULLEN
                        Damn...you keep it.

           McCory still won’t take them.

                                 DAVID
                        Who you wanna do next?

           Cullen keeps trying to thrust the photos into David’s sweaty 
           hand.  Finally, David takes them.

                                 CULLEN
                        What’re you gonna do with those?

                                 DAVID
                        Get rid of the motherfuckers.  

           Cullen reaches in his jacket pocket and takes out a thick 
           envelope.

                                 CULLEN
                        Here.

                                 DAVID
                        Who do you want to do next?

                                 CULLEN
                        The three kids.  You know, the ones 
                        we talked about.

                                 DAVID
                        Who?

                                 CULLEN
                        You know! 
                                 DAVID
                        You mean Beverly Bass, Bubba, and 
                        Christy?

                                 CULLEN
                        Yeah, yeah...

           David hands the .22 to Cullen, who takes it.  

                                 CULLEN
                        Look at that motherfucker.  

           Cullen walks to his car, stuffs the gun in his coat pocket.  

           INT. FBI VAN - SAME

           The FBI Men shake their heads.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Come on, David...get him to say it.  
                        Not enough...

           EXT. PARKING LOT - COCO’S FAMOUS HAMBURGERS - SAME

           David seems to read the FBI men’s thoughts.  He follows 
           Cullen.

                                 DAVID
                        Hey...

           Cullen stops.

                                 DAVID
                        You want Beverly Bass dead, right?

           Cullen’s face darkens. 

                                 CULLEN
                        All right.

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t want to make a mistake 
                        here...you’re sure?

                                 CULLEN
                        Yeah.

           Cullen doesn’t know what to make of McCrory.  

                                 DAVID
                        You want a lot of people dead, 
                        right?

           Cullen clenches his teeth.
                                 CULLEN
                        All right.

                                 DAVID
                        Am I right?

                                 CULLEN
                        All right.

           Cullen gets into his Cadillac and drives away.  

           INT. FBI VAN - SAME

           The FBI men look to each other.  

                                 FBI AGENT
                             (into radio)
                        Take him.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN - DAY

           Cullen parks his Cadillac, then strolls over to a telephone 
           booth in front of a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise.  

           UNMARKED POLICE CARS and FBI cars screech into the parking 
           lot. 

           PLAINSCLOTHES POLICE wearing bulletproof vests and FBI agents 
           leap out of the cars and rush the telephone booth the second 
           Cullen steps out.  He holds up his hands trying to shield his 
           face. 

           Joe Shannon, also wearing a vest, nods to Cullen.

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        Remember me?

           TWO AGENTS throw Cullen against a car and frisk him.  They 
           pull out his wallet, and bag the .22 Ruger.

           Joe opens Cullen’s wallet. 

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        We got ourselves...one thousand, 
                        one hundred and twenty two dollars 
                        in bills...fifteen cents in 
                        change...and this...

           Joe holds up a picture of a small boy, who stands naked.  He 
           sports an improbably huge penis.  
           EXT. BEAR LAKE - HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS - DAY

           A hot, August day on Bear Lake.  A large yacht trolls lazily 
           along the water.  

           EXT. DECK YACHT - DAY

           Haynes, a drink in hand, stands at the helm of his yacht, 
           entertaining GUESTS, four COUPLES who enjoy the hot, August 
           sun as they sip their fruity cocktails.   

                                 HAYNES
                        The only thing that ever really 
                        worries me is that someday I might 
                        defend someone who is really 
                        guilty, get ‘em turned loose, and 
                        then they get out and hurt someone.  
                        Then again, that’ll never happen 
                        because I’ve never defended a 
                        guilty man...at least, not 
                        knowingly.

           The Guests laugh, soaking in the charm of their charismatic 
           host.  Below, the radio crackles.  RICHARD’S WIFE, BETH, 
           calls up from below.

                                 BETH HAYNES
                        Richard?  Someone wants to talk 
                        with you on the radio.

                                 HAYNES
                        Bob...come over here and take the 
                        helm.  Just keep her true north.  
                        And if any other boats come too 
                        close, just honk this horn here 
                        until they get out of your way.  

           INT. RADIO ROOM - HAYNES’S YACHT - SAME

           Beth, 45 and classy, gives Haynes an alarmed expression.  He 
           reads her, then takes the microphone.

                                 HAYNES
                        This is Haynes.

                                 SHIP TO SHORE RADIO
                        Yes...I have an urgent message for 
                        you from a Mr. Phil Burleson 
                        ...Cullen Davis was arrested this 
                        morning in Fort Worth on murder 
                        solicitation charges.  Mr. Burleson 
                        is asking you come to Fort Worth as 
                        soon as possible.  
           Haynes looks at the radio a long time, thinking.  He glances 
           to Beth, worried.  She looks worried, too.

           EXT. DECK YACHT - SAME

           Haynes emerges from the cockpit. All of his guests look to 
           him - they overheard.

                                 GUEST #1
                        Damn...what’s it mean?

           Haynes looks over his boat, and finally grins.

                                 HAYNES
                        A much bigger boat.  

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - TARRANT COUNTY DA’S OFFICE - DAY

           Haynes, Burleson, and THREE OTHER DEFENSE ATTORNEYS sit at 
           attention - before them, a big television set plays them 
           black and white video footage of Cullen Davis making plans 
           for murder with David McCrory in Coco’s Parking Lot.  

           Joe Shannon and JACK STRICKLAND, 32, a new prosecutor, lean 
           and curly headed, grin at them.  Payback.

           Haynes and Burleson exchange glum looks.  

           INT./EXT. RENTAL CAR - SAME

           Burleson drives while Haynes sits beside him. The other 
           attorneys sit in the backseat.  They don’t say a word - 
           until:

                                 HAYNES
                        Oh, come on.  Don’t be so 
                        depressed.  All they got up there 
                        is a bunch of evidence.  

           They guffaw.  

           EXT. AMERICANA HOTEL - SAME

           Haynes and the others get out of their car with briefcases in 
           hand.

                        Cullen got his star defense team 
                        together again...this time costing 
                        him a hell of a lot more than it 
                        did before.

           Haynes stands before Judge Tom Cave again.

                        They got a change of venue, this 
                        time to Racehorse Haynes’s 
                        backyard...Houston, Texas.  They 
                        stacked the deck. Again. 

           INT. COURTROOM - HARRIS COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           SUPER: HOUSTON, TEXAS

           JUDGE PETE MOORE, 59, a World War Two Marine fighter pilot 
           whose face is creased with stern lines, looks to Haynes with 
           hooded eyes.  

                                 JUDGE MOORE
                        This ain’t Amarillo, pardner.  

                                 HAYNES
                        Yes, sir.

                                 JUDGE MOORE
                        Consider yourself put on notice.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           David McCrory on the witness stand.  

                                 DAVID
                        He told me he wanted fifteen people 
                        dead...

                                 HAYNES
                        Objection...not responsive.

                                 JUDGE MOORE
                        Overruled.  Sit down, Mr. Haynes.  
                        Continue, Mr. McCrory.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay...he wanted to have Beverly 
                        Bass and Bubba Gravel killed and 
                        cut to pieces so’s it looked like a 
                        drug murder.  

                                 JOE SHANNON
                        Those were his words?

                                 DAVID
                        More or less.
           David looks to Cullen and tries to smile - one of those 
           “sorry” grins.  Cullen glares right through him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Haynes stands.

                                 HAYNES
                        Objection...assum...

                                 JUDGE MOORE
                        Overruled.  Go ahead, Mr. McCrory.

           Davis watches with tight lipped anger.  Haynes loathes the 
           sight of David McCrory and has a hard time hiding it.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           David keeps talking - 

                                 DAVID
                        He told me he’d kill my entire

                        Your Honor, you don’t know the 
                        reason for my objection.

           Haynes takes a seat, red faced and angry.

                        I know what you’re trying to pull 
                        here, Mr. Haynes.  I don’t like it.  
                        There was nothing wrong with Mr. 
                        McCoryr’s answer.  Go ahead, Mr.

                        I was contacted by the FBI in the 
                        summer of 1978...by an Agent 
                        Manning...who told me that my life 
                        was in danger.

                                 HAYNES

                        Priscilla was going to have me 
                        killed.  He told me that I was to 
                        be contacted by someone close to 
                        me...David McCrory, who was in

                        They were allies.  Margie McCrory, 
                        David’s wife, was very close to 
                        Priscilla.

                        Priscilla was trying to set me up 
                        in a murder for hire scheme...to 
                        try and make me look guilty.

                                 CULLEN
                        He told me that I was to go along

                        said.

                                 FOREMAN
                        Don’t you get it?  A rich man like 
                        that would never stoop to murdering 
                        a judge!  

                                 JUROR #1
                        Didn’t you hear those tapes?

                                 JUROR #2
                        Those tapes...I couldn’t make head 
                        or tail of ‘em.  Could you?

                                 FOREMAN
                        Nope.   
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LAW OFFICES OF RICHARD HAYNES - DAY

           Haynes and Burleson examine papers. 

                                 HAYNES
                        I already got the appeal drawn up.  
                        Just in case.

                                 BURLESON
                        Just in case?  If I were you I’d 
                        take it when they announce a 
                        verdict.  

           A CLERK pokes his head in the room.

                                 CLERK
                        Jury’s in.

                                 HAYNES
                        Here we go.

                                 BURLESON
                        Put that in your briefcase.

                                 HAYNES
                        Where’s your optimism?

           Haynes slips the appeal in his briefcase.  

           INT. COURTROOM - HARRIS COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Judge Moore takes his place at the bench.  

                                 JUDGE MOORE
                        Does the jury have a verdict?

           The Foreman stands.

                                 FOREMAN
                        Your honor...we are unable to reach 
                        a verdict.  

           Judge Moore shakes his head, then glares at Haynes.  

                                 JUDGE MOORE
                        I have no choice but to judge this 
                        a mistrial.  

           The courtroom erupts in cheers.  Cullen and Haynes grin to 
           each other.  Cullen looks like the cat that swallowed the 
           canary.  
           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAVIS MANSION - DAY

           Priscilla and Christy watch the verdict being announced on 
           television.  They’re both stunned.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        We’d better pack up, Christy. Time 
                        to get outta this place for good.

           Priscilla and Christy both cry and hug.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (V.O.)
                        So they had another trial...this 
                        time in Fort Worth.  No mistrial 
                        this time, because the good people 
                        of Tarrant County got exactly what 
                        they deserved.

           INT. COURTROOM - TARRANT COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           SUPER: NOVEMBER 9, 1979

           Cullen Davis beams as the courtroom audience claps and 
           cheers.  A GROUP OF WOMEN clutching Bibles start a chant:

                                 WOMEN’S CHANT
                        Final justice!  Final justice!  
                        Final justice!  

                                                                CUT TO:

           A Fort Worth juror, a heavy set man with a cigar, nods to a 
           TV CAMERA and Reporter who thrusts a huge microphone in his 
           face.  

                                 FORT WORTH JUROR
                        We voted to acquit Mr. Davis on the 
                        basis that we thought...why would a 
                        good, Christian man like that do 
                        something that low down?  He’s 
                        above that kind of behavior.  

           EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - DAY

           Cullen and Karen walk out, beaming and waving.  TV cameras 
           crowd around him.  People applaud him.  The chanting 
           continues - 

                                 CHANTING
                        Final justice!  Final justice!

           Haynes and Burleson step out and hug Cullen.  They beam to 
           the cameras.

                             (V.O.)
                        Suddenly, Cullen Davis walked on 
                        water.  He was a pundit, a man who 
                        people went to for answers.  God 
                        knows why; the man couldn’t even 
                        fuck well, let alone have great 
                        insight into world events. I never 
                        even saw him read, except to check 
                        up on sports scores.

           INT. TV STUDIO - DALLAS - NIGHT

           SUPER: THE CHARLIE ROSE SHOW - DECEMBER, 1979

           Charlie Rose, brows furrowed, looks to Cullen, who reclines 
           in a swivel chair.  

                                 CHARLIE ROSE
                        Could you give us your opinion on 
                        the war in Afghanistan, the Iranian 
                        Revolution, and do you think this 
                        is the reason for the sudden spike 
                        in gold prices?

                                 CULLEN
                        Well, those are three different 
                        things.  

                                 CHARLIE ROSE
                        Yes...yes they are.  

                                 CULLEN
                        I see no correlation between the 
                        three.

           Charlie Rose leans in.

                                 CHARLIE ROSE
                        Tell me, Cullen...what is it 
                        important to you?  What does Cullen 
                        Davis care about?

                                 CULLEN
                        Well, that’s a very broad question.  

                                 CHARLIE ROSE
                        Are you afraid of living in the 
                        mansion again?

                                 CULLEN
                        Whoever did it wasn’t after me.  I 
                        have no reason to fear for my life.

                                 CHARLIE ROSE
                        Do you have any idea of who it was?
           Cullen smiles.

                                 CULLEN
                        Yes.

                                 CHARLIE ROSE
                        Do you think you know?

                                 CULLEN
                        Yes, I do.

           Rose looks to the audience.

                                 CHARLIE ROSE
                        Who was it?

                                 CULLEN
                        I can’t reveal that on public 
                        television!  

           Laughter.

                        After that, he said he was givin’ 
                        his life to Jesus.  He got the 
                        mansion back and said he was havin’ 
                        all of our modern art destroyed 
                        because it was possessed by demons.

           EXT. FRONT YARD OF DAVIS MANSION - DAY

           Cullen and Karen stand with a pile of the modern art 
           sculptures that once adorned the inside of the mansion.

           A BLOW DRIED TELEVANGALIST, JAMES ROBSON, 48, grins beside 
           them.  They all go to work on the art pieces with hammers, 
           smashing them to pieces for assembled TELEVISION CREWS.  They 
           destroy ancient Indian, African, and Middle Eastern masks and 
           carvings.

                        They threw it all in Lake Worth but 
                        later some divers went down and 
                        they revealed that what he broke 
                        was phoney.  

           EXT. UNDERWATER - LAKE WORTH - DAY

           Scuba divers hold up cheap, plastic replicas of modern and 
           native art.  
           INT. EVANGELICAL TABERNACLE - NIGHT

           Cullen stands before a mega-church packed with worshippers.  
           He holds the microphone, shaking with the spirit of the Lord.  

                                 CULLEN
                        I had demons in me.  I did!  But 
                        the Lord got ‘em out of me. Yes, 
                        sir, he did!  Praise Jesus. 

           The congregation cheers him on.  

                                 CULLEN
                        I can sniff out a demon when I feel 
                        one near me.  Yes, sir, I can.  
                        Praise God for the many gifts he 
                        bestows on us.  Praise God.  Now 
                        who’s got a demon in them...’cause 
                        if you do, come up here, and I’ll 
                        cast it out.  I will! With the 
                        merciful help of Jesus, I will!  

           A line of people queue up before him. He holds his hands out, 
           then casts out the demons, real or imaginary, that vex the 
           congregates.  They hand over money to an USHER before 
           approaching Cullen.  

           An OLD, STOOPED MAN comes up to Cullen - it’s Jack Wilborne, 
           looking very old and frail.  Cullen takes him in an embrace.

                                 CULLEN
                        I’m sorry, brother.  I’m so sorry.  

           Wilborne fixes him with a steely, blue eyed glare. Cullen 
           tries to embrace Wilborne, but he side-steps him.  

           EXT. MID-CONTINENTAL BUILDING - DAY

           Movers truck out stacks of paperwork and filing cabinets to 
           waiting repossession trucks.  

           Ken and Cullen look on.

                             (V.O.)
                        By 1986, Cullen had totally ruined 
                        Kendavis Enterprises. All of the 
                        world’s oil didn’t dry up in 1990, 
                        as he predicted.  He’d divested the 
                        company’s billions and invested in 
                        poor investments that fell apart.  
                        Every one of them.  Kendavis 
                        declared bankruptcy in 1987, and 
                        the company Cullen’s daddy built 
                        for him vanished overnight.
           EXT. DAVIS MANSION - NIGHT

           Lines of cars are in the drive.  A VALET runs to each car.

                             (V.O.)
                        The mansion was sold and became a 
                        restaurant. Like most restaurants, 
                        it was popular for a while and then 
                        went outta business. It was sold 
                        and now it’s a high priced banquet 
                        hall that rents out for special 
                        occasions.  

           INT. DAVIS MANSION - DAY

           The interior is unrecognizable.  HUGE WOMEN line up at a 
           buffet table, ladling enormous amounts of starchy food onto 
           sagging paper plates.  On the wall is a primitive banner that 
           reads:  FORT WORTH LY0NS CLUB.

           A SMALL MAN stands at the dais, reading off statistics; 

                                 LYONS CLUB MAN
                        So far, we’ve donated twenty sets 
                        of football pads to local high 
                        schools and over one hundred cheer 
                        leader pom-poms...all different 
                        colors.

           INT. HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Cullen stands alone before a mostly empty room.  Only two 
           extremely OBESE WOMEN sit, waiting. He holds a Bible.

                        Finally, people stopped payin’ 
                        Cullen to cast out their demons.  

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

           Cullen steps out from the underpopulated conference room.  He 
           pours himself a cup of complimentary coffee in the lobby.

           Priscilla, heavier and older than when we saw her last, sits 
           across the lobby from him, glaring his direction.  Cullen 
           spots her, pretends that he didn’t, then walks over to her.

           Pricilla instinctively draws in on herself.  Cullen looms 
           over Priscilla.

                                 CULLEN
                        Hello, Priscilla.
           She burns daggers at him with her eyes.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Cullen.

                                 CULLEN
                        What’re you doin’ here?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        I’m speaking before a support group 
                        of grieving parents who’ve lost 
                        children to violent crime.

                                 CULLEN
                        What?  In there?

           He glances over to the nearby conference room across the pink 
           lobby - unlike his, this one is packed with people.  

                                 CULLEN
                        You doin’ okay?

                                 PRISCILLA
                        No.  You?

                                 CULLEN
                        Not really.  

           A long, icy silence passes between them.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Good.

           Priscilla studies him, sizing up the shrunken figure before 
           her.

                                 CULLEN
                        Glad to see you haven’t changed.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Have you?

           Cullen doesn’t miss a beat;

                                 CULLEN
                        I believe I have.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        You think so?  You look like the 
                        same, old Cullen to me.  

                                 CULLEN
                        No...I live at the foot of the 
                        cross now.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Really?
                                 CULLEN
                        Yes, ma’am.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Willin’ to prove it?

           Cullen nods; “bring it on”. 

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Jack tells me you apologized to him 
                        durin’ one of your “holy” 
                        services...

                                 CULLEN
                        Hold on, now...

                                 PRISCILLA
                        ...and I’d like you to apologize to 
                        me.  Right here, right now.  

                                 CULLEN
                        Just so we’re clear...I apologized 
                        to Jack for stealing his wife. 

           Cullen’s eyes blink behind his enormous eyeglasses.

           Priscilla points to a large picture of Andrea Wilborne on an 
           easel that’s propped just outside of the crowded conference 
           room.  Below her smiling face it says - Andrea Wilborne: 1964 
           - 1976.  Child-like drawings of animals surround her 
           portrait.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Today’s her birthday...you 
                        know...or maybe you forgot.  She 
                        would have been twenty-five.

           Cullen can’t bring himself to look at the picture. He burns a 
           stare at the floor, ashamed.  

                                 CULLEN
                             (whispering)
                        Sometimes I wish I could...go back 
                        and...

           Priscilla stands and leans toward him, trying to hear his 
           voice.

                                 CULLEN
                        ...do things differently. (pause) 
                        I’m not a monster.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Yes, you are.

           Cullen considers her statement, slowly nods.  
                                 CULLEN
                        Maybe I am.

                                 PRISCILLA
                        Shouldn’t you go back in there and 
                        cast out some demons? They’re 
                        waiting.

           He slowly walks back to the old ladies searching for 
           salvation. 

           AN OLDER MAN, REVEREND W.C. TAYLOR, pokes his head out of 
           Priscilla’s crowded conference room.

                                 W.C. TAYLOR
                        Mrs. Davis?  We’re ready for you.  

           Priscilla flashes a million dollar smile and glides into the 
           room, majestically, despite the tragic reason for her being 
           there.  She receives a thunderous ovation.

           INT. SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           Karen Masters scribbles math problems on a chalkboard.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (V.O.)
                        Karen had to go back to work, 
                        teachin’ school. And Cullen?  He 
                        ended up in Dallas peddling hand 
                        cream and living off his infamy.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - HOME IN DALLAS - NIGHT

           A cocktail party populated with older people in a middle 
           class home.  Cullen, looking very old and with weary eyes 
           that have seen too much, sits down next to TWO OLD LADIES. He 
           holds up a tube of hand cream. 

                                 CULLEN
                        This one is really good for 
                        covering up those liver spots.  

           He smiles, pathetic.  His teeth are yellow and jagged.  

                                 OLD LADY #1
                        I’ll take two. 

           A TALL MAN approaches Cullen.  He holds his hand out.

                                 TALL MAN
                        Cullen Davis?

                                 CULLEN
                        Yes, sir?
                                 TALL MAN
                        My name is Joe Groves.  Pleased to 
                        meet you.

                                 CULLEN
                        Where you from, Joe?

                                 JOE GROVES
                        Fort Worth.

                                 CULLEN
                        I can’t say Fort Worth was very 
                        good to me.  

           EXT. UPSCALE HOME - COLLEYVILLE, TEXAS - DAY

           SUPER: 7 MAY, 2008

           Establish an upscale, Tudor home in a quiet, bedroom 
           community.  Dark clouds gather above it.

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (V.O.)
                        As much as he wanted to blame his 
                        problems on Fort Worth, wherever 
                        Cullen went, bad fortune followed.

           A lightning bolt streaks out of the sky and strikes the 
           house, setting it on fire.

           A 77-year-old Cullen hobbles outside, holding up a fire 
           extinguisher.  He pulls the trigger - it fails to operate. He 
           throws it down in disgust.   

           INT. SMALL FORT WORTH APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Christy, broader at the beam and with lighter hair, watches 
           her mother balance twin grand-daughters on her lap, smiling, 
           happier than we’ve ever seen her.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (V.O.)
                        My daughter Christy didn’t let me 
                        down...and for the first time in my 
                        life, I felt genuine happiness with 
                        those two little babies.  I guess 
                        it was the years or maybe the bumpy 
                        road I chose...but I’d like to 
                        think I learned a thing or two 
                        about myself.
           INT. GAY BAR - NIGHT

           Priscilla dances with a group of GAY MEN, all of them wearing 
           the costumes of the Village People.  The Indian Chief 
           simulates sex with her, and she loves it, swinging around a 
           long, feather boa.

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (V.O.)
                        My only regret in life is that 
                        Cullen never had to pay for killin’ 
                        my daughter.  That gets to me.  But 
                        I just hope that when I breathe my 
                        last there’s something else out 
                        there, something beyond all this, 
                        ‘cause I’d like to see Andrea one 
                        more time.  If I could, I’d never 
                        stop hugging her and telling her 
                        how much I love her.

           Priscilla dances, raising her arms to the sky, a rapturous 
           smile on her face.  

                                 PRISCILLA
                             (V.O.)
                        I’m kinda like the Statue of 
                        Liberty...lotta people want to say 
                        they’ve been there, but no one 
                        wants to pay for the upkeep.

           WINSTON CHURCHILL

           EXT. BANKS OF TRINITY RIVER - FORT WORTH - EVENING

           The sun is going down.  The area where the mansion is to be 
           constructed is marked off with wooden posts and small, red 
           flags.

           Priscilla watches the sunset.  Cullen wraps an arm around her 
           shoulders.  

                                 CULLEN
                        We’re gonna have a great life.
