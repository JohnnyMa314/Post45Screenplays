           INT.  BERGER  BROS  BURGERS  -  DAY

           NOAH  MILLER  (35),  a  warm,  likable,  handsome  white  guy, 
           sits  at  a  table  with  a  BURGER  in  front  of  him.  He  talks 
           into  a  television  camera.   

                                 NOAH
                        From  the  looks  of  this  bacon 
                        cheeseburger,  Arik  and  Yoni  Berger 
                        don’t  keep  kosher,  but  I’m  not 
                        complaining. 

           Two  yamulke-toting,  bearded  guys,  ARIK  and  YONI,  stand 
           behind  Noah  and  give  a  thumbs  up  to  the  camera.

           Noah  lifts  the  succulent  burger  to  his  mouth  and  sinks 
           his  teeth  into  it.  Burger  juice  trickles  down  his  face  as 
           he  chews.

                        When  it  comes  to  burger  research, 
                        these  guys  have  really  done  their 
                        “jew”  diligence.

           Noah  looks  to  his  female  producer,  DEB,  standing  behind 
           the  camera.  She  shakes  her  head.

                        Let’s  try  that  again.

           Noah  looks  back  into  the  camera.  He  then  points  to  Yoni’s 
           necklace. 

                                 NOAH  (CONT’D)
                        This  burger  gets  “chai”  marks  from 
                        me.

           The  camera  man  and  the  sound  guy  CHUCKLE.  Deb  shakes  her 
           head  again.

                        Too  insider?  Ok.  Ok.  For  real  this 
                        time....  That’s  one  delicious 
                        burger.  For  News  Channel  4  and  New 
                        York  Magazine,  I’m  The  Urban  Chow-

                        time.

                                 DEB
                        That’s  a  wrap.  Thanks  everyone.

           Noah  walks  off  camera  towards  Deb. 

                                 NOAH
                        A  little  piece  of  me  dies  every 
                        time  I  say  ‘Urban  Chow-boy.’

                        shouldn’t  complain  considering  you 
                        eat  food  for  a  living.

                        Don’t  forget  my  adoring  fans.

           Deb  playfully  hits  Noah.

                                 DEB
                        Get  out  of  here.  Don’t  you  have  a 
                        party  to  prep  for? 

                                 NOAH
                                 (to  the  room)
                        That’s  right.  I  expect  to  see  all 
                        of  you  at  my  place  tonight.  Seven 
                        o’clock  sharp.

           Noah  ad-libs  good  byes  and  members  of  the  crew  pat  him  on 
           the  back  as  he  walks  out  of  the  restaurant.

           KEITH  OLBERMANN  sits  behind  his  desk  and  delivers  his 
           “Special  Comment”  into  the  camera.

                                 KEITH
                        Typically  I  reserve  this  forum  for 
                        unleashing  my  outrage  at 
                        proprietors  of  injustice, 
                        immorality,  hypocrisy,  and  all 
                        things  wrong.  But  on  this  day  I 
                        have  no  venom  to  spit,  only  hope 
                        and  love  to  embrace.  And  if  that 
                        seems  overly  schmaltzy  to  you,

                        dedicated  viewers,  then  clearly 
                        you  don’t  understand  the  magnitude 
                        of  what  we  are  witnessing.  How 
                        fitting  that  today,  nearly  70 
                        years  to  the  day  after  the  birth 
                        of  Dr.  Martin  Luther  King  Jr.,  a 
                        black  man  has  been  sworn  into 
                        office  as  the  president  of  the 
                        United  States.  Perhaps  the 
                        greatest  realization  yet  of  Dr. 
                        King’s  dream  is  the  man  who  in  a 
                        couple  of  minutes  will  take  the 
                        stage  behind  me.  President  Barack 
                        Obama  is  post-racial  America.  Yes, 
                        Mississippi,  post-racial.

           INT.  NOAH’S  APARTMENT,  LIVING  ROOM  -  SAME

           We  pull  out  to  see  that  Keith  Olbermann  is  being  watched 
           on  a  large  wall-mounted  plasma  TV.

           Noah’s  inauguration  party.  Well-dressed  yuppies  mill 
           about  the  party,  drinking  and  enjoying  the  festivities  in 
           Noah’s  beautiful  apartment.  

           Noah  sits  on  a  couch  in  front  of  the  TV.  His  8  month-old 
           son  JASON  sits  in  his  lap.  He  puts  his  arm  around  his 
           other  son,  4  year-old  MICAH.

                                 NOAH
                        People  are  gonna  ask  you  boys 
                        where  you  were  on  this  day  for  the 
                        rest  of  your  life. 

                                 MICAH
                        But  I’m  right  here,  Daddy!

           Noah  kisses  Micah  on  the  top  of  his  head  then  leans  down 
           to  Jason. 

                                 NOAH
                        Can  you  say  ‘Obama?’  O-ba-ma?

           An  attractive,  well-dressed  woman  leans  over  the  couch. 
           This  is  LIZ  MILLER,  Noah’s  wife. 

                                 LIZ
                        Honey,  he  tried  to  eat  your  iPod 
                        today.  I  think  you’re  reaching  a 
                        bit. 

           Liz  playfully  taps  Jason’s  nose  and  joins  her  family  on 
           the  couch. 

                                 NOAH
                        Do  you  think  we  should  have  done 
                        dim  sum  instead  of  tapas?

                        Noah,  you  always  think  everything 
                        could  be  better.  The  grass  is 
                        perfectly  green  right  here.  Now 
                        shut  up.

           On  the  TV,  President  Obama  takes  the  podium  and  begins 
           SPEAKING.  The  room  quiets  down. 

           NOAH’S  APARTMENT,  LIVING  ROOM  -  HOURS  LATER

           Noah  stands  at  his  stereo,  scrolling  through  songs  on  his 
           heavily  chewed-up  iPod.  He  finds  a  winner,  smiles  and 
           hits  play. 

           The  Notorious  B.I.G.’s  ‘MO  MONEY  MO  PROBLEMS’  pumps  out 
           of  the  speakers  and  the  merry  crowd  begins  bopping  along. 

           PETE  PAPANICALOU,  Noah’s  best-friend,  runs  over.  Pete  is 
           loud  and  abrasive  but  lovable.  He  gives  NOAH  a  bear  hug. 

                                 PETE
                        How  awesome  is  this?

                        It’s  fucking  incredible.  I

           Noah  searches  for  it.

                        I  just  wanna  hug  a  black  person, 
                        y’know?

           Noah  and  Pete  survey  the  crowd  at  the  party.  Every  single 
           person  there  is  white.  They  look  at  each  other.  Pete 
           opens  his  arms.

                                 PETE

                        Or  I  guess  we  could  go  hug  your 
                        door  man.

                        Somebody  should  tell  him  that, 
                        cause  he  sure  talks  like  he’s 
                        black.

                        What  does  that  even  mean,  to  talk 
                        like  you’re  black?

           Pete  flashes  Noah  a  look  as  if  to  say,  ‘give  me  a  break.’

           A  buzzed  Liz  approaches  and  starts  to  dance  with  the  two 
           of  them  as  the  celebratory  night  continues. 

           INT.  THE  COMEDY  CELLAR  -  NIGHT  --  WEEK  LATER

           Noah  and  Liz  sit  at  a  table  in  a  crowded  comedy  club  with 
           Pete  and  his  ditzy  blonde  date  NICOLE. 

           CHRIS  ROCK  stands  on  stage  doing  his  act.

                                 PETE
                        Wow!  How’d  you  know  he  was  going

           Nicole  LAUGHS  at  one  of  Rock’s  jokes.

                                 NICOLE
                        This  is  so  beyond.  I’ve  loved  him 
                        ever  since  his  TV  show.

           Nicole  turns  towards  the  stage  and  does  the  Arsenio  Hall 
           arm  pump  and  HOOT.  Noah  and  Liz  look  at  Pete  who  shrugs 
           sheepishly.

           On  stage,  Rock  continues  his  act.

                                 ROCK
                        ...and  I  love  all  these  cracka-ass-

                        they  voted  for  Obama  they’re 
                        automatically  not  racist.  You  guys 
                        know  who  you  are.  Same 
                        motherfuckers  who  think  they’re 
                        down  with  the  black  community  just 
                        cuz  they  watched  a  season  of  ‘THE 
                        WIRE’  or  own  one  Biggie  album.

           Liz,  Pete,  and  Nicole  LAUGH  heartily.  But  to  Noah,  this 
           isn’t  funny.

           INT.  14TH  STREET  Y,  BASKETBALL  COURT  -  DAY  --  WEEK  LATER

           Ten  30-somethings  play  an  intense  game  of  hoops.  Noah  and 
           Pete  are  on  opposing  teams.  Noah  gets  the  ball,  drives 
           hard  to  the  hole,  and  hits  a  reverse  lay-up. 

           Pete  dribbles  down  the  court  and  heaves  a  three-pointer 
           that  gets  stuck  in  between  the  rim  and  the  backboard. 
           Everybody  GROANS.

                        Nice  shot,  Ehlo.

           A  circle  of  players  gather  underneath  the  hoop.  They  take 
           turns  jumping  up  to  try  to  dislodge  the  ball.  Nobody  can 
           jump  high  enough.

           Noah  shakes  his  head  in  disbelief.  He  turns  to  Pete.

                                 PETE
                        Nope.

           Noah  thinks  about  it.

                                 NOAH
                        Have  we  ever  had  a  black  guy  play 
                        in  this  game?

                                 PETE
                        Yeah.  Of  course.  Roger  brought 
                        that  guy  Harold  once.

                                 NOAH
                        When?

                                 PETE
                        ‘97,  I  think.

                                 NOAH
                        So  that’s  it?  In  15  years  of 
                        playing  in  this  game  we  can  only 
                        remember  one  black  guy?

                                 PETE
                        Well  I  remembered  one.  You  can’t 
                        remember  any.

                                 NOAH
                        Does  that  strike  you  as  odd?

                                 PETE
                        We  don’t  have  many  black  friends.

                                 NOAH
                        Many  or  any?

                                 PETE
                        Neither,  I  guess.

           A  SHORT  BLACK  JANITOR  with  heavy  work  boots  and  about  30 
           keys  hanging  from  his  belt  sets  down  a  broom  and  walks 
           underneath  the  basket.

           With  astonishing  ease  he  jumps  up  and  knocks  the  ball 
           loose.  Without  saying  a  word  he  walks  off  the  court  and 
           returns  to  his  broom.

           A  power  lunch  scene.  Noah,  casually  dressed,  sits  at  the

           his  laptop,  a  plate  of  food,  and  his  son  Jason. 

           Noah  takes  a  forkful  of  food  into  his  mouth.  He  chews 
           contemplatively.  He  starts  typing  on  his  computer,  pauses 
           and  looks  to  Jason.

           INT.  NURSERY  SCHOOL  CLASSROOM-  -  DAY

           Noah  and  Liz  sit  in  tiny  chairs  in  front  of  Micah’s  white 
           teacher,  Mrs.  Yates. 

                                 MRS.  YATES
                        Alright.  Now  before  we  get 
                        started,  do  either  of  you  guys 
                        have  to  go  to  the  bathroom?

                             LIZ
                                                          NOAH
           No.  I  think  we’re  ok.
                                              Well,  I  guess  I  could.

           Liz  glares  at  Noah.

                                 NOAH
                        I  mean,  no.  We’re  both  fine.

                                 MRS.  YATES
                        Way  to  cooperate!  For  using  words 
                        instead  of  hitting,  you  both  get  a 
                        gold  star.

           Mrs.  Yates  grabs  two  gold  star  STICKERS,  stands  up,  and 
           places  a  star  each  on  Liz  and  Noah’s  sleeves. 

                                 LIZ
                                 (agitated)
                        Mrs.  Yates,  can  you  please  tell  us 
                        why  we’re  here?

                                 MRS.  YATES
                        I  love  that  you’re  ready  to  learn. 
                        So  Micah,  your  wonderful,  special, 
                        son,  has  taken  a  peculiar  interest 
                        in  our  newest  student,  Antoine.

           Noah  and  Liz  look  at  each  other.

                                 LIZ
                        I  knew  it,  he’s  gay.

                                 MRS.  YATES
                        Oh  my,  no.  It’s  just  that  Antoine 
                        happens  to  be  our  only  African-
                        American  student...

                                 (excited)
                        Well  then  that’s  a  good  thing  that 
                        he’s  trying  to  befriend  him.

                                 MRS.  YATES
                        Yes,  friendship  is  a  wonderful 
                        thing.  That’s  why  we’re  sitting 
                        here  in  the  friendship  triangle. 
                        But  with  Micah  and  Antoine  it’s 
                        more  like...  Micah  follows  him 
                        around...  everywhere.

                        And,  well,  then  today  Micah 
                        covered  his  face  in  brown  magic 
                        marker  because  he  said  “that’s 
                        what  Antoine  does  everyday.”

           Liz  smirks.

                                 LIZ
                        I  don’t  want  to  be  insensitive, 
                        but  he’s  four  years  old.  Is  this 
                        really  a  big  deal?

                                 MRS.  YATES
                        He  also  pinned  Antoine  down  and 
                        attacked  his  face  with  an  eraser 
                        in  an  attempt  to  ‘clean  up  his 
                        dirty  face.’

             Noah  buries  his  face  in  his  hands.

                                 LIZ
                        That’s  no  good.

                                 MRS.  YATES
                        No,  but  it  has  given  us  an 
                        opportunity.  I’ve  spoken  with 
                        Antoine’s  parents  and  they’d  love 
                        us  all  to  sit  down  and  talk  this 
                        out.  Make  everyone  more 
                        comfortable.

                        Actually,  that  would  make  me  much 
                        less  comfortable.  Please  let  them 
                        know  we’re  very  sorry,  but  we’ll 
                        handle  this  at  home.

                                 MRS.  YATES
                        Your  choice  makes  me  sad,  but  it 
                        is  yours  to  make.  Now  may  I  ask 
                        you  a  question?

                        It  seems  Micah’s  behavior  stems 
                        from  a  lack  of  exposure.  Now  we 
                        don’t  normally  give  out  homework 
                        assignments  in  nursery  school,  but 
                        I  think  it  might  be  good,  for  you 
                        and  for  Micah,  if  you  diversify 
                        your  social  circles  a  bit.

                        starting  to  realize  that  my  life 
                        may  not  be  what  I’ve  always 
                        thought  it  was.

                        I’ve  always  fancied  myself  so 
                        liberal  and  into  diversity  and 
                        everything  but  when  I  actually 
                        examine  my  life,  it’s  not  there.

                        Give  me  a  break  Noah.  You  do 
                        appreciate  diversity,  and  so  do  I, 
                        but  just  because  it  so  happens 
                        that  most  of  our  friends  are...

                        No,  but  this  is  getting  out  of 
                        control.  I  don’t  want  my  only 
                        interaction  with  black  people  to 
                        be  emails  from  Barack  Obama.

                        I  think  you’re  making  too  big  a 
                        deal  out  of  this. 

                                 NOAH
                        I  just  can’t  handle  the  idea  of 
                        our  kids  being  raised  in  an 
                        environment  where  they’re  only 
                        surrounded  by  people  who  look,  and 
                        dress,  and  talk  exactly  like  us.

           Liz  looks  at  the  gold  star  still  stuck  to  Noah’s  sleeve. 

                                 LIZ
                        Would  you  please  take  that  gold 
                        star  off  of  your  sleeve.  This 
                        train  isn’t  going  to  Auschwitz. 

           Noah  hangs  his  head,  dejected.

                        Maybe  that’s  what  I  deserve.

           EXT.  NEW  YORK  CITY  STREET  -  NIGHT

           Noah  and  Pete  walk  down  an  oddly  quiet  city  block. 

                                 PETE
                        Where’d  you  say  you  heard  about

                        involved,  but  this...

           Pete  looks  at  their  surroundings

                        It’s  not  as  bad  as  you’d  think. 

           They  approach  a  building  with  a  steel  door  where  a  sign 
           reads  “SPREAD  THE  BLACK  -  Meeting  Tonight  -  Downstairs.”

                                 PETE  (CONT’D)
                        Exactly  what  kind  of  an 
                        organization  is  this?

           INT.  SPREAD  THE  BLACK  MEETING  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Noah  and  Pete  head  down  a  staircase  and  into  a  cold, 
           dimly-lit  basement.  A  small  group  of  black  people  sit  on 
           folding  chairs  facing  a  platform.  Noah  spots  two  open 
           chairs  near  the  front  of  the  room.  They  slowly  make  their 
           way  to  the  seats.  All  eyes  are  on  them-  the  only  white 
           people  in  the  room.  Noah  self-consciously  sits  down.

           He  turns  to  the  nerdy  looking  black  guy  next  to  him.

                                 NOAH
                                 (super  friendly)
                        Hey.  How  you  doing? 

           Noah  extends  his  hand  for  a  shake.

           The  guy  just  stares  at  Noah’s  hand.  Noah  nods  and  turns 
           towards  the  platform.

           The  LEADER  of  the  meeting  walks  onto  the  platform  holding 
           a  white  MANNEQUIN  wearing  a  tee  shirt  that  reads  “White 
           Devil.” 

           Noah  swallows  nervously.

           The  leader  addresses  the  room.

                                 LEADER
                        Good  evening  my  brothers  and 
                        sisters. 

           The  leader  unsheathes  a  machete  from  his  belt  and 
           violently  beheads  the  mannequin.

           The  small  crowd  cheers  their  approval.

           Noah  sprints  out  of  the  room.  Pete,  spellbound,  remains 
           seated.

           Noah  and  Liz  dine  at  a  table  set  for  three.  Liz  chows 
           down  while  Noah  stares  at  his  meal.

           his  gregarious,  wannabe-black  doorman,  RAY.

           Ray  gives  Noah  an  absurdly  elaborate  handshake.

           reaches  for  the  elevator  call  button  but  stops  short  and

           127th  street  and  Malcolm  X  Blvd.  He  heads  down  the  block 
           where  he  sees  a  long  line  of  people  waiting  outside  the 
           famous  Harlem  soul  food  institution.

           As  Noah  nears  the  back  of  the  line  he  begins  to  notice 
           that  the  restaurant  goers  aren’t  who  he  hoped  they  would 
           be:  A  family  of  heavy-set  white  mid-westerners  in  ‘I

           picture  next  to  the  Sylvia’s  sign.  An  elderly  woman’s

           the  black  HOSTESS  at  her  podium.  He  looks  around  the 
           room.

                                 HOSTESS
                        Can  I  help  you?

           Noah  sees  that  the  clientele  inside  is  no  different  from 
           the  tourists  he  saw  outside. 

                                 NOAH
                        I’m  afraid  not.

           EXT.  MADISON  SQUARE  GARDEN  -  NIGHT

           Noah  and  Pete  stand  in  front  of  the  giant  MSG  Marquee.  It 
           reads  “TONIGHT  ONLY:  KANYE  WEST.”

           INT.  MADISON  SQUARE  GARDEN  -  LATER

           Kanye  rocks  the  arena.  At  their  seats,  Pete  does  the 
           robot  as  Noah  scans  the  crowd.

           All  around  them  are  screaming  WHITE  teenage  girls.  In  the 
           seats  directly  next  to  Noah  a  15  year-old  couple 
           passionately  makes-out.  The  boy  attempts  to  stuff  the 
           girl’s  hand  down  his  pants,  but  she  forces  his  hand  onto 
           her  breast  instead.  The  make-out  session  continues 
           uninterrupted.

           Noah  reaches  for  his  beer  only  to  see  a  16  year-old  kid 
           swipe  it  and  run  down  the  aisle  chugging  it  with  his 
           friend.

           Noah  sinks  down  in  his  seat.
           EXT.  THE  CAGE  BASKETBALL  COURT  -  DAY

           A  sunny  spring  day  at  the  famed  West  4th  Street 
           basketball  court.  Throngs  of  spectators  lean  on  the  20 
           foot  tall  chain  link  fence  that  surrounds  the  outdoor 
           black  top.  Inside  the  cage  ten  athletic  African-Americans 
           play  a  fast  and  furious  game  of  street  ball. 

           Noah,  in  his  hoops  gear,  stretches  on  the  sideline. 

           EXT.  THE  CAGE  BASKETBALL  COURT  -  LATER

           Noah  now  sits  slumped  against  the  fence.  He’s  clearly 
           been  waiting  a  long  time  to  get  in  the  game.

           Mike,  a  sinewy,  black,  30-something  approaches  Noah. 

                                 MIKE
                        Hey  man,  we’re  short  one  for  the 
                        next  game.  You  wanna  play? 

           Noah  springs  to  his  feet.

                                 NOAH
                        For  sure. 

           Mike  shakes  Noah’s  hand. 

                                 MIKE
                        I’m  Mike.

                                 NOAH
                        Noah. 

                                 MIKE
                        Alright  Noah,  let’s  see  what  you 
                        got.

           Noah  heads  onto  the  court  with  Mike.

                                 MIKE  (CONT’D)
                        You  look  really  familiar.

                                 NOAH
                        You  watch  Channel  Four  News?

                                 MIKE
                        No.  I  think  I’ve  seen  you  play 
                        ball  at  the  Y.  I  play  right  after 
                        you  guys  sometimes.

                                 NOAH
                        Oh  nice.

                                 MIKE
                        You  got  a  decent  little  game.

           Noah  lights  up,  turns  to  Mike  and  puts  on  the  charm.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NOAH
                        Thanks.  With  a  body  like  that  you 
                        must  be  a  whale  of  a  power 
                        forward.

           Noah,  completely  enthralled  in  his  conversation,  doesn’t 
           see  a  basketball  on  the  court  directly  in  his  path.

                                 NOAH  (CONT’D)
                        So,  you  play  here  often?

           And  with  that,  Noah  steps  square  on  the  ball.  The  ball 
           skids  forward  and  Noah  flies  backwards.  He  crashes  down 
           onto  the  court,  slamming  his  head  against  the  cement.

           Noah,  out  cold,  lies  face-up  on  the  asphalt.

           EXT.  THE  CAGE  BASKETBALL  COURT  -  LATER

           As  Noah  hobbles  away  from  the  court,  he  holds  an  ice  pack 
           to  his  head.  He  stands  at  the  street  corner,  dejected

           All  of  a  sudden  it  begins  to  pour.  Noah  looks  to  the  sky. 
           Could  it  get  any  worse?  Noah  searches  for  a  cab.

           EXT.  THE  CAGE  BASKETBALL  COURT  -  LATER

           Noah  is  now  completely  drenched.  Finally,  an  available 
           cab  pulls  towards  the  curb.  Just  as  Noah  heads  for  the 
           back  door  a  BLACK  MAN  gets  to  the  cab  first. 

                                 NOAH
                        Hey,  that’s  my  cab.

                                 BLACK  MAN
                        No.  Actually  it’s  my  cab.

                                 NOAH
                        No  way.  He  definitely  stopped  for 
                        me.

                                 BLACK  MAN
                        Oh,  so  it’s  like  that  still?  Cab 
                        can’t  stop  to  pick  up  a  black  man? 

                                 NOAH
                                 (defeated)
                        Forget  it.  Just  take  it.

           The  Black  Man  gets  in  the  cab.  Noah  hangs  his  head. 

           The  cab  starts  to  pull  away,  but  then  stops.  The  rear 
           window  lowers.

                                 BLACK  MAN
                        Get  in.
           INT.  CAB  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Noah  sits  in  the  cab  with  the  Black  Man.  This  is  RASHON 
           DAVIS  (35).  Rashon  is  nattily  attired  and  handsome.

                                 RASHON
                        That  was  my  bad.

                                 NOAH
                        Don’t  worry  about  it.  Maybe  you 
                        were  there  first.

                                 RASHON
                        Oh,  I  was  definitely  there  first. 
                        I  was  talking  about  playing  the 
                        race  card. 

           The  African  CAB  DRIVER  turns  around.

                                 CAB  DRIVER
                        Where’s  my  first  stop?

                                 RASHON
                                 (to  Noah)
                        I’m  sure  I’m  further  uptown  than 
                        you.  Where  you  headed?

           Noah  thinks  about  it.

                                 NOAH
                        Why,  where  are  you  going?

                                 RASHON
                        I’m  up  on  123rd  and  Riverside.

           Noah  recognizes  an  opportunity.

                                 NOAH
                        Oh,  actually  I’m  headed  a  bit 
                        further  uptown  than  that.  I’ll 
                        drop  you  first.

           The  cab  driver  turns  back  around.

                                 RASHON
                        You  live  in  Harlem?

                                 NOAH
                        No.

                                 RASHON
                        Didn’t  think  so.  Only  two  reasons 
                        white  folks  head  north  of  125th. 
                        Dinosaur  Barbecue  or  Sylvia’s?

                                 NOAH
                        Yes. 

                                 RASHON
                        That  wasn’t  multiple  choice.

                        Um,  I  meant...

           Noah  is  interrupted  by  the  Taxi  TV  MONITOR  in  the  back  of 
           the  cab.  It  plays  Noah’s  most  recent  TV  food  review. 

                                 RASHON
                        I  knew  you  looked  familiar.  Matter 
                        of  fact,  I  ate  at  Berger  Brothers 
                        last  week  after  your  review. 

                                 NOAH
                        Oh  yeah.  What  did  you  think?

                                 RASHON
                        Burger  was  pretty  good.  Well 
                        cooked.  Decent  bun.  But  homemade 
                        ketchup?  Now  that’s  just  stupid.

                                 NOAH
                        I  hear  ya.  It  doesn’t  get  any 
                        better  than  Heinz.

                                 RASHON
                        For  real.  I  love  Heinz  so  much  you 
                        could  call  me  John  Kerry.

           Noah  looks  at  Rashon,  confused.

                                 RASHON  (CONT’D)
                        Read  a  paper,  man.  He’s  married  to 
                        Theresa  Heinz.

                                 NOAH
                        Oh  yeah,  that’s  right.

                                 RASHON
                        But  I’ll  still  go  back.  It’s  right 
                        next  door  to  where  I  work.

           The  cab  driver  turns  around  again.

                                 CAB  DRIVER
                        You  want  me  to  stay  on  Tenth  or 
                        take  West  Side  Highway?

                                 RASHON
                        Doesn’t  matter  to  me.

                        better  taking...

           Noah  looks  at  the  cab  driver’s  ID  picture  and  name: 
           Mpolondo  Mukamba.  Noah  then  glances  at  Rashon.

                        you  think  is  best.  Far  be  it  from 
                        me  to  tell  you  how  to  do  your  job. 

           Noah  proudly  smiles  at  Rashon  who  awkwardly  smiles  in 
           return.

           INT.  CAB  -  LATER

           The  driver  pulls  up  alongside  a  modern  high-rise.  Rashon 
           opens  the  door  and  gets  out.  He  reaches  into  his  pocket 
           and  pulls  out  a  ten  dollar  bill.

                                 RASHON
                        Here  you  go.

           Rashon  tries  to  hand  Noah  the  money.

                        Don’t  worry  about  it.  I  got  it.

                                 RASHON
                        What?  A  black  man  can’t  afford  to 
                        pay  for  his  own  cab?

                                 RASHON
                        Relax.  I’m  just  playing.  Thanks 
                        for  the  ride.

                        Oh.  Ha.  Good  one...  John  Kerry!

           Noah’s  joke  falls  completely  flat.

                                 RASHON
                        Ok  then.

           Rashon  closes  the  door  and  the  cab  takes  off.

                                 MPOLONDO

           INT.  CAB  -  LATER

           The  cab  pulls  up  to  Noah’s  building.  He  starts  to  get  out 
           when  he  notices  Rashon’s  UMBRELLA  in  the  back  seat.
           INT.  NOAH’S  APARTMENT,  KITCHEN  -  DAY

           Noah  and  Liz  sit  on  stools  at  their  kitchen  counter. 
           Rashon’s  two  dollar,  black,  available-on-any-street-

                        I  think  I  have  to.

                                 LIZ
                        It’s  beyond  creepy.

                                 NOAH
                        No,  it’s  a  nice  gesture.

                                 LIZ
                        Imagine  if  you  shared  a  cab  with  a 
                        guy  and  he  showed  up  at  our  house 
                        a  week  later  with  a  piece  of 
                        trident  that  you  left  in  the  taxi. 
                        You’d  call  the  cops.

                                 NOAH
                        No.  I  would  thank  him.

                                 LIZ
                        You  would  not!  Admit  it,  you  have 
                        a  crush  on  this  guy  and  it’s 
                        making  you  act  all  crazy.

           Noah  stares  at  the  umbrella.

                                 NOAH
                        I  think  he  might  be  the  one.

                                 LIZ
                        So  you’re  just  gonna  show  up  at 
                        his  office?  That’s  something  a 
                        serial  killer  would  do. 

                                 NOAH
                        Actually,  I’m  not  even  sure  where 
                        he  works.  He  just  said  it’s  next 
                        to  Berger  Brothers. 

           Liz  rolls  her  eyes.

           EXT.  BERGER  BROS  BURGERS  -  EVENING

           Noah  stands,  umbrella  in  hand,  on  the  sidewalk  in  front 
           of  Berger  Bros.  He  looks  at  the  building  directly  to  the 
           left  of  Berger  Bros:  CAFFEINE  COMPUTER  FIX.

           Then  he  looks  at  the  building  directly  to  the  right  of 
           Berger  Bros:  POPEYE’S  FRIED  CHICKEN.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He  scratches  his  head.  He  takes  a  step  towards  Popeye’s 
           then  stops.  He  shakes  his  head,  turns,  and  walks  towards 
           Caffeine  Computer  Fix.

                                 RASHON  (O.C.)
                        Noah?

           Noah  turns  around  to  see  Rashon  and  DARRELL,  another 
           black  guy,  walking  out  of  Popeye’s  together.  They  each 
           carry  a  soda  and  a  gym  bag.

                                 NOAH
                                 (off-guard)
                        Hey.

           Rashon  and  Darrell  approach  Noah.

                                 RASHON.
                                 (to  Darrell)
                        This  is  that  food  guy  I  told  you 
                        about.
                                 (to  Noah)
                        This  is  my  employee,  Darrell.

           Noah  shakes  Darrell’s  hand.

                                 DARRELL
                        I’m  also  his  cousin.  Rashon  thinks 
                        he’s  funny.

                                 NOAH
                        So  you  guys  work  together.  Cool.

                                 RASHON
                        Yeah,  I  opened  up  the  store  five 
                        years  ago,  and  Darrell’s  been 
                        along  for  the  ride  since  day  one.

                                 NOAH
                        I  gotta  say,  so  many  new  trendy 
                        restaurants  try  to  do  fried 
                        chicken  these  days,  but  in  my 
                        humble  opinion,  you  guys  still 
                        do  it  best.

           Rashon  and  Darrell  look  at  each  other  confused.  Then  they 
           notice  their  Popeye’s  cups.  They  CRACK  UP. 

           Noah  chuckles  awkwardly,  unsure  of  what’s  so  funny.

                                 RASHON
                                 (to  Darrell)
                        Oh  man.  This  fool  saw  us  coming 
                        out  of  Popeye’s  and  thought  we 
                        worked  there? 

                                 DARRELL
                                 (mocking)
                        Would  you  like  biscuits  or  cole 
                        slaw  with  that?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Noah’s  face  turns  red.

                                 RASHON
                        That’s  too  funny.
                                 (to  Noah)
                        Nah  man,  we  were  just  grabbing 
                        some  sodas.  That’s  my  place  over 
                        there.

           Rashon  points  to  Caffeine  Computer  Fix.

                                 RASHON  (CONT’D)
                        It’s  a  computer  repair  slash 
                        coffee  shop.

                                 NOAH
                        Wow.  I  feel  like  an  ass.  I’m  so 
                        sorry. 

                                 RASHON
                        Hey,  I’m  sure  whoever  owns  that 
                        Popeye’s  is  a  rich  bastard.
                                 (beat)
                        You  back  for  another  Berger 
                        Burger?

                                 NOAH
                        Oh,  no.  Actually  I  came  here  to 
                        bring  you  this...

           Noah  hands  Rashon  the  umbrella.

                                 RASHON
                        What’s  this?

                                 NOAH
                        It’s  your  umbrella.  You  left  it  in 
                        the  cab.

                                 RASHON
                        That’s  not  my  umbrella. 

                                 NOAH
                        Oh.  It  was  in  the  cab,  I 
                        thought...

                                 DARRELL
                        Hold  up.  You  came  here  just  to 
                        give  him  that  crappy  umbrella 
                        that’s  not  even  his?  Please  tell 
                        me  you  live  on  this  block.

                                 NOAH
                        I  don’t  but,  uh,  it’s  cool,  I  was 
                        in  the  neighborhood  anyway.

           Darrell  nods,  unconvinced.  The  three  of  them  stand 
           silently  for  an  awkward  beat.

                        Nice  to  meet  you  Darrell. 

           Noah  turns  away.  Rashon  watches  him  sulk  off.

                                 RASHON
                        Uh...  Noah,  you  play  ball,  right?

           Darrell  hits  Rashon.  Noah  turns  around.

                        That’s  really  nice,  but  I’m

                        Are  you  sure  this  guy  isn’t  a

                        Somebody  will  have  extra  gear.

           INT.  KENNEDY  HIGH  SCHOOL  GYMNASIUM  -  NIGHT

           Noah,  Rashon  and  Darrell  enter  the  gym.  On  the  court, 
           seven  other  black  guys  warm  up.

                                 RASHON

                        Hey,  do  any  of  you  guys  have  a 
                        spare  shirt  or  a  pair  of  shorts 
                        that  my  man  here  can  borrow?

           Massive  6’9”  ANDRE  steps  forward. 

                                 ANDRE
                        I  got  a  shirt.

           5’3”  TYRONE  also  pipes  up.

                                 RASHON
                        See.  All  set. 

           INT.  KENNEDY  HIGH  SCHOOL  GYMNASIUM  -  LATER

           All  nine  black  players  shoot  around  and  shoot  the  shit.

                                 DARRELL
                                 (to  Rashon)
                        What’s  taking  him  so  long?

           Rashon  shrugs.  Just  then  the  door  to  the  locker  room 
           swings  open.  Everybody  on  the  court  turns  to  look,  and 
           their  jaws  collectively  plummet  as  they  see  --

           Noah,  whose  enormous  borrowed  white  t-shirt  hangs  down 
           past  his  knees,  making  it  look  like  he’s  not  wearing 
           shorts.  

                                 DARRELL  (CONT’D)
                                 (to  Rashon)
                        I  told  you  there  was  something 
                        wrong  with  this  guy. 

           Noah  trots  over  to  Rashon  and  Darrell,  his  shirt-dress 
           flows  as  he  moves. 

           Rashon  gestures  towards  Noah’s  mid-section. 

                                 RASHON
                        What’s  the  deal,  man?

           Noah  begins  to  lift  his  shirt  up,  but  Darrell  smacks  his 
           hand  down.

                                 DARRELL
                        Yo,  nobody  wants  to  see  your  junk.

                                 NOAH
                        No,  I’m  wearing  shorts,  they’re 
                        just  a  bit  too  tight  to  tuck  this 
                        shirt  into. 

           Noah  lifts  his  shirt  up  to  reveal  nut-hugging  shorts  that 
           leave  absolutely  nothing  to  the  imagination. 

           Everybody  GROANS  and  turns  away  in  disgust. 

                                 DARRELL
                        I  said  we  did  not  want  to  see  your 
                        junk,  man.

           RALPH,  a  mean-looking  dude,  aggressively  steps  up  to

           The  ten  guys  play  a  competitive  pick-up  game.  Noah 
           continues  to  look  ridiculous  in  his  shirt-dress. 

           Noah’s  team  has  the  ball.  Noah  stands  unguarded  along  the 
           three  point  line.  No  one  passes  to  him. 

           INT.  KENNEDY  HIGH  SCHOOL  GYMNASIUM  -  LATER

           Noah  is  open  on  the  perimeter  and  again  his  teammates 
           fail  to  pass  him  the  ball. 

           INT.  KENNEDY  HIGH  SCHOOL  GYMNASIUM  -  LATER

           Rashon  dribbles  on  the  left  side  of  the  court  and  spots 
           Noah  wide  open  at  the  three  point  line.  He  passes  Noah 
           the  ball. 

           Noah  sets  to  shoot,  but  gets  trigger  shy.  He  looks  to 
           pass  even  though  he’s  unguarded.

                                 RASHON
                        Knock  that  down. 

           Emboldened,  Noah  shoots  the  three  pointer  and  --

           SWISH.  He  drains  it.  As  he  trots  back  on  defense  he 
           extends  a  fist  to  give  Rashon  a  bump.  However,  Rashon 
           goes  for  the  traditional  high  five.  Their  hands  touch 
           awkwardly.

           INT.  KENNEDY  HIGH  SCHOOL  GYMNASIUM  -  MONTAGE

           Noah  nails  a  jumper  from  the  baseline. 

           Andre  and  Noah  make  eye  contact.  Noah  throws  Andre  a 
           perfect  alley  oop  pass.  Andre  throws  down  a  vicious  dunk. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Rashon  and  Noah  backpedal  on  defense.  This  time  Noah  goes 
           for  the  high  five  and  Rashon  attempts  the  fist  bump.  More 
           awkward  hand  touching.

           Darrell  feeds  Noah  a  beautiful  bounce  pass  as  Noah  cuts 
           to  the  basket.  Noah  lays  the  ball  in.  Ralph  chews  out  his 
           teammate  who  was  supposed  to  be  defending  Noah. 

           Noah’s  teammates  all  give  him  props  as  they  head  back  on 
           defense.

           INT.  KENNEDY  HIGH  SCHOOL  GYMNASIUM  -  LATER

           All  the  sweat-drenched  players  catch  their  breath  as 
           Rashon  ties  his  shoe  at  the  top  of  the  key.  He  picks  up 
           the  ball.

                                 RASHON
                        Game  point.  Ball  in. 

           Rashon  passes  the  ball  to  Darrell  who  swings  it  over  to 
           Noah.  Noah  fakes  a  shot  and  then  blows  by  his  defender. 
           He  heads  in  for  the  game  winning  lay-up  when,  out  of 
           nowhere,  Ralph  clobbers  him.  Noah  hits  the  floor  with  a 
           THUD  and  grimaces  in  pain. 

           Everyone  on  the  court  cringes,  taken  aback  by  Ralph’s 
           unnecessarily  hard  foul. 

                                 NOAH
                        I’m  alright. 

           Sprawled  on  the  floor,  Noah  extends  his  hand  to  Ralph, 
           looking  for  help  getting  up. 

           Ralph  sneers  at  Noah,  ignores  his  hand,  and  walks  away. 

           Darrell  comes  over  and  helps  Noah  to  his  feet.  Rashon 
           heads  after  Ralph  and  gets  in  his  face. 

                                 RASHON
                        What’s  the  matter  with  you?  That 
                        was  some  bullshit.

                                 RALPH
                        Point  game,  no  easy  buckets.  Get 
                        the  hell  out  my  face. 

           Rashon  collects  the  ball  to  resume  play. 

           Ralph  walks  right  up  to  Noah  and  pushes  him  in  the  chest. 

                                 RALPH  (CONT’D)
                        I  got  this  scrub  now. 

           The  game  starts  up  again.  Noah  gets  the  ball  in  the  post. 
           He  takes  a  few  dribbles,  trying  to  back  Ralph  down. 
           Draped  all  over  Noah,  Ralph  barely  gives  an  inch.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Noah  pivots  around  Ralph,  and  puts  up  a  difficult  turn 
           around  jumper  off  the  glass.  The  ball  sails  through  the 
           net. 

           Noah’s  team  wins.  His  teammates  rush  over  to  congratulate 
           him.

                        Yeah,  he  hooked  me. 

                                 RASHON
                        I’ve  been  playing  in  this  game  for 
                        fifteen  years,  and  there  has  never 
                        been  one  offensive  foul  called, 
                        ever.

                                 RALPH
                        Well  I  just  called  one.

                                 NOAH
                        C’mon  dude,  you  know  I  didn’t  foul 
                        you. 

                                 RALPH
                        Shut  your  mouth,  punk.  This  isn’t 
                        even  your  game. 

                                 RASHON
                        It’s  not  your  game  either,  Ralph.

                                 DARRELL
                        Yeah,  man.  And  your  breath  always 
                        stinks  like  cucumbers.  What’s  that 
                        about?

                                 RALPH
                        So  that’s  how  it  is?  You  guys  are 
                        all  gonna  take  this  little  bitch’s 
                        back  instead  of  mine? 

           Ralph  looks  to  the  other  players.  They’re  all  silent. 

                                 RALPH  (CONT’D)
                        Fuck  all  ya’ll!

           And  with  that,  Ralph  tears  off  his  sweaty  tank  top, 
           throws  it  on  the  floor  and  marches  out  of  the  gym.

                                 DARRELL
                        Oh  shit!  That’s  my  ride  home.

           Darrell  runs  after  Ralph.

           EXT.  KENNEDY  HIGH  SCHOOL  -  LATER

           Rashon  and  Noah  ad-lib  goodbyes  to  the  other  guys.

                                 RASHON
                        You  weren’t  half  bad  out  there.

                                 NOAH
                        You’re  really  good  too.

           Rashon  takes  a  business  card  out  of  his  wallet  and  hands 
           it  to  Noah.

                                 RASHON
                        Right.  So,  if  you  wanna  run  again, 
                        let  me  know. 

           From  the  street  a  car  horn  HONKS.

           Rashon  and  Noah  make  their  way  towards  a  Nissan  Maxima. 
           The  driver’s  side  window  rolls  down.  We  see  the  driver, 
           KIM  (25)  black  and  beautiful. 

                                 KIM
                        C’mon  honey,  we  gotta  go. 

           Rashon  leans  down  and  plants  a  big  kiss  on  Kim’s  lips.

                                 RASHON
                        Hey,  baby
                                 (to  Noah)
                        Noah,  this  is  my  girlfriend,  Kim. 

                                 NOAH
                        Nice  to  meet  you.

                        How  you  doing? 

                                 RASHON
                        And  that  little  man  sleeping  in 
                        the  back  is  my  son,  Antoine. 

           Noah  peers  into  the  backseat  where  a  light-skinned  black 
           boy,  roughly  Micah’s  age,  sleeps.  This  is  ANTOINE.

                                 NOAH
                        Did  you  say  his  name  was  Antoine?

                        Yeah,  why?

                        grab  the  cake  from  the  freezer.

           Noah  walks  over  to  the  freezer  and  pulls  out  a  semi-
           circle  shaped  ice-cream  cake.  He  brings  it  over  to  Liz 
           who  puts  four  regular  sized  candles  and  one  HALF-SIZED 
           CANDLE  into  it.  Noah  lights  the  candles  and  they  present

           Micah  blows  out  the  candles.  Noah  and  Liz  CLAP  and  Jason 
           BANGS  on  his  high  chair  tray  excitedly. 

           Micah  stands  up  on  his  chair.

                        And  as  for  the  racism,  I  don’t 
                        really  see  it.

                        I  don’t  know,  man.  Inviting  a

                        little...

           Noah  searches.

                        Kind  of.  It  just  feels  like  I’m 
                        reinforcing  a  stereotype.

                        I  can’t  stand  this.  People  are  way 
                        too  sensitive.  You  know  why 
                        there’s  a  stereotype  that  black 
                        people  like  soul  food?  Because 
                        tons  of  --

           A  FAT  WOMAN  walks  in  the  aisle  behind  Pete  and  bumps  him 
           forward  causing  Pete  to  hit  the  button  on  his  mic.

           A  smattering  of  APPLAUSE  sounds  throughout  the  arena.  A 
           BLACK  MAN  sitting  in  the  lower  section  stands  up.

                                 BLACK  MAN
                        You  know  that’s  true!

                        So  what?  You’re  saying  all 
                        stereotypes  are  true?

                                 PETE
                        No,  but  there’s  usually  some  basis 
                        in  reality  for  ‘em.  Besides, 
                        assuming  someone  likes  soul  food 
                        isn’t  offensive-  regardless  of 
                        their  race.  Soul  food  is  pretty 
                        much  universally  adored.  Now  if 
                        you  were  inviting  him  to  join  you 
                        for  beginner’s  swim-lessons,  that 
                        would  be  offensive.

                                 NOAH
                        So  you’re  sure  he  won’t  think  I’m 
                        a  racist?

                        Not  until  you  tell  him  you’re  the

           INT.  RASHON’S  APARTMENT,  LIVING  ROOM  -  DAY

           A  clean,  spacious,  modern  apartment.  Large  windows 
           present  a  beautiful  southern  view  of  Manhattan.

           Rashon  paces  in  the  apartment  while  on  the  phone.

                                 RASHON
                                 (into  phone)
                        Um.  I  guess  so.  Sure.

           Rashon  hangs  up  the  phone. 

           INT.  RASHON’S  APARTMENT,  BEDROOM  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Rashon  enters.  His  adorable  girlfriend  Kim  lies  in  bed 
           reading  the  newspaper.  She  looks  up.

                                 KIM
                        So  who’s  that  you’re  going  out 
                        with?

                                 RASHON
                        That  dude  Noah  who  played  ball 
                        with  us  the  other  day.  The  food 
                        critic.

                                 KIM
                        The  creepy  umbrella  guy?

                                 RASHON
                        Yeah,  him.

                                 KIM
                        So  he  asked  you  out?

                                 RASHON
                        I  mean  not  ‘out’  out.  He  gets  to 
                        bring  someone  with  him  when  he 
                        reviews  a  restaurant.  He  seems 
                        nice  enough.

                                 KIM
                        Sounds  real  nice.
                                 (beat)
                        Is  he  gay?

                                 RASHON
                        No.

                        Not  that  I’m  aware  of.

           EXT.  MOMOFUKU  SOUL  -  NIGHT

           Rashon  stands  on  the  sidewalk  waiting  in  front  of  the 
           restaurant.  A  husky  blonde  WOMAN  walks  up  to  Rashon.

                        What’s  up,  Rashon? 

           Rashon  looks  at  the  woman,  confused.

                                 RASHON
                        I’m  sorry.  Do  I  know  you?

                                 WOMAN
                        It’s  me,  Noah.

           Rashon  gets  a  closer  look,  and  underneath  the  lipstick 
           and  wig,  it  is  indeed  Noah.  Rashon  takes  a  step  back.

                                 RASHON
                        Listen,  yo.  You  got  the  wrong

                        reviews  in  disguise,  didn’t  I?

                                 RASHON
                        Um,  yeah.  You  did  not  mention 
                        that.

           INT.  MOMOFUKU  SOUL  -  LATER

           Noah  and  Rashon  sit  across  from  each  other  at  a  table  for 
           two  in  the  hip,  hot,  happening  dining  room.

                                 NOAH
                        ...yeah,  I  used  to  go  with  just 
                        the  fake  mustache,  but  eventually 
                        people  caught  on.  If  I’m 
                        recognized,  it  completely 
                        compromises  the  review,  so  I  had 
                        to  take  it  to  the  next  level.

           Rashon  takes  Noah’s  full  outfit  in.

                                 RASHON
                        That’s  next  level  alright.

                        One  more  thing,  my  lady  voice 
                        isn’t  too  convincing,  so  I’m  gonna 
                        have  to  ask  you  to  do  the 
                        ordering.

                                 RASHON
                        You  serious?

                                 RASHON
                        Everything?

           The  WAITER  walks  over  to  the  table.

                                 WAITER
                        Are  you  two  ready  to  order?

           Rashon  looks  at  Noah  for  confirmation.  Noah  nods.

                                 RASHON
                        We’re  gonna  start  with  an  order  of 
                        all  the  appetizers,  and  then,  uh, 
                        give  us  all  the  entrees  too.

                                 WAITER
                        Are  you  expecting  others  to  join 
                        your  group?

           Noah  shakes  his  head  no.

                                 WAITER  (CONT’D)
                        I  shouldn’t  tell  you  this,  but 
                        there’s  no  way  you  can  eat  all 
                        that.

           Rashon  looks  to  Noah  for  help.  Noah  shrugs.

                                 RASHON
                        Well,  technically  it’s  not  just 
                        us.

           INT.  MOMOFUKU  SOUL  -  LATER

           Noah  and  Rashon’s  table  overflows  with  food.

                        So,  there’s  something  I  probably 
                        should  have  told  you  earlier.

                        in  drag?

                        Yes.  Other  than  that. 

           Noah  takes  a  sip  of  his  beer.

                        My  son...

           And  Noah  stops  mid-sentence.  His  attention  drifts  to  a 
           neighboring  table  where  an  OLD  LADY  sits,  blatantly 
           staring  at  Noah  with  a  huge  smile.  Noah  looks  back  at  her 
           and  her  smile  widens  as  her  stare  intensifies. 

                                 NOAH  (CONT’D)
                        Shit.  I  think  this  woman 
                        recognizes  me.

                                 RASHON
                        Who?

           And  with  that,  the  old  lady  gets  up  and  approaches  their 
           table.

                                 OLD  LADY
                        I  just  had  to  come  over  here  and 
                        talk  to  you.

                                 NOAH
                        That’s...

                                 OLD  LADY
                        I  just  think  now  more  than  ever  a 
                        relationship  like  yours  represents 
                        the  best  of  this  country...

           The  old  lady  reaches  out  and  clutches  Noah  and  Rashon’s 
           hands.

                                 OLD  LADY  (CONT’D)
                        ...It  makes  me  proud  to  be  an 
                        American,  coming  out  to  a 
                        restaurant  and  seeing  a  beautiful 
                        mixed  couple  just  sitting  here, 
                        with  nothing  to  hide.  Who  knows, 
                        maybe  your  child  could  be 
                        president  too  someday.

           Just  then,  a  young  black  woman,  DAWN,  walks  by  Noah  and 
           Rashon’s  table. 

                                 DAWN
                        Rashon? 

           Rashon  struggles  to  free  his  hand  from  the  old  lady’s

                        Eating  dinner...

                        No.  See  Kim  knows  I’m  here.  This 
                        is  just  my  friend  No...

           The  old  lady  re-grabs  Rashon’s  hand.

           Dawn  takes  out  her  phone  and  SNAPS  a  picture  on  her  cell

                        I’m  so  sorry  about  all  that.  I

                        It  was  hectic  for  a  minute  there. 
                        But  that’s  the  craziest  night  I’ve 
                        had  in  a  while.  It  was  fun.

                        Yeah.  Only  thing  that  bothered  me 
                        was  that  salty  chili.  Damn  shame 
                        too,  cause  I  love  me  some  chili. 

           Noah  thinks  for  a  second.

                        Well  my  wife  makes  a  mean  chili.

                        Just  let  me  know  when.  I  never

                        I’m  sorry.  You’re  right.  I  got 
                        carried  away.  I  had  to  pull  out

           INT.  NOAH’S  APARTMENT,  KITCHEN  -  SAME

           Liz  and  Kim  continue  with  the  dishes.

                                 LIZ
                        ...I  guess  that  explains  why  your 
                        boobs  are  up  by  your  chin  and  mine 
                        dangle  past  my  belly  button.

                                 KIM
                        Don’t  be  fooled.  You  have  no  idea 
                        how  hard  this  bra  is  working.

                                 LIZ
                        So  four  years,  huh?  That’s  pretty 
                        serious. 

                                 KIM
                        It  is,  but  I’m  definitely  ready 
                        for  the  next  step.  Rashon  though, 
                        I’m  not  so  sure.

                                 LIZ
                        Guys  never  want  to  settle  down.  I  
                        had  to  stop  sleeping  with  Noah  for 
                        him  to  propose.

           Kim  laughs.

                        It’s  different  with  Rashon. 
                        As  a  divorcee,  he’s  a  little  bit 
                        scarred  to  say  the  least.

                                 LIZ
                        I’m  sorry,  that  sounds  like  a 
                        tough  situation.

                                 KIM
                        Yeah,  I’d  like  to  think  I’m  pretty 
                        understanding  but  I  know  that 
                        won’t  last  forever.

                        But  I  like  him  hanging  out  with 
                        Noah.  A  happily  married  man  can 
                        only  be  a  good  influence.

           All  of  a  sudden  Victoria  bursts  through  the  door  wearing 
           her  coat.  Liz  and  Kim  are  startled.

                                 VICTORIA
                        I’m  so  sorry.  Did  you  guys  say  you 
                        wanted  a  pack  or  a  carton?

           INT.  RASHON’S  APARTMENT,  BEDROOM  -  NIGHT

           Rashon  and  Kim  cuddle  in  bed.  Rashon  kisses  Kim’s  ear.

                                 KIM
                        So  that  was  really  fun.  I  like 
                        them  a  lot.

                                 RASHON
                        Uh-huh.

                                 KIM
                        We  should  take  them  out  sometime.

           Rashon  continues  his  kissing,  barely  listens  to  Kim.

                                 KIM  (CONT’D)
                        They  seem  so  happy,  don‘t  they? 
                        Like  they  have  a  great  marriage.

                                 RASHON
                        Mmm-hmm.

                                 KIM
                        You  want  that,  don’t  you?  For  us 
                        to  be  that  happy.

           Rashon  stops  his  kissing  and  looks  up  at  Kim.

                                 RASHON
                        Baby,  we  are  that  happy.  Besides, 
                        we  have  lots  of  things  going  for 
                        us  that  they  don’t  have.

                        For  one,  your  fine  ass.

           Rashon  starts  kissing  Kim  again,  this  time  on  her  neck, 
           but  Kim  pushes  him  away.  She  turns  her  back  to  him  and 
           turns  off  the  bedside  lamp.

                        Really?

           Kim  smiles  to  herself.

           producer,  and  Ed,  his  boss,  sit  at  a  table.

           Noah  sits  in  the  backseat  with  Liz.  She  looks  out  the 
           window  at  the  surroundings.

           Noah  leads  Liz  into  the  packed  bar.  The  predominantly 
           black  crowd  stands  elbow  to  elbow  but  no  one  seems  to 
           mind  as  they  happily  party  to  thumping  hip-hop  MUSIC.

           Noah  sees  Rashon  and  Kim  through  the  mass  of  bodies.  He 
           gives  them  a  dorky  salute/wave  then  turns  to  Liz.

                        Rashon  seems  like  a  perfectly  nice

                        forward  to  a  night  alone.

                        goes  bananas  for  dancehall.  I’m 
                        guessing  some  Sean  Paul.

           On  stage,  dreadlocked  M.C.  CHUCK  SNUGGLES,  taps  the 
           microphone.

           In  unison,  the  crowd  responds  “SING  IT!”

           Chuck  flips  a  switch  on  the  bottom  of  his  mic.

           Darrell  heads  onto  stage  and  Chuck  hands  him  the  mic.  The 
           baseline  to  Sean  Paul’s  dancehall  anthem  ‘LIKE  GLUE’ 
           kicks  in.  Immediately  the  crowd  starts  dancing  their 
           asses  off.

                        there  on  my  own.  And  you  know  what 
                        they  say,  ‘once  you  go  black...”

           On  stage,  Darrell  stirs  the  crowd  into  a  frenzy  with  his 
           impassioned  rendition  of  the  chorus.

                                 DARRELL

                        C’mon  Noah.  Aren’t  you  gonna 
                        unleash  your  inner  Timberlake?

           Noah  puts  up  his  hands  as  if  to  say,  no  thanks. 

                                 LIZ
                        He  hasn’t  had  enough  to  drink  yet.

                                 RASHON
                        White  folks  love  to  get  drunk 
                        before  they  dance.  That  way  y’all 
                        have  an  excuse  when  you’re  off 
                        rhythm. 

                                 LIZ
                        Not  me.  I  never  miss  an 
                        opportunity  to  shake  what  my  mama 
                        gave  me.

           Liz  and  Kim  sandwich  Rashon.  They  all  dance. 

           Noah  picks  up  a  random  drink  from  the  table  and  pounds 
           it.  He  picks  up  another  and  does  it  again. 

           INT.  SUGAR’S  BAR  -  LATER

           Noah  stumbles  a  bit  en  route  to  the  bar.  He  rests  his  arm  
           atop  the  bar  and  leans  his  head  against  his  fist.  An 
           attractive  black  female  bartender  approaches  him.

                                 NOAH
                        Gimme  a,  uh...

                        Amstel  Light? 

                                 NOAH
                        Actually,  yeah.  How’d  you  know?

           She  serves  him  an  Amstel.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Racial  profiling.

                        What?

                                 BARTENDER
                        Look  around,  there  are  only  a 
                        handful  of  white  people  up  in 
                        here...

           Noah  scans  the  bar.  In  a  sea  of  black  he  spots  several 
           white  faces,  each  one  with  an  Amstel  Light  pressed  to 
           their  lips. 

           Noah  cringes.

                        predictable?

                                 BARTENDER
                        Pretty  much.  I  mean,  every  karaoke 
                        night  we  get  a  few  white  folks 
                        looking  for  their  adventurous 
                        night  out  to  tell  their  friends 
                        about.  They  mostly  just  stand  on 
                        the  sidelines,  sipping  their 
                        Amstels,  but  hey,  we’re  happy  to 
                        take  their  six  bucks  a  bottle. 

           She  looks  at  the  Amstel  Light  in  Noah’s  hand. 

                                 BARTENDER  (CONT’D)
                        That’ll  be  six  bucks.

           Noah  thinks  about  it.

                                 NOAH
                        You  know  what?  Screw  this.  Give  me 
                        the  blackest  drink  you  have.

                                 BARTENDER
                        The  blackest?

           Noah  nods  and  the  bartender  replaces  his  Amstel  with  a 
           Heineken.

                                 NOAH
                        Really?  Heineken? 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Yup.  Black  people  love  Heineken. 
                        It’s  our  champagne  of  beers.

           INT.  SUGAR’S  BAR  -  LATER

           Noah  returns  to  the  table  with  two  Heinekens.  Liz  stands 
           there  by  herself.

                                 NOAH
                        Where  are  Rashon  and  Kim?

                        hate  Heineken.  It’s  too  dark.

           This  triggers  something  in  Noah.  He  sets  the  beers  down 
           and  marches  towards  the  stage.

                                 LIZ  (CONT’D)

           Kim  and  Rashon  are  on  stage  singing  Nelly  and  Kelly’s 
           ‘DILEMMA.’  Rashon  wears  a  BAND-AID  on  his  face  a  la 
           Nelly.  They’re  almost  too  cute  as  they  sing  the  duet.

                        think  about  is  you.  Even  when...

           Noah  jumps  up  on  stage  interrupting  Kim.  He’s  drunk.

                                 RASHON
                        What  are  you  doing?

                        whatever.

           The  music  stops  and  the  crowd  starts  BOOING.

                                 RASHON
                        What’s  wrong  with  you?

                                 NOAH
                        I’m  fine.  I  just  want  to  do  a

                                 RASHON
                        Ok.  It’s  your  funeral.

           Rashon  hands  Noah  the  microphone.  Noah  walks  to  the  side 
           of  the  stage  and  whispers  something  to  Chuck  Snuggles.

           Rashon  and  Kim  step  off  the  stage  and  watch  on  from  the 
           front  row.  Liz  joins  them.  She  grabs  a  shot  from  the  tray 
           of  a  passing  cocktail  waitress  and  slams  it.

           Noah  stands  alone  on  stage,  staring  out  at  his  restless 
           audience.  The  faces  in  the  crowd  look  back  at  him 
           disapprovingly.

                        bay-bee,  uh.

           A  subtle  MURMUR  of  slight  approval  begins  in  the  crowd. 
           Rashon  and  Darrell  nod  their  heads  along  with  the  beat.

           On  stage  Noah  begins  to  strut  around  with  growing

           Noah’s  increased  confidence  on  stage  has  won  over  the 
           crowd.  Everybody  dances  as  vigorously  as  they  have  all 
           night. 

           Loving  every  second  of  it,  MC  Chuck  Snuggles  pumps  his 
           arm  up  and  down  as  the  crowd  and  the  beat  undulate. 

           Noah’s  really  feeling  it  now.  He  moves  to  the  front  of 
           the  stage  to  further  engage  the  audience.

           From  the  crowd  a  HERCULEAN  BLACK  GUY  (HBG)  gets  up  on 
           stage  and  gets  up  in  Noah’s  grill.

           HBG.

           As  Rashon  turns  to  respond  to  Noah,  HBG  decks  Rashon  with 
           a  ferocious  punch.

           And  Noah  punches  HBG  in  the  face  with  all  his  might,  but 
           HBG  doesn’t  even  budge.  It’s  as  if  Noah  didn’t  touch  him.

                                 HERCULEAN  BLACK  GUY
                        You  really  shouldn’a  did  that.

           Noah-  black  eye,  busted-lip,  bloody  nose  and  all-  sits 
           across  from  Rashon.  Liz  sleeps  on  his  shoulder.  An 
           impressive  collection  of  empty  pint  glasses  litter  the

                        I  was  just  trying  to  save  your 
                        dumb  ass. 

           Noah  shakes  his  head  and  chuckles.

                                 NOAH
                        How  could  they  think  I’m  a  racist? 
                        I’m  Jewish.  I’m  a  minority  too.

                                 RASHON
                        How  was  the  crowd  supposed  to  know 
                        you  were  Jewish?

           Liz  lifts  her  head  up  grogily  and  without  opening  her 
           eyes--

                                 LIZ
                        Cause  of  his  little  dick. 

           Amused  at  herself,  Liz  smiles,  drops  her  head  and  begins 
           SNORING. 

                                 NOAH
                        Ignore  her,  she’s  totally 
                        hammered.

           Rashon  grins.

                                 RASHON
                        Don’t  worry,  Kim’s  the  same  way 
                        when  she’s  wasted:  brutally 
                        honest. 

           Noah  raises  his  glass  to  toast  Rashon’s  zinger.  They 
           knock  glasses  and  spill  beer  all  over  the  table. 

                                 NOAH
                        All  I’m  saying  is,  Jews  and 
                        Blacks,  we’ve  both  had  it  pretty 
                        rough. 

                                 RASHON
                        I  gotta  be  honest  with  you,  I 
                        don’t  really  feel  comfortable  with 
                        you  lumping  Jews  and  Blacks 
                        together...

                        No,  I  just  meant...

                                 RASHON
                        Because  realistically,  Jews  have 
                        had  it  way  worse. 

           Noah  emphatically  SLAMS  the  table  with  both  palms.

                        That’s  preposterous.

           Rashon  lifts  his  beer  to  take  a  sip,  but  can’t.

                        You  guys  ok?  Can  I  get  you  another

           The  waitress  walks  away.  Noah  stares  at  Rashon.  They’re 
           both  clearly  drunk.

                                 RASHON

                        It  appears  I  am.

                        were  horrible. 

           Rashon  takes  a  swig  of  beer.

                        Before  you,  I  hated  white  people.

           Noah,  mid-sip,  lets  his  mouthful  of  beer  fall  gently  back 
           into  his  glass,  in  order  to  respond.

                        No  what’s  not  cool  is  how  white 
                        people  always  use  black  people. 
                        Antoine’s  mom  is  white.  We  were 
                        supposed  to  spend  our  life 
                        together,  but  she  was  only  with  me 
                        to  piss  off  her  parents.

                        by  a  nappy-headed  bro.

                        might  just  restore  my  faith.

           Even  through  Noah’s  drunkenness,  this  makes  him 
           uncomfortable.  He  smiles  weakly,  nods  and  raises  his 
           beer.

           Noah  sits  at  his  desk  examining  his  appearance  through 
           his  computer’s  built  in  camera.  He  applies  the  finishing 
           touches  to  the  Bin  Laden-like  fake  beard  on  his  face  and 
           stands  up.

           Pete  enters  the  office.

           MONTAGE  SET  TO  MICHAEL  JACKSON’S  ‘BLACK  OR  WHITE’

           Noah,  in  Bin  Ladin  beard,  and  Rashon  dine  at  a  festive 
           GREEK  RESTAURANT.  The  waiter  brings  out  a  plate  of 
           flaming  cheese.  Rashon  and  Noah  are  delighted. 

           A  beautiful  summer  day  at  a  bustling,  outdoor,  public 
           pool  in  Harlem.  Throngs  of  happy  black  families  hang  out 
           in  and  around  the  wading  pool.  Noah  stands  in  the  water 
           and  liberally  applies  sunscreen  to  his  face.  He  offers 
           some  to  Rashon  who  declines  with  a  laugh.  Next  to  them, 
           Micah  and  Antoine  splash  each  other  playfully. 

           Central  Park.  Noah  teaches  Rashon  how  to  throw  a  frisbee.

           Rashon  and  Noah  watch  tv  in  Noah’s  living  room.  On 
           screen,  host  Seth  Rogen  signs  off  as  the  credits  roll  on 
           ‘SATURDAY  NIGHT  LIVE.’  Noah  turns  off  the  TV.  Rashon 
           looks  at  Noah  like  he’s  crazy,  snatches  the  remote  from 
           him,  and  turns  the  TV  back  on.  The  opening  credits  of 
           ‘SHOWTIME  AT  THE  APOLLO’  play.  Rashon  nods  his  head  to 
           the  theme  song.

           A  gorgeous  summer  afternoon  at  the  beach.  Noah  carries 
           Micah  into  the  ocean.  Rashon  and  Antoine  look  on  from  the 
           shore.  Noah  turns  and  invites  them  into  the  water  with  a 
           wave.  A  visibly  nervous  Rashon  politely  declines.  

           Noah  films  his  TV  segment  from  Rashon’s  store  Caffeine 
           Computer  Fix:  picture  Starbucks  meets  the  Apple  Genius 
           Bar.  Noah  bites  into  a  scone.  From  behind  the  counter 
           Rashon  gives  a  thumbs  up  to  the  camera. 

           ‘BLACK  OR  WHITE’  starts  to  fade  out  as  Noah  and  Rashon 
           leave  the  store  and  walk  down  the  street  together.

                        Our  neighbors?  Why?

                                 NOAH
                        I  ran  into  them  earlier  and 
                        invited  them  to  stop  by  for 
                        dinner.

           Noah  removes  some  plates  from  the  cupboard.  Liz  paces 
           angrily.

                                 LIZ
                        Why  the  hell  are  they  here?

                        Shhh!  They  might  hear  you.

                                 LIZ
                        So  what?  I  don’t  care  about  them. 
                        Which  is  why  I  don’t  understand 
                        what  they’re  doing  in  our  dining 
                        room.

                                 NOAH
                        I  thought  it  would  be  nice.

                                 LIZ
                        But  we’ve  been  happily  ignoring 
                        our  neighbors  for  years.  Who’s 
                        Sunday  Style  section  am  I  gonna 
                        steal  now?  I  can’t  rob  ‘em  if  I 
                        know  ‘em.  You’re  ruining 
                        everything.

                                 NOAH 
                        Well,  Rashon’s  so  friendly  with 
                        all  his  neighbors.  They’re  always 
                        stopping  by  to  borrow  milk  and 
                        stuff.  It’s  a  nice  sense  of 
                        community.

           EARL  SNYDER,  the  elderly  neighbor,  sticks  his  head  into 
           the  kitchen.

                        It’s  the  thought  that  counts.

           Liz  GRUNTS  with  frustration  and  storms  out.

           Conference  room.  Noah,  Deb,  and  Ed  sit  around  the  table 
           silently  typing  away  at  their  laptops.  Frank,  also  at  the

                        It’s  not  impressive.

           Frank  rubs  his  fingers  over  a  RED  STARBURST.

                        sense  of  touch.

           EXT.  NURSERY  SCHOOL,  PLAYGROUND  -  DAY

           A  handful  of  children  horse  around  on  a  jungle  gym  next 
           to  the  school. 

           Rashon  enters  the  playground  and  spots  Antoine  and  Micah 
           hanging  upsidedown  from  the  monkey  bars.  Rashon  playfully 
           grabs  them  and  carries  them  off  towards  the  street,  one 
           in  each  arm.  They  squirm  as  he  tickles  them. 

           Suddenly,  a  loud  whistle  BLOWS  repeatedly.

           A  black  SECURITY  GUARD  sprints  towards  Rashon,  whistle  in 
           mouth,  a  look  of  violent  determination  on  his  face.

                                 SECURITY  GUARD
                                 (screaming  and 
                                 running)
                        Amber  Alert!  Amber  Alert!  Amber 
                        Alert!  Amber  Alert!

           Rashon  sets  the  kids  down  and  turns  just  as  the  Security 
           Guard  barrels  into  him,  slamming  him  to  the  concrete.

           Mrs.  Yates  rushes  over  to  Rashon,  who  is  pinned  to  the 
           ground.

                                 MRS.  YATES
                        What’s  going  on  here?!

                                 SECURITY  GUARD
                        This  man  was  trying  to  abduct 
                        these  boys.

                                 MRS.  YATES
                        This  is  Mr.  Davis.

                        And  he’s  on  Micah’s  pick-up  list.

           The  Security  Guard  helps  Rashon  to  his  feet.

                                 SECURITY  GUARD

                        I  do  now.

           The  Security  Guard  nods  and  returns  to  his  post.

                                 MRS.  YATES
                        I’m  really  sorry  about  that,  Mr.

                        Excuse  me.

           Mrs.  Yates  runs  off.

                                 PETE  (O.C.)
                        So  you  made  Micah’s  pick-up  list? 

           Rashon  turns  to  see  Pete  standing  behind  him.

                                 PETE  (CONT’D)
                        That’s  pretty  legit.  I  guess 
                        Noah’s  mission  is  complete.

                                 RASHON
                        Huh?  What  are  you  talking  about? 

                                 PETE
                        Forget  it.  Ready  to  go,  Micah?

           Micah  isn’t  paying  attention.  He  and  Antoine  play  with 
           pebbles  on  the  ground.

                                 RASHON
                        Wait.  Noah  asked  me  to  pick  up 
                        Micah.

                        Ok.  Maybe  we  should  call  Noah  to 
                        sort  this  out.  Just  to  be  safe.

                                 NOAH
                        Stripes  are  no  good  on  camera. 

                                 RASHON
                        Remind  me  why  you’re  not  doing 
                        this  with  your  fashion  designer 
                        wife  again?

                                 NOAH
                        She’s  great,  but  she  dresses  me 
                        too  conservatively.  I  need  every 
                        detail  of  this  pilot  to  be  fresh, 
                        including  my  outfit. 

                                 RASHON
                        Alright  then,  let’s  make  it  fresh. 

           INT.  BARNEY’S,  FITTING  ROOM  -  LATER

           Rashon  sits  on  a  leather  couch  outside  of  a  changing 
           stall.  Noah  emerges  from  the  stall  wearing  a  crisp  white 
           shirt  tucked  into  a  pair  of  khakis.  He  struts  toward 
           Rashon  holding  his  arms  out  proudly.

                                 NOAH
                        So?

                                 RASHON
                        Liz  dresses  you  more 
                        conservatively  than  that?

                        is  a  slim-fitting  shirt.  It’s  hip.

                                 RASHON
                        You  look  like  a  Docker’s  model.

                                 NOAH
                        Thanks.

                                 RASHON
                        Wasn’t  a  compliment.

           INT.  BARNEY’S,  FITTING  ROOM  -  LATER

           Rashon  remains  on  the  couch.  Noah  exits  the  changing 
           stall  this  time  donning  a  broad-shouldered,  4-button, 
           mustard-colored  suit.  Rashon  stands  up.

                                 RASHON
                        Now  that’s  what  I’m  talking  about!

                                 NOAH
                        I  look  like  Steve  Harvey.

           Rashon  gives  him  a  once  over.

                                 RASHON
                        Yeah,  you’re  right.  You  do  look 
                        kinda  ridiculous. 
                                 (beat)
                        I’ve  got  another  idea.

           INT.  BARNEY’S,  FITTING  ROOM  -  LATER

           Noah  walks  out  of  his  changing  stall  sporting  some 
           flattering  charcoal  slacks,  converse  sneakers  and  a 
           bright  purple  crew-neck  sweater.  Noah  looks  sharp. 

           Rashon  takes  in  the  outfit.

                                 RASHON
                        Hmmmmm.

                                 NOAH
                        Sweater  is  a  bit  much,  right?

                                 RASHON
                        Gimme  a  second. 

           Rashon  walks  out  of  the  fitting  room.  Noah  stands  and 
           checks  himself  out  in  the  mirror  in  various  poses.  Rashon 
           re-enters  holding  a  scarf.  He  hands  it  to  Noah.

                                 NOAH
                        I  can’t  wear  this,  it’s  way  too 
                        warm  out.

                        I  think  it’ll  work. 

           Noah  puts  the  scarf  on.  Rashon  CLAPS  it  up.

                                 RASHON  (CONT’D)
                        That’s  it.  That’s  your  outfit.

                                 NOAH
                        Why  would  I  buy  this?  I  can’t  pull 
                        it  off.  I  look  stupid. 

                                 RASHON
                        Trust  me,  it’s  fresh.  Just  wear  it 
                        with  confidence.

           Rashon  puts  his  hand  on  Noah’s  shoulder.

                                 RASHON
                        Noah...you  got  to  own it to own 
                        it. 

           Noah  looks  at  himself  in  the  mirror  with  a  self-assured 
           posture.

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah?

                                 RASHON
                        Yeah.

           INT.  14TH  STREET  Y,  BASKETBALL  COURT  -  DAY

           Noah’s  “white”  basketball  game.  Players  shoot  around  on 
           the  court. 

           Noah  enters  the  gym  wearing  shorts,  a  tee  shirt,  and  his 
           summer  scarf.  He  sets  his  bag  down  on  the  sideline.  Pete 
           walks  over.

                                 PETE
                        Nice  of  you  to  show  up.

                        does  it  make  me  an  asshole  because 
                        I’m  doing  something  different? 
                        Sorry  I’m  not  conforming  to  your 
                        narrow  view  of  what’s  acceptable.

                                 PETE
                        You  need  to  calm  down  and  get  off 
                        your  damn  high  horse. 

           The  other  guys  in  the  gym  become  aware  of  the  escalating 
           tension  between  Noah  and  Pete.  They  stop  shooting  around 
           to  observe.

                                 PETE  (CONT’D)
                        I’m  just  busting  your  balls.

                        it  being  insecure  and  judgemental.

                                 PETE
                        The  hell  is  your  problem,  dude?

                        here. 

           Noah  picks  up  his  bag  and  heads  towards  the  door. 

                                 PETE
                        Don’t  be  a  dick.  You’re  leaving  us 
                        one  short.

                        Fuck  off.

           Almost  at  the  exit,  Noah  stops.

                                 (yelling)
                        Why  don’t  you  ask  him? 

           Noah  gestures  to  the  adjacent  court  where  a  guy  in  a 
           wheelchair  is  shooting  baskets.

           Noah  leaves.

           EXT.  14TH  STREET  Y,  BASKETBALL  COURT  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Noah  walks  out  of  the  building  and  onto  the  sidewalk.  He 
           pauses  and  looks  back,  clearly  conflicted.  He  heads  back 
           towards  the  gym  when  --  his  phone  RINGS.  He  stops  and 
           answers.

                                 NOAH

                        That’s  great...  Oh...  Right  now?

           Noah  thinks  for  a  second  then  turns  back  towards  the 
           street.

                                 NOAH  (CONT’D)
                        ...Sure.  I  got  nothing  going  on...

           INT.  CASTRO  PUB  -  DAY

           Noah  walks  into  the  cozy  confines  of  a  restaurant.  The 
           place  oozes  charm.  Immediately,  Noah  is  overcome  by  the 
           heavenly  aroma  that  fills  the  place.  An  elderly  LATINA 
           WOMAN  walks  by  carrying  three  steaming  plates  of 
           beautifully  presented,  mouth-watering  entrees.  

           Noah  spots  Rashon  seated  at  the  bar  and  walks  over.

                                 NOAH
                        Hey.

           Rashon  turns  around.

                        about  it  earlier.  If  you  like 
                        Cuban,  I  think  it  could  be  perfect 
                        for  the  pilot.

                        Anyway...  this  is  Kim’s  favorite 
                        place.  The  owner  loves  her  like  a 
                        daughter.  It’s  only  been  around  a 
                        couple  of  years.  Great  food,  good 
                        scene  but  still  under  the  radar.

                                 NOAH

                        marry  that  beautiful  mamacita.

                        Adios,  Flor. 

           Rashon  heads  for  the  door.  Noah  heads  after  him,  catching 
           him  just  before  he  leaves.

                        So  Kim  told  Liz  that  you  guys 
                        aren’t  going  to  Atlanta  for  the 
                        4th  anymore.

                        Yeah.  Her  brother  had  to  go  to 
                        L.A.  for  work.

                                 NOAH
                        Well  Liz  and  I  would  love  for  all 
                        of  you  to  join  us  at  her  parents.

                                 RASHON
                        That’s  ok.  We  wouldn’t  want  to 
                        impose.

                                 NOAH
                        I  insist.  Besides  I  could  use  some 
                        more  allies  up  there.  Her  parents 
                        are  unbearable.

           EXT.  EDELSTIEN  HOUSE  -  DAY

           A  gigantic  Connecticut  home  with  perfectly  manicured 
           lawns,  a  large  pool  and  tennis  court  sit  just  off  placid 
           Long  Island  Sound.

           Noah  and  Micah  splash  around  in  the  pool.  Liz  and  her 
           mother,  SHERI,  sunbathe  while  watching  Jason. 

           Liz’s  father,  WALT,  lines  up  a  shot  on  the  nearby  putting 
           green.  He’s  mid  back  swing  when  ---

           The  doorbell  RINGS. 

           Walt  shanks  his  putt.

           Walt  opens  the  front  door  to  reveal  Noah,  Kim,  and

           Rashon  and  Kim  look  at  each  other,  not  sure  what  to  do.

                                 RASHON
                        I’m  Rashon  and  this  is  Kim  and

                        told  you  we  were  coming.

                        We’re  doing  it  for  Noah.  He  warned 
                        us.

           Rashon  takes  a  deep  breath.

           EXT.  EDELSTIEN  HOUSE  -  LATER

           The  tennis  court.  Noah  and  Kim  play  doubles  against 
           Rashon  and  Liz.  Walt  smokes  a  cigar  and  watches  from  the 
           sideline.

           Liz  hits  a  backhand  winner.

                                 WALT

                        you  that  backhand?

           Liz  smiles  and  points  at  her  dad.

           Noah  serves  a  near  ace,  but  Rashon  makes  a  spectacular 
           running  return  for  a  winner.

                                 WALT  (CONT’D)

           EXT.  EDELSTIEN  HOUSE  -  EVENING

           The  back  porch.  The  whole  family  congregates  for  a 
           barbecue.  Noah  and  Rashon  man  the  grill.  Noah  flips  some 
           meat.

           Noah  shakes  his  head  and  pours  some  beer  over  the  meat.

                        Sorry  about  Walt.  I  know  I  warned

                        ‘behind  the  times  racist’  than 
                        ‘full  of  hate  racist.’

           A  glass  CLINKS  several  times.

           Walt  bangs  a  knife  against  his  high  ball  of  scotch.

                        I  just  wanted  to  thank  everyone 
                        for  making  it  to  our  4th  of  July 
                        celebration.  Lizzie,  we  love 
                        seeing  you  and  our  beautiful  grand 
                        kids.  It’s  nice  to  meet  your 
                        lovely  new  friends.  We’re  always 
                        pleased  to  open  our  home  to  all 
                        sorts  of  people.  And  Noah...  it 
                        appears  you’re  still  part  of  the 
                        family.

           Noah  fake  smiles.

           As  Walt’s  SPEECH  drags  on,  Liz  pulls  her  mother  aside. 

                                 LIZ

                        It’s  ok,  honey,  that’s  only  his 
                        fourth  drink.

                                 LIZ
                        That’s  not  ok.  But  I’m  not  even 
                        talking  about  his  drinking.  He’s 
                        offended  our  guests  numerous 
                        times.  He’s  acting  like  he’s  never 
                        been  around  black  people. 

                                 SHERI
                        Well,  not  socially-  but  don’t  you 
                        worry.  I’ll  take  care  of  it.

           Sheri  walks  right  up  to  Kim  and  puts  her  arm  around  her. 
           Liz  can  barely  watch.

           Walt’s  speech  winds  down.

           Sheri  squeezes  Kim  affectionately,  and  then  winks  at  her 
           daughter. 

           Liz  dies  inside  as  Kim  awkwardly  nuzzles  up  to  Sheri.

           INT.  NOAH  AND  LIZ’S  CAR  -  NIGHT

           Micah  sits  in  the  back  seat  and  picks  his  nose.  He  offers 
           the  booger  to  Jason  who  doesn’t  respond.  Micah  eats  the 
           booger  himself.

           Noah  drives,  looking  straight  ahead.  Liz  sits  stiffly. 
           There’s  palpable  tension.

                                 NOAH
                        I  don’t  think  it’s  good  for  Micah

                        alone  white.  It’s  just  ignorance. 
                        But  hey,  at  least  my  mom  gave  a 
                        shout  out  to  Barack.

           Noah  gets  off  the  bed.  Stands  up.

                        for  you,  Lizzie.  Mentioning  our 
                        president’s  name  does  not  excuse 
                        their  behavior.

                                 LIZ
                        Of  course  not.  I  was  just  kidding.

                        Were  you  really  though?  The  fact 
                        that  those  people  raised  you  must 
                        have  rubbed  off  on  you  a  little.  I 
                        mean  you’re  constantly  complaining 
                        about  me  spending  time  with 
                        Rashon.  Why  is  that,  Liz?

                                 LIZ
                        I’m  not  even  dignifying  that  with 
                        a  response.

                                 NOAH
                        What?  Did  I  strike  a  nerve?  Kind 
                        of  like  Micah’s  teacher  did? 

           Liz’s  frustration  mounts.

                                 LIZ
                        Do  you  even  hear  yourself  right 
                        now?  Because  you  sound  a  lot  like 
                        a  dick.

                                 NOAH
                        You’re  awfully  defensive.

           Liz  throws  a  shirt  to  the  ground.

                        You’re  damn  right  I  am.  See,  I 
                        don’t  give  a  shit  who  you  spend 
                        time  with.  But  I  do  give  a  shit 
                        when  you  start  neglecting  your 
                        family.  And  you’re  accusing  me  of 
                        being  racist  for  that?

                        No,  your  parents  are  the  racists. 
                        You’re  just  disturbingly  content 
                        with  your  homogeneous  existence.

           Liz  walks  to  the  door  and  swings  it  open.

           Noah  walks  out  of  the  room.  Liz  SLAMS  the  door  shut. 

           EXT.  NOAH’S  APARTMENT  BUILDING  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Ray  the  doorman  stands  under  the  awning,  smoking  a 
           cigarette.  Noah  storms  out  of  the  building,  nearly 
           knocking  over  Ray.

                                 RAY
                        Damn,  son!  You  look  mad  heated.

                        I’ll  live.

           INT.  DEWEY’S  PUB  -  NIGHT

           Noah  sits  alone  at  the  bar  and  guzzles  a  Heineken.  He 
           sets  the  empty  bottle  down  and  peels  off  the  label.

           On  the  bar,  his  blackberry  vibrates.  He  checks  a  text.  It 
           reads:

           Party @  Darrell’s. You  should come. Tell Liz  we’re          
           dancing.

           INT.  DARRELL’S  APARTMENT,  HALLWAY  -  NIGHT

           Noah  walks  down  the  hallway  with  one  Heineken  party  keg 
           in  his  left  hand  and  another  balanced  on  his  right 
           shoulder.  As  he  drunkenly  zig  zags  down  the  hallway  he 
           sips  from  the  open  tap.

           Noah  stops  in  front  of  an  apartment,  looks  at  the  door 
           and  realizes  he  has  no  free  hand  to  knock.  Naturally,  he 
           knocks  with  his  head  instead.

           An  OLDER  BLACK  MAN  opens  the  door.  Noah  hands  him  the 
           unopened  party  keg. 

                                 NOAH
                        Here  you  go,  man.  It’s  party  time!

           The  Older  Black  Man  takes  the  keg  and  studies  it.

                        Yo,  Noah.  Down  here.

           Noah  turns  to  see  Darrell  down  the  hall,  waving  Noah 
           towards  his  apartment.  Noah  looks  back  to  the  Older  Man.

                                 OLDER  BLACK  MAN
                        Well  thank  you  very  much.

           He  shuts  the  door  in  Noah’s  face. 

           INT.  DARRELL’S  APARTMENT  -  MOMENTS  LATER

           Darrell  leads  Noah  into  the  party  where  cool  thirty-
           somethings  mingle,  drink,  dance  and  lounge.   Noah  surveys 
           the  scene,  doesn’t  see  Rashon  and  shrugs  his  shoulders. 
           He  lifts  his  party  keg  above  his  head  and  starts  drinking 
           from  it  again.

           Rashon  taps  Noah  on  the  shoulder  from  behind.  Noah 
           swivels  around,  while  still  drinking  from  the  keg.

                                 RASHON
                                 (teasing)
                        What?  You  don’t  think  black  people 
                        can  afford  cups  at  their  parties? 

           Noah  stops  drinking.

                                 NOAH
                        No  man,  you’re  finishing  this  keg 
                        with  me  tonight.  Just  us  two.

                                 RASHON
                                 (hesitant)
                        OK...  you  alright,  buddy?  Where’s

                        You  wanna  talk  about  it?

           Noah,  now  drinking  from  the  keg  again,  shakes  his  head 
           no.  As  he  does,  beer  pours  all  over  his  face.

           Rashon  takes  the  keg  from  him.

                                 RASHON  (CONT’D)
                        You  better  let  me  have  this.
           INT.  DARRELL’S  APARTMENT  -  LATER

           Rashon  and  Noah  sit  on  a  couch  passing  the  keg  back  and 
           forth.  Noah  stares  at  all  the  people  dancing  in  front  of 
           them.

                                 NOAH
                        This  is  awesome.  Nobody  ever

                        to.  Everybody’s  too  uptight.  

                                 RASHON
                        I  seem  to  recall  you  not  dancing 
                        at  karaoke?

                        I’m  different  now.  I’ve  seen  the 
                        light.

           Rashon  looks  at  Noah’s  half-open  drunken  eyes.

                                 RASHON
                        I’m  not  sure  you  can  see  anything 
                        right  now.

           Noah  spots  a  smoking  hot,  scantily  clad  black  woman 
           dancing.  This  is  PAM.  Noah  stares. 

                                 NOAH
                        I  see  that  Aphrodite  Tighty.

                        I  don’t  know  what  that  means,  but 
                        that  girl  is  crazy.

                        a  Ludacris  video.  You  know  her?

                                 RASHON
                        I  hooked  up  with  her  for  a  minute 
                        right  before  I  met  Kim.

                        You’re  on  your  own  there.  I’d

           They  see  Noah,  sloppily  grinding  Pam  on  the  dance  floor.

           On  the  dance  floor,  Pam  bends  over  and  shakes  her  ass  in 
           Noah’s  crotch.

                        I  want  to  do?  First  Liz,  now  you. 
                        You’re  supposed  to  be  my  real 
                        friend.

                        I  wish  I  never  found  you.

           Rashon  reaches  for  Noah’s  arm  again,  but  pauses.

                                 RASHON
                        What  do  you  mean  found  me?

           Noah  drunkenly  wobbles.

                        Big  whoop.  I  was  looking  for  a 
                        black  friend...  y’know  what  forget 
                        it,  it’s  done  now.

           The  wheels  are  turning  in  Rashon’s  mind. 

                                 RASHON
                        You  were  looking  for  a  black 
                        friend?
                                 (realizing)
                        So  that’s  what  Pete  meant...

                        I’m  some  sort  of  quota  to  you?

                                 RASHON
                        Exactly  what  the  fuck  is  it  like

                        not? 

           Kim  moves  to  the  front  of  the  crowd  that  has  gathered 
           around  this  confrontation. 

                                 NOAH
                        It’s  not  that  simple. 

                                 RASHON
                        Well  it  is  to  me.

           Rashon  shoves  Noah  in  the  chest. 

                                 RASHON  (CONT’D)
                        Get  the  hell  out  of  here!

           Noah  wants  to  explain,  but  under  the  glare  of  the 
           disapproving  room  he’s  at  a  loss.  He  lowers  his  head  and 
           makes  his  way  out. 

           Kim  steps  up  to  Rashon. 

                                 KIM
                        What  just  happened?  Was  that  about 
                        her?

                        It  had  nothing  to  do  with  her.

           Rashon  shakes  his  head.

                                 RASHON
                        Forget  it.  It’s  too  complicated. 
                        Let’s  just  go.

           INT.  PETE’S  APARTMENT  BUILDING,  HALLWAY  -  NIGHT

           Noah  stares  at  the  door  in  front  of  him,  takes  a  deep 
           breath  and  knocks. 

           No  answer.

           Noah  knocks  again.

                        This  better  be  good.

           Pete  opens  the  door,  wearing  nothing  but  tighty-whities. 
           He  notices  Noah’s  rough  condition.

           INT.  PETE’S  APARTMENT  -  CONTINUOUS

           Pete  and  Noah  enter  the  living  room. 

                                 PETE
                        Just  gimme  a  second.

           Pete  heads  for  the  bedroom.  Noah  sits  on  the  couch. 

           Within  seconds,  wild  MOANS  of  passionate  lovemaking  fill 
           the  apartment.  Noah  grabs  a  magazine  from  the  coffee 
           table  and  leafs  through  it,  trying  to  distract  himself.

           A  final  masculine  GRUNT  reverberates  off  the  walls. 
           Immediately,  a  cute  BLONDE  GIRL  emerges  from  Pete’s 
           bedroom,  adjusting  her  clothes.  Pete  follows  her  out, 
           still  sporting  only  underwear. 

                                 BLONDE  GIRL

                        G’night. 

           She  turns,  pecks  Pete  on  the  cheek  and  lets  herself  out. 
           Pete  takes  a  seat  next  to  Noah  on  the  couch.  Noah  scoots 
           away  from  Pete’s  hairy,  almost  entirely  naked  body. 

                                 PETE
                        So  what’s  up?  You  look  upset. 
                        Someone  steal  your  scarf?

           Noah  smiles.

                        I  owe  you  an  apology.  I  got  way 
                        too  angry  over  a  fashion

           Pete  stands  up  and  paces,  deep  in  thought.  He  stops. 

                                 PETE
                        Put  it  like  this.  You’re  a 
                        basketball  player,  right?  What  do 
                        all  great  players  have  in  common?

                        No,  well  yes,  but  that’s  not  the 
                        point.  They  all  have  great 
                        fundamentals.  But  the  legends 
                        don’t  stop  there.  Magic  had  his  no 
                        look  passes,  Jordan  incorporated 
                        his  fade-away.  And  those  things 
                        elevated  their  games  to  the  next 
                        level.  But  do  you  think  at  any 
                        point,  they  said,  “hey  I’ve  got 
                        this  great  new  fade-away  now,  so 
                        guess  what,  fuck  you 
                        fundamentals!”?

           Noah  mulls  this  over.

                        I  feel  like  an  asshole.

                                 (singing)

                        sunshine.  Good  day  sunshine.

           Liz  rolls  over  and  slowly  opens  her  eyes.  She  hears  Noah 
           singing  The  Beatles  hit  ‘GOOD  DAY  SUNNSHINE’  and  looks 
           confused.  She  then  hones  in  on  the  baby  monitor.

                        laugh  about.

           Liz  gets  out  of  bed  and  picks  up  the  baby  monitor.   The 
           SINGING  continues  as  she  exits  the  room.

           As  Liz  walks  down  the  hallway  she  not  only  hears  the 
           music  from  the  monitor,  she  begins  to  hear  the  faint 
           sounds  of  its  source  as  well. 

           Liz  nears  the  door  to  the  boy’s  room,  behind  which  the 
           music  is  clearly  emanating.

           She  opens  the  door.

           INT.  NOAH’S  APARTMENT,  MICAH  &  JASON’S  ROOM  -  CONTINUOUS

           Liz  enters  to  see  --

           Noah,  Micah,  and  Jason  all  dressed  in  colorful  Sgt. 
           Pepper  Beatle’s  outfits,  complete  with  mop-top  wigs. 
           Micah  “strums”  his  ‘Guitar  Hero’  guitar.  Jason,  in  his 
           high  chair,  shakes  a  mini-tambourine.  Noah  stands 
           centered  and  plays  the  guitar. 

                                 NOAH
                                 (singing)
                        She  feels  good,  she  know  she's 
                        looking  fine.  I'm  so  proud  to  know 
                        that  she  is  mine.

           Noah  smiles  at  Liz.

                                 NOAH  AND  MICAH

                        day  sunshine.

           Noah  finishes  the  song  with  one  final  strum.

                                 NOAH
                        Bring  it  home  boys.

           Micah  jams  Hendrix  style  on  his  fake  guitar  and  Jason 
           happily  bangs  his  tambourine.

           Liz  CLAPS.

                        You  could  say  that.

           Noah  sets  his  guitar  down,  walks  up  to  Liz,  and  takes  her 
           hands.

                        It’s  a  cheap  move  using  the  kids.

           Micah  eats  pancakes  at  the  table.  Jason  mashes  food  with

                        into  the  whole  marriage  issue 
                        and...  they  broke  up. 

           Shaken  by  the  news,  Noah  is  non-responsive.

           Noah  enters  through  the  front  door.  He  walks  towards  the 
           back,  past  the  couches  filled  with  latte  drinking 
           customers.

           Rashon  stands  behind  the  counter  helping  a  middle-aged 
           WHITE  WOMAN  with  her  IPOD  SHUFFLE.  Noah  walks  up  behind 
           her.  Rashon  notices  him.

                        it  on  here.

           Noah  grows  impatient  and  walks  in  front  of  her.

                        This  is  unacceptable.

           Noah  whips  around  and  faces  the  woman.  He  points  to  her 
           iPod.

           and  stomps  on  it.  He  pulls  a  100  dollar  bill  out  of  his

                        I  said  get  back  to  work,  fool. 

           Darrell  nods  to  Noah  and  walks  off. 

           INT.  ESSEX  ALE  HOUSE  -  NIGHT

           Rashon  and  Noah  sit  across  from  each  other  in  the  same 
           booth  as  last  time.  Rashon  thoughtfully  sips  his  beer 
           then  puts  it  down.

                                 RASHON
                        Whatever  it  is,  it’s  gotta  be 
                        spectacular.

                                 (agreeing)
                        Totally  unprecedented.

           They  each  take  another  slow  sip  of  beer,  and  set  their 
           glasses  down  simultaneously. 

                                   NOAH  (CONT’D)
                        Because  she’s  really  mad.

                                 (agreeing)
                        Like,  really,  really  mad. 

           They  go  back  to  their  beers  once  more. 

                                 NOAH
                        I  think  I  got  it.

                                 (hopeful)
                        You  think  you  got  it? 

           Noah  thinks  it  over  for  another  second.

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah,  I  got  it.
           EXT.  CASTRO  PUB  -  NIGHT

           A  sign  in  front  of  the  restaurant  reads:  CLOSED  FOR 
           FIESTA  PRIVADA

           INT.  CASTRO  PUB  -  SAME

           The  restaurant  is  filled  with  festive  decorations.  Flor 
           passes  out  mojitos  to  the  happy  guests.  The  crowd 
           includes:  Noah’s  co-workers  Deb,  Ed  and  Frank;  Basketball 
           buddies  Andre  and  Tyrone;  Liz’s  parents  with  Jason; 
           Micah,  atop  Darrell’s  shoulders;  the  elderly  neighbors, 
           the  Snyders  and  doorman  Ray. 

           Noah  and  Liz  stand  near  the  entrance  greeting  guests. 
           Pete  walks  in  with  ABBY  a  new  blonde  date.  Pete  hugs 
           Noah.

                                 PETE
                        I’m  proud  of  you,  kid.

                                 NOAH
                        Thanks  buddy. 

           Abby  looks  around  the  restaurant.

                                 ABBY
                                 (to  Noah)
                        Your  apartment  is  gorgeous!

           Noah  pats  Pete  on  the  back  as  he  and  Abby  make  their  way 
           to  the  bar. 

           Kim  walks  through  the  front  door  with  a  handsome  BLACK 
           MAN.  Kim  hugs  Liz.

                                 LIZ
                        I’m  so  happy  you  came.

                                 KIM
                        Of  course.

           Noah  kisses  Kim  on  the  cheek.

                                 NOAH
                        Thanks  for  being  here.  It  means  a 
                        lot.

                                 KIM
                        You  know  I’m  a  big  fan.

           Noah  hugs  her.

                                 KIM  (CONT’D)
                        Is  he  here?

                                 NOAH
                        No.  He’s  not  coming.

           Noah  turns  and  looks  at  the  man  standing  with  Kim.

                                 KIM
                        Oh,  I’m  so  sorry.  Guys,  this  is  my 
                        brother  Tyler.

           Kim’s  brother  is  TYLER  PERRY.  He  shakes  hands  with  Noah 
           and  Liz.

                                 TYLER
                        Nice  to  meet  you  both. 
                        Congratulations.

                        Thanks  so  much  for  coming.

           Kim  and  Tyler  head  further  into  the  room.

                                 NOAH  (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t  you  say  her  brother  was 
                        some  really  famous  actor  or 
                        something?

                                 LIZ
                        That’s  what  she  said,  but  I’ve 
                        definitely  never  seen  that  guy 
                        before.

           Noah  shrugs.

           Behind  them,  loud  SCREAMS  are  heard.  Noah  and  Liz  turn  to 
           see  all  of  the  black  party-goers  and  doorman  Ray  crowded 
           around  Tyler.

                                 RAY

                        I’m  buggin  out! 

           Noah  checks  his  watch.

                        Quiet  down. 

           The  crowd  turns  to  face  a  large  wall-mounted  projection 
           screen. 

           On  the  screen  credits  roll  and  --

           Everybody  in  the  restaurant  APPLAUDS.

           On  screen,  Noah  stands  in  front  of  Castro  Pub  wearing  the 
           outfit  Rashon  picked  out  for  him,  summer  scarf  and  all.

                                 NOAH

                        gem  ‘Castro  Pub.’  I’ll  introduce 
                        you  to  the  lovely  owner  and  head 
                        chef,  Flor  Hernandez.  We’ll  take  a 
                        peek  inside  the  kitchen,  see  how 
                        they  cook  up  all  the  tasty 
                        flavors.  And  we’ll  even  have 
                        candid  conversations  with  some  of 
                        the  regular  customers.

           A  slick  produced  opening  credit  sequence  plays. 

           INT.  CASTRO  PUB  -  LATER

           All  eyes  in  the  crowd  are  glued  to  the  TV.  Flor  grins 
           bashfully  as  she  sees  herself  on  camera.

           On  screen,  Flor  and  Noah  wear  matching  chef  hats.  They 
           simmer  some  beef  in  the  kitchen.  Noah  looks  into  the 
           camera

                                 NOAH

                        take  a  big  whiff.

                        You  guys  smell  that?

                        No?  Well  trust  me.  It  smells 
                        absolutely  incredible.
                                 (to  Flor)
                        Any  chance  you’ll  tell  us  what 
                        spices  you  marinate  this  meat  in?

                        marry  Flor  to  get  this  recipe.

           The  crowd  at  the  party  LAUGHS.  Noah  winks  at  Flor  who 
           blows  a  kiss  in  return.

           On  screen,  Noah  stands  in  the  middle  of  the  dining  room.

                        Pub,  now  let’s  go  see  how  they 
                        turned  out.

           Noah  walks  up  to  a  couple,  dining  at  their  table.

           At  the  party  the  room  buzzes  with  excitement.  The  show  is 
           a  big  hit.  Noah  and  Liz  share  a  look  of  anticipation.

           Back  on  screen,  Noah  stands  at  the  couple’s  table.

           Noah  walks  away  from  the  couple.

                        Let’s  go  talk  to  someone  else.

           Noah  makes  his  way  to  a  table  in  the  back  of  the 
           restaurant  where  a  man  sits  by  himself.  As  Noah  gets 
           closer,  we  see  that  this  is  Rashon.

                                 NOAH  (CONT’D)

                                 (on  screen)
                        Actually,  I’m  waiting  for  someone.

                        It’s  getting  pretty  late.  How  long 
                        are  you  planning  on  waiting?

                                 RASHON
                                 (on  screen)
                        Forever.  She’s  worth  it.  See  this 
                        is  her  favorite  restaurant,  and  I 
                        have  something  important  I  want  to 
                        ask  her,  so  until  she  shows  up, 
                        I’ll  be  right  here.

                        short  break.

           As  the  show  goes  to  commercial  on  the  screen  in  the 
           background,  everyone  shifts  their  attention  to  Kim.  In 
           turn,  she  looks  to  Noah.  He  replies  with  a  shrug.

           Kim  slowly  turns  toward  the  back  of  the  restaurant.  The 
           crowd  parts,  clearing  a  path  that  reveals  Rashon,  sitting 
           at  the  same  table  as  he  did  on  screen.

           Kim  stands,  unable  to  move,  overcome  with  emotion.  Tyler 
           gently  nudges  her  forward.  As  Kim  approaches  Rashon,  he 
           gets  down  on  one  knee.

           Rashon  SNAPS  his  fingers.  From  around  the  corner,  Antoine 
           comes  running  out  with  a  RING  BOX.  He  hands  it  to  Rashon. 
           Kim’s  eyes  fill  with  tears.

                                 KIM
                        This  better  not  be  a  joke.

                                 RASHON
                        Kimberly  Perry,  make  me  the 
                        luckiest  man  alive  and  be  my  wife.

                        Of  course.

           Rashon  places  the  ring  on  her  finger.  He  stands  and  they 
           kiss.

                                 KIM  (CONT’D)
                        How  long  have  you  been  here?

           Rashon  smiles.

           Everyone  congregates  around  the  happy  couple  and  ad-libs 
           congratulations. 

           Rashon  spots  Noah  standing  a  few  feet  away,  taking  it  all 
           in.  Rashon  walks  over  to  him.

                                 RASHON
                        Nice  show.

                                 NOAH
                        Better  ending.

           Rashon  gives  Noah  a  big  hug.

           INT.  CASTRO  PUB  -  LATER

           Liz  stands  on  the  bar  with  a  microphone  in  hand.

                                 LIZ
                        Let’s  get  this  party  started.

           Beenie  Man’s  dance  hall  anthem  ‘WHO  AM  I’  booms  over  the 
           restaurant  speakers.  Rashon,  Kim,  Antoine,  Micah,  and 
           even  Noah  start  dancing  with  the  rest  of  the  crowd.

                                 LIZ  (CONT’D)
                                 (singing)
                        Whoah  nah  nah  nah  nah.  Sim  simma. 
                        Who  got  the  keys  to  my  Beemer?  Who 
                        am  I?  The  girls  dem  sugar!

           End  credits  roll  as  Liz  rips  the  mic  and  rocks  the  house.

                                 THE  END
