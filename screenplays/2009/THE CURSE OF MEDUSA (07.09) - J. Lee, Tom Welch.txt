           -William Congreve.

           A harmony of female voices speak in the darkness.  THE FATES.

                                 THE FATES (V.O.)
                        How could something so beautiful 
                        come to this?  

                                                    FADE IN:

           EXT. ANCIENT GREECE - ATHENA’S PALACE - DAY

           Athens, Greece.  The most powerful and advanced city-states 
           in the world, is now in ruins.  High above the city sits 
           Athena’s Palace, located atop the mighty Acropolis.  The city 
           is covered with the remains of Athenian soldiers, men, women, 
           and children.  

           An imposing army from the underworld of HADES lays waste to 
           the city of Athens, killing all those who oppose.  Legions of 
           DEMON SOLDIERS race towards the palace.  

           On the far side of the palace, a giant CYCLOPS plows its way 
           through Athenian soldiers and towards the great Parthenon.  
           Another cyclops climbs the towering walls.

           Large GRIFFINS, beasts with the head and wings of an EAGLE 
           and the body of a LION, soar above the battle.  They 
           occasionally swoop down, snatching men and flying them high 
           into the sky, only to drop them to their deaths. 

           The Fates speak over the action.

                                 THE FATES (V.O.)
                        Athens, Greece.  Once viewed as the 
                        most illustrious and prominent 
                        cities in the eastern world, is now 
                        under attack by one of the world’s 
                        most feared monsters.  A monster so 
                        powerful, even the gods themselves 
                        could not stop her.

           EXT. ATHENA’S BALCONY - DAY

           High ranking OFFICIALS and PALACE GUARDS gather around to 
           witness the carnage. 
                               (cid:13)                   (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                   (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)           Within moments, the evil soldiers begin climbing over the 
           walls and onto the balcony.  The palace guards quickly engage 
           in battle.

                                 THE FATES (V.O.)
                        Fueled by a driving force and 
                        hunger that can never be satisfied;  
                        Revenge.  

           An athletic and muscular man emerges from the shadows on the 
           balcony.  A long scar runs across his chin.  His sword and 
           armor are stained with blood.

           He is PERSEUS.  He speaks to someone OFF SCREEN.

                                 PERSEUS
                        It is her.  She has come for you.

           He dives from the balcony and back into the battle, fighting 
           demons on his way down.  

           For a moment, the balcony is quiet.  Seconds later, a dark 
           creature flies from the sky with a shrieking HOWL.  Then, a 
           loud THUD, as it grasps onto the side of the palace.  

           We hear it as it scales its way up the palace walls.  The top 
           of a head, filled with hissing SNAKES, slowly rises over the 
           side of the balcony, followed by two large reptilian claws. 

           The creature then LEAPS into our POV.  CUT TO BLACK.

                                 THE FATES (V.O.) 
                        A name and beauty that was once 
                        worshipped, is now feared.  This is 
                        the tale of Medusa.  

           EXT. ANCIENT LIBYA - NIGHT 

           On Screen Text:  Libya, Africa.  Three Months Prior...

           CREDITS as we slowly FADE IN on an ancient map of Neolithic 
           Libya.  We PUSH IN on the map, eventually through it, and 
           fall into a dark cloud.

           EXT. SKY - NIGHT

           We soar through the clouds and a large landmass is revealed. 
           It is Libya, Africa nearly five thousand years ago.  
                           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                 THE FATES (V.O.)
                        Her tale begins nearly five 
                        thousand years ago.  It was 
                        prophesied to Athena, virgin 
                        goddess of wisdom, justice, and 
                        war, that she would come into 
                        possession of a great power.  A 
                        power that would strike fear into 
                        the hearts of her enemies and 
                        defeat all those who dared oppose 
                        her.  Her esteemed Athenian army 
                        scoured the globe in search of this 
                        power but it was not until the 
                        Athenian troops arrived in the dark 
                        lands of Libya, Africa, that this 
                        legendary power was unearthed.  
                        Athena’s quest would end here, but 
                        the events that would eventually 
                        lead to the destruction of Athens, 
                        had only just begun.  

           Covered with dangerous mountains, volcanos and vast deserts, 
           the aphotic countryside is ruled by darkness.  

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Below, the vast Athenian army battles with the Libyans.  
           While resolute, the Libyans are no match for the powerful 
           Athenians.

           Towards the shores, the Athenian troops lock something into a 
           massive steel cage.  The cage is over ten feet tall and just 
           as wide.  

           Their capture is deadly.  The surrounding area looks as if a 
           tornado swept through with dozens of large trees destroyed 
           and ripped from the ground.  Soldiers are scattered about, 
           having lost the battle of subduing their capture.  

           From a nearby hill, a powerful man sits atop his horse and 
           watches this all.  His hands and armor are soiled with blood 
           and dirt.  He has already dealt enough death for the evening.  

           He bears the symbol of an OLIVE TREE on his breastplate.  
           Athena’s symbol.  He is ARTEGUS, commander of the Athenian 
           army.  

           Another soldier, a tracker named HOMER, approaches.
                                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                 HOMER
                        The last of the Libyan army awaits 
                        within the forest ahead.  They are 
                        surrounded.

           Artegus says nothing.  He stares at a small temple in the 
           distance.  King Phorcy’s temple.  

           PLAXIO, Artegus’ second in command, steps in from behind.  He 
           wears an impressive gold breast-plate and grips an equally 
           deadly sword.  The handle, carved into the beak of an eagle, 
           curves around his hand. 

           Standing beside him is THERON.  A tall, silent, and deadly 
           warrior.  Half of his face is covered by a mask.  The exposed 
           half is hideously distorted and scarred.

                                 PLAXIO
                        Awaiting word from their pathetic 
                        King, no doubt.  We should destroy 
                        them now.   

                                 ARTEGUS
                        No.
                        (a beat)
                        Send word to King Phorcys.  I wish 
                        to speak to him.     

           Homer nods and rides towards the temple.

                        Why waste time reasoning with these 
                        barbarians?  This only jeopardizes 
                        the mission.  They have nothing 
                        left to offer.  

           No reply.  Artegus steers his horse down the hill and towards 
           the temple.  

           I/E. KING PHORCY’S TEMPLE - UPPER LEVEL - SAME TIME

           A woman steps outside on a ledge overlooking the dark valley.  
           She watches as the Athenian General and his troops approach.  

           She is BEAUTIFUL.  Gorgeous in fact.  She has long black hair 
           bound in unique DREADLOCKS.  Her eyes are a deep piercing 
           BLUE.  Hypnotizing.  She is MEDUSA.

           A beautiful Libyan necklace hangs from her neck.  Her older 
           sister, EURYALE, and younger sister, STHENO, stand behind 
           her.

                        Perhaps father will listen to 
                        reason.

                                 MEDUSA
                        Our father is far from a reasonable 
                        man.  He is a tyrant and deserves 
                        the same fate as this land.

                                 STHENO
                        What will we do?

                                 MEDUSA
                        (quietly)
                        We will leave.  We will find a new 
                        life.  Far from here.  Far from 
                        Libya.

                                 EURYALE
                        Father will never let us leave 
                        Libya.  

                                 MEDUSA
                        His rule has come to an end.  After 
                        the Athenians leave, he will have 
                        no power over us any longer.  

           Artegus looks up to see Medusa watching him as they enter the 
           temple.  Medusa turns and re-enters the room.

           INT. THROWN ROOM / TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS

           Seated at the head of an EMPTY thrown room is the large and 
           barbarous tyrant ruler, KING PHORCYS.  His people have 
           forsaken him but he still refuses to show weakness.

                                 KING PHORCYS (CONT’D)
                        IF YOU THINK THAT I WILL GIVE UP MY 
                        LANDS TO ATHENA WILLINGLY, YOU ARE 
                        GRAVELY MISTAKEN.  I do not believe 
                        in your gods.  Nor do I fear them.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        It is not your land that we have 
                        come for.  Your war is over.  I am 
                        here, only to spare the lives of 
                        the rest of your people.  I will 
                        only offer this once.

           King Phorcys stands.  His tall and imposing frame advances 
           towards Artegus.  Artegus remains untroubled.
                                               (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                 KING PHORCYS
                        Spare me your favors, Athenian!  I 
                        know why she has sent you here and 
                        I would rather see my people dead, 
                        burned in flames, before I succumb 
                        to her will.  The beast will 
                        forever be a curse to Athena.  She 
                        will regret ever coming to Libya.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        (a long beat)
                        As you wish, King.

           Plaxio slowly stalks behind King Phorcys.  His armor and 
           sword begin to pulsate and emit a golden shadow.  He can take 
           this idle chat no longer and, in one swift move, pulls his 
           sword and decapitates the King.  Discussions are concluded.

           Artegus glares at Plaxio.  Plaxio wipes the King’s blood on 
           his armor and exits.

           EXT. TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS

           The Athenian troops exit the temple to the stares and 
           bewilderment of the Libyan people.  Their king is dead.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Prepare the beast for transport.  
                        We leave for Athens in the morning.

           The soldier does as he is told.  Artegus grabs Plaxio and 
           shoves him against the temple.

                                 ARTEGUS (CONT’D)
                        What the hell do you think you are 
                        doing?!  I did not order the 
                        assassination of their king.

           Plaxio’s armor slowly begins to pulsate.  Not yet at full 
           force yet, however.  

                                 PLAXIO
                        I serve a higher power.  Our orders 
                        were clear.  Time for idle talk and 
                        understanding is over, General.  

           Artegus releases his grip.  Plaxio walks off.  The golden 
           glow in his armor slowly fades.  
                                              (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)

ATHENIAN CAMP - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Campfires are put out as the soldiers retire for the evening.  
           Artegus returns to his tent.  CADIUS, stands guard.   

                                 CADIUS
                        General Artegus, Sir.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        At ease Cadius.  Spend this last 
                        night with the others.  

                                 CADIUS
                        Very good, Sir.

           Cadius heads towards the rest of the camp.  Artegus enters 
           his tent.  

           EXT. ATHENIAN CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Cadius joins the soldiers at the center of their camp area.  

                                 SOLDIER 1
                        Have you seen the beast?

                                 SOLDIER 2
                        What could Lady Athena possibly 
                        want with such an ancient creature?

           Plaxio and Theron enter. 

                                 PLAXIO 
                        What does anyone with power seek.  
                        Even a god?

                        More power.

           INT. GENERAL’S TENT - CONTINUOUS

           Artegus removes his armor and clothing.  He hangs his sword.  
           As he does, a hooded silhouette slowly moves in the darkness.

           Seeing the reflection in the sword, he turns quickly, but 
           recognizes the intruder.  It is MEDUSA.  Medusa walks towards 
           Artegus, removing her hood.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        I did not intend for that to...

           Medusa stifles his words with a long kiss.

                        The war is over.  And tomorrow you 
                        will return to Athens with me. 

                                 MEDUSA
                        I have long waited for the day to 
                        be free from my father.  My sisters 
                        are hesitant to leave, but they 
                        know there is nothing left for us 
                        in Libya.

                        You will risk it all?  Your loyalty 
                        to Athena?  The safety of your men?   
                        Just so we can be together?  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        I will do whatever it takes.  

                                 MEDUSA
                        If we are caught, they will kill us 
                        all.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        You will all be safe in Holloway.  
                        That is where I spent my childhood.  
                        Far from Athena’s watchful eye.  
                        Once in Athens, I will resign as 
                        general of Athena’s army and we 
                        will be together.  

                                 MEDUSA
                        Promise me.  Tell me you love me.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        I promise.  And I love you, Medusa.

                        Get some rest.  The journey home 
                        will be long.

           They kiss one final time.  Medusa sneaks out of the tent.  As 
           Medusa slips into the darkness, Plaxio approaches.  He 
           faintly sees the silhouette of a woman before she is 
           completely concealed by the night.

SHORES OF LIBYA - DAWN OF THE NEXT DAY

           Morning has come.  Hundreds of warships sail away from the 
           shores of Libya.  Artegus boards his ship.

           Our POV slowly travels down the long ship and eventually to 
           the lower decks.  There, in the dark corner, Medusa and her 
           two sisters hide and await passage to Athens.  

           EXT. WARSHIP - SEA - MORNING

           The ships travel through rough seas where unusual prehistoric 
           SEA CREATURES rise in and out of the water. 

                                 THE FATES (V.O.)
                        Searching for a new beginning, 
                        Euryale and Stheno followed their 
                        beloved sister Medusa to Athens.  

           In the dark corner, Medusa lays asleep next to her sisters.  

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. SHORES OF LIBYA - DAY (DREAM SEQUENCE)

           A younger Euryale and Stheno run through the fields of Libya 
           looking for places to hide.  A younger Medusa stands with her 
           hands over her eyes.  Her dreadlocks are shorter.

           She opens her eyes and searches for her sisters.  She runs 
           towards the shore. 

                                 CHILD MEDUSA
                        Euryale?  

           Suddenly the SCREAMS of an infant are heard.  Medusa turns to 
           see a large chest floating out to sea.  A young BABY BOY 
           cries helplessly from inside of the chest.  He has a small 
           scar along his chin.  Medusa cries out to her sisters for 
           help, but they do not come.

                                 CHILD MEDUSA (CONT’D)
                        Euryale help!  Stheno!

           The strong waves rock the chest back and forth, sending it 
           further away from the shore.  Medusa runs out into the water.

                                 CHILD MEDUSA (CONT’D)
                        Here!  I’ll save you!

           INT. OCEAN - CONTINUOUS (DREAM SEQUENCE)

           A FULLY GROWN Medusa emerges in the middle of the ocean as a 
           heavy downpour of rain falls.  

           She reaches the chest, but it is empty.  She looks to the 
           shore to see a FULLY GROWN MAN, covered in shadows, watching 
           her.  He bears the same scar across his chin.  He is PERSEUS.  

           She slowly sinks towards the bottom.  Something then catches 
           her eye.  A light from beneath her grows closer and then 
           flashes in front of her.  She sees blurry images of: a city, 
           unfamiliar faces, an Olive Tree, a large temple, two people 
           sitting on a large balcony of the temple...  

           Medusa struggles even more.  She swims up and almost reaches 
           the surface, her legs kicking frantically in the water.  
           Suddenly, a grotesque HAND, with scales and claws reaches up 
           and grabs her leg.  Medusa screams again, as the hand pulls 
           her deep down into the dark depths of the water.

           EXT. WARSHIP - SEA - DAWN

           Medusa bolts awake from her dream SCREAMING.  Euryale quickly 
           goes to her to comfort and quiet her.  

                                 EURYALE
                        (whispering)
                        Shh...it is okay, Medusa.  I am 
                        here.

                                 STHENO
                        Was it the same dream?

           Medusa nods, finding comfort in here sister’s arms.

           EXT. WARSHIP - SEA - DAY

           Artegus stands at the bow of his ship, deep in thought.  His 
           friend and fellow soldier, ANGELO, approaches.

                                 ANGELO
                        Poseidon truly favors us today.

           Artegus continues to stare out into the sea.  The two friends 
           stand in silence for a moment.

                        How long have you and I been 
                        friends?

           Artegus musters a smile. 

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Too long, I’m afraid.

                                 ANGELO
                        How long do you plan on keeping 
                        your Libyan lover a secret?

                                 ARTEGUS

                        You knew?

                                 ANGELO
                        I’ve seen that look about you 
                        before.  When you met Andromeda’s 
                        mother.  
                        (a beat)
                        But she is still the daughter of 
                        the enemy.  As long as you serve 
                        Athena, she will never let this 
                        happen.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        I will be stepping down.  I want 
                        you to take my place as General.

                                 ANGELO
                        (laughing)
                        I am merely a pawn of the gods.  
                        And Plaxio is highly favored by the 
                        goddess herself.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Plaxio is too eager to kill.  
                        Without shield and sword from 
                        Athena, he would be nothing more 
                        than a field warrior.  He cannot 
                        lead.

                        (smiling)
                        You just did. 

                                 ANGELO
                        This Libyan, Medusa.  Is she worth 
                        it?

           Artegus gives Angelo a look that is undeniable.

                                 ANGELO (CONT’D)
                        Of course.  
                        (then)
                        Careful, my friend.  Love and 
                        sorrow are mirrored brothers. 

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Keep this secret.   

                                 ANGELO
                        You have my word.  

           INT. WARSHIP - LATER  

           Artegus steps down into the cargo section of the ship.  
           Medusa waits behind some crates.  They share a passionate 
           kiss. 

                                 ARTEGUS
                        We are nearing Greece.  Do you 
                        remember what we discussed?  There 
                        will be a lot of commotion...

                                 MEDUSA
                        (cutting him off)
                        Once the soldiers exit the boat, 
                        exit through the stern.  Wait for 
                        you at the docks.  I remember.

           Medusa gives Artegus a reassuring smile.

                                 MEDUSA (CONT’D)
                        We will be fine.  

           Artegus hears the horn from above.  Land has been spotted.

           EXT. SHORES OF ATHENS, GREECE - DAY

           The warships approach the magnificent shores of Athens.  The 
           desolate lowly land of Libya is no more.

Fertile greens.  Areas that 
           were once covered in shadows are now filled with people.  

           EXT. WARSHIP - CONTINUOUS

           Angelo stands on the bow.

                                 ANGELO
                        Now there is a sight I have truly 
                        missed.

           EXT. ATHENS, GREECE - DAY

           The city is MASSIVE.  A prominent icon of structural design 
           and advancement.  Colossal buildings held up by intricately 
           designed columns can be seen for miles throughout the city.  
           Tall statues devoted to the Gods tower above the incessant 
           crowd.  

           Artegus’ ship is the first to dock.  The citizens of Athens 
           welcome their warriors home with cheers and blessings.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        (to Cadius)
                        These citizens need not be alarmed.  
                        When it is clear, take the beast to 
                        the rear of the palace and make 
                        certain it is secure inside of the 
                        vault.  

           RODIMUS, a former warrior turned religious man, emerges from 
           the crowd.  He hugs Artegus.  

                                 RODIMUS
                        Welcome home, Artegus!  It is good 
                        to have you back.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Rodimus.  It is good to be back.  
                        Where is Andromeda? 

                                 RODIMUS
                        Your daughter still shies away from 
                        the large crowds.  She waits for 
                        you at our home. 
                        (pointing to the parade)
                        But go.  They are here to welcome 
                        you.  Go!

WARSHIP - DOCKS

           Medusa, Euryale and Stheno exit the boat without being seen.  
           They all take in the site of the city.  

                                 STHENO
                        It is breathtaking.

           THEN, something catches Stheno’s attention.  Intrigued, she 
           casually wanders off.   Medusa and Euryale fail to notice.

           EXT. PARADE TO THE ACROPOLIS - CONTINUOUS

           Flower petals fall from the upper levels as the soldiers 
           approach the mighty Acropolis.  Its many levels are home to 
           museums and shops.  Thousands gather to wave and cheer for 
           their returned family members.  Statues and artwork decorate 
           the ascending steps and walkways.  The legendary Parthenon, 
           lies at the very top.  The palace of ATHENA.

           The parade leads to the gates of the Parthenon and the mighty 
           gates open to the sound of trumpets and horns.  

           Artegus and the troops are ushered through the gates.  In the 
           center of the Parthenon, sits a grand sized OLIVE TREE 
           growing atop a beautiful water fountain.  

           Trumpets sound one last time, marking the end of the parade.  
           From inside the grandeur hall of the palace, a figure 
           approaches the high staircase.  It is ATHENA.

           She is BEAUTIFUL, POWERFUL, CONFIDENT, and is surrounded by a 
           radiant GLOW.  Her movements are fluent.  Her appearance is 
           impeccable.  High level officials gather around her.  She 
           raises her hands and the crowd silences.  

                                 ATHENA
                        I welcome you, sons and daughters 
                        of Greece.  Your victory has 
                        ensured our great land safety once 
                        again.  Athens salutes you!

           The crowd cheers.  Artegus does not.

                                 ATHENA (CONT'D)
                        General Artegus.  Come, join me.

           Artegus climbs the high staircase.  KATINA, Athena’s personal 
           assistant, hands Artegus a medal.
                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)

                        You have proven your valor once 
                        again.

           The crowd cheers.  Athena glances at the pile of discoveries 
           from the war.  

                                 ATHENA
                        And what of the beast?

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Underground in the vault.  
                        Tranquilized.  

                                 ATHENA
                        You serve me well, Artegus.  I see 
                        your reign as commander lasting for 
                        many years as did your father 
                        before you.

           EXT. DOCKS - SAME TIME

           As the Athenians celebrate, Medusa and Euryale wait near the 
           docks, out of sight.  But Stheno is nowhere to be found. 

                                 MEDUSA
                        Where is Stheno?  

           EXT. ATHENS - MARKETPLACE - A LITTLE LATER 

           Medusa searches for her younger sister.  She and Euryale 
           quickly maneuver through the crowd.  They eventually find 
           themselves in the middle of the Agora; Athens’ bustling and 
           seemingly endless marketplace.  

           Merchants and dealers handle their daily business.  As well 
           as thieves and hustlers lurking about the busy market.

           Medusa finally spots Stheno.  Stheno speaks to an OLD MAN

           She is interrupted as the old man reveals himself.  He is

           He is POLYDEGMON.

           at him skeptically.

           The sisters look forward, taken aback by the busy market.

           Medusa turns but he is gone.  

           Throughout the Agora, slaves and donkeys carry most of the 
           purchases.  In a nearby tent, a SNAKE CHARMER subdues three 
           SNAKES wrapped around his head and arms.

           particular.

                        Do you see how the men look at us?

           Men gawk at them as their beauty is unmatched.  As the 
           sisters continue, a man in black quietly falls in behind 
           them.

           Perched high on a balcony, someone watches.

           EXT. ATHENA’S PALACE - BALCONY - DAY

           A servant carries a tray of fruit and wine onto the balcony.  
           We see the back of a LARGE and POWERFUL man leaning over the 
           ledge.  His broad shoulders sit above a muscular frame.  The 
           servant places the tray down and exits.  Moments later, 
           Athena steps out onto the balcony.

           He turns around.  He is LORD POSEIDON.  His eyes are an 
           intense green.  Very sharp.  His powerful TRIDENT lays beside 
           him.  He stares at her without speaking.

           Poseidon turns back and resumes looking over the balcony.  A 
           crowd slowly gathers around the three sisters.  

           EXT. ATHENA’S PALACE- DAY

           Stheno and Euryale enter another tent.  Medusa waits outside 
           near a corner of Athena’s palace.  She looks up, noticing 
           Poseidon watching her.  They stare at each other until Athena 
           joins him at the ledge of the balcony.

           Athena looks down at Medusa who quickly turns away.  Medusa 
           stops a local man next to her. 

                                 MEDUSA
                        Who is that man?

                        (whispering)
                        He is no man.  He is Lord Poseidon, 
                        god of the sea.  The lady is 
                        Athena, the divine ruler of Athens.  
                        Goddess of wisdom and war.

           Stheno and Euryale exit the tent and rejoin Medusa.

                        Now we have seen enough.  We must 
                        get back to the docks...

           The man in black makes his move. He lunges at Medusa, 
           forcefully snatching her fur.

           EXT. ATHENA’S PALACE - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

           Poseidon notices this robbery.  He opens his hand and his 
           Trident flies to him and in one swift move, he gracefully 
           LEAPS over the balcony.  When he lands, the earth SHAKES.

           EXT. ATHENA’S PALACE - CONTINUOUS

           He stands up, mighty and tall, with a calm yet ferocious look 
           in his eyes.  He hurls his mighty Trident at the thief.  It 
           sails over the thief’s head, inches in fact, landing directly 
           where his next footfall would have.

           bearing down on him.  Poseidon snatches the thief by the 
           neck.  He dangles from Poseidon’s mighty arm like a rag doll.

                        Please...please...

           Poseidon smoothly SNAPS his neck in two.  The lifeless body 
           hangs for a moment.  Poseidon then effortlessly flings the 
           body towards the depths of the ocean.

           He approaches Medusa with the stolen belongings.  The nearby 
           merchants either shy away or bow down to him.  Poseidon 
           speaks in a DEEP, soothing voice.

                        (a beat)
                        Are you hurt?

                                 MEDUSA
                        No...no.  Thank you.  

           Poseidon’s sharp eyes gaze over Medusa’s entire body.

                                 POSEIDON
                        You are not from here.  What is 
                        your name?

                                 MEDUSA
                        Medusa.  These are my sisters, 
                        Euryale and Stheno. 

                                 POSEIDON
                        (seductively)
                        Medusa...

           A whisper of Medusa’s name quickly spreads through the 
           marketplace.  In the distance, Artegus searches for Medusa 
           and her sisters.  He finally spots them, cornered by 
           Poseidon.  Athena also makes her way towards the women.  
           Artegus rushes to them.

           Athena calmly approaches the women and stands next to 
           Poseidon.  She notices how Poseidon takes in these new women.    

                                 ATHENA
                        What seems to be the problem? 
                                                                      (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 POSEIDON
                        Your perfect city is infested with 
                        thieves.  My intervention was 
                        required.  As usual

           Athena turns and quickly, yet thoroughly, surveys Medusa.  

                                 ATHENA
                        What are you women doing in the 
                        agora unaccompanied?  

                                 MEDUSA
                        We... 

           Artegus quickly approaches.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Lady Athena.  Lord Poseidon.  These 
                        women... were the royal servants to 
                        the Libyan king.  I thought they 
                        could be of use to you in regards 
                        to the beast. 

           Athena studies the three women.  ALTAIR, her trusted owl, 
           swoops down from the balcony and lands on her shoulder.

                                 ATHENA
                        Very well, Artegus. 
                        (a beat)
                        Come.  You three will stay in the 
                        maiden’s quarters.  Katina will 
                        show you everything.

           Athena turns and heads back towards the palace.  Medusa and 
           her sisters follow hesitantly.

           INT. ATHENA’S PALACE - CONTINUOUS

           The interior of the palace is exquisite.  Unlike the busy 
           marketplace, the palace is clean, peaceful, and serene.   

           The ceiling; vaulted and over fifty feet high, is detailed 
           from corner to corner with flawless hand paintings.  There 
           are hundreds of rooms on the first, second, and third, 
           floors. 

           INT. ATHENA’S PALACE - SERVANTS QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Katina escorts them to their sleeping quarters, a room filled 
           with women servants divided into sections.

                        This is where you will sleep.  You 
                        will be informed of your duties 
                        daily.

                        (to: Medusa)
                        I hope this suits you.  If you 
                        should need anything...

                                 ATHENA
                        They will want for nothing.  If I 
                        require information on the beast I 
                        will call upon you at that time.

                                 POSEIDON
                        Welcome to Athens.

           Poseidon looks at Athena and then seductively at Medusa once 
           more before he exits.  

           Athena sees all this.  She follows Poseidon out of the room.  
           Artegus follows.  He gives Medusa a reassuring look.

                                                    FADE OUT.

           EXT. ATHENS - WARRIOR TRAINING ARENA - AFTERNOON

           Metal clanking.  Swords fly across the screen.  Reveal 
           Artegus masterfully defending each attack.  He trains a group 
           of younger Athenian soldiers.   

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Good work.  That is enough for 
                        today.  

           The men gather their belongings.  Angelo approaches.

                                 ANGELO
                        Is it me, or do the soldiers seem 
                        to be getting younger and younger?

                                 ARTEGUS
                        You are just getting older.

                                 ANGELO
                        Ahh yes. 

                                 ARTEGUS
                        I am off to my summer home in 
                        Holloway.  To see Andromeda.

                        Excellent.  Send her my best.  

           Artegus hops on a horse drawn wagon.  He rides off towards 
           the palace.  Angelo picks up one of the swords and pulls off 
           a few moves of his own, smiling all the while.

           INT. ATHENA’S PALACE - SERVANTS QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           A large room full of maidens are in the middle of their daily 
           chores.  Medusa and her sisters fold linens. 

                                 MEDUSA
                        Euryale.  I have an errand to run 
                        outside of the palace. 

                                 EURYALE
                        Where are you going?

           Medusa quiets as Katina walks by. 

                                 MEDUSA
                        I cannot speak of it here.  If 
                        anyone asks my whereabouts, please 
                        cover for me.  I’ll return tonight.

           EXT. ATHENA’S PALACE - AFTERNOON

           Artegus arrives at the rear of the palace.  He pulls up next 
           to a small exit door.  

           He looks around to make sure he’s not being watched.  When 
           the coast is clear, Medusa sneaks from the palace and under a 
           cover on the back of the wagon.  

           EXT. HOLLOWAY VILLAGE - LATER

           The two travel a dirt road towards the village of HOLLOWAY.  
           They pass a small pond where a SWAN floats on the water.  The 
           SWAN watches as the wagon passes.  

           EXT. ARTEGUS’ HOME - HOLLOWAY - LATER

           The wagon pulls up to Artegus’ small home.  The village 
           mostly consist of farmers and croppers.  They smile as 
           Artegus approaches.  Medusa is nervous.

                        These people don’t care if I am 
                        general or not.  Only that I am 
                        happy.  Most have known me since 
                        childhood.  If there is anywhere in 
                        Greece that our secret is safe, it 
                        is here.

           Rodimus’ wife ARCEE steps outside.  She approaches Artegus 
           and Medusa.  A young girl watches from the window.

                                 ARCEE
                        Artegus.    

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Arcee.  I cannot thank you and 
                        Rodimus enough for this.  Again.

                                 ARCEE
                        The pleasure was ours.  She is just 
                        as you were at that age.  Eager and 
                        inquisitive.  Sometimes stubborn. 

           A twelve year old girl exits the home.  She is ANDROMEDA.  
           Hesitant at first, she soon approaches her Father. 

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Father...

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Yes Andromeda.  I am home.

           He hugs her, as if it has been years.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        For how long?

                                 ARTEGUS
                        For good this time.

           Andromeda’s eyes widen.  Then, they settle on Medusa.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Andromeda.  I’d like you to meet 
                        someone.  This is Medusa.  

                                 MEDUSA
                        Your father has told me much about 
                        you.  

           Andromeda looks to her father.

                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                 ARTEGUS
                        She is a very good friend.  She is 
                        staying in Athens now, but soon, 
                        she will be joining us in Holloway.  

           Unsure how to feel, Andromeda turns back to Medusa.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        I like your hair.

           EXT. FIELD - SUNSET

           Artegus sits on a blanket.  Andromeda lets Medusa help her 
           feed the horses.  Medusa then joins Artegus on the blanket.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        (smiling)
                        Even the horses like you.

                                 MEDUSA
                        My father would never let us ride.  
                        So my sisters and I used to sneak 
                        out in the night and take his best 
                        horses and just...ride.  We’d sneak 
                        back in.  He never knew that we had 
                        taken them out.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Make sure you sneak away tomorrow 
                        night for the festival here in 
                        Holloway.  You’ll enjoy it.  The 
                        festival brings out the best of the 
                        village.  Are you still bringing 
                        your sisters?

                                 MEDUSA
                        I feel it is safe now to tell them 
                        everything.  About us.  Euryale is 
                        starting to get suspicious.

           EXT. ATHENA’S PALACE / SERVANTS QUARTERS - NIGHT

           Euryale watches out of the window, waiting for Medusa.  By 
           the door, Stheno sees Katina coming by the rooms for the 
           evening’s roll call.  She rushes to Euryale at the window.

                                 STHENO
                        Where could she be?

                                 EURYALE
                        She will be the death of us all.

                                 KATINA
                        The three Libyans...

                        All accounted for, lady Katina.

           Euryale and Stheno turn to find Medusa sitting in her bed, 
           next to the blowing curtains of the second window.  

           Katina exits.  Stheno is relieved, Euryale is not.  She turns 
           to the window, as Artegus’s wagon rides off into the night.  

           EXT. VILLAGE OF HOLLOWAY - THE NEXT DAY

           The three sisters walk the dirt road leading to Holloway.  
           Ahead, the villagers are waiting for something to commence.

                                 MEDUSA
                        Isn’t it peaceful out here?  

                                 EURYALE
                        Medusa, where are you taking us?  

                                 STHENO
                        Who are those people? 

                                 MEDUSA
                        Will you stop with your barrage of 
                        questions, sisters?  There is much 
                        to see outside of the city.  We 
                        won’t be gone long.   Katina will 
                        never know we’re gone.

           The people of Holloway drink wine and celebrate.  Local men 
           play instruments, others dance.  Unlike Athens, the sisters 
           walk freely without the stares and looks of the people.  They 
           are welcomed here.

           A small group of whimsical SATYRS perform on stage.  Goat-
           like creatures with puck noses, small horns, and tails.  Some 
           entertain from the stage.  Some, to the crowd’s excitement, 
           frolic through the spectators. 

           A Satyr on stage hands a woman a basket, covered by a cloth.  
           The crowd grows excited.  She pulls back the cloth and a 
           group of BIRDS fly out to everyone’s amusement.  

           Another ensures that everyone’s cup is filled with wine.  He 
           runs up to Medusa and her sisters and hands them goblets of 
           wine.  Another runs by and drapes beads around their necks.

                        My goodness, what are these 
                        creatures?

                        They are Satyrs.  Servants of 
                        Dionysus, they celebrate the end of 
                        summer and the beginning of the 
                        winter vegetation. 

           Euryale turns, and in shock, sees Artegus.  A moment of 
           hatred for the man who killed her father flashes across her 
           face.  She immediately grabs her sisters’ arms and 
           backpedals.  Stheno follows.  Medusa does not.

                                 MEDUSA
                        It is okay, Euryale.  You wanted to 
                        know what my plan was, here we are.  
                        This is where we will live one day. 

                                 EURYALE
                        With him?  The Athenian General?!
                        That man killed our father!

           Euryale grabs Stheno’s arm and pulls her back towards the 
           dirt road.  

                                 MEDUSA
                        You despised that man, Euryale.  

                                 EURYALE
                        He was still our Father.

                                 MEDUSA
                        Father wouldn’t listen to reason 
                        and you know that.  Artegus is not 
                        who you make him out to be.  

                                 EURYALE
                        You are tempting fate, Medusa.  
                        Come, Stheno.  We are leaving.

           Euryale glares at Artegus over Medusa’s shoulder.  They turn 
           and leave Holloway.  Artegus approaches with a goblet of 
           wine.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        I take it you didn’t tell them 
                        about us.

                                 MEDUSA
                        Euryale is quick tempered and slow 
                        to trust.  Give her time.

                        (then, more upbeat)
                        Enough of that.  Come, show me a 
                        good time.  

           He hands her the goblet of wine.  Artegus grabs her hand and 
           leads her back to the festival.  

           Ahead, Andromeda and a group of kids run through the festival 
           laughing and playing with wooden swords.  Andromeda and her 
           friend stop to have a fake duel.  Andromeda is efficient with 
           the sword.

                        She is her father’s child.

           Andromeda looks up to see to her father and Medusa.  

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Father.  Medusa.  Did you see me?!  
                        I am getting better.

                                 MEDUSA
                        Very impressive.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Yes.  Now go.  Catch up with your 
                        friends.  

           Andromeda smiles and runs off.  

                                 ARTEGUS (CONT’D)
                        She seems to be warming up to you.

                                 MEDUSA
                        It is just the sweets.  They will 
                        wear off soon.  

           Rodimus approaches with a full goblet of wine, slightly 
           drunk.  

                                 RODIMUS
                        My friend, Artegus.  Let us toast! 
                        To Dionysus!  May his grace grant 
                        us a fine winter harvest and his 
                        wine grant us warm bellies.

           Artegus laughs.  Rodimus turns to Medusa.

                        Medusa, this is my good friend 
                        Rodimus.  Forgive him.  He has had 
                        a few too many.

           Rodimus drunkenly toasts his goblet of wine with Medusa’s.  

                                 MEDUSA
                        (smiling)
                        As he should.  But in our country, 
                        it is bad luck not to look one in 
                        the eye during a toast.

           She locks eyes with Rodimus. They toast again. 

                                 MEDUSA
                        And it is even worse to let a woman 
                        out drink you!

           Medusa turns back her goblet of wine and finishes it.  
           Artegus and Rodimus both smile and follow suit.  

           The musicians play a new song.  Medusa takes Artegus by the 
           hand and leads him out where others are dancing.  Artegus 
           fumbles at first but then gets the hang of it.  

           Medusa then takes the lead.  She is an excellent dancer.  The 
           crowd stops and watches with amusement.  They clap, 
           encouraging the couple to keep it up.

           Off to the side, Andromeda watches with a smile.

           Medusa then gently pulls Andromeda into the circle to dance 
           as well.   The song ends.  Everyone claps.

                        I’m out of breath now.

           Andromeda’s young friends call for her to join them.  She 
           waves goodbye and runs off.

                        felt this happy.  

           They kiss.  Just then, a Satyr runs up and tosses some powder 
           into the air.  It explodes into bright FIREWORKS above their 
           heads.

ARTEGUS’ HOME - LATER

           The festivities have slowed down as Medusa, Artegus and 
           Andromeda are back at home.  Medusa braids Andromeda’s hair 
           into dreadlocks while Artegus lights the fireplace.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        How does it look?

                                 ARTEGUS.
                        It looks great.

                                 MEDUSA
                        I hope you like it because...

           She finishes up one last twist of Andromeda’s hair.

                                 MEDUSA
                        ...I am finished.

           Her hair is now twisted into dreadlocks.  They resemble 
           Medusa’s, only shorter.  Andromeda can’t stop smiling.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Very beautiful Andromeda.  Just in 
                        time for bed.   

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Thank you Medusa.

                                 MEDUSA
                        You are very welcome.

           Andromeda runs off into her room.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Must you go?

                                 MEDUSA
                        Yes.  Katina will be doing her 
                        count of the maidens just before 
                        midnight.  
                        (off Artegus’ disappointed 
                         look)
                        But, perhaps I can stay a little 
                        longer.

           She smiles.  They share another passionate kiss.

ARTEGUS’ ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Medusa slowly awakens to discover the sunlight pouring in 
           through the open window.  Artegus slumbers next to her.  She 
           quietly gets up and exits the home.

           INT. ATHENA’S PALACE - ATHENA’S TEMPLE - SAME TIME

           CLOSE UP of a large glass bowl filled with water.  The still 
           water slowly begins to move.  It then rises from the bowl and 
           hovers in the air.  The water takes the form of a ball and 
           floats across the temple.  ZOOM OUT to see two hands receive 
           the water ball.  Poseidon’s hands.

           Athena’s temple is white with massive statues in the corners.  
           ZEUS, POSEIDON, and HADES.  

           The distinguished SHIELD of AEGIS sits on a ledge.  Delicate 
           silk draperies hang from a white canopy bed in the center of 
           the room.  This is Athena’s sanctuary.  Pure.

           Poseidon manipulates the liquid ball, turning it into 
           different shapes.  He then turns the water back into the 
           shape of a ball and it begins to glow.  He leans forward, 
           staring into the ball.

           The light pours over Poseidon’s face.  The inside of the ball 
           begins to swirl and eventually settles into a vividly clear 
           image of the outside world.  Poseidon sees the past, present 
           and future.

           He sees Medusa.  She walks along a dirt trail smiling to 
           herself.  The vision then changes to Artegus watching her as 
           she leaves.

           The vision changes to the island of Crete where the Minotaur 
           ravishes the land.  It wields a deadly WAR HAMMER.  The 
           Minotaur devours men and children alike with no remorse.

           Athena walks into the temple.  The light inside of the ball 
           fades away.

                                 ATHENA
                        Poseidon.  I have told you before.  
                        This is a pure and holy sanctuary.  
                        You are neither.   

                                 POSEIDON
                        You should not have brought it 
                        here.

                                 POSEIDON (CONT’D)
                        You know of what I speak.  The 
                        Minotaur. 

                                 ATHENA
                        Have you already grown tired of 
                        your own creation?  

                                 POSEIDON
                        If Zeus would allow us to kill 
                        those we curse, I would have rid 
                        the lands of the beast years ago. 
                        On the isle of Crete, it grew out 
                        of control.  You will not be able 
                        to contain it. 

                                 ATHENA
                        Is it jealousy or guilt that fuels 
                        your anger?  Jealousy of losing the 
                        city to someone like me or the 
                        guilt of seeing your own cursed 
                        creation go on to kill hundreds of 
                        innocent men, women and children.  

                                 POSEIDON
                        It is easy to boast of your 
                        accolades now.  But beware.  You 
                        are close to crossing the line 
                        between your duty... and your 
                        obsession.  And cross it you will.  
                        Then we will see who is ridden with 
                        guilt.

                                 ATHENA
                        We shall see, now won’t we? 
                        (then, nonchalantly)
                        Don’t you have some sea affairs to 
                        attend to?  Leave me.  

           The liquid ball continues to hover between Poseidon’s strong 
           hands.  

                                 POSEIDON
                        Seventy percent of this planet is 
                        under my control.  Trust me young 
                        one, I have better things to be 
                        doing.  If Zeus believed you alone 
                        could handle everything, he would 
                        not have asked me to be here.

                        In the meantime, I’ll turn my 
                        attention to another Libyan 
                        discovery.  

           The ball flashes a vision of Medusa and then fades away.   He 
           looks at Athena, and lets the water drop to the floor.  He 
           leaves with a grin.  

           EXT. SEA - MORNING

           The ocean glistens in the bright sun as Medusa walks along 
           the shore.  She looks out to see a a fleet of fishing boats 
           sail smoothly across the water.  They all bear the symbol of 
           the Olive Tree.  Athena’s boats. 

           EXT. DECK, FISHING BOAT #1 - CONTINUOUS

           There are supplies along with a large haul of fish in a net.  

                                 FISHERMAN #1
                        Athena will be pleased.

           Suddenly, the boat sways back and forth, but the ocean 
           remains calm.  Something is coming.  They can only feel it.  

           The water slowly RISES into a gigantic figure.  It is 
           Poseidon.  Body forged completely of water, protruding fifty 
           feet above the surface.  He moves towards the shore, causing 
           massive waves in the process.   The fishermen hang on for 
           their lives.  Their supplies tumble helplessly overboard.

           Once Poseidon passes, the water slowly settles.  Their boat 
           is damaged but they are still alive.

           Medusa sees Poseidon’s large godly form over the horizon.  He 
           slowly contracts back into his normal, yet powerful body.

                                 POSEIDON
                        Good evening, Medusa...  Do not be 
                        frightened.    

           Medusa can only stare at Poseidon.  Scared and mesmerized 
           simultaneously.  Poseidon looks over Medusa’s body as if he 
           were a child with a new toy.

                                 POSEIDON (CONT’D)
                        Would you like to take a ride 
                        across the sea?  I can show you 
                        wonders.

           Wonders and images are created from water.  Vast cities, 
           dolphins, wealth and riches... a glimpse of Libya.

                                 MEDUSA
                        I... I must get back to the Palace.  
                        I am sorry.

           She manages to maneuver around him and once she does, she 
           quickly walks off.  She tries not to look back.

           Poseidon smirks and turns to the sea.  With the flick of his 
           wrist, the water obeys its master and ROLLS into a giant 
           tidal wave that shakes the city.  

           EXT. DECK, FISHING BOAT #1 - SAME TIME

           The fishermen finish picking up their scattered equipment.  
           Darkness suddenly blankets them.  They look up to see a WAVE 
           towering over their heads.  

           In a flash, the wave engulfs the figuratively small boats as 
           it tears through to the other end of the sea. 

           EXT. ATHENA’S PALACE - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

           An agitated Athena steps outside onto her balcony, 
           overlooking her impressive city.  Poseidon has destroyed two 
           of her ships.  

                                 ATHENA
                        Poseidon’s childish rivalry is 
                        beginning to tire me.  

           Suddenly, the sounds of VOICES. 

           Athena hears her citizens.  Thousands and thousands of voices 
           and conversations.  She can hear each one of them distinctly.  
           In the midst of these countless conversations, she repeatedly 
           hears a specific name.  MEDUSA.  

           The voices grow louder and begin to blend together until they 
           are undecipherable.  Athena slowly begins to get angry.  The 
           walls begin to tremble.  Some of the smaller statues fall 
           over and break.  

           Athena shuts her eyes.   When she opens them and it all 
           stops.  The voices.  The trembling.  The earth is completely 
           quiet once again.

           Euryale and Stheno weave material for Athena.  Medusa enters.  

                                 STHENO
                        Medusa.  Katina has been for 
                        looking for you...  

           Suddenly, Altair SWOOPS into the doorway of the quarters.  
           His eyes, wide and penetrating.  He stares directly at 
           Medusa.

           Then, Katina steps into the entryway. 

                                 KATINA
                        Lady Athena awaits you in the 
                        courtyard.

           EXT. ATHENA’S PALACE - COURTYARD - EVENING

           Medusa follows Katina to the courtyard.  A large group of 
           Athenian citizens have gathered around the fountain as Athena 
           speaks to them individually.  

           The citizens bring flowers and other small items as gifts of 
           appreciation to the Goddess.  Athena senses Medusa.  She 
           signals her guards.  They politely close off the service to 
           the remaining citizens waiting in line.

                                 SOLDIER 
                        The Lady will see to your needs 
                        tomorrow.

           The soldiers escort the citizens out and close the gates.  
           Katina follows, leaving Medusa and Athena alone.

                                 ATHENA
                        Medusa.  Please, join me.

           Medusa approaches the goddess, slightly intimidated.  She 
           stares at the beautiful fountain surrounding the olive tree.  
           Her reflection sways on the surface. 

                                 ATHENA
                        Many years ago, a patron deity was 
                        needed to govern this city.  
                        Poseidon wanted rule, as did I.  We 
                        both presented gifts to determine 
                        who would preside.  Poseidon struck 
                        the ground with his trident and 
                        presented this fountain.

                        But the water sprung forth was 
                        salty and of no use.  I presented 
                        the olive tree.  It symbolizes 
                        peace and prosperity for the 
                        people.  They come to me with their 
                        prayers, and I try to give them 
                        what they desire.  

           A beat.  Athena gently touches Medusa’s dreadlocks.

                                 ATHENA (CONT’D)
                        You truly are beautiful.  It must 
                        be difficult acting as a maiden 
                        when you come from royalty.

                        I have known who you were from the 
                        moment you arrived in Athens.  No 
                        need for secrets any longer.

                        Now, I retrieved what I desired 
                        from Libya.  But the beast has 
                        proven slightly...complex.  Your 
                        father was able to control it and I 
                        need you to enlighten me on his 
                        methods.

                        I don’t know much about it.  Only 
                        that my father used it to keep my 
                        sisters and I bound to Libya, 
                        afraid of an old prophesy told to 
                        him by a witch in the mountains.  
                        That is all I can tell you about 
                        the beast.

                        That disappoints me.  I was hoping 
                        your presence would be more useful 
                        than just a distraction to my 
                        people and Lord Poseidon.  Poseidon 
                        may seem enticing but be mindful of 
                        your place here.  My palace and 
                        servants are pure.  Do not 
                        interfere with the ways of the 
                        gods.  

           A beat.  Medusa is taken aback.

                        It is late.  Hopefully your memory 
                        will serve you better in the 
                        morning.  Otherwise, there is no 
                        reason to allow your stay.

           Altair flies in and lands on Athena’s shoulder.  Medusa 
           leaves the courtyard.

           INT. ATHENA’S PALACE - DAY

           A large room full of maidens wash clothes, linens, and other 
           chores for the goddess.  Medusa enters with a basket and sets 
           it down.

                        We need more hot water.

                        I’ll go.

           INT. ATHENA’S PALACE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Medusa walks down a long corridor.  A low haunting moan 
           echoes throughout the halls.  She places her ear against the 
           wall. 

           As she follows the sound, she comes to a STATUE of Athena.  
           She touches the statue, accidently TRIGGERING a secret 
           passage behind it to open.

           She peers into the passageway at a case of stairs winding 
           down into a dark, secret place.

           INT. DUNGEON - DARKNESS

           The staircase leads into a dungeon below the palace.  Medusa 
           slowly walks down the stairs, her curiosity leading her 
           deeper towards the sound.  She approaches a corner and slowly 
           peeks around it...  

           Two GUARDS walk past but they do not see her.  They speak to 
           each other in passing. 

                                 GUARD #1
                        The tranquilizers should keep it 
                        sedated long enough for the 
                        transport.

           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)           Medusa walks in the shadows.  The guards walk up the stairs 
           and exit through the secret entrance.

           Medusa slowly backpedals into the main chamber of the 
           dungeon.  She pauses.  She can feel hot thick air on her 
           neck.   The silhouette of something massive rises behind her.  
           She turns around.

           She finds herself looking up into a tall, dark, steel-barred 
           cage...directly into the eyes of a ferocious beast.  

           It is THE MINOTAUR.  The ancient mythical beast with a 
           colossal body of a man and the head of a bull.  A large nose-
           ring protrudes from its snout.  

           Its furry body is concealed in the darkness, imprisoned 
           within a large cage on wheels, awaiting transportation.  

           Medusa notices something within nose-ring.  Unique SYMBOLS 
           are carved in, what resembles a blue CRYSTAL.  They GLOW in 
           the darkness. 

           Her gaze then moves up into the beasts’ eyes.  Medusa steps 
           forward.  Unafraid.  She is drawn to this beast.  His eyes 
           study her, not as a mindless brute, but as an intelligent 
           being.  She places her hand inside of the cage and slowly 
           traces her hands across his face.

           SUDDENLY, two tall heavily enforced doors slowly open, 
           shining bright light into the dark dungeon.

           Medusa and the Minotaur look back at one another.  The 
           Minotaur quickly lowers its head and closes its eyes.  Medusa 
           steps back into a crevice in the wall.  A group of soldiers 
           enter from a steep ramp and secure the prison to a large 
           chain. 

           After the chain is secure, they walk back up the ramp and 
           outside.  Medusa keeps her eyes on the Minotaur.  One of his 
           eyes OPEN, briefly looking back at Medusa, before closing 
           once more.

           EXT. ATHENS - DAY

           Artegus directs his men while they prepare to haul the 
           Minotaur’s cage.  Plaxio stands nearby.  Once secure, the 
           Minotaur’s cage is towed up the ramp by two large BULLS.

           Poseidon and Athena watch from the balcony.

                                 POSEIDON
                        Where are you taking it?

                                 ATHENA
                        The shores of Crete for further 
                        tests.  
                        (off Poseidon’s look)
                        When you have a city to oversee, 
                        you may do as you wish.  Until 
                        then, I believe there is still some 
                        use in this creature.  

           EXT. PALACE - DAY

           Medusa exits the palace.  Ahead of her, Plaxio stands 
           awaiting the beast.  

                                 MEDUSA
                        What is happening?  Where will you 
                        take it?

           Plaxio grabs her. 

                                 PLAXIO
                        What happens to this beast is none 
                        of your concern.  
                        (pulling her closer)
                        But what happens between you and 
                        I...has yet to be decided...

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Leave her be, Plaxio...

           Suddenly a huge ROAR breaks from the cage.  The steel doors 
           FLY off, sending the soldiers in front of it sprawling into 
           the side of the palace.

           Our attention is pulled back to the cage as it is ripped open 
           by an emerging beast.  THE MINOTAUR stands over ten feet tall 
           Heavy dark fur covers its body and two extremely sharp HORNS 
           grow from atop its head.   

           He breaks free from the cage and quickly disposes of the 
           small group of soldiers.  He then charges towards the hills 
           of Athens.  Directly towards Medusa.   

                                 ARTEGUS
                        MEDUSA!

           shoulder.  Soldiers aim their arrows.  Artegus intervenes.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        IN FRONT.  FIRE IN FRONT!  CUT OFF 
                        ITS PATH TO THE LEFT!

           The soldiers carefully fire their arrows in front of the 
           Minotaur, altering his direction of escape.  Artegus grabs a 
           spear and chases after the beast.  

                                 ARTEGUS (CONT’D)
                        Flank him at the end of the market 
                        before he reaches the plains!  

           A group of soldiers confront the charging Minotaur.  With his 
           free arm, The Minotaur simply BATS the soldiers a hundred 
           feet into the air and out of his way.

           Artegus races down a parallel street.  More THUDS as soldiers 
           are sent FLYING into nearby walls.  

           The end of the city opens up into the vast hills of Athens.  
           Plains with mountains and trees run parallel to the ocean.  
           The Minotaur is almost free.

           Just as the Minotaur approaches the last shop in the market, 
           Artegus LEAPS onto a wagon, then to a wooden ledge, and 
           finally to the roof of the small building.  He HURLS the 
           spear at the Minotaur’s free shoulder.  As the Minotaur turns 
           to the pain, Artegus LEAPS off of the roof and grabs Medusa.  
           They fall to the ground, rolling a few yards from the 
           Minotaur.  

           But their success is short lived.  

           The Minotaur pulls the spear out of its shoulder and breaks 
           it in half.  It swings at Artegus but misses.  But when its 
           fist slams the ground, it sends Artegus and Medusa tumbling 
           to the ground.  The Minotaur reaches for Medusa when we hear 
           a BOOMING voice from behind.  

                                 POSEIDON (O.S.)
                        That is far enough.  

           The Minotaur turns and is met by its greatest threat.  
           Poseidon.  A beat.  To everyone’s surprise and amazement, the 
           Minotaur SPEAKS.  In a low, DEEP voice...

                                 MINOTAUR
                        You!

                        I should have killed you long ago.

           The Minotaur’s nose ring begins to GLOW a deep blue.  It then 
           rushes into Poseidon at full speed, knocking him into a 
           building.  The building collapses on Poseidon, burying him 
           under the rubble.  Medusa watches in shock.

                                 MINOTAUR (CONT’D)
                        You should never have created me.

           The Minotaur is swift and powerful.  Poseidon BURSTS through 
           the rubble.  The Minotaur quickly charges him again, horns 
           first.  It thrusts Poseidon through yet another building.

           The two continue to fight inside the building.  Medusa, now 
           separated from Artegus, is trapped as the debris collapses 
           around her.

           BRUTAL BLOWS from within the building as the two SMASH each 
           other into the walls.  The building eventually is nothing but 
           debris and dust with them both underneath.

           The Minotaur rises from the destruction holding Poseidon 
           above his head.  He SLAMS Poseidon into the base of a 
           mountain only yards away from the collapsed building.  It 
           moves towards Medusa and picks her up as she screams.

                                 POSEIDON
                        We’re not finished yet...

           Poseidon stands.  The Minotaur drops Medusa and attacks 
           again!  It is relentless in its attack, charging forward 
           again.  Poseidon dodges and counters with a powerful strike 
           to The Minotaur’s chest.  He continues to pummel the beast, 
           driving it to the ground.

           Poseidon grabs the Minotaur by its horns and begins spinning 
           around.  He finally releases it, HURLING the beast towards 
           the mountains.  It lands over a mile away.   Once the 
           Minotaur is a safe distance away from Poseidon, its nose ring 
           STOPS glowing.    

           The Minotaur recovers and begins to break large boulders from 
           the side of the mountain.  It HURLS them back at Poseidon.  

           The Minotaur charges again.  Poseidon pulls out a small 
           golden staff.  He thrusts it forward, TRANSFORMING it into 
           his mighty TRIDENT and drives his Trident into the ground.

           Powerful Geysers begin SHOOTING up in the path of the 
           charging beast.

           (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)           The Minotaur is agile, able to avoid most of them.  It gets 
           within twenty yards of Poseidon, enough for the nose ring to 
           glow again, but that is as close as it gets.  

           A water geyser BLASTS The Minotaur into the air.  While it is 
           airborne, Poseidon TWISTS his Trident into the ground and a 
           large crevice forms under the free-falling beast.  The beast 
           ROARS as it lands with an enormous THUD into the newly formed 
           cavern.  

           Poseidon twists his Trident once again and the ground quickly 
           SLAMS SHUT on the Minotaur below.

           Soldiers gather in awe at the death of The Minotaur. 

           A beat.  Then, the gargantuan hand of The Minotaur BURSTS 
           through the ground to everyone’s surprise.  

           The Minotaur struggles to pull himself out of the earth, 
           still alive, but succumbs to exhaustion and passes out.  
           Poseidon, tired of this battle, storms towards the wounded 
           beast.  He raises his Trident above his head for a final blow 
           when a BRIGHT LIGHT shines in front of him, blinding him.  

           Athena emerges through the light.

                                 ATHENA 
                        That is enough Poseidon!  

                                 POSEIDON
                        Out of my way, Athena.  This is 
                        personal...

                                 ATHENA
                        The creature is far more powerful 
                        than I could have imagined.  

                                 POSEIDON
                        Making it all the more deadly.  It 
                        must be destroyed once and for all.

                                 ATHENA
                        Need I remind you of the severity 
                        of Zeus’s punishment?  Our plans 
                        will remain the same.  Transport 
                        the beast to Crete for further 
                        testing.

                                 POSEIDON

The look of 
           concern across his face is undeniable.  The Minotaur was far 
           stronger than he had anticipated.

                                 ATHENA
                        Where are you going?

                                 POSEIDON
                        Someone else will have to watch 
                        over his prized city.  For I am 
                        done.  

           Poseidon glares at Athena and then storms away.  The crowd of 
           soldiers quickly opens, allowing the furious god to pass. 

           Athena motions to the nearby warriors and they drag the 
           Minotaur out of the hole.  It is unconscious, but alive.

           In the distance, Athena sees Artegus riding away with Medusa.  
           Rage flashes in her eyes as she realizes what has happened.

                                 PLAXIO (O.S.)
                        Your General has betrayed you, my 
                        lady.   He has abandoned his 
                        duties...for her. 

           Athena turns to Plaxio.

                                 ATHENA
                        Perhaps it is time for a change 
                        amongst the ranks. 
                        (a beat)
                        General Plaxio...take my Palace 
                        Guards.  Find Medusa and bring her 
                        back to Athens at once.  

                                 PLAXIO
                        And what of Artegus?

                                 ATHENA
                        I will deal with him later.  Bring 
                        the Libyan to me. 

           INT. ARTEGUS’ HOME - VILLAGE OF HOLLOWAY - THAT EVENING

           Artegus and Medusa rush into the house. 

           INT. ARTEGUS’ HOME - ANDROMEDA’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Artegus peers in on Andromeda.  She sleeps peacefully.  Her 
           dreadlocks spilling over her pillow.

           Artegus quickly runs through the house, grabbing clothes and 
           other items.

                                 MEDUSA
                        Athena saw us together.  She knows, 
                        Artegus.  What is going to happen?

                                 ARTEGUS
                        She has most likely dispatched her 
                        guards.  We must leave Greece.  
                        Tonight.

                                 MEDUSA
                        And go where?

                                 ARTEGUS
                        I know of an island.  Once used by 
                        the Greeks but they have long gone.  
                        We can settle there.  Start over.  

                                 MEDUSA
                        What of my sisters?  I cannot leave 
                        them.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        I’ll find a way to get them.  But 
                        right now, we must pack.  Quickly.  
                        We don’t have a lot of time. 

           Medusa reluctantly starts to help Artegus pack.  Artegus goes 
           back towards Andromeda’s room.

           INT. ARTEGUS’ HOME - MAIN ROOM

           Medusa grabs belongings from the main room.  A light passes 
           by the window. 

           She looks to the window to see ATHENIAN PALACE GUARDS holding 
           torches.  They march to the front of Artegus’ home.

                                 MEDUSA
                        Artegus...ARTEGUS!

           Artegus rushes into the room.  He sees the torches.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Go to Andromeda’s room.  I will 
                        take care of them.  Go!

ARTEGUS’ HOME - SAME TIME

           Plaxio, Cadius, and a small troop of the Palace Guards BANG 
           on Artegus’ door. 

                                 PALACE GUARD #1
                        General!  General, open the door 
                        immediately!  

           Artegus opens the door.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Plaxio?  What is going on here?!  

                                 PALACE GUARD #1
                        I am sorry General, we must search 
                        the premises.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        In search of what?...

                                 PLAXIO
                        Did you think she would not find 
                        out?  Lady Athena has ordered us to 
                        search the premises for the Libyan 
                        princess Medusa.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        What have you done, Plaxio?

           Plaxio and the Athenian guards barge past him, searching the 
           small house.  Artegus watches Plaxio move through the house, 
           enraged at the betrayal.

           One of the palace guards heads towards Andromeda’s room.  
           Artegus stops him.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        My daughter is asleep. 

           The guard peers into the room.

           INT. ANDROMEDA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           In the dark room, the light slowly spills over Andromeda who 
           is fast asleep.  Andromeda stirs.

           Medusa hides on the other side of the bed in the darkness.  
           The guard steps into Andromeda’s room for a closer look as 
           the light from the main room continues to illuminate the 
           room.  He almost sees Medusa...

           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)           Artegus grabs the guard by the back of his neck, yanking him 
           out of the room.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Perhaps I was misunderstood.  My 
                        daughter is asleep!

           The guard reaches for his sword.  Artegus quickly disarms the 
           guards, and knocks out another preparing to strike.  Artegus 
           stands, holding his sword towards the other three guards.  

                                 ARTEGUS (CONT’D)
                        Soldiers.  You come here in the 
                        middle of the night with 
                        accusations.  Threaten my family.  
                        Threaten me?!  Leave my home, or I 
                        will kill you where you stand.  
                        Decide.

                                 CADIUS
                        (to Plaxio)
                        There is nothing here.

                                 PLAXIO
                        Leave him be.  Lady Athena will 
                        deal with you.  And for Medusa... 
                        she will most certainly be killed.

           The Palace Guards slowly back pedal from the home.  Artegus 
           fumes with anger.

           Artegus opens the door to his daughters room to find 
           Andromeda alone.  Andromeda looks towards the open window.

           Medusa’s Libyan necklace lays on the desk next to her bed.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Oh no.

           EXT. ROAD TO ATHENS - LATER

           Medusa sneaks through darkness back towards the palace.  The 
           palace guards’ torches can be seen in the distance behind 
           her.  

           Suddenly the earth SHAKES.  Not much.  But a small tremor.   

           We ZOOM OUT RAPIDLY away from Medusa.  The earth SKIMMING by 
           us.  We continue to travel away from them until...
                                  (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)           EXT. ATHENS - NIGHT

           We stop in another person’s POV.  He watches.  Out of view 
           from any mere mortal.  Even at this far distance he can still 
           see clearly.

           It is Poseidon.  Watching.  Staring.  From here, we partially 
           see the side of his massive frame.  The bottom of his Trident 
           has been driven into the ground.  He stares off into the 
           darkness.

           EXT. ROAD TO ATHENS - CONTINUOUS

           Medusa continues to run towards the palace ahead.

           EXT. ATHENA’S PALACE - A LITTLE LATER

           Medusa arrives to the palace and hurries up the long 
           staircase.  

           INT. ATHENA’S PALACE - NIGHT

           Medusa has just entered the palace.  She heads towards the 
           maidens quarters.  She hears another whispering voice.  

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Medusa...

           She stops.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Medusa.  It is me.  Artegus. 

           Confused, she rushes back to the palace doors.

           EXT. ATHENA’S PALACE - CONTINUOUS

           Artegus is there at the doorstep.  

                                 MEDUSA
                        (quietly)
                        What are you doing?   

           He steps into the palace and kisses her.  Slightly rougher 
           than before.  Medusa, surprised at this, kisses back.  
           Artegus enters the palace.
                                   (cid:13)                             (cid:13)

ATHENA’S PALACE - HALLWAY - LATER 

           Artegus leads Medusa deep into the palace to Athena’s sacred 
           temple.  It is enclosed by two large stone doors.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        In here.

                                 MEDUSA
                        Athena doesn’t permit anyone in the 
                        temple...

           Without hesitation, Artegus opens the door and enters.  She 
           nervously follows him in.  

           INT. ATHENA’S PALACE - ATHENA’S TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS

           The room is dim, lit only by candles.  The four Olympian 
           statues create a haunting ambiance.  Constantly staring. 

                                 MEDUSA
                        (whispering)
                        We shouldn’t be in here...what are 
                        you doing?

           He kisses her again stifling her last comments.  She kisses 
           back, reluctantly.  She knows that they should not be in this 
           holy place but she cannot help herself.

           There is something very different about Artegus.  He is more 
           aggressive.  Less sensitive.

                                 MEDUSA
                        Wait...Artegus...we should...

           The water from the large glass bowl slowly begins to rise.  
           Scattered about in the air into thin sheets of water.  It 
           hovers in the air.  

           He effortlessly lifts her off her feet and carries her over 
           to the bed.  

           In the midst of the sexual energy, Medusa feels as if 
           something is terribly wrong.  As if she is being watched.

           She is.  Altair sits high above the two in a corner.  Medusa 
           attempts to looks around, but Artegus overpowers her.  

           As she kisses him, she opens her eyes and notices something 
           far stranger.  She immediately dismisses the thought, for it 
           is too farfetched.  
                                                   (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                              (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)           Artegus’ eyes do not look like Artegus’ eyes.  They look 
           familiar, but Medusa cannot put a finger on it.  They remind 
           her of something else...someone else.  They are sharp.  
           GREEN...

           She quickly forgets as Artegus removes the rest of her 
           clothing.  He kisses her all over her naked body. 

           But still, looking into his eyes, she can’t shake the 
           feeling.  As he kisses her, she grabs his face and stares 
           directly into his eyes.

                                 MEDUSA
                        ...Poseidon?!

           He ENTERS her.  She arches her back as a bolt of electricity 
           rushes through her body.  Her veins BULGE as they are filled 
           with the god’s power.  

           She is intoxicated by his magic and has absolutely no energy 
           to stop this act.  Her eyes and limbs become heavy.  They 
           have wild sex.  She on top of him.  He on top of her.  This 
           is not ordinary sex.  He feels much more...powerful. 

           The water and has now expanded and turned into a clear mist, 
           cast throughout the temple.  It sways rhythmically.

           Altair still sits and watches her as they continue to have 
           sex.  We ZOOM IN on Altair’s wide staring eyes and into...

                                                     CUT TO:

           ATHENA’S PALACE - ATHENA’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Athena’s eyes.  She sits upright in her bed staring straight 
           ahead.  Her eyes fume with surprise and anger.  It would look 
           like she was staring at the wall, but she sees much more.  
           She sees what Altair sees. 

           She rises out of bed and FLOATS...

           EXT. ATHENA’S PALACE - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

           Outside to her balcony.  She stands at the ledge, facing the 
           West.  The night is still and quiet.   

                                 ATHENA
                        You dare defile my holy temple?!  
                        You shall feel the wrath of a power 
                        that truly has no end.  You will 
                        forever be a walking plague to

           INT. ATHENA’S PALACE - ATHENA’S TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS

           The room is calm once again.  Medusa lays next to Artegus 
           sleeping.  Artegus, wide awake, moves Medusa to the other 
           side of the bed and gets up.  

           INT. ATHENA’S PALACE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Artegus exits Athena’s temple shutting the doors behind him.  
           He turns and begins walking away from the room.  As he does, 
           he MORPHS back into his true body.  POSEIDON.

           EXT. ATHENA’S PALACE - BALCONY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Athena looks to the sky and calls upon her infinite godly 
           powers.  She begins to speak in an unidentifiable ancient 
           language and tone.  She holds her hands up to the sky and her 
           eyes begin to GLOW.  

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           The clouds darken and swarm together.  Large raindrops begin 
           pouring down onto the earth.  As the cursed drops hit the 
           ground, snakes mutate from their puddles and slither towards 
           the temple. 

           INT. ATHENA’S PALACE - ATHENA’S TEMPLE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Medusa sleeps alone in the bed as if she were drugged.  

           A long black snake peeks out from under her pillow.  It 
           slowly slithers across her face.  She swats at it 
           unconsciously.  The snake crawls across her body.  It finally 
           springs forth, gorging its teeth into her wrist.    

           She wakes up in terror grabbing at the snake.  The snake 
           slides under the covers and across her legs.  She lifts the 
           cover to discover a dozen snakes crawling across her bed.  
           She SCREAMS. 

           Blood spills from her wounded wrist.  She peels back the silk 
           drapery but the floor is gone.  What replaces it are 
           THOUSANDS of hissing snakes.

           covering Medusa.  They lunge at her, hissing and biting until 
           they’ve totally consumed her.  

           We ZOOM OUT of the canopy to the horrid SCREAMS of Medusa.  

                                                CUT TO BLACK.

           INT. ATHENA’S PALACE - ATHENA’S ROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Poseidon enters the room.  He eats an apple but finds no joy 
           in it.  Athena stares at him.  Completely calm and collected.

           Poseidon sarcastically offers the fruit to Athena.  A beat.

                                 ATHENA
                        You are like a pestering gnat, 
                        yearning for attention.  You’ve 
                        succeeded.  

           Poseidon says nothing.  Continues to chew on his apple.  

                                 ATHENA (CONT’D)
                        But I do find it quite ridiculous.  
                        A god...reduced to sorcery to 
                        ravish a mere human.    

           Athena removes her robe, revealing her flawless body and 
           slips into a long white peplos sleeping gown.  Poseidon takes 
           another bite, but Athena’s got his attention.

                                 ATHENA (CONT’D)
                        She was beautiful, wasn’t she.  We 
                        shall see how much enjoyment you 
                        receive from your fixation now.    

           Athena blows out the candle, leaving Poseidon in the dark.

           INT. ATHENA’S PALACE - ATHENA’S TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS

           We cut back to Athena’s temple.  The room which was just 
           filled with snakes is now empty.  Medusa drags herself across 
           the floor.  She makes her way into the bathing room where she 
           grabs a robe and puts it on.  

           She struggles to find her footing, but falls down again, 
           leaving trails of blood over everything she touches.  

           CLOSE UP of Medusa’s eyes.  They turn from their beautiful 
           blue hue to STONE.  Then, they turn black.  Lifeless, hollow, 
           endless, black eyes.

           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)           She agonizes as no human body should ever endure this type of 
           pain.  For a moment, her body hovers above the ground as her 
           very SOUL is torn from her body.  

           HORRID VISIONS flash before her eyes.  She sees hundreds and 
           hundreds of DEATHS of people whom she has made eye contact 
           with through the years.  It is EXCRUCIATING both mentally and 
           physically for her to witness these horrors.

           She cries with her hands covering her face.   Large wings 
           pierce her skin and BREACH from her back.

           Her hair begins to change.  One by one, her once beautiful 
           dreadlocks BURST into FLAMES, with each one giving birth to a 
           grotesque snake growing from her scalp.   

           INT. ATHENA’S PALACE - SERVANTS QUARTERS - NIGHT

           Euryale and Stheno sleep peacefully in the maidens quarters.  

           Suddenly, Euryale’s eyes SHOOT open.  Then, they roll back 
           into her head.  She begins to choke on her tongue.  The 
           maidens awake at the sound to see Euryale convulsing 
           uncontrollably.  Then, a new serpent-like tongue flickers out 
           of her mouth.  She begins to morph into a hideous creature.  
           Her teeth change into sharp tusks.  Wings burst from her back 
           and her hands change into bronze CLAWS.  In the bed across 
           from her, Stheno turns into a monster as well.  The two 
           sisters writhe in pain during their transformation.

           A maiden jumps out of the bed and rushes through the double 
           doors...  

           Only to run into a monster worse than the other two.

           We see the back of a hooded figure, looking down on the 
           unsuspecting maiden.  FEAR flashes across her face.

           Something under the hood continuously moves, unnaturally.  A 
           moment of uncertainty.  Then, a loud SHRIEK and the screen 
           QUICKLY CUTS TO BLACK. 

           A few moments pass and then...

           INT. ATHENA’S PALACE - MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS

           The sisters flee the temple, all cloaked in dark blankets.  
           They have no real answer of what has recently happened to 
           them.  They bolt through the maze-like palace, turning corner 
           after corner until two guards approach them.  
           (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)

           instincts and strength as they throw the guards against the 
           walls.

           Medusa looks into the EYES of one of her pursuers.  Before he 
           can react, his body immediately stiffens as his entire body 
           turns to STONE.  He falls over and his torso BREAKS in half.

           EXT. ATHENA’S PALACE - NIGHT

           Plaxio and the palace guards approach to see a group of 
           villagers gathered outside of the palace.  The three cloaked 
           sisters burst through the doors and outside.  Only parts of 
           their beastly, disgusting bodies can be seen.  

           A nearby villager grabs a torch and thrusts it at the three 
           sisters.

                                 MALE VILLAGER
                        Beasts!  Beasts have invaded the 
                        temple...

           He is quickly trampled as they rush past him and make it into 
           the forest.  The palace guards approach, but the sisters are 
           gone.  Plaxio and the guards enter the gates of the palace.

           Artegus arrives on his horse soon after.  He quickly 
           dismounts the steed and runs towards the front gates of the 
           palace.  Debris is scattered about.  Soldiers tend to the 
           wounded and dead.

           Artegus looks around, but there is no sign of Medusa, Stheno 
           or Euryale.  He rushes to a palace guard.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        WHAT HAPPENED HERE?!

           The palace guard has no answers.  Artegus moves past him and 
           into the gates.

           INT. PALACE COURTYARD - DAY

           Inside the gates of the palace, guards quickly cover up 
           bodies with sheets.  Artegus sees Homer.  But Homer turns his 
           back on Artegus.

                                 ARTEGUS (cont'd)
                        Homer, what happened?

           Suddenly Plaxio’s voice intervenes.

                        WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Where is she?  Where is Medusa?!

                                 PLAXIO 
                        Seize him!

           Two guards approach Artegus with swords drawn.  They grab 
           Artegus.

                                 PLAXIO
                        (reaching for his sword)
                        You are a traitor to your country.  
                        You will never see Medusa again.  

           Artegus lunges at Plaxio but is restrained by the guards.  
           Plaxio’s vest and sword begin to glow.  He snatches Medusa’s 
           Libyan necklace from Artegus’ neck.

                                 PLAXIO (CONT’D)
                        You are pathetic.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        WHERE IS SHE?!

                                 ATHENA (O.S.)
                        She is gone.

           Athena’s voice TOWERS over all other conversation.  Plaxio 
           and Artegus turn to see the Goddess standing behind them.

                                 ATHENA (CONT'D)
                        I am truly disappointed in you, 
                        Artegus.  Risking the security of 
                        Athens for a Libyan slave.  Or 
                        should I say...Princess.  Speak her 
                        name no more.  She is dead.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        You LIE!

           EVERYTHING STOPS.  Athena casually steps towards Artegus.

                                 ATHENA
                        (whispers)
                        I assure you.  The woman you knew 
                        is gone.  Forever.

           immediately SAILS backwards and THROUGH the palace doors 
           outside.  He CRASHES down into some supplies against another 
           building.  

           Athena raises her hand and Artegus is lifted off of the 
           ground.  He floats over to her.  He is semi-conscious. 

                                 ATHENA
                        You deserve death.  But I will be 
                        merciful.  You will forever wear 
                        the symbol of a traitor to your 
                        country.  Artegus, shamed son of 
                        Agregos.  You are hereby banished 
                        from Athens.  

           As he hovers in the air, Athena’s eyes GLOW.  Suddenly, the 
           skin on Artegus’ neck GLOWS as well.  It BURNS an ancient 
           symbol into his skin, the mark of a traitor.

           He drops to his knees.  Medusa’s necklace dangles in front of 
           him.  He looks up just as the butt of Plaxio’s sword SLAMS 
           against his head, knocking him out.

                                                    FADE OUT.

           EXT.  ATHENA'S BALCONY - NIGHT

           Over black.

                                 THE FATES (V.O.)
                        Ignited by Poseidon’s antagonism, 
                        Athena’s wrath was powerful...But 
                        never had it been so vicious.

                                                    FADE IN:

           We fly over the country of Greece.  We see the natural 
           shaping of the land.  We angle towards a dark isolated part 
           of the earth. 

                                 THE FATES (V.O.)
                        And the three sisters, all cursed, 
                        left the city of Athens never to 
                        return.  Turned into repulsive 
                        lurid Gorgons.  Hands of large 
                        bronze claws.  Powerful wings 
                        spread across their scaly backs.  
                        However, the one who received the 
                        most punishment from Athena’s 
                        curse...was Medusa.

                        Euryale and Stheno, furious at what 
                        their beloved sister had caused, 
                        took to the skies and flew off to a 
                        far away island.   

           A massive WING FLAPS onto the screen.  We then see Euryale 
           and Stheno FLYING away towards the moon.  

           EXT. ISOLATED CAVE - NIGHT

           ANGLE ON a dark cave.  Medusa drags herself inside.

           INT. MEDUSA’S CAVE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Medusa crawls until she can crawl no further and passes out.

                                 THE FATES (V.O.)
                        Medusa; who had finally found love, 
                        was betrayed by the lord Poseidon, 
                        cursed by the goddess Athena, and 
                        shunned by her sisters, was now 
                        forsaken.  Scarred, bloody, and 
                        maimed, she made her way to a 
                        desolate cave.

           IMAGES.  FADE IN and OUT as Medusa struggles with her new 
           cursed state.  She clumsily bumps about her cave, eyes 
           closed, afraid of her new power.  She weeps heavily in the 
           corner.  Her body shivers from the cold, her wings eventually 
           wrapping around her.  Time has passed.  She settles into her 
           cursed form.  She’s stronger now.  Lifeless, stoned, animals 
           surround the cave.  She tosses a dead deer inside.  She 
           feeds.  

                                 THE FATES (V.O.)
                        And this is where she would lay.  
                        Until she found a new strength.  
                        And power.  And a thirst for 
                        revenge.  

                                                FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. MEDUSA’S CAVE - NIGHT

           A heavy rain falls across Greece.

           Still cloaked, Medusa returns to her cave.  A small fire 
           burns in the distance.  A silhouette of someone sits near the 
           flames.  She stops.

                        Who’s there?!

           A closer look reveals an elderly man.  He etches something 
           into the walls of the cave.

                                 MAN
                        I seek shelter from the storm.  I 
                        mean you no harm.  

           Medusa stalks near this man in her cave.  Her snake hair 
           continuously moves under her hood.  

                                 MEDUSA
                        You should not be here if you value 
                        your life.

                                 MAN
                        Oh, I’ve been to hell and back.  
                        You can do no worse to me than the 
                        gods already have.

           The man turns to Medusa and we see that he has no eyes.  Just 
           HOLLOW crevices.  His face is hard and wrinkled.  It is clear 
           this man has been through much in his long life.  

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        (re: his eyes)
                        Don’t be alarmed.  I wish I could 
                        see your face.  

                                 MEDUSA
                        No.  No you don’t.  

           Medusa looks to the crude etchings on the rock.  Carvings of 
           the TITAN CRONOS, as well as ZEUS.  They are surrounded by 
           unique SYMBOLS.  Symbols that Medusa has seen before.  In the 
           glowing nose-ring of The Minotaur.

           A beat.

                                 MAN
                        (sensing her curiosity)
                        Ah, the symbols.  Ironic I suppose.  
                        Despite being blind, this is all 
                        that I see.  Over and over again.

                        I do not know.  I believe they are 
                        all that is left, of a forgotten 
                        language.  They tell of the one 
                        great being ever to render the Gods 
                        powerless.

                        The Titan CRONOS.

           Medusa looks to the etchings as they seem to come to LIFE.  
           The old man’s words speak as the etchings animate along the 
           cave’s walls.  

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        CRONOS.  Legendary ruler of the 
                        Titans.  The first of the great 
                        Deities to inhabit our world.   
                        Fearing a prophecy, he swallowed 
                        all of his children, rendering them 
                        powerless inside of his body.  Save 
                        for one.

           The crude drawing of Cronos swallows his tiny children.  They 
           are trapped within his stomach.  One, however remains.  He is 
           marked distinctly with a BOLT OF LIGHTNING.

                        Yes.  Zeus fulfilled the prophecy, 
                        and grew to be more powerful than 
                        them all.  He destroyed his 
                        father’s body...freeing his 
                        siblings in the process.

           Zeus’s body morphs into a lighting bolt and zaps the much 
           larger body of Cronos.  The body of Cronos EXPLODES.  
           Fragments scatter throughout the world.

           INT. MEDUSA’S CAVE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The rain has lightened.  Medusa sleeps near the ashes of the

                        Medusa.  Cursed and shunned by the 
                        Gods of Olympus.  A mere pawn in 
                        their selfish games.

                        is to be disregarded by the 
                        Olympians.

           Medusa rises to her feet.

           Red hot FLAMES emerge from the cave.  A large frame appears 
           within them.  He is towering and wide, in the process of 
           removing a helmet.  The source of his invisibility.  Once 
           removed, we see the full body of HADES.

                        yet to embrace it.  Harness it.  Do 
                        not fight that which consumes you.

                        HE will never love you now.

           Enraged, Medusa turns to the dark Lord.  She CHARGES forward 
           but Hades BURSTS into FLAMES.  The blaze spreads out and 
           surrounds her and the entire cave.  The flames GROW, 
           consuming everything. 

           EXT. UNDERWORLD OF HADES - SAME

           Suddenly Medusa finds herself in the underworld of HADES.    
           An endless cavern with a burning red sky.  Ancient structures 
           lie in ruins surrounded by sharp rocks and stalagmites.

           cuts its way through the middle of this underworld... THE 
           RIVER STYX.  A hooded figure steers a boat in the distance.  

           Watching Medusa are six beastly eyes from the darkness.  The 
           three-headed beast CERBERUS preys from the shadows. 

           Then, thousands and thousands of restless souls are revealed 
           in the ruins.  Constantly building onto an already massive 
           castle.  

                                 HADES
                        I can help you.  Your desire for 
                        death and revenge is undeniable...

                        deserved this fate!!

                                 HADES
                        Then do something about it.  Soon, 
                        you will be consumed.  Leaving you 
                        in darkness forever.  You have 
                        little time...

                                 MEDUSA
                        I can never get close to Artegus 
                        again.  Not without killing him.  I 
                        just want my life back. 

           Several snakes slither out of the river STYX towards Medusa.  
           Medusa sees her former BEAUTIFUL self in the reflection of 
           the dark river.  Her snake hair is gone and her beautiful 
           dreadlocks have returned.  She touches her face.  

                                 HADES
                        Expect no one to simply give it 
                        back.  You must take that which you 
                        desire.

                        Destroy the source of the curse.  
                        The gods did this to you.  SHE did

                        Your power will grow with each

                        be only one soul left to claim.  
                        Then, your true self will be 
                        revealed.

           The flames of Hades burn BRIGHT once again.  The intimidating 
           God has gone, but his voice echoes throughout the cave one 
           final time.

           INT. PARTHENON - THE NEXT DAY

           Katina walks with purpose through the halls.  She stops at 
           two large double doors.  She takes a breath before knocking.

                                 POSEIDON (O.S.)
                        Enter.

           Katina enters to find Poseidon standing naked in front of 
           her.  She immediately stops.

           Three women lay in the bed behind him.  He stands before her.  
           Unashamed.  Katina turns away from the perfect god.

                                 POSEIDON (CONT’D)
                        Have you come to join me, Katina?

                                 KATINA
                        My lord.  Athena would like to 
                        speak with you in her quarters 
                        whenever you... are available.

           Poseidon continues to gaze at Katina.  He grows bored and 
           gets back in the bed.

                                 POSEIDON
                        Tell Athena I am busy.  Get out.

           EXT. PALACE STEPS - DAY

           A group of Palace Guards gather near the steps.  Katina exits 
           the Palace and descends the stairs.  The Guards fall into 
           proper form as she passes.  

           Ahead, Katina notices some soldiers ahead harassing a tent 
           owner.  The two soldiers take fruit without payment.

                                 TENT OWNER
                        Please, I have a family. 

                                 SOLDIER 1
                        Quiet!  This is merely our tax for 
                        keeping you citizens safe.

           Katina intervenes, still frustrated from her Poseidon 
           encounter.

                                 KATINA
                        That is enough!  Lady Athena would 
                        not approve of this behavior.

                                 SOLDIER 2
                        Our apologies, Lady Katina.

           She turns and heads towards the garden.  The two soldiers 
           ease their stance.  A dark hooded figure approaches them from 
           behind.  

           Medusa has returned.

                                 MEDUSA
                        (re: Katina)
                        She can be a thorn, can’t she?

           The guards turn to her.  Her eyes, covered by the hood.

                                 SOLDIER 2
                        And you are?

                                 MEDUSA
                        An old acquaintance of Lady Athena.  
                        Could you deliver a message for me?

           Near the garden, Katina hears SCREAMS from the citizens out 
           front.  She looks up, as what appears to be TWO rather large 
           stones SKIDDING across the ground.  They come to a stop at 
           the steps.  They are the severed HEADS of the two soldiers, 
           turned completely to STONE!

           (cid:13)           The soldiers gaze on in horror.  They draw their swords and 
           look ahead to see the hooded Medusa standing several yards 
           away.  Snakes rise out of her hood, taunting the soldiers.  

                                 KATINA
                        Medusa!  Kill her!

           They charge Medusa.  The snakes WHIP Medusa’s hood back, 
           finally revealing her cursed FACE.

           Soldiers and citizens alike stop at the sight of Medusa.  The 
           ones that are not caught in her legendary gaze run for their 
           lives.  

           For the DOZENS less fortunate, they are killed within a 
           matter of minutes.  The curse quickly spreading through their 
           bodies leaving them dead and turned to complete stone. 

           Katina hurries down a nearby alley.

           EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Katina rushes through an alley of the Parthenon’s exterior 
           courtyards and comes to a fork.  One direction leads to the 
           market, where citizens run for safety.  Katina turns into a 
           tall, hedge-like path.  A maze of sorts, eventually leading 
           to the rear of the Palace.   

           She moves with familiarity until the sunlight is eclipsed by 
           the winged form of the Gorgon above.  She stops as Medusa 
           flies ahead and drops into the maze.  Katina is not alone.

           Katina takes another route within the maze.  She hears 
           movement and stops with her back against the hedge wall.  
           She’s unaware as we see Medusa’s hooded silhouette following 
           her from the other side of the wall. 

           Katina moves ahead, blindly turning corners.  Katina quietly 
           runs through a brief opening where a statue of Athena lies.  
           The statue has been CLAWED in half.  She hears guards 
           shouting from beyond the maze.  

                                 GUARDS (O.S.)
                        It’s in the maze!  Here!

           She moves towards their voices, turning a corner and ALMOST 
           runs directly into Medusa eye line.  She stops and covers her 
           mouth as not to scream.  Medusa doesn’t see her and rounds 
           another corner.  
                                                                    (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)           Katina leans back against the hedge wall to rest.  After a 
           deep breath, she notices a single snake slithering through 
           the hedge.  It rubs against her shoulder.  Her eyes open wide 
           with fear.  Within seconds, Medusa’s reptilian-like arms 
           BREACH through the hedge and snatches Katina!

           EXT. ATHENA’S PALACE - CONTINUOUS

           Athena emerges through the palace doors.  She speaks to a 
           guard.

                                 ATHENA
                        What is happening?  Where is 
                        Katina?!

           No answer from the guard.  He is nothing but STONE.  

           A nearby maiden SCREAMS at something in the sky!  Athena 
           looks above to see KATINA’S STONE BODY falling to the ground.

                                 ATHENA (CONT’D)
                        Katina?!

           The body of Katina SHATTERS into several of chunks of stone 
           as it hits the ground. 

           The FLAP of a wing is heard.  Athena looks up to see Medusa 
           soaring far off into the sky, away from the Palace.  

           EXT. HOLLOWAY VILLAGE - DAY

           To the north of holloway begins a vast forest.  Cutting 
           through the quietness, is a constant THUD. 

           I/E. FOREST - CONTINUOUS 

           Artegus chops away at a massive tree.  His beard is scruffier 
           and his face, hardened.  The mark of ATHENA is still visible 
           on his neck.  The mark of a traitor.  

           EXT. HOLLOWAY VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Artegus hauls a bundle of wood toward his hut.  Andromeda 
           comes out on the porch.  She tries to help her father.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Here.  Let me help...
                                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)

                        I’ve got it.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        You’re about to drop...

                                 ARTEGUS
                        I said I’ve got it!...

           He mishandles the logs and they tumble the ground.  Andromeda 
           hurts for her heavyhearted father. 

           He picks up one of the heavier logs and THROWS it, releasing 
           his frustration.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        DAMNIT!
                        (then, to Andromeda)
                        I’m sorry.  

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        It’s okay.  Come.  Dinner will be 
                        ready soon.  

           Andromeda, trying to stay strong for her father, holds his 
           hand and walks him inside. 

           Artegus suddenly stops.  He looks back towards the forest, 
           sensing something.  But sees nothing but the woods.  They go 
           inside.

           I/E. FOREST - SAME TIME

           We see a cloaked Medusa watching Artegus from the trees.  

           INT. ATHENA’S PALACE - COURTYARD - THAT NIGHT

           A group of artists paint an entire side of a Palace wall.  
           They depict legendary Greek gods and Titans who have been 
           cursed.

           -Atlas - the Titan who was cursed and confined to holding the 
           sky on his shoulders.  

           -Prometheus - The Titan who stole fire from Zeus and was 
           cursed by being bound to a rock while an eagle ate his liver 
           every day, only to have it grow back to be eaten again the 
           next day.
                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                           (cid:13)           -Sisyphus - the king who was cursed to roll a huge boulder up 
           a hill, only to watch it roll down again and again throughout 
           eternity.

           Athena oversees the creation of the mural with Altair perched 
           on her shoulder.  Plaxio enters.  

                                 ATHENA
                        General, Plaxio.

                                 PLAXIO
                        My Goddess.  It is an honor to be 
                        back in your graces.

           Plaxio looks to the mural.

                                 ATHENA
                        (re: the mural)
                        Devoted to those souls who have 
                        crossed the Gods.  And the 
                        punishments they have been doomed 
                        to live with.
                        (turns to Plaxio)
                        The day draws near when we gods 
                        will leave this earth and mortals 
                        will walk alone.  But the world 
                        must stable enough to stand on its 
                        own.  

           One of the artists begins to paint a head with several snakes 
           coming out of its scalp.  

                                 ATHENA (CONT’D)
                        Leave us now.

           They bow and exit, leaving Athena and Plaxio alone.  As they 
           exit, they pass Angelo.  Angelo notices Plaxio speaking with 
           the goddess Athena.  He stops and listens.

                                 ATHENA
                        She is still alive.  And has 
                        returned from exile.  She is here.  
                        In Athens.  

                                 PLAXIO
                        Medusa?  

           Angelo can’t believe his ears.

                                 PLAXIO (CONT’D)
                        Why would she return to Athens?
                           (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                 ATHENA
                        To kill me.
                        (a beat)
                        No god can kill those that they 
                        curse.  Which is why you are going 
                        to do it.

           Plaxio smirks.

                                 ATHENA (CONT’D)
                        No one is to know of this.  She 
                        dwells in the eastern forest.  Hunt 
                        her down and kill her swiftly.  

                                 PLAXIO
                        Yes, goddess.

           Plaxio exits.  Angelo emerges from the shadows.

           EXT. ATHENS - MARKETPLACE - THE NEXT DAY

           Artegus walks with Andromeda through the market in Holloway. 
           They shop for fresh produce and meat.

           Andromeda picks up a melon and holds it up to her father.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        What about this one?

                                 ARTEGUS
                        The one next to it.

           Andromeda grabs the other melon and hands it to her father.  
           A few shops over, Andromeda notices the hooded Medusa, 
           watching from the distance.  Her face is hidden by a veil, 
           which blows ever so slightly.   

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        (softly)
                        Father...

           Artegus does not hear her as he speaks to Rodimus who is 
           shopping as well.  Andromeda slowly wanders towards the 
           hooded figure.  Medusa quickly turns and walks away.

           Artegus turns back to see Andromeda gone.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Andromeda?

           His pace quickens as he grows more and more frantic.  The  
           old man from the Agora, Polydegmon, bumps into Artegus.  
                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                 ARTEGUS
                        Excuse me.  I am trying to find my 
                        daughter...

                                 POLYDEGMON
                        Artegus, son of Agregos.  Your 
                        daughter will soon die.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        What did you say?

                                 POLYDEGMON
                        You have unknowingly brought a 
                        great evil to this land and your 
                        daughter will suffer because of it.  

           Without hesitating, Artegus ferociously GRABS the old man by 
           the cloak and yanks him closer.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        What have you done with my...

           Suddenly Artegus’ hands begin to BURN from gripping the old  
           man’s cloak.  Artegus quickly releases him and looks at his 
           singed hands.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        What form of demon are you?

           Polydegmon chuckles.  

                                 POLYDEGMON
                        (whispering in his ear)
                        The cursed one grows stronger.  The 
                        only way to save your daughter is 
                        to seek the blood of the cursed.  
                        You must face your greatest fear.  
                        Only then will your daughter be 
                        saved, and the transformation 
                        complete.  

           Artegus stares at the old man.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        If you’ve harmed her in any way!  I 
                        will kill you.

           Polydegmon backs away calmly as if nothing happened.  He 
           takes a step to the side, and Andromeda is now clearly in 
           view a few feet behind where the old man just was.  

           Artegus rushes over to his daughter.  The old man disappears 
           into the crowd.  
                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                 ARTEGUS
                        Andromeda?  Are you alright?  Are 
                        you hurt?

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        There was a woman...

                                 ARTEGUS
                        ARE YOU ALRIGHT?!

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        (snaps out of it)
                        Yes.  Yes, father.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        What have I told you about 
                        wandering off like that?  Never do 
                        that again!

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        I’m sorry.  I was just...

                                 ARTEGUS
                        I don’t care what you were doing.  
                        Don’t let it happen again.  We are 
                        leaving.

           Andromeda is on the brink of tears.  They start to leave the 
           market when Andromeda turns back.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        (remembering)
                        Our melon... 

           She goes back to pick up the forgotten fruit.  As she grabs 
           it, a red SCORPION crawls out from beneath.  It STINGS 
           Andromeda’s wrist.  

                                 ANDROMEDA (CONT’D)
                        Owwwww!

           She immediately becomes dizzy, and soon falls to the ground.  
           Artegus rushes over to her. 

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Andromeda!  Andromeda.  What’s 
                        wrong?  Wake up, sweetheart.  Wake 
                        up!
                        (looks around)
                        SOMEONE HELP ME!

           Rodimus runs to help.  He feels her neck and examines her 
           body, trying to diagnose her sudden illness.
                                          (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 ARTEGUS (CONT’D)
                        Rodimus!  What’s wrong with her.

                                 RODIMUS
                        She’s been poisoned.  Bitten.

           Rodimus turns and looks around.  He spots the RED SCORPION 
           which quickly bursts into a small flame.  It is gone.  
           Rodimus’ eyes open wide.  He looks to Artegus.

                                 RODIMUS (CONT’D)
                        Something wicked is at work here.  
                        We must get her home.  Quickly.  I 
                        have medicine. 

           Artegus lifts her up.  They quickly carry her towards the 
           village.  

           EXT. FOREST - A LITTLE LATER

           Plaxio, Homer, Angelo and Theron search for Medusa.  Homer 
           notices a blood stain on a nearby tree.  He rubs his finger 
           on it, then licks it.

                                 ANGELO
                        That’s disgusting.

                                 HOMER
                        I think we’re heading in circles.

                                 ANGELO
                        You’re the tracker.  You should 
                        know these woods more than anyone.

                                 HOMER
                        Something’s different now.

                                 ANGELO
                        The village of Holloway is not far.  
                        Maybe some of the villagers there 
                        have seen the Gorgon.

           Plaxio thinks it over.  He looks at Homer who, seems lost.

                                 PLAXIO
                        Perhaps.

           EXT. ARTEGUS’ HOME - EVENING

           The sun begins to set.  Artegus paces, nervously.  Rodimus 
           emerges from the home.

           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 ARTEGUS
                        How is she?

                                 RODIMUS
                        I have tried every form of 
                        medicine.  That is all I can do to 
                        slow the poison.  I’ve never seen 
                        an illness like this.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        (a beat)
                        There was an old man in the market.
                        (looks at his hands)
                        He told me this would happen.  He 
                        spoke of the cursed one.  And that 
                        only the blood of the cursed would 
                        save her.  His voice keeps 
                        repeating in my head.  I try to 
                        make sense of it but...

           There is a commotion at the entrance of the village.  

           Plaxio and his men enter Holloway.  Homer questions the 
           villagers while children stare at Theron’s face.  Other 
           parents quickly grab their kids and take them inside.

           Artegus sees Plaxio and is immediately angered.  Artegus 
           starts his way, but Rodimus stops him.

                                 RODIMUS
                        Don’t do it.  You have more 
                        important things to worry about.  

           They watch as Plaxio and Theron enter the local tavern to 
           question villagers.  

           After a moment, Angelo approaches Artegus and Rodimus on his 
           horse.

                                 ANGELO
                        Artegus.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        What is he doing here?  How can you 
                        serve him?  After what he’s done?

                                 ANGELO
                        I am a servant of Athens, Artegus.  
                        You know this better than anyone.  

           Artegus turns to walk away.

                        She is still alive, Artegus.
                        (a beat)
                        Medusa.  

           Artegus slowly turns.  Shocked.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        What did you say?

                                 ANGELO 
                        Things are not what they seem, 
                        Artegus.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Medusa...she is alive?  How can 
                        this be?  I looked everywhere...

                                 ANGELO
                        She was cursed by Athena.  Turned 
                        into this... monster.  I’m afraid 
                        she is not the Medusa you remember.  
                        She killed Katina and dozens of 
                        Palace Guards and citizens alike.  
                        Turned them to solid stone just by 
                        looking at them.  By orders of 
                        Athena, we have been ordered to 
                        track her down and kill her.  
                        (a beat)
                        I’m sorry, Artegus.  

           INT. TAVERN - SAME

           Plaxio and Theron enter the local pub.  Conversations 
           immediately diminish as the general orders an ale.

                                 PLAXIO
                        (to the villagers)
                        We are here on official orders from 
                        Athena, Goddess of Wisdom and War.  
                        We are looking for the creature 
                        that attacked the palace yesterday.  
                        If you have any information of her 
                        whereabouts...speak now.

           The room is silent.  Suddenly the door swings open revealing 
           a figure in a dark robe.  The figure proceeds towards Plaxio.  
           Theron reaches for his sword, however, the figure removes his 
           hood, revealing the old man, POLYDEGMON.  Plaxio nods to 
           Theron to lower his guard.

                        Pardon me, General, could I bother 
                        you for a coin piece?  

           Plaxio stares at this odd, old man.

                                 POLYDEGMON (CONT’D)
                        I have only one, and I would like a 
                        cold ale.  I have been traveling 
                        for many moons.

           Plaxio nods to Theron, who tosses the man another coin.

                                 POLYDEGMON (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, kindly.  Now I have 
                        two...

           He holds them up, covering his eyes.

                                 POLYDEGMON (CONT’D)
                        One for each eye.

           He chuckles.

                                 PLAXIO
                        You have your change, old man, now 
                        leave us be.  Before I grow angry.

                                 POLYDEGMON
                        As you wish, General.  You should 
                        save your strength for the 
                        creature.

                                 PLAXIO
                        What do you know of the creature?

                                 POLYDEGMON
                        It is what you seek, is it not?  I 
                        know where it dwells.  I can show 
                        you the way.

           INT. ARTEGUS’ HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Arcee hovers over Andromeda, who falls in and out of 
           consciousness.  Artegus sits in a chair, blankly staring at 
           her.  Angelo and Rodimus hover over him.

                                 RODIMUS
                        Perhaps this is the only way, 
                        Artegus.  Her cursed blood may be 
                        the only cure.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        My daughter is poisoned.  You now 
                        tell me that Medusa is still alive, 
                        but now a monster, terrorizing 
                        Athens.  And the only way to save 
                        my daughter is to kill the one I 
                        love?  Is that it?

                                 ANGELO
                        If we... 
                        (a beat)
                        If there is any blood, I will bring 
                        it to you.  I promise you.

           No response.

                                 ANGELO (CONT’D)
                        I cannot imagine how difficult this 
                        must be.  But I felt you deserved 
                        to know the truth.

           Artegus slowly nods.  Angelo looks to the window.  He sees 
           Plaxio and the others mounting their horses.

                                 ANGELO (CONT’D)
                        I must go.  
                        (a beat)
                        What will you do.

           Artegus stands and hugs his friend.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Please be careful, old friend.  

           Artegus turns and walks to Andromeda.  Angelo wants to say 
           something, but doesn’t.  He leaves.  

           A beat.  Artegus slowly pats his daughters forehead.  He 
           whispers.

                                 ARTEGUS (CONT’D)
                        Wake up Andromeda.  I need to take 
                        you with me.  I’m going to make you 
                        all better.  I promise.

           Artegus wakes Andromeda.  He picks her up and carries her 
           towards the door.  She is weak, but responds.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Where are we going Father?

                        A dark place, of last resort.  

           EXT. ARTEGUS’ HOME - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT  

           Artegus carries Andromeda outside.  He looks to the entrance 
           of the village where Plaxio, Angelo, Theron and Homer ride 
           off on their horses.  The old man rides with Homer.  

           Artegus walks to the other side of his home.  His horse waits 
           inside a small stable.  He places Andromeda atop the horse.  
           Rodimus and Arcee come outside.

                                 RODIMUS
                        You’re going, aren’t you?

                                 ARTEGUS
                        I have to, Rodimus.  I have to save 
                        her.

                                 RODIMUS
                        Which one?

           A beat.  Artegus mounts his horse without answering.  Rodimus 
           realizes that Artegus has no sword.

                                 RODIMUS (CONT’D)
                        You do not have your sword. 

                                 ARTEGUS
                        If it truly is Medusa, then I do 
                        not need a sword.  

           Artegus pauses.  He looks to Andromeda. 

                                 ARTEGUS (CONT’D)
                        I have to do this.  

           Artegus guides his horse towards the eastern forest, 
           following at a far distance behind Plaxio, Angelo, Theron and 
           Homer.

           EXT. EASTERN FOREST - NIGHT   

           Homer, riding with the old man, leads the way down a hill and 
           into the forest.  Plaxio, Theron, and Angelo, follow.

           After a full evening of travel, Plaxio and the others reach a 
           small opening in the trees.

                        What is your name, old man?

                                 OLD MAN
                        I have been called many things in 
                        my lifetime.  But you can call 
                        me... Polydegmon.  

           Theron whispers to Plaxio.

                                 THERON
                        I do not trust him.  

                                 PLAXIO
                        You only have to deal with him a 
                        little longer.  He will lead us to 
                        the creature, and that will be the 
                        last thing he ever does.

           Homer stops.  The temperature is noticeably colder now.  
           Their breath mists in front of their faces.

                                 ANGELO
                        What is it?

                                 HOMER
                        This is the first stretch where I 
                        can see or hear nothing.
                        (a beat)
                        No birds, animals, insects.  
                        Nothing.  Where have you brought 
                        us?

                                 POLYDEGMON
                        Not much further.  

           Ahead in their path is a large bear that has been turned to 
           stone.  They pass the lifeless animal. 

                                 POLYDEGMON (CONT’D)
                        We are here.

           As they draw nearer, the amount of lifeless stoned beasts 
           increases.  The temperature is incredibly colder.  Ahead is a 
           large cave opening at the foot of a mountainside.

                                 POLYDEGMON (cont'd) (CONT’D)
                        There it is.  

           Polydegmon points to a dark opening in the mountain.  

                                 PLAXIO

           trees.  They walk to the opening, weaving their way between 
           the plethora of deceased animals.  

           The opening to the cave sits atop a hill, connected to the 
           roots of the mountain.  Two tall decaying statues of men 
           support the opening.  Both statues have tormented expressions 
           and their hands claw at their faces.  

           The old man stops and allows the soldiers to pass him.  

                                 POLYDEGMON 
                        Ahead lies your destiny, General.  
                        I will go no further. 
                        (a beat)
                        I suppose you will need these more 
                        than I.

           The old man tosses the two coins from earlier back at the 
           general.  They land in the grass near Plaxio’s feet.

                                 PLAXIO
                        You are correct.  Because now that 
                        you have fulfilled your purpose, 
                        there is really no need for you to 
                        exist...

           He turns, SLINGING a knife at the old man.  But it finds 
           nothing but the bark of a tree.   The old man is GONE!  The 
           other men turn and look for him but he is nowhere to be 
           found.

                                 HOMER
                        Where...?  

                                 ANGELO
                        Never mind him.  We must move on. 

                                 PLAXIO 
                        I WILL BE BACK FOR YOU, OLD MAN.  
                        DO YOU HEAR?  NO ONE TAUNTS ME!!

           Plaxio lights a long torch in one hand and draws his sword in 
           the other.  He turns to his men.  

                                 PLAXIO (cont'd) (CONT’D)
                        When we find her.  Remember, the 
                        kill is mine.  

           The men enter the cave.  In the forest, HADES’ sinister laugh 
           is heard once again.

MEDUSA’S CAVE - DARKNESS

           The cave is a dark, hollow, wicked place.  The cave begins as 
           a short narrow tunnel and then opens up into a round dome.  A 
           small fire throbs in a metallic bowl in the center of this 
           room.  

           They each light a torch of their own.  Homer notices an 
           inscription carved crudely into the rocks.  

                                 ANGELO
                        What does it say?

                                 HOMER
                        (reading)
                        Only...the cursed...shall pass.

           The men arise out of the tunnel into another room.  A fork in 
           the darkness divides the cave into four different 
           passageways.  

                                 PLAXIO
                        Each of us will take a path.  If 
                        you reach her first, signal for 
                        backup.  

           The men look at each other before they embark on their paths.  
           This will be the last time they see each other alive.  

           Our POV switches back and forth from each warrior.  QUICK 
           SHOTS as the men, swords unsheathed, search the cave for 
           Medusa.  But they find nothing.  

           Homer is startled as he bumps into something.  He quickly 
           waves his torch to reveal a tormented STATUE.  What was once 
           a man, is now nothing but stone.   He quickly exits the room, 
           only to bump into Angelo.

                                 ANGELO
                        Anything?

                                 HOMER
                        (shaking his head)
                        Nothing alive at least...

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Artegus arrives to the clearing that Plaxio and his men 
           stopped at, moments earlier.  He notices the drop in 
           temperature.

           further from the cave.  Keeping her far enough away from any 
           danger.  He whispers to her.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Andromeda.  We’re here.  Under no 
                        circumstances are you to leave this 
                        horse.    
                        (a beat)
                        I love you.  Just hang on a little 
                        longer.  I’ll be back.  I promise.  

           He kisses Andromeda on the forehead and re-situates her so 
           she’s comfortable.  He looks to the cave’s entrance.

           INT. MEDUSA’S CAVE - MAIN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Inside the cave, Plaxio discovers Medusa’s chamber.  It is 
           large with columns supporting the cave throughout the room.  
           Torches are lit throughout the room, making it much brighter 
           than the rest of the cave.

           Still, no sign of Medusa.  Plaxio has had enough.  

                                 PLAXIO
                        (Shouting)
                        Come forth Gorgon!  I know you are 
                        here!  I can smell your fear.    

           No response.  Just a constant drip of water, a chilly breeze, 
           and Plaxio’s echoing voice.

                                 PLAXIO (CONT’D)
                        Afraid to face me, MEDUSA?  
                        (a beat)
                        Yes, I know who you are, Libyan.  
                        Or who you were.  You are an 
                        abashment.  Abandoned by those you 
                        thought loved you.  Your sisters.  
                        Artegus.

           QUICK SHOTS: Angelo, Theron and Homer have all paused in 
           their separate paths.  Listening for a response.

                                 PLAXIO (CONT’D)
                        You are a coward.  Just as Artegus 
                        was.  

           Suddenly the air appears to be sucked out of the cave.  An 
           eerie silence fills the cave.

           having taken it from Artegus.  

                                 PLAXIO (CONT’D)
                        (prodding)
                        You hold on to an idea that is no 
                        longer possible.  Artegus is dead, 
                        Medusa!   And this pathetic 
                        necklace of yours is all that is 
                        left of him.  Come out, so you may 
                        join him in Hades.

           THEN, out of the darkness... There is a deep inhale followed 
           by a shrieking SCREAM! It BELLOWS throughout the cave.  

           EXT. MEDUSA’S CAVE - SAME

           Even outside the cave, Artegus hears the horrid shriek.

           INT. MEDUSA’S CAVE - CONTINUOUS

           SUDDENLY, the cave is filled with the sounds of movement.  
           The wind has picked up and the temperature drops more and 
           more.  The sounds draw closer, booming louder and louder.

           Plaxio’s armor begins to glow.

           INT. MEDUSA’S CAVE - PATH OF HOMER - DARKNESS

           Homer waves his torch in every direction.  Trying to get a 
           grasp on the impending sounds. 

           A quiet SLITHERING noise startles him.

           Homer turns around.  He raises his torch high in the air, but 
           sees nothing.  The SOUND returns, however he still cannot 
           place it.

                                 HOMER
                        I hate snakes.

           Then, a snake lowers itself down from behind Homer.  It 
           sniffs him with its serpent tongue.    

           Homer quickly turns around and seizes the snake!  He pulls 
           his torch towards the snake.  

                                 HOMER (CONT’D)
                        Got you, you little...
           (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)
           (cid:13)           Suddenly the snake draws unnatural strength from its source 
           and pulls itself back up, raising Homer off of his feet.  
           Homer SCREAMS as he is pulled above.   

           Above, his torch reveals MEDUSA, clinging to cave’s ceiling.  
           The snake emanating from her head.  The other snakes quickly 
           rise to the attention of Homer.  They all LUNGE towards him, 
           DIGGING into his flesh!

           We hear Homer’s final scream as it echoes throughout the 
           different corridors of the cave.

           INT. MEDUSA’S CAVE - PATH OF THERON - DARKNESS

           Homer’s scream makes its way into the path of Theron.  Theron 
           turns around as a gust of wind accompanies the sound. 

                                 THERON
                        Homer?

           Theron quickly retraces his path back to the source of the 
           scream.  He follows the path to the same chamber.  Homer’s 
           torch rolls to a stop at Theron’s feet.   

           He walks further into the chamber.  He shines his light 
           across the entire room. There is blood splattered all over 
           the walls of the cave.  

           He turns to discover a statue staring directly at him.  This 
           startles him and he almost strikes it with his sword.  He 
           leans closer to the statue... revealing that it is Homer, or 
           what is left of him.  Chunks of flesh have been gouged from 
           his face.  He misses an arm as well.  Theron’s torchlight 
           reveals dozens of statues of warriors from the past.  

           He lodges his torch in the wall to free his other hand.  
           Theron removes his mask, revealing the other half of his 
           disfigured face.  He then removes his armor and draws another 
           sword. 

                                 THERON (CONT’D)
                        I sense your presence, foul beast.  

           A HISSING sound echoes off the walls.  He stays close to the 
           flame, rotating slowly to cover all angles.  Nothing.

           Silence.  After a moment, a demonic voice whispers out over 
           him.

                                 MEDUSA (O.S.)
                        I see your future... It ends now.
                                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)           From above, we see Medusa crawling along the ceiling above 
           Theron.  She lunges down on him as he swipes at her with his 
           sword, barely missing.  

           Medusa lunges at Theron giving him a quick glance of her 
           eyes!  Theron, however manages to kick Medusa, knocking her 
           back into the shadows.  He looks around, waiting for the 
           creature to return.  

           He begins coughing.

                                 THERON 
                        I am not like the others, you will 
                        not slay me as easily.

           Her voice speaks from the darkness.

                                 MEDUSA
                        You are just like the others.  No 
                        different.

           Theron pinpoints the Gorgon and attempts to move forward, 
           however his FEET have turned to STONE.  He looks down with 
           the torch as they slowly begin to solidify.  The curse slowly 
           makes its way up his body.  

           Furious, he refuses to give up.  He tries to move forward 
           causing his leg to BREAK AWAY from his foot.   He GROWLS in 
           pain.  He continues forward and breaks away his other leg as 
           well.  This causes him to collapse to the ground.  He looks 
           up.  Medusa stands in front of him.

           A light emerges from the far corner.  It is Angelo, running 
           into the room.

                                 ANGELO
                        Theron...is that you?

           He shines his light towards the center of the room, where the 
           lifeless body of Theron lies.  Medusa kneels over him.  

           Snakes WHIP VIOLENTLY from the back of her head.  She stands 
           up and turns towards Angelo.  Angelo immediately turns and 
           runs in the opposite direction.

                                 ANGELO (CONT’D)
                        PLAXIO!  SHE’S HERE.  SHE’S COMING!

           Medusa chases Angelo down yet another corridor lit with 
           torches.  She is abnormally fast, crawling along the walls.  
           Just as she is within striking distance, Angelo FALLS DOWN a 
           secret passageway within the ground.  He tumbles down hitting 
           the ground below.  
                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)           Medusa stands at the top of the passageway.  Her face is 
           still obscured from our view.  We hear Plaxio cry out from 
           far off screen.

                                 PLAXIO (O.S.)
                        ANGELO?  WHERE ARE YOU?

           Medusa turns towards Plaxio’s voice.

           INT. MEDUSA’S CAVE - PATH OF PLAXIO - CONTINUOUS

           We return to Plaxio, who stands waiting.  He clutches the 
           eagle headed handle of his sword.  

                                 PLAXIO
                        ANGELO!

           Plaxio drops his torch and arms himself with his shield.   
           There is a constant shadow that moves, just beyond the 
           candlelight.  

           A loud SHRIEK is heard as Medusa DIVES at Plaxio from the 
           shadows.  Plaxio’s armor pulsates as it senses the danger.  
           He jumps out of the way and counters with a swipe at Medusa, 
           barely missing her.  Medusa SCREAMS in anger and backhands 
           Plaxio, sending him hurling into the cave’s wall.  

           Her wrath is out of control!  She charges at him with 
           shrieking rage.  Plaxio is able to rise to his feet and dodge 
           her attack.  

           He strikes again, this time slicing her arm.  She steps back 
           into the shadows in pain.

                                 PLAXIO (CONT’D)
                        Your emotions have the best of you.  
                        I will enjoy killing you, almost as 
                        much as I did him.  

           His armor glows, he knows where she is.  He turns and swipes 
           with his sword.   This time, Medusa grabs his arm, stopping 
           the sword only inches away from her face.  With her other 
           arm, she grabs Plaxio by the throat, lifting him off the 
           ground.  He drops his sword as he tries to pry himself free 
           of her deathly grasp. The snakes under her hood slowly push 
           her hood back to reveal her face.  A WRATHFUL Medusa speaks 
           as she slowly crushes his neck.

                                 MEDUSA
                        I will destroy you, General.  And 
                        this world will crumble.

Despite her Gorgon curse, there is 
           still a part of her that is still irresistible to man.

                                 MEDUSA (CONT’D)
                        Look at me.  You know you want to.

           Plaxio is intoxicated almost.  Unable to fight it... Plaxio 
           slowly begins to look.  He in entranced.  

                                 PLAXIO
                        (weakly)
                        NOOOO!

           Angelo arrives, but it is too late.  He can do nothing.

           As Plaxio stares into her beautiful, yet wicked eyes, he sees 
           horrid FLASHES of death and screaming.  Past and present as 
           the eyes of Medusa destroy Plaxio’s very soul.  

           A QUICK FLASH of a pre-cursed Medusa.  Her eyes are shut.  
           She is beautiful.  But within seconds her hair burns into 
           flames.  Her eyes OPEN, revealing a dozen men and women.  
           Their tormented souls scream, reaching for help.

           BACK TO SCENE: Plaxio’s eyes fill up with a grey liquid, 
           quickly drying into STONE.  The curse then spreads like a 
           plague from his eyes outward towards the rest of his face.  
           Soon his entire face is consumed, followed by his neck, and 
           then down through the rest of his body.  

           Medusa snatches her necklace from his dying hand.  Within 
           seconds, where a man once knelt, now lays a lifeless statue 
           of Plaxio.

           Angelo catches a glimpse of Medusa’s face and immediately 
           begins to vomit.  He turns and runs away, retracing the way 
           he came.  

           As he runs, he develops a noticeable limp which slows his 
           stride.  His breath also begins to shorten, but he struggles 
           on.

           EXT. MEDUSA’S CAVE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Artegus approaches the cave.  Then suddenly, Angelo stumbles 
           into the night.  He is out of breath and limping badly.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Angelo!

           Artegus runs to his friend who collapses in front of him.  
           Angelo drops his sword as Artegus embraces him.

           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                 ARTEGUS (CONT’D)
                        Angelo.  You’re hurt.  Where?

                                 ANGELO
                        (coughing)
                        It is too late...

           Artegus looks to his body as it slowly turns to stone.  By 
           now, Angelo can hardly speak.  His lips are solid and just 
           before his entire body and face turn, he utters his last 
           words.

                                 ANGELO (CONT’D)
                        She’s coming Artegus.  She’s...
                        (a beat)
                        Her eyes.   Don’t look into her 
                        eyes!

           Angelo lets out one final breath as he succumbs to the cruse.  
           His body turns to stone in Artegus’s arms.  Artegus quickly 
           backs off.  He checks his hands and body, realizing that the 
           curse does not spread.

           He hears something from within the cave.  Andromeda who 
           watches from the distance.   Her eyes open wide as something 
           emerges into the night.  

           A hooded Medusa stands at the cave’s entrance.  

                                 MEDUSA
                        Athena sends another soldier to 
                        die.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        I am not here on behalf of Athena.  
                        I seek the blood of the cursed one.

                                 MEDUSA
                        You have found her.

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Medusa.  
                        (a beat)
                        Is...is that you?  

           Medusa raises her head slightly at the sound of his voice.

                                 ARTEGUS (CONT’D)
                        It is me.  Artegus...

                        Artegus?!  NO.  It cannot be.  He 
                        killed you.  ANOTHER TRICK OF THE 
                        GODS?!?  SENT TO TAUNT ME!?!  

           Medusa grows furious.  But Artegus is shocked as he realizes 
           that this truly is Medusa.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        It is me, Medusa.  And I know that 
                        it is you.  Somehow...that is you.  
                        I...I can’t believe it.

                                 MEDUSA
                        YOU LIE!  YOU ARE NOT ARTEGUS!!

                                 ARTEGUS
                        Medusa!  Listen to me.  It is me, 
                        Artegus.  Father of Andromeda.  And 
                        she is sick and you are her only 
                        hope...  

           Her eyes PIERCE through her veil.  The snakes begin to pull 
           back her hood.

                                 ARTEGUS (CONT’D)
                        The eyes...

           Medusa LUNGES into the air, wings fully extended.  Artegus 
           quickly pulls out a large knife as Medusa descending upon 
           him!

           Medusa descends on Artegus.  He closes his eyes and thrusts 
           his knife and STABS Medusa in the right side of her chest.  
           She swats him with her powerful tail, sending him crashing 
           into a tree.  She howls in pain and stumbles backwards.

           Medusa tries to pull the knife from her body but breaks the 
           handle from the blade.  She then pulls the blade out of her 
           body and tosses it.

           Artegus lay face down.  Andromeda can only watch with wide 
           eyes from behind a nearby tree.   She grows anxious.  She 
           sees the blade that Artegus stabbed Medusa with only moments 
           before.  It lies on the ground only a few feet away, covered 
           in the Gorgon’s blood.

           Medusa prepares to attack again.  

                                 MEDUSA
                        How dare you take his form!  You 
                        will pay for this deception!

           (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)           Her snakes prepare to feast.  With the last of her strength, 
           Andromeda leaps up from behind her and STABS Medusa in the 
           back.  Medusa SHRIEKS as the blade pierces through her skin.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Father!!

           Medusa turns and backhands Andromeda, knocking her to the 
           ground.  This abrupt action causes the bloody blade to SLICE 
           Andromeda’s hand wide open.  Andromeda cries in pain.

           His daughter’s screams causes Artegus to regain 
           consciousness.

           ANGLE ON Andromeda’s hand.  The blood from Medusa merges with 
           Andromeda’s own and Medusa’s blood enters Andromeda’s body.  
           The veins from Andromeda’s neck begin to subdue.  She already 
           begins to heal.

           Artegus runs and LEAPS on Medusa’s back.  Suddenly...Medusa 
           crouches and then LAUNCHES them both into the sky! 

           EXT. SKY - NIGHT  

           With each powerful flap of her wings, she flies them both 
           higher and higher into the sky.

           Once they are high enough, Medusa decides to drop Artegus.  
           She releases him, but he does not fall.  He grabs a hold of 
           her necklace!

           From that, Artegus quickly grabs onto her legs.  As he 
           secures his grip, the necklace breaks free and falls to the 
           Earth below.

           We FOLLOW the necklace as it lands, sticking in the ground 
           next to a frightened Andromeda.

           BACK TO the action in the air.  Artegus draws another knife, 
           STABBING through Medusa’s right wing.  She HISSES in pain as 
           the two begin to lose altitude.  He climbs higher onto her 
           back, forcing her other wing to succumb.  With that, the two 
           begin to FREE FALL towards the ground below.

           EXT. GROUND - CONTINUOUS

           Andromeda, with necklace in hand, looks up at the air-born 
           struggle, as they begin to fall with gaining momentum.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        FATHER!!!
                                                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)           EXT. SKY - CONTINUOUS

           As they fall, the two battle with one another in the air, 
           exchanging PUNCHES and STABS as they fall faster and faster 
           to the ground. 

           Medusa is able to turn herself and fight Artegus face to 
           face.  He closes his eyes and at that moment, a vision 
           flashes across the screen.

           It is a VISION of memories past as her eyes PIERCE his soul.  
           We see a vision of Artegus and Medusa in Libya.  They kiss 
           passionately in secret.

           Back to the battle.  The two continue to fight in the air.  
           Her snake hair snaps at Artegus! 

           Another VISION.  Medusa and Artegus laugh as they watch 
           Andromeda play with a group of her friends.

           Back to the battle.  Medusa is able to break one wing free 
           and slow their decent, but only mildly.  Artegus struggles to 
           the top of Medusa as they free fall.  

           Another VISION flashes.  Medusa dances with Artegus in 
           Holloway.  Another VISION shows the two of them kissing, 
           unclothed on the floor of Artegus’ home. 

           In the air, Artegus’ eyes open and he has no other choice but 
           to look directly into Medusa’s eyes.  We cut to another 
           VISION.

           This time, we are surrounded by a faint white glow.  Heaven-
           like.  Medusa and Artegus are both human and unscathed.  
           Naked and pure.  They stand looking at each other.  Finally, 
           they realize the unimaginable; that they stare into the eyes 
           of the one they ONCE loved.  The one they will always love.

           This vision slowly fades and we are brought back to reality 
           as Artegus and Medusa still realize who the other is.  They 
           end their struggle and let gravity take them towards the 
           earth.  A moment of peace.  

           Medusa’s cave is directly beneath them now.  Her wing still 
           manages to slow their fall, but not enough...

           Time slows.  Only the winds are heard as Artegus and Medusa 
           CRASH through the cave’s ceiling.

           Andromeda is in shock.  She watches from outside the cave as 
           the dust settles.  Something moves in the rubble.  

           She backs up, in fear of the creature but to her surprise, it 
           is her father.  Artegus stumbles out of the cave, barely 
           alive and covered in dust.  He stumbles towards Andromeda.  
           He drops to his knees.  

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Father!  I thought you were dead.  
                        We must hurry home...

                                 ARTEGUS
                        ...Andromeda...there is not much 
                        time.

           As Andromeda hugs her father, she realizes his body begins to 
           get cold and stiff.  His arms are beginning to slowly turn to 
           stone.  She looks up to his face, as he is already well aware 
           of what is transpiring.  He looks up to her, and forces a 
           smile.  

                                 ARTEGUS (cont'd)
                        It is alright Andromeda.  
                        Everything will be alright.
                        (a beat)
                        Go...you must go...now.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Father, please... I...

                                 ARTEGUS
                        (weakened)
                        Go, Andromeda.  Have no fear.  I 
                        will always watch over you.  I love 
                        you.  I always have.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        I love you, father.

           Andromeda hears another noise from the cave.  She tearfully 
           stands up and runs back to her horse, hidden in the trees.

           Medusa emerges from the cave.  She is battered and bruised, 
           but already she begins to heal.  She slowly walks towards 
           Artegus.

           She leans over her former love.  She watches him, regretfully 
           knowing she cannot avoid the inevitable.

                        (softly)
                        Artegus...  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        It’s okay.  I understand now.
                        (a beat)
                        I always knew you were alive...

                                 MEDUSA
                        ...I love you.  

                                 ARTEGUS
                        We will be together again...

           Then, Artegus’ eyes fill up with the grey liquid that will 
           eventually spread through his body.

                                 ARTEGUS (CONT’D)
                        I love...

           Our POV pushes INSIDE his body.  We watch as the curse turns 
           his organs, bones, and all other bodily fluids to stone.  The 
           last thing to go is his heart.  His heart slows its beating 
           as it succumbs to the curse as well.  Finally, it stops 
           beating and is completely stone.  With one final pump of his 
           heart, it produces a small crack in the stone.  We move out 
           of his body to see his face breathe its last and final 
           breath.  

           Artegus is gone.

           Medusa looks to the sky and SCREAMS.  She then takes to the 
           sky! 

           EXT. ATHENA’S PALACE - SAME TIME

           Medusa’s scream travels all the way to Athens.  Altair swoops 
           down to Athena’s shoulder, who is alarmed.

           EXT. FOREST - SAME TIME

           Andromeda, now healed, races through the forest on her 
           Father’s horse.  She races towards Holloway.

           EXT. ATHENA’S PALACE - COURTYARD - A LITTLE LATER

           Palace Guards patrol the entrance to the palace.  Suddenly, 
           Medusa lands on the grounds in front of the Parthenon.  
           Palace Guards immediately engage.

                        You!  Identify yourself at once!

                                 MEDUSA
                        (loud whisper)
                        MEDUSA!

           She smashes through them, sending a few of them CRASHING into 
           the doors of the Palace.  More soldiers attack.

                                 ANOTHER PALACE GUARD
                        ATTACK!

           Medusa closes her eyes for a moment.  When she opens them, 
           concentrated beams shoot from her eyes.  The beams strike the 
           men immediately, turning them to stone.  She marches on, 
           crushing any statue in her way.  A second blast to the now 
           lifeless statues destroys them.

           Soldiers from all sides of the palace converge on her.  
           Medusa centers herself near the fountain.  Soldiers continue 
           to attack, but to no avail.  Most are BLASTED to stone and 
           dust by her cursed vision.  Others are clawed and hurled 
           through the air.  

           SUDDENLY, a gust of wind forms into a cyclone and engulfs 
           Medusa.  She is trapped. 

                                 ATHENA (O.S.)
                        THAT IS ENOUGH, MEDUSA!!

           Medusa looks around but the constant winds dwarfs her 
           perspective. 

           EXT. ATHENA’S BALCONY - SAME

           Athena stands on her balcony, controlling the cyclone with 
           her hands.  

                                 ATHENA
                        YOU HAVE CHALLENGED ME FOR THE LAST 
                        TIME!  YOU MUST BE DESTROYED!

                                 MEDUSA
                        Destroy me?   YOU CREATED ME!

                                 ATHENA
                        SILENCE!  Your reign of terror has 
                        come to an end.

COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

           The spiraling walls of the cyclone begin closing in on 
           Medusa.  She screams in wrath and channels even MORE POWER 
           from within.  She BLASTS her cursed beam at the fountain 
           below.

                                 ATHENA
                        THE FOUNTAIN!  NO!!

           Athena loses concentration for a slight moment, and Medusa 
           breaks THROUGH the engulfing winds.  The cyclone spirals out 
           of control and travels through a group of soldiers before 
           Athena can stop it.  

                                 MEDUSA
                        I SHALL HAVE MY REVENGE!

           Medusa soars into the sky.  Athena raises her arm as a BLAST 
           of WHITE ENERGY shoots out from her palm.  The blast ZAPS 
           Medusa from the sky.  She crashes into the woods just outside 
           of the city.  

                                 ATHENA
                        I will put an end to this once and 
                        for all!

           EXT. FOREST - A LITTLE LATER

           Medusa CRASHES into the ground.  As she collects herself, the 
           winds suddenly begin to pick up.

                                 ATHENA (O.S.)
                        You are powerful.  But not nearly 
                        as powerful as I.  

           Medusa turns to find ATHENA standing through a gathering of 
           trees.  Athena’s eyes start to glow and the winds gain speed.   
           The TREES start to BOW outward, making a tunnel towards 
           Medusa.  They continue to curve until a clear path forms 
           between the two rivals.

           The winds force Medusa backwards.  She digs her claws into a 
           nearby tree as not to blow away. 

           Then, a single tree RIPS itself from the ground, followed by 
           another.  And another.  Athena motions towards Medusa and the 
           trees are hurled through the air at the Gorgon.  Medusa 
           gracefully dodges the attacks.

           to fly to the sky but the winds are too strong.  She falls on 
           her back.  A large tree descends upon her.  Medusa closes her 
           eyes....

           SUDDENLY the tree BURSTS into flames and disintegrates into 
           ash.

           The two women turn to discover LORD HADES.  He steps in front 
           of Medusa.

                                 HADES
                        There will be no more of that, 
                        Athena.  She belongs to me now...

                                 ATHENA
                        Stand aside, Lord Hades.  This is 
                        none of your concern.

                                 HADES
                        Oh, but it is.  I’ve got plans for 
                        this one.  And if you desire her, 
                        you will have to get through me.  

           The body of Hades begins to glow with fire.  Soon his entire 
           body is engulfed in flames.  Medusa backpedals to escape the 
           heat. 

           The flames from Hades move with life.  Like a living serpent 
           of fire it grows larger and larger.  The flames begin to 
           spread to the surrounding trees, igniting them.

                                 ATHENA
                        I will NOT back down from you!

           A light emerges from her two hands. Her SWORD and SHIELD form 
           from the light.

                                 HADES
                        You should.

           Athena’s entire body glows as a cyclone of wind forms around 
           her.  

           Hades HURLS powerful balls of fire towards Athena, who blocks 
           them with her shield.  She stumbles with each powerful block.  
           The deflected flames ignite the forest behind her.   

           Athena directs her winds towards Hades, slowly suffocating 
           his flames.  With a nod of her head, Athena rips several 
           trees out of the ground and SLAMS them down atop Hades.  
           Medusa watches from behind a rock.

The 
           explosion sends out a fiery SHOCK WAVE which travels 
           throughout Athens.  Athena is knocked back, causing her sword 
           to fly out of her hands, landing near Medusa.

           She crashes and lands roughly thirty feet away.  She looks to 
           Hades, fatigued.  Hades looks to her, wanting more.  Medusa 
           looks to Athena, and then to the glowing sword that lies 
           within reach.  The moment is still.  Quiet.

           Athena CHARGES at Hades and Hades at her!  Medusa leaps up, 
           ripping the sword from the ground.  She HURLS it at Athena!  
           The entire scene SLOWS to a crawl as the two Gods draw closer 
           to one another.  The same goes for the sword, aimed directly 
           at Athena.  The three come within a couple feet of each other 
           before a faint cracking surge of WHITE LIGHT appears between 
           them.  The white light branches out like a root more and more 
           until it is revealed to be BOLT OF LIGHTNING!  

           Resuming full speed, the bolt of lighting CRASHES DOWN 
           electrocuting the two Gods as well as the sword.  The sword 
           deflects into the ground while Hades is sent tumbling 
           backwards, slamming into a massive boulder.  Athena is thrown 
           back as well, however the bolt mysteriously seems to place 
           her gently onto the ground.

           A massive CLASH of thunder echoes throughout the land.  All 
           goes quiet.  The call of a lone EAGLE is heard from above.  
           The three stop and look to the sky to see a massive eagle 
           descend from the clouds as LIGHTNING crashes all around it.  
           The entire countryside sees this lightning.  It is like no 
           other ever to come before or after.

           Medusa escapes during the commotion.

           Meanwhile the eagle descends closer to the ground.  It is 
           then STRUCK by a bolt of lighting!  The flash of light is 
           blinding.  It then fades to reveal a BEHEMOTH man.  He has 
           broad shoulders with a thick long beard.  He is ZEUS.  
           Supreme ruler of both gods and men.  

                                 ATHENA
                        Father...

                                 ZEUS
                        That is enough from the BOTH of 
                        you.

                                 HADES
                        You expect me to listen to...

                        (cutting him off)
                        I EXPECT YOU TO OBEY!
                        (a beat)
                        Your involvement in this matter 
                        troubles me.  

                                 HADES
                        Medusa will be mine.  And even you 
                        brother, with all your great power, 
                        can do nothing to stop it.

           Within an instant, Hades combusts into a flame and disappears 
           into the ground.  Zeus SLAMS his fist into the earth, but it 
           too late.  Hades is gone.  He turns to Athena.

                                 ZEUS (CONT'D)
                        The powers granted to you are not 
                        to be used selfishly and 
                        carelessly.  We are not here to 
                        interfere with what destiny has in 
                        store.  As gods, we are to oversee 
                        the world.  Not change it.  

                                 ATHENA
                        Father, I...

                                 ZEUS
                        You have created a problem that you 
                        can no longer control.  Mortals 
                        must now deal with the monster you 
                        have unleashed upon them.  Men will 
                        answer the call.  They will bring 
                        an end to this problem.

           Zeus VANISHES into a bright white light.  Just as he does, a 
           group of rugged men arrive through the trees  

           One man emerges.  He rides a jet black horse, radiant as it 
           is powerful.  The man who rides the beautiful steed is strong 
           and handsome, with DEEP BLUE eyes.  We have seen him before.  
           The man from Medusa’s nightmare.  He is PERSEUS.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Lady Athena.  I bring greetings 
                        from King Polydectes.  He has sent 
                        me here to serve you.  
                        (a beat)
                        I am Perseus.  I fight for Athens.

CRETE CAMP - NIGHT

           A DARK presence makes its way through the quiet camp of 
           Crete.  Most of the warriors are asleep.  We travel through 
           the camp to an underground prison.

           INT. UNDERGROUND PRISON - NIGHT

           Moonlight shines through small vents from above.  The subtle 
           light reveals a large prison cell.  It is heavily bound by  
           thick steel bars.  INSIDE, the Minotaur is chained up. 

           Two guards stand to the right of the cage.  A NOISE is heard 
           from the dark corner of the prison.  The guards immediately 
           turn to the sound.   

                                 GUARD #1 (cont'd)
                        Is someone there?

           Out of the darkness, two deadly snakes FLY through the air,  
           immediately latching onto the guards, BITING and CHOKING 
           them.  They fall to the ground.

           A cloaked Medusa emerges from the shadows.  She walks past 
           the men and towards the cell, pausing to pick up a set of 
           keys from one of the fallen guards.  She stops in front of 
           the cell and the two snakes slither up Medusa’s cloak and 
           back onto her scalp, rejoining the rest of the snakes. 

           She turns the key, unlocking the first phase of the cage.  A 
           lever lying beyond that, opens the cage more.  She uses her 
           strength to turn it completely.  The massive steel bars 
           slowly rise up, allowing access to the beast.

           She enters.  Another level releases the chains.  She places 
           her hand on it, but waits.

                                 MEDUSA
                        I come here tonight to summon your 
                        help.

           Medusa’s eyes change to GREEN.  The Minotaur stares into her 
           eyes, yet does not turn into stone.  Its eyes take on the 
           color of Medusa’s.  The crystals in his nose ring pulsate.

                                 MEDUSA
                        The gods must pay for what they 
                        have done to us.  There is talk of 
                        a power.  A power that can kill the 
                        very Gods themselves.

           EXT. CRETE CAMP - MOMENTS LATER 

           The Greek guards sleep in their quarters.  One slowly awakens 
           only to see the Minotaur’s large WAR HAMMER smashing down on 
           him.

           EXT. ISLAND OF CRETE / CAVE - LATER

           The Minotaur leads Medusa into a massive cave hidden within 
           the side of a volcanic summit on the island. 

           INT. ISLAND OF CRETE / CAVE - CONTINUOUS

           Medusa follows The Minotaur down an extremely long winding 
           staircase built into the rocks.  They travel deeper and 
           deeper into the cave.

           INT. ISLAND OF CRETE / GLOWING CAVE - CONTINUOUS

           They enter a section of the cave that radiates with a blue 
           glow.  The walls are littered with tiny fragments of blue 
           crystals lodged into the rock.  The same substance that is in 
           The Minotaur’s nose ring. 

           Towards the middle of the wall, a larger piece of this 
           crystal is lodged deep within the wall.  

           Medusa leans into it.  Under her hood, her eyes sparkle as 
           the reflection of the crystal flickers in her eyes.

           Euryale and Stheno, both cloaked, fly and land at their 
           sanctuary.  A small island, just east of Athens.  

           INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS

           The two sisters enter.  Euryale stops.  She senses someone.

           Medusa raises the crystal from the Minotaur’s nose ring. And 
           with that, the power to weaken the gods.

           EXT. MEDUSA’S CAVE - SUNRISE

           Plaxio’s lifeless statue has been dragged outside.  The two 
           coins from before have been placed over his eyes.

                        In order to enter Hades, one must 
                        first be led.  It is said no living 
                        soul can find its entrance.  Only 
                        the dead can guide you.  

           A slender carrier DEMON approaches the body.  He wears a 
           black robe and carries walking stick.   He takes out a small 
           wooden flute and begins to play a dark melody.  As he does 
           this, the transparent soul of Plaxio RISES up from his 
           deceased body.  

                                 MEDUSA (V.O.)
                        That is when I will make my move.

           The demon hears something behind him.  He turns and looks 
           directly into the eyes of Medusa.  The crystal from the 
           Minotaur’s nose ring now hangs around her neck.  It GLOWS.  
           The demon cannot move, or speak as he is under her spell.

           Medusa’s eyes beam rays of GREEN light at the demon’s eyes.  

                                 MEDUSA
                        You will lead me to the gates of 
                        HADES.

           Medusa turns to the soul of Plaxio, which calmly hovers in 
           the background.  She BLASTS it with rays from her eyes, 
           causing it to disperse into the air, forever lost.  

           The demon plays his flute again.  Suddenly, the ground begins 
           to RUMBLE!  The Earth cracks and breaks, opening a doorway 
           built within the Earth.  The demon slowly walks down the 
           slope and towards the entrance.  Medusa follows.

           The ground covers up behind them.

           INT. HADES - SAME

           We follow the silhouette of Medusa as she is led through the 
           darkness and out into a massive RED cavern of epic 
           proportions.  

           She looks to the sky of fire, the endless caverns, and the 
           river Styx.  She has seen this before, the vision from Hades.

           The demon turns to Medusa.

                                 DEMON

The demon 
           quickly burns.

           A small boat emerges from a dark section of the river Styx.  
           A robed and hooded figure rows towards the shore.  Although 
           mostly covered by the robe, his body consists of twisted 
           bones and rotten flesh.  CHARON, the ferryman.

           Charon comes to a stop.  His head slightly nods upwards.  He 
           extends his skeleton-like hand, then speaks with a deep 
           haunting whisper.

                                 CHARON
                        (a beat)

                        I will pay no toll.  My business is 
                        with Hades.

           Medusa looks to Charon and BEAMS her cursed power directly 
           into his hood.   The beam blows back his hood.  REVEALED is a 
           horrific SKULL with horns.  Charon’s face is nothing but 
           bone.  No skin, no hair...no eyes.

           Medusa’s beam enters his decaying eye sockets, but has no 
           affect.  With this, Charon grins and laughs MANIACALLY!

                                 CHARON
                        HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!

           Medusa then tries to leap over the river but is quickly blown 
           back by a powerful and unknown source.  Her entire body is 
           singed.  

                                 CHARON
                        TOLL PLEASE!

           INT. RIVER STYX / HADES - MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE UP on Charon’s skeleton hands as he juggles two gold 
           COINS back and forth between his bony fingers.  

           Medusa sits hunched over at the bow.  A dark mist has come 
           over the river. 

           Tiny mysterious and beautiful orbs of light float through the 
           air.  They pulsate with energy.  Oddly enough, this stretch 
           of the journey is almost peaceful.  Each orb appears to have 
           its own soothing, innocent whisper as they float past Medusa.  
           The souls of the dead.  One particular orb hovers in front of 
           her.

           background.  He speaks.

                                 ARTEGUS 
                        Medusa.

           In a flash, the vision is gone.  The orb is left behind as 
           the ferryman continues to row forward.  

                                 MEDUSA
                        Artegus?

           The orb disappears in the mist.  The boat docks and Medusa 
           exits.

                        We shall see about that.

           Medusa looks up to see a mountainous castle.  Thousands of 
           dead souls continue to work on the dark castle.  Decaying men 
           and women, and creatures work like slaves.  

           A small herd of MINOTAUR, each with a grotesque yet powerful 
           carcass, stack boulders.  Three GIANT CYCLOPES emerge from 
           the shadows carrying large stone columns. Each standing over 
           FIFTEEN FEET TALL and a SINGLE EYE protruding from the middle 
           of their foreheads.

           He circles Medusa.  Clapping.

                        I guided you.  You were a desolate 
                        and weak martyr but look at what 
                        you’ve become. 

           Medusa notices that all of the tortured souls and demons have 
           stopped what they were doing to watch her.  CERBERUS, the 
           infamous three headed BEAST, emerges.  It slowly moves 
           towards Medusa and sniffs her.

                        them.  A god like me.  I can end 
                        all of their pointless suffering, 
                        yet they continue to praise 
                        Poseidon.  Athena...Zeus.  FOR

           Cerberus moves to his masters’ side.  Hades pets the beast.  
           The souls of the dead begin to form a circle around Medusa.  

           Hades laughs.  Medusa then reveals the CRYSTAL from the 
           Minotaur.  Hades suddenly stops.  

                                 HADES
                        Where did you get that...?

           Medusa steps towards Hades.  He backs up.  The legions of

           EXT. HILL, JUST OUTSIDE ATHENS - DAY

           A lone deer stands atop a green hill nearby Athens.  A moment 
           of peace.  Then...

           The ground begins trembles.  A skeleton hand BREAKS through 
           the ground.  

           The deer runs away as more and more horrific demon hands rip 
           through the dirt.  The top of the hill then tears open.  The 
           ARMY OF HADES emerges from the depths of the earth.  

           EXT. EAST ATHENS - CONTINUOUS 

           Near the entrance of Athens, people go about their normal 
           routine.  Merchants handle their daily business.  A group of 
           young soldiers walk through the city.    

           Suddenly, one of the soldiers feels the impending rumble in 
           the ground.  He turns to see the evil armada advancing 
           towards the city in the distance.

                        My God...

           He turns to the other soldiers, not yet aware of the attack.

                                 YOUNG SOLDIER (cont’d)
                        SOUND THE ALARM!  WE ARE UNDER 
                        ATTACK!!

           But everyone is in shock as they watch the approaching herd 
           of bodies.  The young soldier snaps out of it and rushes up 
           to the large bell atop the unattended watchtower.

           EXT. WATCHTOWER - CONTINUOUS

           The young soldier hurries up the stairs.

           EXT. EAST ATHENS - DAY - SAME TIME

           One of the Cyclops rips a boulder from the ground with ease.    
           He then HURLS it towards the watchtower.

           EXT. WATCHTOWER - CONTINUOUS

           The young soldier grabs the large hammer to ring the bell.  
           Realizing this will be his death, he swings the hammer just 
           as the large boulder tears through the tower and his body.  

           EXT. ATHENS - CONTINUOUS

           His efforts were not in vain.  The sounds of the bell ECHO 
           through the kingdom, alerting Athens to the attack.

           INT. ATHENA’S PALACE - CONTINUOUS

           Athena is surrounded by senators and high ranking officials.  
           She hears the sound of the bell.  Athena rushes outside to 
           the balcony. 

           EXT. ATHENA’S BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

           She looks over her balcony.  Far off in the distance, she is 
           astonished to see Hades’ army advancing on the city.  

           A senator looks through a telescopic device.

                        The army of Hades?!  How can this 
                        be?!

                                 ATHENA
                        (a beat)
                        It is not Hades.  

           EXT. EAST ATHENS - SAME

           The Attack on Athens has begun.

           The dark army BREAKS through the walls and towers along the 
           entrance of the city, destroying any and everything in their 
           path.  Buildings collapse.  Soldiers are FLUNG through the 
           air like rag dolls while Athenian citizens flee.

           The Athenian Army is not prepared for battle.  The guards and 
           soldiers who are stationed at the edge of the city, rush into 
           battle but they are hopelessly outnumbered.

           The demon soldiers make their way through the alleys and 
           roads of the city. 

           EXT. ATHENA’S BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

           Athena turns to her Palace Guards.

                                 ATHENA
                        Summon every warrior and have them 
                        defend the city.  Do not let them 
                        reach the palace!

                                 PALACE GUARD
                        Where is Lord Poseidon?

                                 ATHENA
                        Worry not about Poseidon right now.  
                        Summon Perseus!  We must defend 
                        Athens on our own.  

           BELOW, Athena’s armada charges towards the battle at the 
           entrance of Athens. 

           EXT. EAST ATHENS/BATTLE - DAY

           Meanwhile, CADIUS, is stationed at the outskirts of the city.  
           He stands with just a small fleet of troops at his disposal.
                                          (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                 CADIUS
                        BAND TOGETHER!  WE MUST DEFEND THE 
                        CITY!!

           SUDDENLY, the loud SHRIEKS of the GRIFFINS are heard.  

           The beasts SWOOP down from the sky, grabbing soldiers with 
           their talons and lifting them off the ground.  For those not 
           instantly killed by their razor sharp claws, they are soon 
           DROPPED from hundreds of feet in the air to their death.

           Cadius fights diligently, killing beasts as they near his 
           troops.

           ARCHERS then arrive on the scene, and begin firing at the 
           Griffins.  They fire into the sky, able to push back the 
           aerial attack.

                                 CADIUS(cont’d) (CONT’D)
                        Yes!  Push them back!

           Their victory is only a temporary one, as one of the cyclops 
           SLAMS through a nearby wall.  With one SWIPE of its powerful 
           arm, the front line of archers are knocked into a air.

           The death toll mounts as the fighters try to hold back the 
           attack. 

           Homes are burnt to the ground as the army of Hades forges 
           towards the Acropolis.    

           EXT. HILLTOP - SAME

           Atop a nearby hill overlooking the city, Medusa watches as 
           the assault on Athens continues.  Her sisters Euryale and 
           Stheno stand by her side. 

                                 EURYALE
                        They are no match for your army, 
                        Medusa.

                                 STHENO
                        The city is yours for the taking.

           Medusa pulls out the power of Cronos.  It continues to 
           radiate.  

                                 MEDUSA
                        Unlike Hades, I do not desire the 
                        city.   I only care about Athena.  

           Just then, THE MINOTAUR emerges.  It towers next to Medusa.
                                         (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                 MEDUSA (CONT’D)
                        This is the day of reckoning.  They 
                        will pay for what they’ve done to 
                        us.  And with the power of the 
                        Titans...I will kill her.  

           The Minotaur ROARS and charges into battle.  Medusa tucks the 
           crystal into her robe.  She and her two sisters spreads their 
           wings and head into the battle.

           EXT. ATHENS - ALLEYS - DAY

           A mother runs through an alleyway with her infant child.  She 
           turns to see the demon soldiers running past the alley.  

           The mother closes her eyes and looks to the sky for prayer. 
           She quickly discovers three demon soldiers CRAWLING over the 
           top of the building and down the walls towards her and her 
           baby!

           One of the demons LEAPS down towards her!  To her shock and 
           surprise, a young boy shoves her out of the way!

                                 YOUNG BOY
                        GO!  GO!

           The demons pursue them along the walls like a spider to its 
           prey.  They rush out of the alley and into the open, deserted 
           market place.  The young boy backs up, fearing the end, when 
           SUDDENLY...

           THE ATHENIAN ARMADA FINALLY REACHES THE MARKETPLACE!

           Hundreds of soldiers begin pouring out from behind buildings 
           and alleyways.  The Athenian armada quickly disposes of the 
           two demon soldiers and make their way to the battle.  

           EXT. BATTLE - CONTINUOUS

           Cerberus feasts on soldiers as the demonic army continues to 
           advance!  Cadius continues to lead his troops against the 
           onslaught. 

                                 CADIUS
                        They mustn’t reach the Parthenon.  
                        For Athens!

           His soldiers nod and prepare for attack.  They charge 
           attempting to flank them.  Suddenly, the three GORGON SISTERS 
           swoop down from the sky.
                                                (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)           Medusa lands and immediately begins fighting the Athenian 
           warriors.  As they rush her, she turns them to stone and 
           maneuvers through her pursuers.  

                                 ATHENIAN SOLDIER
                        It is her.  MEDUSA!  COVER YOUR 
                        EYES!!  

           EURYALE swoops in and GRABS a soldier with her claws, 
           hoisting him off of the ground and flies him high into the 
           sky.  

           A Cyclops has made it all the way to the palace and begins 
           climbing the wall.  A little further behind, a second Cyclops 
           makes its way towards the Palace as well.  The city of Athens 
           is in FLAMES.

           Then, the ground breaks.  A host of HARPIES emerge from the 
           fires of the underworld.  Their scrawny bodies crawl out of 
           the ground.  They quickly spread their decaying wings and 
           take flight. 

                                 MEDUSA
                        (to the Haripes)
                        Converge on the Palace!

           The Harpies each grab a Demon-soldier by the shoulders and 
           LIFTS them off of the ground.  They fly upwards towards the 
           higher levels of the Acropolis!

           EXT. ATHENS - BALCONY - SAME TIME

           The senators back pedal away from Athena as the army of Hades 
           gets closer.  

                                 SENATOR
                        Lady Athena, the creatures are...

           SUDDENLY sharp claws come out of nowhere and GRAB the 
           senator.  Blood GUSHES out as the claws LIFT him into the 
           air.  

           The entire balcony finds itself under attack by a flock of 
           Griffins.

           Athena steps forward.  Her EYES LIGHT with power.  She 
           extends her arm as powerful BEAMS of light BLASTS outward 
           from her palm.  The rays of light BURN the flying Griffins 
           into smoldering ash!

           (cid:13)           Perseus soon arrives with this rugged band of warriors.  
           Athena turns to him.

                                 ATHENA
                        Perseus.  Your destiny awaits you.  
                        I shall secure the Palace.  Make 
                        safe my city!

           Perseus nods to his men.  They exit the room, heading to the 
           ground level.  Perseus doesn’t follow.  Instead, he leaps up 
           onto the ledge of the balcony.  He looks down to the Cyclops, 
           climbing the towering wall. 

           Perseus LEAPS overboard.  He free falls past the many levels 
           of the Parthenon towards the Cyclops.  He GRABS onto the body 
           of a Griffin soaring through the sky.  

           The Griffin wails as Perseus weighs it down.  Slowing his 
           fall, Perseus unsheathes his sword and flings himself onto 
           the back of the Cyclops.  He stabs it into the monsters back, 
           then repels himself down the back of the Cyclops, carving his 
           sword deeper into its flesh.  

           Perseus leaps onto the rocks of the Acropolis as the creature 
           falls and CRASHES to the ground.  The ground trembles with a 
           large THUD.  Perseus lands.

           Perseus unsheathes his sword and swiftly destroys the winged 
           beast.  He then begins to dispose of several demons, followed 
           by a decaying Centaur.  He is fearless.  He charges into 
           battle  

           INT. PARTHENON - LOWER LEVEL - SAME

           The harpies begin to drop the demons onto the palace 
           balconies and windows.  They demons crawl inside and attack 
           from within.  A Palace Guard destroys a demon with his sword.  
           Suddenly, the guard feels a quake.  He rushes to an open 
           window only to find the massive hand of a Cyclops reaching in 
           and grabbing him!

           A disgusting CRUNCH is heard.  

           EXT. ATHENS - BATTLE - SAME

           Medusa is in the middle of the war.  

           She stops for a moment, watching as her army burns its way 
           through the great city.  She hears the screams of innocent 
           women and children.  
                                   (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)

They 
           reach for one another but the demons show no mercy.  

           A fiery explosion consumes her view.  Bodies continue to fall 
           at the hands of her army.

           The revenge in her eyes is replaced with remorse.  Her head 
           quickly swells with images of the violence.  Athens will fall 
           all because of her.  She hears her own voice from the past 
           within her head.

                                 MEDUSA (V.O.)
                        (in her mind)
                        I want nothing to do with power / I 
                        never  deserved this fate / I just 
                        want my life back! / Artegus!!!

           She snaps out of it as she feels the EARTH TREMBLE!  As does 
           the rest of the battle.  Everyone turns to see a massive 
           TIDAL WAVE approaching the shores of the city.

           EXT. ATHENA’S PALACE - BALCONY - SAME

           Athena sends out a BLAST of wind, knocking a dozen demons 
           from her balcony.  She turns to see the impending wave 
           heading towards her city. 

           This epic tidal wave crashes down on the shores and quickly 
           POUNDS its way through the docks and past the beaches.  The 
           flooding water makes its way into the city where the battle 
           lies.  

           EXT. ATHENS - BATTLE - SAME

           The brave YOUNG BOY from before is about to be hit by the 
           massive wave.  Cadius quickly rushes in and grabs the boy, 
           holding him before impact.  But impact does not come.  They 
           look up to find the water miraculously flowing AROUND them.

           The water flows around the Palace.  The last remaining 
           CYCLOPS clings onto the Palace walls as the wave approaches.

           The massive flooding continues to head ONLY in the direction 
           of the evil invaders.  Hundreds of demon soldiers are WASHED 
           AWAY by the water as it continues to avoid innocent 
           civilians.  The flooding even manages to target the buildings 
           that have been set on fire.

           The water does not stop until every single demon from the 
           underworld has been washed off of its feet.  Save for Stheno 
           and Euryale who fly out of the way, avoiding the flood.

           into the sky, eclipsing the sun and lands emphatically on the 
           ground below!

                        He came.

           EXT. ATHENS - CONTINUOUS

           Poseidon moves towards the City.  The demons begin to regain 
           their footing as Poseidon advances through them.  

           A large Centaur stands up with a chain weapon. Poseidon 
           quickly RIPS the creature in half.  He takes its chain and 
           holds it against his legendary TRIDENT.  The chain melts 
           itself into the Trident, becoming one with it.

           Poseidon HURLS his Trident into the air towards the Cyclops.  
           It PUNCTURES the Giant’s head.  Poseidon then recalls his 
           trident and HURLS the Cyclops in the air, away from the 
           palace.  

           Poseidon looks up to see Athena.  Suddenly Athena’s eyes open 
           wide.  Before she can react Poseidon is RAMMED in the back by 
           the powerful Minotaur.  It’s nose ring glows with power.  
           Poseidon looks to his side, bleeding.  He feels the blood, 
           having never seen his own before.  He looks to the Minotaur.

                                 POSEIDON
                        Let’s finish this.

           The Minotaur surprises Poseidon with several powerful punches 
           to the head.  Each punch rattles Poseidon’s entire body.

           Medusa takes to the skies to join the fight.

           Poseidon fights back.  He retaliates with several powerful 
           hits, sending the Minotaur crashing to the ground.  

           The Minotaur gets up and RAMS Poseidon, puncturing his godly 
           skin once again.  The two then lock together, neither showing 
           an advantage.  They are face to face.

                                 MINOTAUR
                        I have been waiting for this day...

                                 POSEIDON
                        You’re an abomination.  A mistake 
                        that I will now correct!

                        greater...

                                 POSEIDON
                        There are other ways of ridding the 
                        world of your stench...

           Poseidon turns his arms into WATER and blasts the Minotaur 
           with the force of a rampaging river.  This pushes him back 
           several feet.

           Poseidon then WHIPS out his trident and SLAMS it into the 
           ground.  A deep crevice begins to form under the Minotaur.  
           In this crevice, a complicated maze of twists and turns 
           quickly forms thousands of feet below the city.  The Minotaur 
           falls down into this never ending labyrinth.  

           Poseidon looks down to the beast.  

                                 POSEIDON
                        Consider this curse broken.

                                 MINOTAUR
                        (falling)
                        Noooo!

           Poseidon then CLOSES the crevice into the Earth, locking The 
           Minotaur underground forever.

           The Minotaur is gone.  Poseidon slowly regains his composure.  
           In the distance, we see a hooded Medusa THROW something at 
           the god.

           Poseidon stops.  He can’t move.  He looks down and we see the 
           large jagged fragment of the CRYSTAL protruding from his 
           chest.  He suddenly struggles to breath.  Medusa approaches 
           the wounded god.  She breathes heavily.

           Poseidon’s chest bleeds.  Medusa looks down at the god and 
           directly into his eyes.  Wounded from the crystal, Poseidon’s 
           skin begins to turn to stone.   

           Poseidon falls to his knees as the virus consumes him.  
           Everyone watches, shocked.  

           Medusa’s emotions come to a head.  Anger, rage and 
           satisfaction.  The god who raped her now dies before her 
           eyes. 

           She approaches the godly statue.  She prepares to destroy the 
           statue with her powerful tail...

She looks 
           up to find Athena standing before her.

           Medusa is wounded and no longer possesses the power of 
           Cronos.  Somehow, she gets up again.

           Athena is slightly taken aback at the resolution of Medusa.  
           There is no quit in the Libyan.

                                 ATHENA
                        You should have stayed in exile.

                        (weak)
                        I wanted none of this.  You disgust 
                        me.  I only desired love.  Artegus.  
                        And you took that away from me.  

           An archer fires an arrow into Medusa’s side.  She falls to 
           one knee.  She pulls the arrow out and THROWS it at the 
           archer.  It lodges in his throat.

           QUICK VISION of Artegus.  Beautiful orbs surround him.  He 
           stands at the top of a hill.  Peaceful.  At rest.  Waiting.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Another archer fires.  Medusa’s blocks it with her wing.  

                                 ATHENA
                        Enough people have died today, 
                        Medusa.

                                 MEDUSA
                        No.  Not yet.  You are still alive.  

                                 ATHENA
                        Are you so blinded by revenge that 
                        you do not see death staring at 
                        you?  You cannot defeat me.  

                                 MEDUSA
                        You took my life away.  You have to 
                        pay for what you’ve done.  And I 
                        will spend my last breaths seeing 
                        that you do.

           Although wounded, Medusa continues forward towards the god. 

           From the shadows, Perseus and two of his men approach.  
           Perseus’ hands are stained with blood.  He stands next to 
           Athena.

           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                 PERSEUS
                        It is her.  She has come for you.

                                 ATHENA
                        Kill her!

           Two of Persus’ men charge Medusa.  She dodges some of the 
           attacks but she is eventually cut by one of the swordsmen.  
           Still, she fights back.

           She is able to disarm one of the men and claws his throat.  
           The other man makes the mistake of getting too close.  Medusa 
           pulls him close to her hood.  Suddenly his body stiffens and 
           he, too is taken by her curse.  She tosses the stoned body 
           aside.  

           She again sees tiny orbs of light in her vision.  She 
           whispers...

                                 MEDUSA
                        (whisper)
                        Artegus...?

           The last thing standing between Medusa and Athena is Perseus.  
           He stands with his back to her, yet watching through the 
           reflection his sword.    

           Medusa’s only weapon are her legendary eyes.  She chooses to 
           leave her hood up, however.

           A long beat.  

           Medusa SCREAMS and then CHARGES towards Athena.  Athena’s 
           eyes grow wide.  Perseus stands prepared.

           She LEAPS at Athena, claws extended.  Perseus times his jump 
           and, in one swift move, swings his sword.  Just before Medusa 
           gets to the god, Perseus’ sword lands on Medusa’s neck.

           The cut is clean and through.  No blood.  Perseus’ swing was 
           exact.

           Medusa’s body crumbles to the ground.  Her head rolls to a 
           stop at the feet of Athena.  The once beautiful and radiant 
           princess lies dead at the feet of Athena. 

           Every remaining demon from the underworld, alive or dead, 
           BURSTS into ash and returns to the underworld of Hades.  

           Now, free of imminent danger, the Athenian soldiers breath 
           sighs of relief.

           The souls of the dead pour into the dark realm of Hades.  

           Hundreds of souls gathered around the throne of Hades.  The 
           stoned body of the god begins to crack.  The stone over his 
           eyes breaks off, revealing his red FIERY eyes.  Hades lives.

           EXT. ATHENS - SAME TIME

           The stoned body of Poseidon is also freed of Medusa’s curse.  
           He slowly regains his form.  The jagged crystal falls from 
           his chest.  Perseus grabs it, removing it from the god’s 
           presence.

           A lone butterfly trickles through the air.  It flies in front 
           of Medusa’s lifeless eyes.  A BEAM or power surprisingly 
           blasts out from the eyes, turning the small insect to stone.  
           The lifeless head of Medusa still retains its legendary 
           power.

                                 ATHENA
                        The great power from Libya.  It was 
                        her all along.  
                        (surveys the destruction)
                        But at what cost?  Perhaps our time 
                        is nearing its end.  Perhaps 
                        mankind is ready.

           After a beat, she nods to Perseus.  

           With an entire city watching, Perseus carefully lifts up 
           Medusa’s head.  Striking what will be a legendary pose for 
           centuries to come.  

                                 THE FATES (V.O.)
                        And thus, the tragic life of Medusa 
                        had drawn to its end.  Love led 
                        her.  Fate found her.  Revenge 
                        consumed her.  And death, would now 
                        free her.  For in the legend of 
                        Medusa, death is but yet another 
                        chapter.

           We pull back from the destruction and into the white clouds.  
           Then, two little white orbs fly through the air.  They are 
           inseparable as they dance and float their way into the sky.  

           Medusa and Artegus, together at last.

                                                     THE END
