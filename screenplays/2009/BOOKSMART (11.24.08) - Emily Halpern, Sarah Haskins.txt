BEDROOM - DAY 

           Two hands, nervously fiddling. Anxious. 

                                 MOLLY (V.O.)
                        So...what do you think?

           Now two different hands, also anxious. One hand runs up and 
           down the crease of a manila-covered envelope. Only the crease 
           is visible, not the entire envelope.

                                 AMY (V.O.)
                        I don’t know.  I’m nervous. 

                                 MOLLY (V.O.)
                        This is the moment we’ve been 
                        working towards. 

                                 AMY (V.O.)
                        Our whole lives. 

                                 MOLLY (V.O.) 
                        I mean...

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 

           A teacher hands back assignments to a class full of bored-
           looking students. 

           The teacher approaches MOLLY CARROLL’S desk. Molly is 
           seventeen, pretty but not gorgeous, a nice-looking girl from 
           the suburbs. Teachers like her. 

                                 MOLLY (V.O.)
                        We’re good students. 

           The Teacher smiles as she hands Molly her assignment. The 
           front page reads “A - Excellent Work”. Molly smiles.

                                 MOLLY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        We get straight A’s. We’re involved-

           INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY 

           Molly works with students putting out the school paper. Molly 
           is clearly in charge, delegating work. Headline Reads: 
           “Investigation Reveals: Asbestos Everywhere.”

           (cid:13)           INT. SCIENCE LAB - DAY 

           AMY ANSTLER prepares materials for a science experiment. Amy 
           is seventeen, nice-looking, leans a little more hippie 
           granola save-the-world crunchy than Molly. She puts on her 
           protective goggles, and pours liquid into a flask. 

                                 AMY (V.O.)
                        We’re very well-rounded. There’s 
                        Debate Team -- 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 

           Amy stands at the front of the classroom, facing a small 
           group of students. The chalkboard behind her reads “DEBATE 
           PRACTICE”.

                                 AMY
                        You might be able to pull the wool 
                        over the eyes of the American 
                        taxpayer with your Reaganomics, but 
                        you can’t pull the wool over these 
                        eyes, Leon. 

           We see Leon, the object of Amy’s rant -- a small, thin 
           freshman, with braces and big glasses. He’s cowering in fear. 

           INT. CLASSROOM --

           Molly sits with a group of students holding Spanish flags.

                                 AMY (V.O.)
                        You’re President of Spanish Club -- 

           Molly smiles, turns to the student next to her.

                   (in Spanish)
                        The sky is pretty today, isn’t it?

                        You’re President of French Club.

           Amy smiles, turns to the student next to her.

           INT. CLASSROOM --

           Amy and Molly sit alone at a table, eating Chinese Food with 
           Chopsticks.

                                 MOLLY (V.O.)
                        And we are the Chinese Club.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                   (to Amy, in Chinese)
                        I am encouraged by the progress of 
                        our special economic zone in 
                        Shenzen. 

           INSERT - YEARBOOK PICTURE. Molly stands with a group of 
           students. Below the photo reads: PHYSICS CLUB.

                        We do so much stuff.

           INSERT - A NEW YEARBOOK PICTURE. Amy stands with a group of 
           students, holding a trophy. Caption reads: KELLOGG HIGH 
           SPELLING CHAMPS.

                        SO much stuff. 

           The pictures now come in rapid succession, one after the 
           next. Pictures of Amy and Molly participating in different 
           activities: we see flashes of “Diversity Club, Library Squad, 
           Environmental Protection Club, Harry Potter Fan Club...” Etc. 
           The pictures appear, faster and faster, until they’re going 
           so fast it’s all a blur.

           And suddenly, they stop. And we’re back in:

AMY’S BEDROOM -- DAY

           We now see Molly and Amy sitting together on Amy’s bed. 

                                 MOLLY 
                        So what are we worried about?

                                 AMY
                        College admissions are 
                        unpredictable. Thousands of top 
                        students are turned away every 
                        year.

                                 MOLLY
                        So it’s statistically possible that 
                        we won’t get in.

                                 AMY
                        At least we’ll know that we tried 
                        our best. 

           Molly begins to lift a manila envelope into frame.

                                 MOLLY
                        I guess there’s only one way to 
                        find out...

           We now see the manila envelopes Amy and Molly hold in their 
           hands. Both envelopes are ENORMOUS.

           As they talk, Amy’s sister KAREN ANSTLER walks past the open 
           door. Karen is 15, a sophomore in high school. She’s a 
           pretty, popular type - clearly much, much cooler than Amy. 

                                 KAREN
                        What is wrong with you? Those 
                        envelopes are like four inches 
                        thick. You obviously got in. 

                                 AMY
                        Don’t jinx us!

                                 KAREN
                        You think they slipped your 
                        rejection letter into a novel they 
                        sent you? 

           Amy stands up and shuts the door. She takes a deep breath.

                                 AMY
                        Ready?

           (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                 MOLLY
                        Ready.

           And then it’s a flurry of envelope-tearing and paper-
           rustling. Hands pull college materials out. Amy and Molly’s 
           eyes furiously scan pages.  And then, at the same time, they 
           look up at each other: 

                                 MOLLY/AMY
                        I GOT IN!

           Amy and Molly stand, beaming. 

           A beat. And then, a voice from outside the door.

                                 KAREN (V.O.) 
                        Losers. 

           Amy and Molly frown -- 

           ROLL OPENING CREDITS

           EXT. SMALL TOWN MICHIGAN - MORNING - ESTABLISHING

           A small, sleepy town in suburban Michigan. It is January and 
           a layer of snow covers the streets. We pan over the town, and 
           we see attractive upper-middle class houses. Quiet 
           residential roads with sidewalks and dimmed street lights. 

           The sort of town where it’d be safe to walk around at 6am.

           And we PUSH IN on -- 

           EXT. FLINT ROAD - MORNING 

           Molly walks down the road alone. She’s presumably the only 
           person awake. She wears a very-full backpack, and she’s 
           carrying several additional books/papers in her arms.

           She stops at the driveway of a pleasant-looking home, where 
           Amy is waiting for her. As she walks up, Molly nearly drops 
           one of her books, but Amy catches it and hands it to her. 

                                 AMY
                        Jesus Christ, what are you, 
                        starting a paper factory?

                                 MOLLY
                        It’s student government stuff. I 
                        just wrote up a prospectus for 
                        second semester.

                        Did Conor help? 

                                 MOLLY
                        He volunteered, but I offered to do 
                        it. I said I didn’t mind. 

                                 AMY
                        He’s CO-class President. That 
                        implies a fifty-fifty sharing of 
                        class President duties. 

                                 MOLLY
                        We do share. We have different 
                        strengths that complement each 
                        other. We’re like the Clintons. 

           Amy makes a face.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        But less gross. 

                                 AMY
                        I had another dream about Ryan. 

           Molly looks to Amy, asking for details. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        So, it’s like ten years in the 
                        future and I’m the premiere 
                        neurosurgeon in Manhattan.

                                 MOLLY
                        You need, like, sixteen more years 
                        of school for that.

                                 AMY
                        So, I am at a Yankees game and Ryan 
                        is playing for the Yankees. Ryan is 
                        up to bat and he gets hit in the 
                        head with a baseball and he goes 
                        down.

                                 MOLLY
                        They wear helmets.

                                 AMY
                        Well, he’s not wearing one that day 
                        because he’s brave.

                                 MOLLY
                        I think it’s a rule.

                        ANYWAY - I run down on the field 
                        and have to open his cranium to 
                        relieve the swelling. Then I 
                        operate on him. And in the recovery 
                        room, he wakes up and sees me and 
                        is like “I know you. You’re the 
                        girl who sat behind me in ninth 
                        grade math.”

                        “Before I got moved down a track”

           Amy bumps into Molly, who slips on the ice and catches 
           herself. She bumps Amy back. They start laughing.

                   (looking at her watch)
                        Oh my God.

                                 AMY
                        What is it?

                                 MOLLY
                        It’s almost 6:30! 

           Amy helps Molly up and they start running, awkwardly, down 
           the street - trying to jog and carry books at the same time.

           Molly and Amy round the corner and run into -- 

           BILL SCHACTER, English Teacher and Student Council Advisor. A 
           large man, with a large stomach, a beard, and glasses. 

           Molly bounces off his stomach, and hits the floor. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Ow.

                        Hi, Mr. Schacter. 

                                 MR. SCHACTER
                        Hi girls. I hear Congratulations 
                        are in order. Yale. And Columbia. 
                        They’ll be lucky to have you.

                        Thanks Mr. Schachter.

                        You know, now that you’ve gotten in 
                        to college - you don’t have to be 
                        here before seven every morning. 
                        You’re second-semester seniors, why 
                        not enjoy it?  

           Molly and Amy stare at him, blinking. Not understanding. 

                                 MOLLY
                        We work hard because we like 
                        working hard. 

           Mr. Schacter takes off his glasses, wipes them.

                                 MR. SCHACTER
                        I guess I can’t really argue with 
                        that, can I? 

           Amy and Molly walk off, calling out “Bye Mr. Schacter”.

           EXT. KELLOGG HIGH SCHOOL - ESTABLISHING - MORNING 

           The sun now shines over Kellogg High School, hours later. 
           Students and teachers file into the building. The school day 
           is beginning. 

           INT. KELLOGG HIGH SCHOOL/NEWSPAPER OFFICE - MORNING 

           Molly is working alone on the paper, when JONATHAN walks in. 
           He’s cute, but a little nerdy. (Think Michael Cera.) He has a 
           crush on Molly. 

           Jonathan walks in, and drops his bag. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Hey. So, I swapped the features 
                        story to run with the piece on 
                        napkin misconduct in the cafeteria. 

                                 JONATHAN
                        Weren’t we going to compile the 
                        survey data before running that 
                        piece?

                                 MOLLY
                        I did it this morning.

                                 JONATHAN
                        I would have helped you.

                        That’s ok, it didn’t take long.

           Suddenly, CONOR PIERSON pops his head around the corner. 
           Conor is the object of Molly’s affections. He’s a handsome, 
           well rounded, all-American boy. He’s not the smartest guy, 
           but he’ll never know that. He’d make a great Senator. 

           Molly freezes. Jonathan rolls his eyes. 

                                 JONATHAN
                        Oh, the Co-President’s here...

           Molly ignores him, trying to play it cool in front of Conor.

                                 CONOR
                        Hey Molly. I just wanted to see how 
                        we were doing for assembly today -

           Molly hands him a bound presentation, perfectly planned.

                                 MOLLY
                        I actually took an extra step and 
                        outlined our priorities for the 
                        entire semester.

                                 CONOR
                        Molly, that’s incredible. 

           He gives her shoulder a little squeeze. Molly blushes. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Today we start planning prom.

                                 CONOR
                        Yeah, it’s a lot of work.

                                 MOLLY
                        It’s too bad we can’t spend the 
                        time getting something real 
                        accomplished.

                                 CONOR
                        But prom is fun.

                                 MOLLY
                        Right. It’s not fun I’m opposed to, 
                        it’s just the -

                        Yes.

                        Well, we can’t impose our agenda on 
                        a democracy.

                        You’re right.

           Conor winks at her, leaves. Jonathan makes a gagging sound, 
           then pretends to cover it up.

                        He’s so smart. 

                                 JONATHAN
                        Nothing he says makes any sense. 
                        You do all the work, and he shares 
                        in the credit. It’s sexist.

                        Since when are you a feminist?

                                 JONATHAN
                        Since when are you an apologist for 
                        the male patriarchy?

                                 MOLLY
                        Eat a weiner. 

                                 JONATHAN
                        I will. Because I’m a feminist. I 
                        mean, I wouldn’t. But I would, like 
                        --

           Amy sits behind a table, handing out flyers and encouraging 
           people to sign her petition. Behind her hangs a huge sign 
           reading “SAVE DARFUR”. 

                                 AMY
                        Save Darfur! Sign this petition.

           Students walk by, listening to their ipods, talking to 
           friends, couldn’t care less.

                        This is important! 

           Amy spots Karen with a bunch of her popular friends. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Karen! Karen! 

           Karen tries to hide behind her friends, then runs by. 

           Amy turns back around, to find that she is face-to-face with 
           RYAN DEXTER. Ryan is Amy’s crush. In contrast with Conor’s 
           All-American cuteness, he’s just incredibly sexy. Tall, very 
           handsome and muscular. He will work his way through college 
           as a Chippendale and love every second of it. Ryan is shoving 
           a donut into his mouth.

           Amy’s surprised, and blurts out his name. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Ryan! Do I - no. I um - do you want 
                        to... save Darfur?

                                 RYAN
                   (chewing)
                        Um. Maybe later.

           Ryan walks past. Amy calls after him. 

                                 AMY
                        Ok. Ok, well - talk to you later 
                        then. Bye! Have a good day! 

           She then slumps down in her seat, and puts her head in her 
           hands, feeling like an idiot.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL ASSEMBLY - DAY

           On stage, PRINCIPAL GANESHTHA, a tall Indian woman, stands 
           behind the podium.

           Mr. Schacter, the faculty advisor to Student Government, 
           Molly, and Conor sit on the stage behind her.

           Principal Ganeshtha clears her throat into the microphone, 
           and the students quiet down. She speaks with a heavy Indian 
           accent.

                        Students...as Principal of Kellogg 
                        High School, I would like to 
                        congratulate the seniors on the 
                        final semester of your high school 
                        careers.

           APPLAUSE and CHEERaS from the students.

                                 PRINCIPAL GANESHTHA (CONT’D)
                        You ought to be proud of 
                        yourselves. Most of you have 
                        already been accepted into fine 
                        colleges - your futures are bright. 

           More applause. Mrs. Ganeshtha pauses, then continues.

                                 PRINCIPAL GANESHTHA (CONT’D)
                        And I know what you’re thinking. 
                        The rest of the year will be all 
                        fun and games. “We’re second 
                        semester seniors. It’s party time.” 
                   (beat)
                        But let me tell you a story about 
                        another second semester senior. His 
                        name was Darren Preston, and he 
                        also thought it was party time. 
                        Darren was a strong student, and a 
                        great athlete. Recruited by Duke to 
                        play football. But during his first 
                        week as a second semester senior, 
                        Darren decided to get wild with his 
                        football buddies. 

           Molly looks at Conor, who shrugs.

                                 PRINCIPAL GANESHTHA (CONT’D)
                        So Darren and his friends bought 
                        many beers, and drank them at his 
                        parents house. And while his 
                        football buddies were laughing in 
                        the kitchen, Darren wandered out 
                        into the backyard, and fell into 
                        the pool. 
                   (beat)
                        And he drowned. 

           Total silence from the senior class. A few uncomfortable

                        And that’s what happens when you 
                        think second semester is “party 
                        time”. 

           Principal Ganeshtha sits. Mr. Schacter goes to the podium.

                                 MR. SCHACTER
                        Um. Thank you, Principal Ganeshtha. 
                        Um. And now, your senior class co-
                        presidents, Conor Pierson and Molly 
                        Carroll.

           The students applaud. A quick shot of the auditorium shows 
           most of them are listening to their iPods.

                                 MOLLY
                        Good morning. Today we have some 
                        news that will delight many of you -

                                 CONOR
                   (taking the mic)
                        It’s PROM TIME.

           Everyone goes crazy, clapping and yelling.

                                 CONOR (CONT’D)
                        To introduce today’s business, the 
                        head of the social committee, Dana 
                        Milovina.

           Everyone looks around for Dana. Suddenly a hip hop beat fills 
           the auditorium and the curtains behind Molly and Conor part 
           to reveal DANA MILOVINA, blonde, pretty, popular - standing 
           in a spotlight with dry ice steaming in from off stage.  Mr. 
           Schacter shakes his head. Dana walks to the podium.

                                 DANA
                        I am super excited to talk about 
                        the most important day of your 
                        life. Prom. 

           Even though Dana is an idiot, everyone is being won over by 
           her speech. As Dana continues, Molly can’t help it. Her eyes 
           are drawn to Conor and as Dana speaks she fantasizes...

           Dana smiles, finished. She takes a seat. Molly stands, the

                        Our job today is to nominate and 
                        vote on prom themes. Keep in mind 
                        these should be themes we all can 
                        enjoy. 

                                 CONOR
                        When you leave, remember to grab a 
                        ballot and write down the theme you 
                        preferred.  

           Students line up at a microphone to suggest their ideas.

                        A Night Under the Stars.

           A jock stands up and shouts:

                                 LITTLE DANNY
                        Untouched virgin senior class 
                        President! 

           Conor looks to Molly, who is horrified, and humiliated. To 
           make it worse, Mr. Schacter stands up to defend her.

                                 MR. SCHACTER
                        Hey! It’s a choice, buddy!

           He then turns, and gives Molly the thumbs-up. She shuts her 
           eyes, beyond embarrassed.

                        Um...if you want to officially make 
                        a suggestion, you have to use the 
                        microphone. 

           We see, in succession, several students offer their ideas for 
           prom theme in front of the microphone:

                                 CHRISTINA
                        The little mermaid!

                        Memories and fun!

                                 JONATHAN
                        Maybe we could make the theme 
                        global warming, you know, so we 
                        still have something important to 
                        focus on.

                                 FAT JORDAN (V.O.)

                                 RYAN
                        Blow jobs!

           Laughs from the jocks. As Ryan walks back to his seat, Amy 
           follows him. Transfixed. She can’t help but fantasize.

           microphone.

                                 MR. SCHACTER
                        The prom theme will not involve 
                        oral sex.

           The students shout “BOO...”

           Amy catches up with Molly, walking to class.

                                 MOLLY
                        BJ’s. Real classy. 

                                 AMY
                        It was satire.

           From behind them, they hear someone calling “GUYS!”

           They turn, to see CHRISTINA, hurrying towards them. She is a 
           really energetic girl who is ALWAYS wearing a Princeton 
           shirt. She waves. A lot.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Oh God. Look away.

                                 MOLLY
                        Too late.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        You guys. I am so excited for prom. 
                        Because this is the best year of 
                        our lives. And we all got into 
                        awesome schools.

                                 AMY
                   (sarcastic)
                        Oh, did you hear back from 
                        Princteon?

           Christina looks at her Princeton shirt, then up, confused.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Yes! Didn’t I tell you? I got in! 

                                 MOLLY
                        I don’t think you mentioned...

                                 CHRISTINA
                        I can’t believe I didn’t tell you!

                                 AMY
                        Me neither...

                                 CHRISTINA
                        I’m so excited. My dad went to 
                        Princeton, did you know that? He 
                        graduated Magna Cum Laude and was a 
                        member of the Cottage Eating Club.

                        I’m going to be a member there too. 
                        Did you know that Princeton has the 
                        top marine biology program in the 
                        counrty? That’s why Princeton was 
                        my top choice. Also because my dad 
                        was there.

                                 MOLLY
                        That’s great. Well, we have class.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Wait a minute, the real reason I’m 
                        talking to you is to tell you that 
                        Bob Rollo and Susan Page are 
                        officially going out. I just 
                        thought you should know. 
                   (points)
                        Look.

           They see Bob and Susan, holding hands by the lockers. 

                                 CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
                        I told you. See you later.

           Christina runs off. As Amy and Molly keep walking. 

                                 AMY
                        Susan Page...

                                 MOLLY
                        She’s even dorkier than we are...

           They shrug it off, and head to class. 

           INT. KELLOGG HIGH SCHOOL/ENGLISH CLASS - MORNING

           Mr. Schacter’s 12th grade British literature class. Almost 
           all our protagonists are in his classroom.

                                 MR. SCHACTER
                        Morning everyone. Good news, after 
                        you turn in your paper today, 
                        Wordsworth is over.

           The class erupts in applause. “So boring.” “Words worth my 
           nuts.” Mr. Schacter begins to pass around the new books.

                                 MR. SCHACTER (CONT’D)
                        Okay, up next, is the poetry of 
                        William Butler Yeats.

           He writes this on the board.
                                           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                 RYAN
                        You wrote “yeets.”

                                 MR. SCHACTER
                        Correct, Ryan. His name is 
                        pronounced differently than it is 
                        spelled.

                                 RYAN
                        Weird.

                                 MR. SCHACTER
                        Yeats was kind of weird, but he was 
                        also a magnificent poet. I think 
                        you’ll like him a lot. Let’s open 
                        to page 42. A favorite. Conor will 
                        you read from the top.

                                 CONOR
                        “A Drinking Song.”

           A couple of the guys are like “Yeah!” 

                                 CONOR (CONT’D)
                        “Wine comes in at the mouth/ And 
                        love comes in at the eye/” 

           Even at the first couplet, Molly is stricken. She gazes at 
           Conor. She feels like he’s speaking directly to her.

                                 CONOR (CONT’D)
                        “That’s all we shall know for 
                        truth/before we grow old and die/”

           Amy has her head tilted, gently, and she looks at Ryan. Ryan 
           is looking at his donut. He gives it a little kiss.

                                 CONOR (CONT’D)
                        “I raise my glass to my mouth/I 
                        look at you, and I sigh.”

           As Conor speaks, we see Jonathan take a large slurp out of a 
           Nalgene bottle and look at Molly. He spills water on his lap.

                                 MR.SCHACTER
                        Why’s he sighing?

                                 AMY
                        Because he’s in love -

                   (without raising her hand)
                        He doesn’t seem happy, though. Sigh 
                        isn’t a happy noise. And he’s 
                        already anticipating death. 

                                 MR. SCHACTER
                        Indeed. Why might he be sad? When 
                        in love might one feel sad?

           Everyone squirms.

                                 MR. SCHACTER (CONT’D)
                        C’mon. Don’t be embarrassed. I know 
                        you’re not robots -

                        Except for, Ron. Still it’s okay to 
                        admit you have feelings. Jonathan?

           Jonathan glances over at Molly. 

                                 JONATHAN
                        When you like someone who doesn’t 
                        like you. 
                   (immediately upset that he 
                    was vulnerable)
                        Or something. I mean, or because 
                        they got hit by a truck or there 
                        was a tragedy with a pet maybe.

                        in high school.

           People laugh.

                        Very funny. Yes, unrequited love. 
                        One of the great tragedies of life.

           He gets a faraway look in his eye and stares out the window 
           for like ten seconds. The class gets creeped out.

                        And it happened to Yeats, so, 
                        there’s that.  Now let’s split up 
                        into groups of three or four to 
                        work through this next poem.

           He trails off. Amy, Molly, and Jonathan are immediately a 
           group. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Should we invite Conor to be in our 
                        group?

                                 JONATHAN
                        He’s in a group. Everyone’s in a 
                        group. Oh, except Julie. Should we 
                        invite her?

           Molly and Amy look over at Julie, still sitting by herself.

                                 MOLL
                        No!

                                 AMY
                        I feel bad for her.

                                 MOLLY
                        I don’t. We were her friends. She 
                        abandoned us. Remember? 

           EXT. JULIE’S HOUSE - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Amy and Molly ring the doorbell. The door opens, to reveal 
           Julie.

                                 MOLLY
                        Hi Julie! Ready to go?

                                 JULIE
                        I - um - can’t hang out with you 
                        guys today. 

           Molly and Amy exchange a confused look. 

                                 AMY
                        But we hang out every day. 

                                 JULIE
                        I can’t today.

                                 AMY

                        Is it your mom’s birthday?

                                 JULIE
                        No.

                                 AMY
                        Is it your dad’s birthday?

                                 MOLLY
                        Is it your sister’s birthday?

                                 AMY
                        Brother’s birthday?

                                 MOLLY
                        Uncle’s  -

                                 JULIE
                        It’s no one’s birthday.

           Julie pushes the door open further to reveal...standing 
           behind her is RICKY, an attractive guy, 18 years old. He 
           walks up and puts his arm around Julie.

           Off Molly and Amy, mouths hanging open - in shock.

           INT. LUNCHROOM - LATER THAT DAY

           Molly and Amy are exiting the lunch line. AMY has gotten the 
           “Texas Tommy” - a hot dog wrapped in bacon, filled with 
           melted cheese.

           As Molly and Amy pass the cashier, we cut to the standard 
           wide shot of a high school cafeteria. The cliques, in their 
           various groups, the intimidating sense that the key to a 
           successful high school career involves finding safe haven at 
           the appropriate table. Molly and Amy pause, looking over the 
           tables - then without a second thought, they leave the 
           lunchroom.

           INT. HALLWAY, LEAVING CAFETERIA

           As Amy and Molly leave, they see Ryan and his friends pinning 
           a freshman boy by some lockers and farting on him.

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh my God. Your crush on him 
                        perplexes me.

                        I can’t help it. I’m drawn to him. 
                        It’s like a - a uterine pull. I 
                        have no control over it. Also he 
                        was also nice to me one day.

           INT. A MATH CLASSROOM

           The math class is taking a test. AMY knocks her calculator 
           off her desk. RYAN, sitting across the aisle from her turns 
           around.

                                 RYAN
                        You dropped your calculator.

           He turns back around without picking it up. Amy blushes and 
           sighs, staring at his back, helplessly in love. 

                                         CUT BACK:

                                 MOLLY
                        That was ninth grade.

                                 AMY
                        It was awesome.

           INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE

           Molly and Amy settle down at tables in the office. It has the 
           sense of a “working lunch” - as they talk, Molly is proofing 
           the paper and Amy is flipping through a math text book.

                                 AMY
                        Anyway, Ryan doesn’t even know I 
                        exist.

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m not sure if Ryan knows he 
                        exists. 

                                 AMY
                        At least Conor knows your name. You 
                        should just ask him out already - 

           There’s a knock on the open door. It’s Conor. He is holding a 
           large box. Molly reflexively stands up.

                                 CONOR
                        I don’t think you have to stand up 
                        when a student government president 
                        enters the room.

                        Oh, right.

                                 CONOR
                        Plus, you’re president too. You’d 
                        be standing all the time.

           Molly laughs at his bad joke. 

                                 CONOR (CONT’D)
                        Well, I just wanted to find you. 
                        These are the prom theme ballots. 
                        We should get together 
                        sometime...to count them. 

           Amy snorts in excitement and some cheese flies off the Texas 
           Tommy and hits Molly.

                                 CONOR (CONT’D)
                        Um.

                                 MOLLY
                        Please continue.

           The cheese is sticking to Molly.

                                 CONOR 
                        Okay - so - when is good for you?

           Amy shoots Molly a look that can mean nothing less than “ask 
           him!” 

                                 MOLLY
                        How about tonight?

                                 CONOR
                        Uh, yeah, but it’s Friday.

           Molly and Amy look puzzled.

                                 CONOR (CONT’D)
                        You really do have a lot of cheese 
                        on your face.

           Molly wipes it off, somewhat successfully.

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh, of course. Silly me. Friday 
                        isn’t a school night. 

                                 CONOR
                        I mean, I would. It’s just that - 
                        Dana’s party is tonight.

                   (he realizes they have no 
                    idea what he’s talking 
                    about)
                        Are you guys going? Big party for 
                        the seniors.

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh, I may have plans.

           Amy kicks Molly under the table.

                                 CONOR
                        You should come. It’ll be good 
                        practice for prom.

           Amy almost dies of excitement and covers a tiny squeal by 
           shoving the hot dog into her face. 

                                 CONOR (CONT’D)
                        So, see you later.

                                 MOLLY
                        Okay. See you. At the party. 

                                 CONOR
                        Later.

           Conor leaves.

                                 AMY
                        Good practice for prom!?

                                 MOLLY
                        He meant administrative.

           But Molly can’t help smiling.

           INT. MOLLY’S KITCHEN -NIGHT

           Molly and Amy are standing by the coffee pot, trying to chug 
           coffee. They look at the clock. It reads 8:15.

                                 AMY
                        How many cups have we had?

                                 MOLLY
                        Eight?

                                 AMY
                        Should we have more?

                        Yeah. We can’t leave for at least 
                        fifteen minutes.

                                 AMY
                        Do we have to go?

                                 MOLLY
                        We said we would. We are women of 
                        our word. Plus, Conor invited us. 

                                 AMY
                        Yeah, but we’ve tried to go to 
                        parties before.

                                 MOLLY
                        We know better now.

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - FLASHBACK

           MOLLY and AMY ring the bell and stand politely on the 
           doorstep, dressed up for what looks like a Christmas party 
           with your grandma: Laura Ashley dresses, thick white tights, 
           barrettes. A YOUNG GIRL answers the door.

                                 YOUNG GIRL 
                        JASON! YOUR FRIENDS ARE HERE!

                        WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? IT’S 
                        SIX FUCKING THIRTY?

            CUT BACK:

                                 AMY
                        And we’ve got to get by your Mom. 
                        Not like last time.

           Mrs. Carroll is reading. Amy and Molly stand by the door.

                        Mom, we’re going to the party.

                                 MRS. CARROLL

                        May I have the Murphy’s telephone 
                        number so I can check in with her 
                        parents about the party?

                                 MOLLY
                        Her parents aren’t home.

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        I’m calling the police.

                        I’ll do better this time. Feel 
                        awake enough?

                                 AMY
                        Yeah.

                                 MOLLY
                        Let’s cross this Rubicon!

           They march to the front door. MRS. CARROLL is in the same 
           place as before, reading.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to the meeting at 
                        Dana’s house.

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        When will you be back?

                                 MOLLY
                        Maybe eleven, eleven thirty.

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                   (suspicious)
                        That’s late for a meeting.
                        This is all about prom?

                                 MOLLY
                        Yes.

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        Seems silly to waste Student 
                        Government energy on such a tacky 
                        ritual. When I was in high school 
                        we spent our student government 
                        time holding mock Congressional 
                        hearings over the fall of Saigon.

                        If the responsible people don’t 
                        plan Prom, then the irresponsible 
                        people can’t have any fun.

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        I suppose. Call your Dad when you 
                        need to come home. Be safe.

           Amy and Molly nod and try not to bolt out the door.

           EXT. MOLLY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           They shut the door behind them. It’s a cold, wet night. 

                                 AMY
                        Good work.

                                 MOLLY
                        Thanks. What time is it?

                                 AMY
                        It’s eight-thirty.

                                 MOLLY
                        Okay, we have to walk six miles so 
                        we should get there at a perfect 
                        time.

           They set off.

           EXT. DANA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Molly and Amy trudge up to the door. There is definitely an 
           awesome party going on inside. Cars jam the driveway, all the 
           lights are on and the music is loud. They ring the doorbell. 
           There’s no response. 

                                 AMY
                        Maybe we should just go in.

                                 MOLLY
                        That’s rude.

           They keep ringing the bell until finally the door swings open 
           and it’s Dana. She stands in bright contrast - in a short

           Amy on her doorstep.

                        Oh my god! I can’t believe you guys 
                        are here! Did you walk?

                                 MOLLY
                        No.

                                 DANA
                        Wow, come in. This is totally 
                        weird. It’s like seeing a teacher 
                        outside of school.

                                 MOLLY
                        Should I take off my galoshes?

                                 DANA
                        Yeah, um, whatever. Just leave them 
                        there. I don’t think anyone will 
                        take your galoshes. Drinks in the 
                        kitchen, party all over!

           A popular girl grabs Dana and, with a look of mild shock at 
           Molly and Amy, drags Dana back into the party. Molly and Amy 
           start to take off their layers in the entryway.

           INT. DANA’S HOUSE - HALLWAY

           Molly and Amy wind their way through the party looking nerdy 
           and out of place. It’ss packed, the music is loud, and high-
           schoolers committ minor acts of vandalism left and right.

                                 MOLLY
                        This violates fire codes.

                                 AMY
                        Look at everyone. Everyone is here. 
                        FRESHMEN are here.

                                 MOLLY
                        Hey - Karen’s here.

           Karen is standing in the kitchen, leaning on a guy with a 
           drink in one hand.  She sees Amy. Amy and Molly wave. Karen 
           looks alarmed and runs away. 

                                 AMY
                        Whoa. Is that Brian Milder?

                                 MOLLY
                        Does your sister have a boyfriend?

           They look at each other, perplexed.

           Molly and Amy are staring at the alcohol on the counter. 
           There is a lot of it. We hear a familiar voice.

                                 CONOR
                        Hey! You came.

           He notices them staring at all the booze.

                                 CONOR (CONT’D)
                        Oh, does this upset you?

                                 MOLLY
                        No....I’m just... looking for my 
                        favorite drink.
                   (beat)
                        A dry white riesling.  

                                 CONOR
                        I don’t know if we have that but I 
                        can make you a rum and coke. Amy?

                                 AMY
                        I’ll just have a plain rum. 

                                 CONOR
                        Plain rum?

                                 AMY
                        That’s the way I like it.

           Conor pours Molly a rum and coke and just gives Amy a big 
           glass of rum. 

                                 CONOR
                        Give the lady what she wants. 
                        Bottoms up.

           Molly takes a tiny sip of her drink. Amy takes a huge 
           swallow. Molly smiles at Conor as if to say “good.” 

           Amy, however, is unable to swallow the large gulp of rum she 
           took and is standing there with a giant fish face with tears 
           running down her cheeks.

                                 CONOR (CONT’D)
                        Swallow it!

                                 MOLLY

                        Just swallow!

                                 MOLLY
                        Spit!

           Amy looks confused and Rum starts to come out of her nose.

                                 CONOR
                        Gross!

           Amy turns and spits out the rum in the sink, heaving. Conor 
           starts backing away.

           Amy and Molly walk into a large fancy library. 

                                 AMY
                        I’m sorry. I didn’t even know that 
                        could happen. But my sinuses are 
                        clear.

                                 MOLLY
                        Stop apologizing.
                   (she puts a hand out and 
                    grabs Amy’s arm)
                        Look! Julie’s here. 

           Julie is talking to a few boys across the room. 

                                 AMY
                        I wonder if Rick knows she flirts 
                        with guys at parties while he’s off 
                        at college.

                                 MOLLY
                        What a slut-bag. 

           Julie notices them, a look of surprise on her face. 

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go find someone to talk to -

                        There’s Eleanor!

           Eleanor is sitting in another corner of the room on a boy’s 
           lap, talking with a group of people.

                        Is she sitting on Nick Riley’s lap?

                        Are they going out?

                        Oh my God! You guys! What are you 
                        doing here? Are you here to save 
                        Darfur? I’m hilarious! 

                                 MOLLY
                        You shouldn’t sneak up on people.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Anyway, yeah, they’re totally 
                        dating.

           As Christina talks, we see the couples she mentions, at 
           various locales in the party, holding hands, or flirting.

                        Wow. We’re like the only three 
                        girls left in the Senior class 
                        without boyfriends.

                        Except I have one.

           A blonde boy materializes at her elbow with two drinks.

                                 HAROLD
                   (in a British accent)
                        Good evening ladies, allow me to 
                        introduce myself: I’m Harold. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Oh my god, you guys. This is my 
                        boyfriend, Harold. He’s an exchange 
                        student at north shore prep.

           Molly and Amy are visibly agog.

                                 HAROLD
                        Charmed, I’m sure.

                        Which is AWESOME. My Dad goes there 
                        on business a lot. Sometimes on 
                        Princeton business...

                        You know what? I still have rum in 
                        my nose. Excuse me while I use the 
                        bathroom.

                                 MOLLY
                        Let me help you.

           They scurry off.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        This is weird. They never come to 
                        parties. And now they have rum in 
                        their noses. Maybe I should put rum 
                        in my nose.

           Relieved to have escaped, Molly and Amy sit on the floor.

                                 AMY
                        CHRISTINA has a boyfriend?

                                 MOLLY
                        This can’t be true. She’s the most 
                        annoying person in the world.

                                 AMY
                        Maybe he gets a feeling of power 
                        when his hand gets under the 
                        Princeton shirt. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Gross. And he’s cute. And British.

                                 AMY
                        It’s like that annoying part of 
                        Jane Eyre when  - 

           There is a large crashing noise. Molly and Amy wince.

           Amy and Molly are rushing to get into their clothes. 

           Dana walks by. She’s hammered.

                                 DANA
                        Leaving?

                        Oh, um, yes. Thank you, we had a

DANA’S HOUSE - LATER

           MOLLY and AMY stand, stamping their feet in the snow, cold. A 
           Volvo station wagon pulls up. They get in.

           INT. MOLLY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Molly and Amy sit on opposite twin beds, wearing pajamas. 
           It’s obvious that Amy sleeps over a lot, and that the second 
           bed practically belongs to her. 

           The room looks like it was frozen in time for a younger girl. 
           The headboards are wicker. There are shelves of books, 
           posters about reading, and three American Girl dolls neatly 
           set up in a schoolroom situation. 

           Amy and Molly are still reeling over their party experience. 
           Molly’s on a tear, pretty worked up - Amy’s being a little 
           more subdued and thoughtful about the situation. 

                                 MOLLY
                        How do all those people have 
                        boyfriends?

                                 AMY
                        It’s like some sort of principle. 
                        Like evolution.

                                 MOLLY
                        So we’re dying off?

                                 AMY
                        No, we’re more selective.

                                 MOLLY
                        That means that we’re being 
                        selected against.

                                 AMY
                        No, we’re selecting for. Maybe 
                        there will be a plague soon.

                                 MOLLY
                        Great. Hey, Conor. Seeing as how 
                        all the other girls in our class 
                        are dead, you wanna go out?

                                 AMY

                        Are dead.

                                 AMY
                        No, they’re birds.

                        Maybe guys find substance abuse 
                        attractive.

                                 AMY
                        She pooped herself on the 
                        orienteering field trip in ninth 
                        grade. Everyone knew about it. 

                                 MOLLY 
                        Well, clearly we’re not the 
                        authority on what guys like. Maybe 
                        next time I see Conor, I should be 
                        smoking cocaine and shitting my 
                        pants! 

           Molly slumps down on the floor. Amy joins her.

                        Christina has a boyfriend.

                                 AMY
                        Yup. This is pathetic. 
                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 MOLLY
                        Maybe being a successful woman 
                        means you will never have a 
                        boyfriend.

                                 AMY
                        You sound like Maureen Dowd.

                                 MOLLY
                        Maybe she’s right.

                                 AMY
                        Maybe we just don’t really try.

                                 MOLLY
                        We try.

                                 AMY
                        No we don’t. The girls who get 
                        boyfriends spend time working on 
                        it. All we’ve worked on is getting 
                        into college.

                                 MOLLY
                        So...what are you saying?

                                 AMY
                        I’m saying...maybe we should set 
                        our minds to it. Let’s try to get 
                        them. We’re good at stuff we try!

                                 MOLLY
                        Like in an organized fashion?

                                 AMY
                        Yes. Like with a PLAN.

           They both start to get excited. 

                                 MOLLY
                        A plan to get boyfriends by prom.

                                 AMY
                        This is going to be easy! 

           Molly stands, with Amy, both girls totally excited now.

                                 MOLLY

                        We’re going to have boyfriends by 
                        prom!

           Molly and Amy get caught up in the awkward girl moment. They 
           clasp hands and shriek with excitement.

                                 MOLLY AND AMY
                        AAAAHHHHH!!!

                                 AMY
                        Want to make a powerpoint?

                                 MOLLY
                        Yes!

           Amy grabs a laptop, and they both sit down on opposite beds. 

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        So, how are we going to do this?

                                 AMY 
                        I don’t know. 

           They sit back, slightly deflated. 

           EXT. MICHIGAN TOWN - ESTABLISHING

           The sun shines over the Carroll Household.

           Chyron Reads: SATURDAY, FEB 15 - 96 DAYS BEFORE PROM

           INT. CONVENIENCE STORE/MAGAZINE RACK - DAY

           Molly and Amy stand by the magazine racks, wearing 
           sunglasses. They look as though they’re about to do something 
           illicit. 

           We see the headlines of popular women’s magazines. “Hot First 
           Date Sex”, “Make Him Love You With Your Body”, “101 Super 
           Secret Sex Tricks” “Thirty Pleasure Spots He Doesn’t Know You 
           Know About” and “Four hundred Guys Confess their 101 Super 
           Secret Sex Positions in Thirty Sex-o-rific Pages.”

           Amy nudges Molly.

                                 AMY
                        Do it.

                        My mom says these magazines poison 
                        your soul. 

                                 AMY
                        Fine. 

           Amy quickly grabs several “lewd” magazines off the shelf - we 
           see her take a COSMO, an ELLE, and a GLAMOUR. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get out of here. 

           Molly and Amy hurry to the cashier and put the magazines on 
           the counter.

                        Do you have to announce it to the 
                        whole store?

           Amy takes out her wallet and shows the cashier her driver’s 
           license.

           INT. MOLLY’S ROOM - DAY

           Molly and Amy are sitting with a pile of FASHION MAGAZINES in 
           front of them - VOGUE, GLAMOUR, ELLE, etc. They’re marking 
           them with post-its. Molly is also making notes on a laptop.

                                 MOLLY
                        What’s a taint?

                                 AMY
                        I dunno. Why?

                                 MOLLY
                        In “Sexy Secrets Men Will Never 
                        Tell” a man named Jason says he 
                        enjoys when girls press his taint.

                                 AMY
                        Google “taint.”
                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)

Molly types “taint” into the laptop - 

           Immediately all sorts of porny pictures pop up.

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh God. Look away.

                                 AMY
                        No, we have to learn.

           Amy turns Molly’s head to face the computer.

                                 MOLLY 
                        It’s hairy! 

           They look disgusted. Riveted, but disgusted.

                                 AMY
                        It’s a butt. Sort of.

                                 MOLLY
                   (reading aloud)
                        “Touching this magic spot will get 
                        your man to moan.” 

                                 AMY
                        Because he’s wondering why you are 
                        trying to give him a rectal exam.

                                 MOLLY
                        This cannot be true.

                                 AMY
                        This seems like an advanced step.

           Molly shows her a page in the magazine. It has a pink 
           silhouette of a man and a woman having sex.

                                 MOLLY
                        A reverse cowgirl? A communist 
                        holdover?

           We see a position that makes no sense.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Can people even do this?

           Amy picks up a magazine.

                                 AMY
                        Look - we don’t have to start with

           INT. KELLOGG HIGH SCHOOL/HALLWAY - DAY

           Molly and Amy burst in the door, confidently strutting in 
           ugly 1980s looking pantsuits. Molly throws the suit jacket 
           over her shoulder thus “transforming” the outfit.

           Students in the hallway stop and stare, stunned. Conor arches 
           an eyebrow at them. Jonathan is confused.

                        Maybe they peed their pants and had 
                        to change at school.

           Students snicker and point.

                        We didn’t make things better. We 
                        made them worse. Clearly we have no 
                        idea what we’re doing. We need more 
                        help than a few smut magazines can 
                        give us.

                        Yeah. We need an expert.

           Molly and Amy look up at each other - both having the same 
           idea at the same time.

           Julie takes a moment, and wipes the clay off her hands. She 
           sits back, and takes a good long pause.

                        You’re the one who got all busy and 
                        important with her new boyfriend. 

                                 JULIE
                        Just because I couldn’t hang out 
                        with you every second didn’t mean I 
                        didn’t want to hang out ever. What 
                        is this, third grade? 

                                 AMY
                        Oh, so you have a boyfriend, and 
                        you’re soooo mature now.
                   (to Molly)
                        This was a bad idea. Let’s forget 
                        it.

                                 MOLLY
                        Yeah. Tell Ricky we said hi.

           Molly and Amy turn to walk away. Julie sighs, and calls them 
           back.

                                 JULIE
                        No, wait a minute. 

           Molly and Amy turn back.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        It was my fault too. I’ll help you.

                        What the fuck are you wearing?

           INT. MOLLY’S HOUSE/KITCHEN - DAY

           CHYRON READS “74 DAYS UNTIL PROM” 

           Mrs. Carroll sits at the kitchen table, tutoring SUGI, a 14-
           year-old Indian girl.

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        Almost, Sugi. But remember, F(x) 
                        equals the cosine of X.

                                 SUGI
                        Oh, I’m so stupid! 

           The doorbell rings, and Mrs. Carroll stands.

CAROLLL
                        What have I told you about that 
                        word? That word does not exist in 
                        this house. 

           Molly runs down the stairs, past her mother.

                                 MOLLY
                        I’ll get it!

           Molly opens the door for Amy and Julie, and the girls quickly 
           head upstairs. 

           Mrs. Carroll is puzzled. She looks to Sugi. Sugi shrugs.

           INT. MOLLY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Molly, Amy, and Julie walk in. Molly shuts the door, and they 
           stand together awkwardly. It’s been a while since the three 
           of them have spent time alone together. 

                                 JULIE
                        Wow. Your room looks exactly the 
                        same. 

           Julie touches one of Molly’s American Girl dolls.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        You haven’t changed anything.

                                 MOLLY
                        Not since fourth grade, really. 
                   (beat)
                        I fear change. 

                                 JULIE
                        Well, I guess that’s why I’m here. 
                        If you want boyfriends you’re gonna 
                        have to change. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Change - change what?

                                 JULIE
                        Everything.

           INT. MOLLY’S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Mrs. Carroll is tutoring Sugi when Mr. Carroll walks in, home 
           from work. He’s carrying a briefcase, and wearing a suit.

CARROLL
                        Hi Honey.
                   (to Sugi)
                        Hello.

                                 SUGI
                        Hello.

           Mr. Carroll takes a drink out of the refrigerator. Mrs. 
           Carroll gets up, and whispers to him, as Sugi works.

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        Julie Marsh is upstairs with Molly 
                        and Amy.

                                 MR. CARROLL
                        All right. 

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        Julie Marsh.

           Mr. Carroll has no idea who this is. 

                                 MR. CARROLL
                        Is she a drug dealer?

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        No. She was Molly and Amy’s best 
                        friend for eleven years.

                                 SUGI
                        It seems like they had a bit of a 
                        falling out.

           They stare at Sugi.

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        That’s right, Sugi. They did. 

                                 MR. CARROLL
                        Maybe they’re friends again.

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        But why now? Something must have 
                        happened. 

                                 MR. CARROLL
                        You worry too much. I’m sure it’s 
                        just girls being girls.

                                 SUGI
                        You say that now -- but wait until

                        Then you’ll have something to worry 
                        about.

           scared. Off Mr. Carroll, looking upstairs -- 

           INT. MOLLY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Julie stands, lecturing. She’s transformed from a friendly 
           girl-next-door to a militaristic drill instructor.

                                 JULIE
                        There need to be big changes made 
                        here. Big. 

                                 AMY
                        We’re ready.

                                 JULIE
                        No, you’re not. You have to be 
                        smart about this. It’s like if a 
                        fat man suddenly decides he wants 
                        to run a marathon. He doesn’t just 
                        wake up all fat and disgusting and 
                        run the marathon. Because he’d die 
                        of heart failure. He has to train 
                        first.  

                                 MOLLY
                        What does that mean?

                                 JULIE
                        It means you’re going to start 
                        small. Work up to the big stuff. 
                        Right now, you have to focus on 
                        doing two things. 

           She now writes on a dry-erase board on the wall.

                        Get cooler, and get sexier. 

                                 AMY
                        But isn’t that a betrayal of 
                        everything we stand for?

                                 JULIE
                        These are surface changes. Surface 
                        changes attract boys. Once you’ve 
                        attracted them, you can be your old 
                        dorky selves. What, do you want to 
                        marry some old librarian?

                        marries an old man because - 

                                 JULIE
                        Just focus on your objectives.

                        Don’t write that down. Why are you 
                        writing this down?

                                 MOLLY
                        So I won’t forget.

                                 JULIE
                        But I just wrote it down right 
                        here. 
                   (pause)
                        Actually, why do you even have a 
                        dry-erase board in your room?

                                 MOLLY
                        For problem-solving.

                        Ok, this isn’t school. This is 
                        exactly the sort of stuff that 
                        needs to stop. Immediately. It’s 
                        not cool. Or sexy.

                                 AMY
                        Fine. What are we supposed to do?

                                 JULIE 
                        Try being social after school.

                                 MOLLY
                        We are social.

                                 JULIE
                        Student activities don’t count. 
                        Especially not student government. 

           Molly frowns. 

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Go somewhere after school, where 
                        people hang out.

                        Nothing.

                                 MOLLY
                        But what’s being accomplished?

                                 JULIE
                        Nothing. It’s just hanging out. For 
                        fun.

                                 MOLLY
                        That’s weird. 

                                 JULIE
                        No, that’s normal. You’re weird. So 
                        stop being spazzes, and try to fit 
                        in.

           As Julie starts outlining more specific details of the plan, 
           we cut away to see Molly and Amy following her advice. Then 
           we return to the present scene, where Julie continues her 
           lesson.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Amy, Molly, and Jonathan stand awkwardly in the corner of a 
           coffee shop. 

           Students are lounging in chairs, laughing and talking. The 
           only open space is right near a little old lady. They move to 
           sit down- 

                                 OLD LADY
                        Seat’s taken.

           INT. MOLLY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Julie continues to outline the plan.

                                 AMY
                        Ok, what else? 

                                 JULIE
                        Go to more parties. You can’t go to 
                        one party in four years and call it 
                        a day. You have to make the effort.

                        You can just show up.

           Amy and Molly exchange a glance, like “really?” Julie shakes 
           her head - clearly they need her help. 

           INT. PARTY - NIGHT

           Amy and Molly stand awkwardly by the bar at a party in 
           someone’s basement. Around them the party rages. 

                                 AMY
                        I just think students should take a 
                        more active role in community 
                        service at a young age. Otherwise 
                        they won’t take an active role as 
                        adults.

                                 MOLLY
                        But making it mandatory won’t 
                        encourage them to participate in 
                        the future, it’ll discourage them. 
                        Studies have shown - 

           Ryan’s friend Jordan wanders up to the bar. He’s loud, and 
           very drunk.

                                 JORDAN
                        What are you talking about?

           He stumbles a little. Molly and Amy look at each other.

                                 MOLLY
                        Well - we’re - 

                                 JORDAN
                        What are you talking about? 

                                 AMY
                        We think that - 

           Suddenly Jordan puts his hand on Molly’s face, and pushes her 
           aside. He then throws up all over the bar.

                        No more mom jeans, no more American 
                        Girl dolls. And for God’s sake, no 
                        more of those insane pants suits. 
                        Think outside the box. 

           INT. J CREW CLOTHING STORE - 

           Molly heads for the dressing room, holding several items in 
           her hands. Amy follows.

           Molly is wearing a pair of light jeans and a navy blue t-
           shirt. She looks back at Amy, as if unsure that she should 
           enter the dressing room - Amy nods, “go on”...

           Molly goes into the dressing room. Moments later, she comes 
           out - wearing the same jeans, and a bright blue shirt.

           Amy raises her eyebrows, delighted with the transformation - 
           she smiles, and claps. 

           Molly smiles, and spins in front of the dressing room mirror - 
           in love with her new look. Amy applauds.

           SALESGIRL stands to the side, watching - she scrunches up her 
           face, as if to say, “what is wrong with those idiots?’

           Molly is leaving the house, wearing her new J Crew outfit. 
           Mrs. Carroll is preparing breakfast.

                        Juice and toast?

           Molly and Amy pull into school and park. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I can’t believe you’re saying this. 
                        You think we’ll get boyfriends 
                        riding the bus with freshmen?

                                 AMY
                        No, of course not. I’m just 
                        considering the ethical 
                        implications of driving to school 
                        when there’s an oil crisis.

                                 MOLLY
                        All the seniors drive to school.

                                 AMY
                        Which is precisely the problem! 
                        It’s group think. We’re at the 
                        brink of an environmental 
                        holocaust, and we - 

           Amy is interrupted by a loud HONKING sound. She turns, to see 
           Ryan, in his car, parked in the space next to Amy’s. 

           Amy rolls her window down, and Ryan pokes his head into the 
           car, smiling.

                                 RYAN
                        Nice ride, ladies. 

           He walks off. Amy and Molly smile at each other. 

                                 MOLLY
                        See?  

           We pull back to reveal their car; An enormous, unsightly 
           Volvo, sitting in a sea of fancy SUVs.

                                 RYAN
                        Blow jobs! 

                                 CONOR
                        We couldn’t take every suggestion. 
                        We picked the most popular, and 
                        least offensive, ideas.

                                 MOLLY
                        There was a tie for most popular 
                        between “The Little Mermaid” -- 

           Some BOO’s from the audience. Christina claps, delighted.

                                 CONOR
                        And “Global Warming”. Even though 
                        we’re pretty sure most of you voted 
                        for that one ironically, it still 
                        tied with Little Mermaid.

                                 MOLLY
                        So in the interests of fairness, 
                        we’re going to have both themes 
                        represented at prom. 

                                 CONOR
                        Um...I guess that’s it. 

           Confused students shuffle out of the auditorium.

                                 CONOR (CONT’D)
                        I guess we didn’t need a whole 
                        assembly for this, huh?

                                 MOLLY
                        Yeah, we could’ve just announced it 
                        over the PA system.

           Molly walks off. Conor watches her go, and calls her back. 

                                 CONOR
                        Hey, Molly. 

           She turns.

                        Cute shirt today. 

           Molly breaks out into a huge smile, and blushes. Cue romantic 
           music. As the music swells, Molly can barely whisper:

                                 MOLLY 
                        Thank you. 

           EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT - MOLLY’S HOUSE

           The sun sets over the Carroll household. 

           INT. MOLLY’S ROOM - DAY 

           Molly and Amy are talking to Julie. Julie is undressing one 
           of Molly’s American Girls Dolls. 

                                 MOLLY
                        And we went to two parties last 
                        week.

                                 JULIE
                        Did you talk to anyone besides each 
                        other?

                                 MOLLY
                        A little.

           Julie frowns.

                                 AMY
                        C’mon, we’ve done everything you 
                        told us to. We got new looks, we’ve 
                        been going out.

                                 MOLLY
                        We’ve made a laudable effort.

                                 JULIE
                        Stop using words like that, for 
                        Christ’s sake. You think a boy’s 
                        going to date someone who made a 
                        laudable effort?

                                 MOLLY
                        Sorry. Why are you taking the 
                        clothes off my American Girls 
                        Dolls?

                        Don’t question me. If this is going 
                        to work, you need to trust. Ok?

                                 MOLLY
                        Ok...

           Julie puts down the naked doll and goes to the white-board. 
           Amy and Molly look at each other, like, this is weird.

                                 JULIE 
                        Your next step won’t be as easy as 
                        buying a few shirts and showing up 
                        at a couple parties. Entering the 
                        next phase means it’s time to dig 
                        down and commit. 
                   (pause)
                        Now. You’ve gotten cooler and 
                        sexier. Sort of. 
                   (pause)
                        It’s time for you to get closer. 

           Molly and Amy sit, a little uncertain. Then Amy moves to 
           Molly’s bed, and sits next to her.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Not closer to each other. Closer to 
                        boys. The boys you like. Amy, get 
                        closer to Ryan. Molly, get closer 
                        to Conor.

                                 MOLLY
                        But I see Conor every day!

                                 JULIE
                        You work with Conor every day. You 
                        need to start flirting with him. Be 
                        a girl around him, not a colleague. 

                                 AMY
                        How are we supposed to do this?

                                 JULIE
                        That’s why I’m here. I’ve come up 
                        with a fantastic idea. But it 
                        requires a bit of  - 

                                 MOLLY
                        Derring-do?

                                 JULIE
                        No.

                        Like a caper?

                                 JULIE
                        No. Amy, you join the softball 
                        team. Molly, you do the spring 
                        musical. 

           The girls are flabbergasted. Simultaneously they object.

                                 AMY
                        Why? Ryan plays baseball.

                                 MOLLY
                        But that’s ridiculous I can’t sing - 

                                 JULIE
                        One at a time. 
                   (to Amy)
                        Due to budget cuts, the teams 
                        travel TOGETHER to away games. 
                        That’s like up to two hours of mega 
                        flirting time. In the dark. All 
                        sweaty. Co-ed bus trips are pretty 
                        much blow job central.

                                 MOLLY
                        But why would I do the musical?

                                 JULIE
                        Because Conor always does the 
                        musical. And all the cast members 
                        see each other all the time, after 
                        school, sometimes naked. School 
                        plays are pretty much blow job 
                        central.

                                 MOLLY
                        So, basically, you’re just trying 
                        to get us to blow job central.

                                 AMY
                        Like, how many blow jobs are 
                        happening at any given moment?

                                 JULIE
                        Tons. 

           Off Amy and Molly, uncertain, but a little excited --

KELLOGG HIGH AUDITORIUM- DAY

           Molly sits in the back of the theater, nervously humming to 
           herself. Students are scattered throughout in various stages 
           of preparation for their auditions.  

           WESLEY, a disgruntled former actor, completely disgusted with 
           his life, sits in the front row watching a nervous boy finish 
           singing “Take Back Your Mink.” WESLEY’s student assistant 
           NORMAN plinks out tunes on the piano.

           PIMPLY BOY finishes. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Good job, what is it - Ethan?

                                 ETHAN
                        Yes.

                                 WESLEY
                        You are aware that song is sung by 
                        a female character?

                                 ETHAN
                   (blushes)
                        No.

                                 WESLEY
                        NEXT!  
                   (to the students)
                        This musical is canonical people. 
                        You can rent it! You can get it on 
                        netflix! You can download it to 
                        your flibberty doos with the 
                        gigglety pops. There is NO reason 
                        you shouldn’t be prepared.

           A slim, pixie-esque girl with a funky haircut and cool 
           clothes sits down next to Molly. She is wearing enormous DJ 
           headphones attached to a teeny mp3 player.

                        Molly Carroll? Are you doing the 
                        musical? This is super awesome. I’m

                        Thank you...

           Conor emerges from the audience and steps on stage.

                                 WESLEY
                        Name?

                                 CONOR
                        Conor Pierson. Senior.

                                 WESLEY
                        Okay Conor - you look like a nice 
                        guy. But are you an ACTOR? Or are 
                        you here because you saw High 
                        School Musical? Because that 
                        Hollywood bullshit does not fly in 
                        ART.

                                 CONOR
                        I’ve been in the musical every 
                        year...

                                 WESLEY
                        Okay. Sing away.

           Conor starts to sing. Molly’s eyes go soft and unfocused as 
           she daydreams along to Conor’s audition. 

           KHS - GYM - SOFTBALL COACH’S OFFICE - DAY

           Amy stares at the softball sign up sheet, hanging from a 
           clipboard on the wall.

           Amy lifts her hand to sign it. She brings it down. She lifts 
           her hand again. She brings it down. Suddenly we hear a DOOR 
           OPEN, and several BOYS LAUGHING. 

           Amy turns, to see Ryan, Jordan, Alex, and other baseball 
           buddies walking down the hall, carrying gym bags.  They’re 
           laughing and punching each other - de rigeur for their set. 
           They walk into the boys’ locker room. 

           Amy again lifts her hand - and now reluctantly signs her name 
           at the bottom of the list.

                        You’re doing the musical?

                                 MOLLY
                        Yeah...just you know..thought..fun.

                                 CONOR
                        Great!

                                 ROSE
                        Hi, I’m Rose. Great job. Your range 
                        is spectacular. Super sonic.

                                 MOLLY
                        I was just going to say that about 
                        your range.

                                 NORMAN

                                 MOLLY
                        It’s me!

                                 CONOR
                        Good luck.

           He pats her on the shoulder. Molly heads to the stage.

                                 WESLEY
                        Molly. We’re going to have you just 
                        sing a few bars, with young Norman 
                        playing accompaniment. Have you 
                        prepared?

                                 MOLLY
                        I practiced all night.

           INT. MOLLY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Molly stands by the piano, singing the final words of ‘If I 
           were a bell’. Sugi is accompanying her. Molly is warbling an 
           on-key (her mother is a music teacher, after all) but 
           horrifically wooden version of “If I were a bell”. 

           INT. KHS - DRAMA ROOM - DAY 

           As we return to the audition, Molly ends the song at the same 
           place. Wesley sits without speaking for several awkward 
           seconds.

                        You managed to sing that song like 
                        it was an instruction book.

           Molly misinterprets his comment, and smiles, relieved.

                                 MOLLY
                        Thank you.

                                 WESLEY
                        NEXT!

           Molly exits the stage. Wesley turns to Norman and whispers. 

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Cut her.

                                 NORMAN
                        We can’t. Everyone gets to be in 
                        the musical. Auditions are just a 
                        formality. I keep telling you that.

                                 WESLEY
                        Ah, Norman. Ironic, isn’t it? In an 
                        inner city school, if you got cut 
                        from a musical you’d probably die 
                        in the streets.

           In the back of the auditorium Conor gives Molly a high five.

                                 CONOR
                        Great job.

                                 MOLLY
                        I was nervous.

                                 CONOR
                        Not a lot of people are gutsy 
                        enough to go out for the musical as 
                        seniors.

                                 MOLLY
                        That’s why they call me...Gutsy 
                        McGoo.

           Molly is alarmed at what she has just said, but they are both 
           interrupted by a loud and incredible rendition of “Umbrella.” 
           They turn and see Rose, belting it out.

                                 CONOR
                        Wow, she’s amazing.

                        That song’s not even in the show.

           EXT. SOFTBALL FIELDS - NIGHT

           Softball tryouts. A bunch of girls mill around doing drills. 
           Amy is at bat. Clearly uncomfortable, she keeps shifting her 
           hands on the bat. A coach stands behind her with a clipboard.

           A pitch zips by, and makes a THWAP into the catcher’s glove.

                                 COACH
                        Strike one!

           Another pitch - another ball zips by. 

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        Strike two!
                   (then)
                        Swing at it, Amy.

           Another perfect pitch zips right past Amy. 

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        Strike three.

           Amy readies herself again, bends her knees - intensely 
           focused. Beat.

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        You only get three.

           Off Amy - oops --  

           EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

           The team is doing a sprint. Amy comes in last. The coaches 
           shake their heads.

           EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

           Amy stands in a line at shortstop. In the front of the line 
           girls are fielding grounders and throwing them to third. Amy 
           looks exhausted. PIPER, a tough girl with a butch haircut 
           takes pity on her.

                                 PIPER
                        This is the last part of tryouts.

                        Thank god. I’ve been doing so 
                        awful.

                                 PIPER
                        Well, don’t worry too much, they’re 
                        only cutting one person.

           As Piper steps forward to field, a line drive hits her in the 
           face. She goes down.  Whistles blow and coaches run 
           frantically out waving their arms. 

                                 COACH
                        She’s out for the season. 

           Off Amy - holy shit, she just made the team.

           INT. KELLOGG HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Amy and Molly trudge down the hall. Molly looks anxious. Amy 
           is massaging her elbow, and walking slowly. 

                                 AMY
                        I’m so SORE. I think I tore my 
                        rotator cuff. And the other girls 
                        hate me because I’m so bad. It’s 
                        like, I’m the dumb kid in class. 
                        Me. 

                                 MOLLY
                        It’s not class, it’s softball. 
                        C’mon, hurry up. 

                                 AMY
                        Yesterday I FINALLY got a hit and I 
                        ran to third, thinking it was 
                        first. Did you know all the bases 
                        look exactly the same? I calmly, 
                        and rationally pointed out that 
                        because they’re equidistant from 
                        home plate, it was an 
                        understandable mistake.
                   (beat)
                        Are you listening? 

                                 MOLLY
                   (distracted)
                        What? Sorry. Nervous anticipation.

                                 AMY
                        I can’t wait until you start the

                        I had no idea we practiced for 
                        three weeks before a game. Who 
                        needs that much practice? 

           They stop in front of a board with a piece of paper posted 
           “GUYS AND DOLLS CAST LIST”. Molly glances - then turns away.

                                 MOLLY
                        I can’t look.

                                 AMY
                        Don’t be ridiculous.

                                 MOLLY
                        What if I didn’t make it? 

                                 AMY
                        Everyone makes it. 

           Amy scans from Stacey Carson to Jen Crowley - no Molly.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Huh. You’re not in the chorus. 
                        Maybe you got a LEAD. 

           Molly perks up with excitement. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, wait - here you are! 

           Molly turns to look. She finds her name, next to the role of 
           GANGSTER NUMBER FOUR. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m a boy? 

                                 AMY
                        You’re a gangster! That’s awesome. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m a boy. In the boy chorus. For 
                        boys. 

           Suddenly, a voice behind her. 

                                 CONOR (V.O.)
                        Looks like we’ll be gangsters 
                        together. That’ll be fun. 

           Molly turns, tries to hide her disappointment. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Right. 
                                                     (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                 CONOR
                        I’m Sky Masterson!

                                 AMY
                        Wow, that’s the lead. 

                                 CONOR
                   (fake modesty)
                        Yeah...

                                 AMY
                   (innocently)
                        Who’s playing Sarah?

                                 CONOR
                        It’s that girl Rose. Sophomore.

                                 MOLLY
                        Yes, she’s very small. I mean, 
                        nice. Anyway, congrats.

                                 CONOR
                        Thanks! You too! See you at 
                        rehearsal, number four.

           Conor heads off. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Number four? That’s not what a boy 
                        calls a girl he likes. Boyfriends 
                        do not call their girlfriends 
                        ‘Number Four’.  

                                 AMY
                        At least you’re not number two.

           Molly starts walking off. Amy keeps teasing her.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Get it? Number two? 

                                 MOLLY
                        Yes, I get it. 

           INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

           Amy, Molly, Julie and Jonathan all sit in a small group.

                                 JONATHAN
                        Anyway, I think we could say Yeats 
                        was motivated by his, uh, desire 
                        and -

                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)           No one is paying attention. Amy yawns.

                                 JONATHAN (CONT’D)
                        You guys want to help? Or should I 
                        just do everything?

                                 AMY
                        Sorry Jonathan. Just tired.

                                 JULIE
                        I keep sayin - drink coffee.

                                 JONATHAN
                        Do NOT drink coffee. It’s bad for 
                        you. What is going on?

                                 MOLLY
                        Stupid play.

                                 AMY
                        Softball. Takes up so much time. 
                        You run and run and run, really, 
                        for a sport where you mainly just 
                        stand. Does anyone understand that?

                                 JONATHAN
                        I don’t know why you guys are doing 
                        that stuff. It’s not you.

           All three girls smile.

                                 JONATHAN (CONT’D)
                        What? Do I have something in my 
                        teeth?

                                 JULIE
                        No. We’re doing an experiment. 
                        Molly and Amy are just seeing if 
                        some new activities will help 
                        attract certain male attentions. 

           Julie indicates the other side of the classroom. Conor is 
           working in a group and laughing. Ryan is chewing on the 
           corner of his book.

                                 JONATHAN
                        You are KIDDING me. Oh my god. Oh 
                        my god. Girls are stupid. I never 
                        believed it, but now I know. I have 
                        to go to the bathroom.

           He gets up and storms to the door. On the way out he hits 
           Ryan’s chair. Ryan looks up.

                        You know why Yeats went crazy? It 
                        was when Maud Gonne was dating that 
                        stupid Major doing stupid stuff. He 
                        was like “I’m a poet, you like 
                        poetry” but no, she was all like, I 
                        like fighter guys. Fighter guys 
                        fighter guys fighter guys. It never 
                        stops!

           He exits.

           EXT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

           Amy and the softball team board the school bus. Amy sees Ryan 
           get on. He smiles at her. She’s excited.

                                 COACH
                        It’s gameday kids, hurry up.

                                 AMY
                   (under her breath)
                        Here we go...

           INT. SCHOOLBUS - CONTINUOUS 

           We see Ryan, sitting in his seat. As Amy climbs the stairs, 
           behind a line of softball players, she nervously looks 
           around. The baseball team has taken up most of the seats.

                                 JORDAN
                        Dykes in the back!

           Humiliated, Amy follows the rest of the softball team to the 
           back of the bus. 

           Amy looks longingly at Ryan who is playing around with his 
           baseball buddies. As Amy takes out a book to read, everyone 
           starts laughing and yelling and being obnoxious. It will be 
           impossible to concentrate in this jungle. Amy leans back in 
           her seat - a new, and awful, reality setting in...

           We flash to several scenes of Amy hating softball:
                                                      (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)           EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY 

           Amy running for home plate, and getting tagged by the 
           catcher. The “tag”, however, is so hard, that Amy gets 
           knocked backwards into the fence. She lies there, in pain.

           EXT. SOFTBALL GAME - DAY

           A pop fly hit in Amy’s direction. We’re close on Amy, 
           extending her hand, ready to catch the ball. We pull back, as 
           the ball falls to the ground - several feet from Amy. 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Amy in the locker room, the team around her. Changing after a 
           game. Amy is dirty and sweaty. She lifts her jersey over her 
           head, but it gets stuck. She struggles with the shirt stuck 
           over her head. 

           INT. KELLOGG HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY

           The cast of Guys and Dolls is assembled on stage. Rose does 
           elaborate stretches outside of the general group. Conor 
           stares at her. This annoys Molly.

                                 WESLEY
                        All right everyone, I know we’re 
                        all more interested in text 
                        messaging than in creating art, but 
                        today - we exchange our 
                        blackberries for imaginations. 
                        Gangsters, you’re with Norman to 
                        work Luck Be A Lady. Conor, Rose, 
                        we’re going to work the Havana 
                        scene today.

                                 ROSE
                        Is that the -- ?

                                 WESLEY 
                        Yes it is, Rose. Let’s see if we 
                        can’t handle this rehearsal with a 
                        modicum of maturity. Shall we try? 

           Rose and Conor blush.
                                              (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)           As Molly walks slowly over to the piano, a short girl tugs on 
           her elbow. Molly looks down to see a very nerdy, short, acne 
           ridden freshman girl, ANNIKA.

                                 ANNIKA
                        Hey, I’m the other girl gangster.
                        I’m excited about this because my 
                        Uncle Mark used to be a woman.

                                 MOLLY
                        What was he going on about a 
                        modicum of maturity? 

                                 ANNIKA
                        Oh, cause it’s the kissing scene. 
                        Between Conor and Rose.

                                 MOLLY
                   (shocked and disturbed)
                        There’s a kissing scene?

                                 ANNIKA
                        Yeah. They kiss BIG TIME.

           Norman starts them with a vocal warm-up, but Molly can’t take 
           her eyes off of Conor and Rose flirting in the background.

           INT. MOLLY’S CAR - LATER

           Molly and Amy hop in the car after their activities. They are 
           interrupting each other at random.

                                 MOLLY
                        They kiss. They fucking kiss.

                                 AMY
                        Everyone hates me.

                                 MOLLY
                        It’s basically torture. I signed up 
                        for two months of horrible torture.

                                 AMY
                        The boys are disgusting. And mean.

                                 MOLLY
                        They’re gonna fall in love.

                                 AMY
                        There’s all this drama --

                        And I’m dancing with a bunch of 
                        losers over on the side.
                   (beat)
                        You smell bad. 

                                 AMY
                        There are no showers. It’s 
                        horrible.

                                 MOLLY
                        All of Conor’s flirting time is 
                        going to get eaten up with Rose.

           Amy focuses on Molly. 

                                 AMY
                        I don’t think it works that way. 
                        There’s plenty of flirt to go 
                        around.

                                 MOLLY
                        But there shouldn’t be! He’s gonna 
                        get all caught up with her. She 
                        just stretches in the middle of the 
                        stage. And he watches. 

                                 AMY
                        Chill. Maybe he’s watching because 
                        it’s weird.

           Molly starts driving.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Look, she’s a sophomore. You and 
                        Conor are already flirting more 
                        than you ever did before. Think 
                        about it. 

           INT. LIBRARY - FLASHBACK

           Molly gets a book location from a reference terminal and 
           heads into the stacks. She runs into Conor looking lost.

                                 CONOR
                        I can never find anything.

                                 MOLLY
                        More like the dew-ey know what 
                        we’re doing decimal system.

           Conor looks confused.

MOLLY’S CAR - DAY

                                 AMY
                        So, just, keep on it. You’re making 
                        progress. I signed up to get 
                        harassed by a schoolbus full of 
                        adolescent jackasses.

                                 MOLLY
                        Yeah. Ok.

                                 AMY
                        You have nothing to worry about. 
                        Just stick with it.

                                 MOLLY
                        Ok. You too...

           Off the girls, both nervous. 

           INT. BUS - DAY

           The softball team is crammed in the back of the bus. A guy on 
           the baseball team walks to the back. The girls look up.

                                 BASEBALL GUY
                        I have a present for you.

           He farts.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Molly and Conor are going over a dance step. Rose comes up to 
           them and does it right the very first time. She and Conor 
           give each other a high five.

           EXT. AWAY SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY

           Amy is at bat. We see that they are winning big. A pitch 
           whizzes by her.

                                 UMP
                        Ball four. Take your base.

           Amy starts walking to third. Her teammates yell at her and 
           she turns around quickly and heads for first.

AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Molly and Conor are still practicing the dance step. Molly 
           finally gets it. She gives a little jump for joy. It seems 
           like Conor is going to give her a hug when Rose does 
           cartwheels by them. Conor chases after her.

           INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY

           Molly, Jonathan, Julie and Amy are eating lunch.

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m not wild about our op-ed 
                        pieces.

                                 JONATHAN
                        Maybe if you’d been here when we 
                        decided on them, you could’ve 
                        weighed in then.

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m still Editor-in-Chief. We need 
                        new ideas. These are all bad. 

                                 JULIE
                        Chill.

                                 MOLLY
                        I can’t chill if this stupid 
                        musical is ruining my paper.

                                 JULIE
                        Oh stop. You and Conor are totally 
                        flirt monster now.

                                 JONATHAN
                        It’s true. Emphasis on “monster”. 

                                 MOLLY
                        You can tell?

                        You laugh at everything Conor says.

                        Thanks. Now I know that my dignity 
                        as class president is compromised. 

           They notice a change in her tone.

                                 JULIE
                        It’s just a joke. What’s up?

                                 MOLLY
                        Nothing. I’m just frustrated that I 
                        have to pick up the slack now. I 
                        thought I could leave the paper for 
                        a couple days without the entire 
                        operation falling apart.

                                 JULIE
                        Um. I think you’re over-inflating 
                        the importance of the school paper.

                                 JONATHAN
                        What is your problem?

                                 AMY
                        She’s worried Conor has a crush on 
                        Rose.

           Everyone is interested in this bit of news. Molly looks a 
           little horrified.

                                 JULIE
                        A sophomore? No way.

                                 MOLLY
                        He pays so much attention to her.

                                 JULIE
                        Well, she’s his co-star. He kind of 
                        has to. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Yeah. But I want to be his co-star. 
                        I have this weird feeling, like 
                        anger, but only at her.  I want to, 
                        you know, just lock her in a closet 
                        somewhere for like five years or 
                        drop a rock on her foot.

                                 JULIE
                        Wow, this is adorable. You’ve never 
                        been jealous and now you are.
                                              (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                 MOLLY
                        I’m jealous of girls who have 
                        boyfriends.

                                 JONATHAN
                        No, you’re not. Because normally, 
                        you look at all the girls in school 
                        who have boyfriends, and it doesn’t 
                        bother you because you’re smarter 
                        than them. And you just tell 
                        yourself, “It’s okay, she’s 
                        stupid.” But with Rose, it’s 
                        different.

                                 MOLLY
                        Thanks for the character analysis. 
                        Good to hear from someone who’s 
                        such an expert on romance.

           Jonathan looks hurt. Molly realizes she made a mistake. 
           Jonathan gets up and leaves.

                                 JULIE
                        That was a shitty thing to say.

                                 MOLLY
                        He’s annoying.

                                 JULIE
                        He has a crush on you, retard. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I don’t want Jonathan to have a 
                        crush on me. Why would he sit 
                        around talking about Conor with us?

                                 AMY
                   (pointed)
                        Yeah, it’s all we do lately.

           Molly does not notice the jibe.

                                 JULIE
                        You have a game today?

                                 AMY
                        Yeah, away. 
                   (sarcastic)
                        Here’s to hoping.

BUS - DAY 

           The boys in the bus are yelling and making noise, throwing 
           food at each other. 

           Amy sits in silent agony. She looks out the window.

           AMY’S POV: Standstill traffic. That bus is moving nowhere. A 
           kid in the parallel car sticks his tongue out at Amy.

           Amy sighs, and looks down - notices some graffiti written 
           beneath the window.

           The graffiti reads “LICK MY BALLS”

           Amy makes a face, then turns her head to face the seat in 
           front of her. Again, she sees more graffiti.

           The new graffiti reads “FUCK MY BALLS”

           Amy makes another face, this time with an audible “ugh”.

           She then turns in the other direction. Fat Jordan is standing 
           on his seat and vigorously dry-humping the seat in front of 
           him, while staring at Amy. He thrusts back and forth against 
           the seat, and waves his hand in the air, like he’s taming a 
           wild stallion. He smiles at Amy, keeps humping.

                                 JORDAN
                        Do I make you horny?? Do I make you 
                        horny?? 

           Amy’s mouth hangs open. Apparently the question was 
           rhetorical, as Jordan keeps humping, now face-forward.

                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Uungh! Uuungh! Yeah! 

           Amy quickly pulls out her cell phone and dials.

           INT. THEATRE - SAME TIME

           Molly stands backstage, peering out from behind a curtain. 

           She’s watching Conor and Rose rehearse a scene together. From 
           the floor, Wesley directs them.

                                 WESLEY
                        All right, Conor, now you lead Rose 
                        stage right.
                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)

           Molly’s CELL PHONE RINGS. 

           Molly, still concerned with watching Conor and Rose, cranes 
           her neck to still see them, but they’re out of view.

                                 MOLLY
                   (under her breath)
                        Shit. 

           She walks further backstage, as she answers her cell phone.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                   (into phone)
                        Hello?

           INTERCUT WITH:

           Amy on the bus. 

                                 AMY
                        We’re in standstill traffic, and 
                        I’m on the bus from Hell. If I 
                        believed in God, I’d think he was 
                        punishing me for my sins.

                                 MOLLY
                        What sins?

                                 AMY
                   (thinks)
                        Failing to save Darfur. 

           Molly continues walking, down a narrow backstage walkway. We 
           hear the rehearsal continuing on stage.

                                 MOLLY
                        Where are you? I can barely hear 
                        you.

                                 AMY
                        Half the people on this bus are 
                        yelling, and the other half are 
                        miming lewd sex acts.

           Molly is still walking with determination, now ascending 
           stairs, not really listening to Amy.

                                 MOLLY
                        Sounds like fun.

                        It’s torture. I have to tell you 
                        what someone wrote on the seat in 
                        front of me. It says:
                   (whispers)
                        Fuck my balls.

           Molly emerges onto the lighting platform. We now see Conor 
           and Rose from Molly’s POV, standing arm-in-arm together on 
           the stage. Conor twirls Rose. Molly frowns.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Isn’t that disgusting? 

           Molly is still focused on the scene below.

                                 MOLLY
                        Isn’t what disgusting?

                                 AMY
                        What it says!

                                 MOLLY
                        What? What did you say?

                                 AMY
                        I said fuck my balls!

                                 MOLLY
                        What’s wrong with you? 

                                 AMY
                        No, that’s what it says on the 
                        seat! Why aren’t you listening?

                                 MOLLY
                        What seat? I can’t talk about this 
                        now. Conor and Rose are making out 
                        on stage. It makes me sick.  

           Amy’s hurt Molly’s not paying attention - but she tries to be 
           there for her friend.

                                 AMY
                        Oh. I’m sorry. But - it’s part of 
                        rehearsal, right? 

                                 MOLLY
                        Exactly! It’s just a rehearsal. 
                        They don’t have to hump each other. 
                        Someone should tell Rose you can’t 
                        win a Tony for Best Slut.

                        (cid:13)                                 AMY
                        Ugh, Molly, now Ryan and his 
                        friends are mushing up balls of 
                        french fries and spitting - 

           As rehearsal progresses, Rose and Conor move towards center 
           stage, very close and flirty with one another. 

                                 MOLLY
                        God they’re not even rehearsing 
                        now! They’re taking a break and 
                        still totally flirting.

           Static is breaking up the phone connection -- 

                                 AMY
                        Are you moving? I can’t hear you 
                        that well. Molly?

                                 MOLLY
                        We’ll talk later, ok? 

           Molly abruptly hangs up and heads back down the stairs.

           INT. BUS - SAME TIME

           Amy sits, her phone in her hand. Feeling dejected. 

           The bus pulls to a stop, and the teams start to pile out. Amy 
           stands up, holding her phone - then stops, drops the phone in 
           her bag, and heads off to the game. 

           INT. THEATRE/BACKSTAGE - DAY 

           Molly is now lurking behind the theatre curtain. She’s 
           talking to a THEATRE TECH, who’s clearly not interested.

                                 MOLLY
                        I mean, don’t you think they’re 
                        going a little overboard? 
                   (pause)
                        I think it’s sad, actually. Rose 
                        must have a self-esteem problem. I 
                        feel bad for her. I feel bad for 
                        her parents. 

           The techie shrugs and walks away, as two CHORUS GIRLS (BETSEY 
           and LINDA) walk in. Molly directs her gossip towards them.

                        You guys enjoying the display 
                        onstage?

                                 BETSEY
                        We just got here. What’s going on?

                                 MOLLY
                        Rose is turning ‘Guys and Dolls’ 
                        into a triple-x rated porn show.

                                 LINDA
                        What?

                                 MOLLY
                        It’s pathetic. She’s all over 
                        Conor. I wonder if she thinks she’s 
                        playing a prostitute.

           The girls laugh.

                                 BETSEY
                        I had no idea. 

                                 LINDA
                        Me neither.

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh, yeah. Rose is a total horndog. 

           Molly nods at Betsey and Linda, who nod to each other.

           INT. THEATRE - DAY 

           The theatre is full for rehearsal. 

           Linda and Betsey walk in and branch off, and each whisper 
           something to two other girls. 

           The first girl looks surprised, and Betsey nods. The girl 
           then passes the secret along to her friend.

           The second girl looks surprised, and Linda nods. The girl 
           then passes the information along. 

           We pull back and watch as the horndog rumor spreads - in what 
           becomes a sea of gossiping students.

SOFTBALL GAME - DAY 

           A burly opposing female team member swings, as the ball is 
           pitched - she hits the ball with a loud CRACK. The pitcher 
           sees the ball is headed straight at Amy.

                                 PITCHER (O.C.)
                        Shit.

           On Amy, seeing that the ball is coming in her direction.

                                 AMY
                        Oh God.

           She runs backward glove extended outward. 

           AMY’S POV: The ball hurdling towards her from above.

           Amy holds out her glove, and closes her eyes tight - we hear 
           a loud THWACK. 

           A pause, and Amy opens her eyes to see the ball inside her 
           glove. Delighted, she holds it up for everyone to see.

           Her teammates cheer. They run for the dugout. Amy smiles and 
           runs with them, holding the ball. They pat her on the back. 
           From the stands, Amy spots a few members of the baseball team 
           - including Ryan - clapping and cheering. 

           Close on Ryan, who seems to be focusing on Amy. Smiling.

           Amy runs to the dugout with her team. She’s actually starting 
           to enjoy herself...

           INT. BUS - NIGHT 

           The bus ride home. The students are much more subdued. Some 
           baseball/softball players chat, and laugh.

           Amy sits in her seat, her uniform dirty, her hair messed up. 
           But she looks happy. And sleepy. Her eyes begin to close as -- 

                                 RYAN (O.C.)
                        Hey.

           Amy looks up.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Can I sit here?

           Amy nods, surprised, and Ryan sits down.

                        You were good in the game today.

                                 AMY
                        I guess. I caught a ball.

                                 RYAN
                        You don’t seem that excited.

                                 AMY
                        No, it was fun. It’s just - I don’t 
                        really think softball’s my thing.

                                 RYAN
                        Why not?

                                 AMY
                        It’s painful. Lots of running. 

                                 RYAN
                        But that’s what’s great about it. 

                                 AMY
                        You really like it.

                                 RYAN
                        It’s fun. I like running, and 
                        getting hurt. And riding on the 
                        bus. So it’s like, baseball’s 
                        perfect for me. Y’know?

           Amy has the feeling Ryan just attempted to deliver a moving 
           speech about his love for baseball. She smiles - it’s sweet. 

                                 AMY 
                        I think so. You love baseball. 

                                 RYAN
                        Yeah.

           They sit, quietly. Amy’s head droops - she’s exhausted.

           Ryan’s trying to psych himself up to say something else...

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re pretty.

           Ryan turns for Amy’s reaction - but she has fallen asleep. 
           Her head is resting on the window. Right next to the graffiti 
           that reads “LICK MY BALLS”.

HALLWAY - DAY 

           Molly walks with Amy. 

                                 AMY
                        Softball’s actually been kind of 
                        fun recently. 

                                 MOLLY
                        That’s good.

                                 AMY
                        I caught a ball yesterday, and --

                                 MOLLY 
                        Oh, god, look, there’s Rose. Let’s 
                        go this way. 

           Amy’s a little annoyed at having been interrupted. Again. 

           From behind them, Christina shouts, pushing her way towards 
           Amy and Molly. 

                                 CHRISTINA (O.C.)
                        Molly! Amy! Wait!

                                 AMY
                        Why does she never give up?

                                 MOLLY
                        She reminds me of birds that fly 
                        into glass windows and then get up 
                        and do it again.

           Christina now catches up to them, out of breath. She’s 
           wearing another brand new Princeton sweatshirt. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Thank God I caught you guys! I have 
                        something to tell you.

                                 AMY
                        Did you hear back from Princeton?

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Yes! I got in!

                                 AMY
                        Congratulations.

           Amy steers Molly in the other direction. Christina follows.

                        But that’s not what I wanted to 
                        tell you!

           Amy and Molly wait, for Christina to finish.

                                 CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
                        I heard that Rose Gower is - 
                   (lowers her voice)
                        A total horndog. 

           At the mention of this word, Amy shoots Molly a look.

                                 CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
                        Apparently she, like, sleeps with 
                        everyone and is a slut and stuff 
                        like that. And I know it for a fact 
                        because Billy told Danny who told 
                        Sasha who told Chris who told me. 

           Beat.

                                 AMY
                        That’s great, Christina. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        I thought you might be interested, 
                        Molly, since you’re in the play 
                        with her. Also since she’s playing 
                        opposite Conor, and you’re in love 
                        with him.

                                 MOLLY
                        I am not!

                                 CHRISTINA
                        You should watch out. She’ll 
                        definitely try and sleep with him. 
                        Like I said, horndog.

           Christina goes off. Molly feels a little self-conscious, 
           starts to leave.

                                 MOLLY
                        We should get to class.

                                 AMY
                        Molly - who started that rumor 
                        about Rose?

                                 MOLLY
                        I have no idea.
                                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 AMY
                        You have no idea? Who might’ve 
                        called her a horndog?

           Molly knows Amy knows it was her. But neither of them is 
           saying anything.

                                 MOLLY
                        I don’t know. 
                   (pause)
                        I’m gonna be late. 

           Molly hurries off. Amy watches her go - and then notices 
           Ryan, standing awkwardly by a locker, staring at her. 

           Ryan looks up at Amy - and he waves. 

           Amy turns behind her, to see if he’s waving at someone else. 
           He’s not. She waves back.

           Ryan then smiles, and winks at her. Amy’s surprised.

           INT. ENGLISH CLASSROOM - DAY

           Mr. Schacter is sitting at the front of the room. The chairs 
           are arranged in a semi-circle. 

                                 MOLLY
                   (reading aloud)
                        “How one man loved the pilgrim soul 
                        in you/and loved the sorrows of 
                        your changing face -- “

           Jonathan keeps casting longing looks at Molly. We see from 
           his POV - to him, it seems like the sunbeam rests just on 
           Molly.

           Julie hits him, snapping us back into reality. 

                                 JONATHAN
                        Ow.

                                 MR. SCHACTER
                        Yes, Jonathan, ow is right. Yeats’ 
                        love was unrequited for much of his 
                        life. His jealously over Maud Gonne 
                        was one reason he initially didn’t 
                        support the Irish insurrectionary 
                        movements.

           Molly nods fiercely at “unrequited” and “jealousy.”

SCHACTER (CONT’D)
                        But he persevered.

           The bell rings.

                                 MR. SCHACTER (CONT’D)
                        Well, class dismissed. 

           The class gets up. Molly and Amy stick their books in their 
           bags and head out. Jonathan jumps up to catch Molly -- 

                                 JONATHAN
                        Molly - wait up -- 

           Julie sticks her foot out and trips Jonathan. He falls over. 
           He gets back up, and looks at Julie. 

                                 JONATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey. What’d you do that for?

                                 JULIE
                        I am not going to let you make a 
                        majestic speech. I won’t let you 
                        embarrass yourself like that. 

                                 JONATHAN
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JULIE
                        I might not be as smart as Molly 
                        Carroll - but I’m not stupid, 
                        either.

                                 JONATHAN
                        Whatever. We should get to science.

           But Julie holds him back -- 

                                 JULIE
                        Jonathan, I am not going to let you 
                        be That Guy.

                                 JONATHAN
                        What guy? You’re being very vague.

                                 JULIE
                        The friend guy. Because you think 
                        at the end of the day, Molly will 
                        realize that she and Conor aren’t 
                        going to live happily ever after 
                        and this whole time she’s really 
                        liked you.

                        And then all your pathetic waiting 
                        will have been worth it. I’m trying 
                        to spare you any further 
                        humiliation. Get this into your 
                        head. It’s not gonna happen.

                        I don’t -- like Molly --

                                 JULIE
                        You’re obsessed with her to the 
                        point that you don’t even notice 
                        when she’s treating you like crap. 
                        Every time she walks by you lap it 
                        up with a spoon. You’re a better 
                        person than that. And you and Molly 
                        Carroll? Never in a million, 
                        billion years.  So just be a man 
                        and move on. 

           Jonathan gets a little teary and tries to hide it.

                   (a little softer)
                        It’s not your fault. She’s just, 
                        uh, very goal oriented. You deserve 
                        better. You deserve someone who 
                        will pay attention to you. Molly’s 
                        got other things on her mind. 

                                 JONATHAN
                        You’re helping her.

                                 JULIE
                        I think Molly’s gone above and 
                        beyond my help.

           INT. HALLWAY, LEAVING CAFETERIA - DAY

           Molly is talking with some popular girls from the play. Conor 
           walks by, they wave. Rose walks by, they laugh. 

           Amy walks up and stands near Molly and the other girls. It’s 
           awkward for a beat, Molly doesn’t say anything. She seems 
           slightly annoyed. She excuses herself from the other girls.

                                 MOLLY
                        See you guys later! 

           Molly turns to Amy.

                        What do you mean ‘yeah’?

                                 MOLLY
                        I just meant, did you want 
                        something?

                                 AMY
                        Why didn’t you wait for me after 
                        class?

                                 MOLLY
                        I didn’t know I was supposed to. 

                                 AMY
                        It’s not, like, an obligation or 
                        anything. But since we walk 
                        together every single day...

                                 MOLLY
                        Sorry. I guess I forgot.

                                 AMY
                        Whatever. Look, I wanted to talk to 
                        you about Ryan. I texted you a 
                        bunch last night but you never -

                                 MOLLY
                        I was at rehearsal.

                                 AMY
                        Right. Ok, but could we - 

                                 MOLLY
                        Look, I want to talk to you about 
                        this, but I have to talk to Conor 
                        right now, ok? We’ll talk later.

                                 AMY
                        When?

                                 MOLLY
                        Later...

                                 AMY
                        At the cast party?

                                 MOLLY
                        You’re going to the cast party?

                                 AMY
                        Everyone goes. Is that a problem?

                        No, I just didn’t know you’d be 
                        there. But that’s great. Yeah, 
                        we’ll talk then. 

           Molly walks off. Amy stands for a beat, annoyed at getting 
           brushed off again. She then walks in the other direction. 

           INT. HALLWAY, OUTSIDE AMY’S LOCKER - DAY

           Amy is opening her locker when her sister Karen comes 
           careening around the corner.

                                 KAREN
                        Amy! Amy!

                                 AMY
                        Oh my god. Are you okay? Is Mom 
                        okay? Is Dad okay? Is someone at 
                        the hospital?

                                 KAREN
                        Could you please stop spazzing.

                                 AMY
                        Why are you talking to me at 
                        school?

                                 KAREN
                   (she gets awkwardly close 
                    and whispers)
                        Because of the biggest rumor of all 
                        time. Ryan Dexter wants to hook up 
                        with you at the cast party on 
                        Saturday.

                                 AMY
                        Oh my God.

                                 KAREN
                        This is huge. Like, super huge. I 
                        do not know how you did it. But 
                        it’s huge. So, do not embarrass me. 
                        Please. I would die. Do you know 
                        how to kiss? 

                                 AMY
                        Fuck off.

                        Do you need a condom?

                        No!

                                 KAREN
                        Just kidding. You’re a retard.
                   (beat)
                        If you do need a condom there are 
                        some in the closet by the Health 
                        Sciences room. Next to the 
                        cucumbers. Have fun! 

           Karen leaves, Amy turns back to her locker, clearly nervous.

           INT. ENGLISH CLASSROOM - DAY

           Mr. Schacter is writing on the board. 

           Amy is staring out the window, unfocused and nervous. Molly 
           is doodling. Julie is playing cat’s cradle with Jonathan. 
           Conor is reviewing his lines. Ryan is playing paper football.

                                 MR. SCHACTER
                        “And what rough beast/its hour come 
                        round at last/Slouches towards 
                        Bethlehem to be born.”
                   (beat)
                        In this poem, Yeats was talking 
                        about apathy. Indifference. People 
                        ignoring the reality of a 
                        situation. 

           No one is paying any attention.

                                 MR. SCHACTER (CONT’D)
                        That’s all for today. There will be 
                        no class next Monday, I’m getting 
                        sick of teaching.

           EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT - HIGH SCHOOL

           The sun sets over Kellogg High School. A quiet night. 27 DAYS 
           BEFORE PROM.  

           INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           The cast is assembled in various states of costume and 
           readiness. Wesley prepares them for opening night. 
                                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                 WESLEY
                        Everyone - I need quiet for a 
                        moment. Quiet, gather around now.

           Molly is getting her hair pinned up. Rose is standing alone 
           near the edge of the crowd. Molly sees this and is gleeful 
           until Conor approaches and gives Rose a hug. 

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        There are a lot of directors, who, 
                        on a night like tonight, might look 
                        out on this sea of young faces and 
                        say: “look how hard you’ve worked, 
                        go have fun.”  
                   (beat)
                        Guess what? LIFE ISN’T FUN. If this 
                        musical does not POP -- 

           He yells. Everyone bolts to attention.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        -- then you FAILED. Get it? That’s 
                        failure. You people are here to 
                        give them an experience. So give it 
                        to them. Every last ONE of you. 
                        Because if this play sucks, I will 
                        never forgive you. 

           A beat. Not exactly inspiring. They think Wesley is strange. 

                                 CONOR 
                        Let’s go get ‘em!

           The cast cheers, excited.

           INT. AUDITORIUM

           On stage, we see the first scene of Guys and Dolls. 

           Amy and Jonathan and Julie sit with Molly’s parents and Sugi. 
           Mr. Carroll looks bored, Mrs. Carroll, critical. She mouths 
           along to some of the words. 

           Amy looks to her left and sees Ryan. He makes a nonsensical 
           hand gesture that seems lewd. Amy slinks down in her seat.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - STAGE

           The song with all the gangsters, “Luck Be A Lady” is coming 
           to an end. Molly is dancing her heart out as gangster number 
           four. Conor, as Sky, is singing away. Song ends. They freeze.

           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)           The audience applauds wildly. 

           Molly is sweaty, breathless. She looks to Conor. Conor looks 
           back at her, and winks. Molly smiles. 

           INT. AUDITORIUM - AUDIENCE

                                 JULIE
                        Wow, I can’t believe we made Molly 
                        do this.

                                 AMY
                        You made her do it.

                                 JULIE
                        Whatever.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE

           Molly is peering from the wings, as Conor and Rose dance to 
           the strains of “If I Had a Bell.” Rose is obviously 
           incredible. The song ends in a kiss. The lights come down to 
           thunderous applause. Molly sends a text.

           INT. AUDITORIUM -AUDIENCE

           The audience is applauding wildly.

                                 AMY
                        Wow, that looked really good. They 
                        have great chemistry. 

                                 JULIE
                        Yeah. I’m a little bit turned on 
                        right now. 

           Amy gets Molly’s text: “DISGUSTING, RIGHT?”

           Julie reads the text over Amy’s shoulder, then looks at Amy.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh boy. It’s gonna be a long night.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

           The chorus takes their bow. They part in the center and Conor 
           and Rose come through and bow together. The screams get 
           louder. Molly, on the end, smiles weakly at her friends.
                                                 (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)           EXT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

           There’s a reception outside the auditorium, with punch and 
           some cookies Jonathan is scarfing. Amy is trying to avoid eye 
           contact with Ryan. Molly emerges from the dressing room.

                                 MR. CARROLL 
                        Congratulations!

           He hugs Molly.

                                 SUGI
                        Wonderful performance. I applaud 
                        your vivacity.

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        Do you want to be an actress now?

                                 MOLLY
                        No way.

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        Then I had a lovely time. 

           Conor appears holding a single rose. He punches Molly on the 
           shoulder and hands her the rose.

                                 CONOR
                        Hey, Moll, great job. Are these 
                        your parents? Hi, I’m Conor.

           The Carroll’s shake his hand.

                                 CONOR (CONT’D)
                        Cool, well, see you later? It was 
                        really fun being in this play with 
                        your daughter. She makes a great 
                        gangster.

           He disappears back into the crowd. Molly looks as if she 
           might die of happiness.

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        I’ll take the rose home so it 
                        doesn’t get ruined.

                                 MR. CARROLL
                        We’ll put it someplace suitably 
                        swoonable.

As she waves goodbye to her 
           parents, she sees Conor talking to a couple that are 
           obviously Rose’s parents. Rose holds a large bouquet. 

           Molly’s eyes narrow in anger. Amy, Julie and Jonathan look 
           worried.

           INT. MOLLY’S CAR - NIGHT

           Molly, Amy, Jonathan, and Julie are loaded into Molly’s car.

                                 JULIE
                        Good job Gangster number four.

           They all clap. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Thanks for coming.

                                 AMY
                        Conor gave you a rose. That’s cool.

                                 MOLLY
                        It is. I think it’s a big step.

                                 JONATHAN
                        Not like a bouquet or anything.

           The girls try to shush him.

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh, I know. I saw that. And it’s 
                        just made me more determined. They 
                        obviously share a working bond, but 
                        now that the play is done -- 

           Molly hits reverse - way too hard. The car skids out of the 
           parking space. She’s driving like she’s in Dukes of Hazzard.

                                 JONATHAN

                                 MOLLY
                        They will fall. 

                                 JULIE
                        Fall?

                                 AMY
                        That’s a weird verb choice.

                        are you, a serial killer? 

           She accelerates. The passengers hold on for dear life.

           In the backseat, Jonathan whispers to Julie.

                                 JONATHAN (CONT’D)
                        And I’m THAT guy? Molly is THAT 
                        guy!

                                 MOLLY
                        What are you saying?

                                 JULIE
                   (scared)
                        Nothing! You’re driving really 
                        well. 

           Off the backseat passengers, alarmed -- 

           EXT. DANA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The cast party is at the same house as before. Molly’s car 
           pulls up with a wild screech. They all get out. Julie and 
           Jonathan are pale, shaken - they make a dash for the house. 

                                 AMY
                        Hey, Moll, before we go inside, can 
                        we talk for a second?

                                 MOLLY
                   (obviously uninterested)
                        Sure.

                                 AMY
                        Um, I guess that Ryan wants to hook 
                        up with me tonight.

                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)           Molly pauses, clearly bothered - takes this in. 

                                 MOLLY
                        That’s great. 

                                 AMY
                        Well, not really. I mean, I like 
                        him. But I’m not sure I want to -- 

                                 MOLLY
                        If you hook up tonight, he’ll 
                        probably ask you to prom. Just 
                        don’t sleep with him yet - cause 
                        then, he’ll probably ask someone 
                        else.

                                 AMY
                        Wow, that was obnoxious. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m just saying, it’s in the bag. 
                        So I guess you win. 

           Molly’s being dismissive, and Amy’s clearly hurt by it. 

                                 AMY 
                        This isn’t about winning. It was 
                        never about winning. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Of course not. You fulfilled your 
                        goal. Thanks for sharing. Now I’m 
                        going to fulfill mine. Do me a 
                        favor and keep an eye out for 
                        Conor?

           Molly heads into the party. 

                                 AMY
                        You didn’t lock your car!

           Molly doesn’t acknowledge her. Off Amy -- 

           INT. DANA’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The party is bumpin. Molly enters, looks around. Dana spots 
           Molly and drags her along.

DANA’S HOUSE/FOYER - SAME TIME

           Amy cautiously enters the party. She sees people and nods, 
           but is still sort of overwhelmed by the madness. She starts 
           skooting towards the general direction of the kitchen. 

           EXT. DANA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAME TIME

           Dana hands Molly a shot glass. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Ok, but just one...

           She does a shot. Dana grabs her, and they stumble out a 
           backdoor, heading for the keg. Conor is there with a bunch of 
           dudes. Just as Molly disappears from the kitchen -- 

           INT. DANA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Amy arrives in the kitchen. The softball and the baseball 
           teams are playing flip cup against each other. 

           Ryan is at one end of the table. When he sees Amy he smiles - 
           an actual human charming smile.

                                 RYAN
                        Be on my flip cup team.

                                 BUTCH CATCHER
                        No way, she’s on our team.

                                 RYAN
                        Not tonight.

                                 AMY
                        How do I play?

           INT. DANA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Julie and Jonathan are sitting on the couch. From their 
           seats, they can see Amy play flip-cup with Ryan, and Molly 
           outside talking to Conor. 

                                 JULIE
                        Our ladies are very busy.

           Jonathan watches Amy try to flip a cup. The cup falls. Ryan 
           picks it up and puts it on her head.

           friends. Everyone laughs - but Molly laughs twice as hard and 
           twice as long. 

                                 JONATHAN
                        They’re busy. Good for them. 

                                 JULIE
                        I know you’re not a big fan of this 
                        project -

           Jonathan nods “you think?”

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        But there’s one part of it I really 
                        like. 

                                 JONATHAN
                   (uninterested)
                        Yeah, what’s that?

                                 JULIE
                        Hanging out with you.

           Jonathan looks at her.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Want to go to prom with me?

           Jonathan looks shocked.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know if you like girls who 
                        only have a 3.6 - 

                                 JONATHAN
                        I thought you had a boyfriend. That 
                        guy Rick. 

                                 JULIE
                        We broke up this winter. 

                                 JONATHAN
                        Why didn’t you tell Molly and Amy?

                                 JULIE
                   (shrugs)
                        They never asked. 

                                 JONATHAN
                        Oh.

Then Jonathan turns to her. 

                                 JONATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Want to go to prom with me?

                                 JULIE
                        I just asked you that.

                                 JONATHAN
                        Yeah, but I want to be the one who 
                        asks. You girls are always taking 
                        charge of me. I don’t want to be 
                        that guy anymore. 

           Off Julie, smiling -- 

           INT. DANA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Amy is plastered. Julie and Jonathan enter the kitchen as she 
           finishes gulping down a beer, flipping the cup and then 
           putting it on her head.

                                 AMY
                        I am good at finishing the cup then 
                        flipping the cup then I put the cup 
                        on my head.

                                 JULIE
                        Yeah...you ok?

                                 AMY
                        Yes. I am the best. Because of 
                        flipping.

                                 RYAN
                        We didn’t lose once! She’s a 
                        natural.

           Ryan starts a chant in the kitchen. “Amy! Amy!”

                                 JONATHAN
                        It’s like Lord of the Flies.

           Ryan takes Amy’s hand. She looks down, at her hand in his. He 
           smiles. She drunkenly smiles back. He leads her out.

           INT. DANA’S HOUSE/FOYER - SAME TIME

           Rose enters. She looks around, trying to find Conor.

Ryan leads Amy by the hand up 
           the stairs.

           EXT. DANA’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Molly and Conor are kicking a soccer ball back and forth, 
           laughing. Rose enters the yard.

                                 ROSE
                        Hey cats n’ kittens.

                                 CONOR
                        Rose! Where’ve you been?

                                 ROSE
                        Had to ditch my Moms. She’s big on 
                        chit-chat. 
                   (of the game)
                        European football, I see. Not my 
                        forte, but fun.

                                 MOLLY
                   (under her breath)
                        Fuck your forte.

                                 CONOR
                        Play with us.

           He gently kicks it to Rose. She’s obviously something of a 
           novice so she kicks it back. It rolls away. Rose giggles. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I’ll get it!

                                 ROSE
                        Molly, I didn’t know you counted 
                        athletic feats among your storied 
                        accomplishments. Your success is so 
                        incredibly mainstream.

           Molly angrily kicks the ball over to Rose - a little too 
           hard. She runs after it. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Ooh, an athletic champion! 

           Rose awkwardly kicks the ball to Conor. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        I’m so bad! 

           Conor passes the ball to Molly, barely looking at her.

                        I can give you a few pointers.

                                 ROSE
                        Would you? That would be fabs. Let 
                        me just take my shirt off.

           Conor smiles, as Rose moves aside to take off her overshirt.  
           Molly frowns. She then steps back from the ball, eyeing Rose. 
           A hunter spotting its prey. 

                                 CONOR
                        Not too hard, there, Molly. Now 
                        Rose, when the ball comes, extend 
                        your foot out to stop it.

           Molly races towards the ball, and kicks it towards Rose as 
           hard as she can.

           The ball hurdles towards Rose’s back - just as Rose bends 
           over to put her shirt down. 

           The ball flies past Rose, hits a tree, and ricochets back 
           towards Molly. The ball SLAMS into Molly’s face. She goes 
           down.

           Rose looks up, oblivious. Sees Molly moaning on the ground. 

                                 ROSE
                        Oh gosh! What happened?

                                 CONOR
                        Molly are you ok? 

           INT. DANA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Amy and Ryan are making out. He’s on top of her. He starts to 
           unbutton her shirt. She pauses, tries to talk to Ryan -- 

                                 AMY
                        So, like, where do you live? What 
                        do you like?

                                 RYAN
                        Boobs.

           Amy takes a beat - oh well. She grabs him, they go back to 
           making out.

DANA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Conor tends to Molly, applying an ice pack to her face. She 
           leans against the counter. It would be sexy, if her face 
           weren’t all bruised and dirty. 

                                 CONOR
                        Any better?

           Molly’s speech is slurred, like someone who just got 
           novocaine at the dentist’s office. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I thith so. Ith stopped stinging. 
                        Ith justh numb now. 

                                 CONOR
                        The swelling’s mostly gone down. 
                        You should be ok.

                                 MOLLY
                        Thath good.

           Conor reaches his hand out, strokes Molly’s hair.

                                 CONOR
                        Your hair’s messed up. I’ll fix it.

                                 MOLLY
                        Thankth. 

           Molly gazes deep into Conor’s eyes, as he tucks her hair 
           behind her ears. 

                                 CONOR
                        There you go.
                   (smiles)
                        Molly, what are we going to do with 
                        you? 

           Molly smiles up at him, her heart pounding. She’s still 
           drunk, caught up in the moment, Conor standing close to her. 
           She thinks he’s being totally romantic. (He’s not.)

           Conor reaches for the icepack, to reapply to Molly’s face. He 
           leans in towards her. Molly, caught up in a sweet moment with 
           Conor, leans in for the kiss - 

           It’s awkward, as she kisses half of his mouth. He’s 
           surprised. He pulls back slightly. Molly keeps her eyes

           (cid:13)                                 CONOR (CONT’D)
                        Are you ok?

                                 MOLLY
                   (nods)
                        Woulth you go to the pwom with me?

           Conor stares at Molly, surprised. Then, through the window, 
           he stares at Rose, outside talking to some people. 

                                 CONOR
                        Um...

           He looks again at Molly - at her bruised, swollen face. He’s 
           a good guy. And he can’t say no. 

                                 CONOR (CONT’D)
                        Sure. That’d be great. 

           Molly smiles wide. Some drool escapes from her cheek. 

           EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT - HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 

           Sun rises over the high school. CHYRON: 10 DAYS UNTIL PROM.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 

           Molly pulls her car into the parking lot. As she drives in, 
           she spots Amy. Molly calls after her. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Amy! Hey, Amy!

           But Amy’s a ways ahead, not turning around. Molly starts 
           jogging, catches up to her. 

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Amy!
                   (beat)
                        I came by your house this morning. 

                                 AMY
                        I walked. I felt like walking.

                                 MOLLY
                        You could’ve told me. 

                                 AMY
                        Sorry.

                        Sorry? 

                                 AMY
                        You’ve been so focused on Conor and 
                        Rose recently, I’m surprised you 
                        even noticed. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Look, I’m sorry. I - I wanted to 
                        tell you something.

           Amy stops, turns around.

                                 AMY
                        What? 

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m going to prom with Conor.

                                 AMY
                   (beat)
                        Did you kill Rose? 

                                 MOLLY
                        No. I asked him. And he said yes. 
                        Conor wants to go with me.

                                 AMY
                        No, Molly. He doesn’t.

                                 MOLLY
                        What’s wrong with you?

                                 AMY
                        What’s wrong with you? Look at you! 
                        You’ve turned in to this psychotic 
                        Conor-crazed monster. He’s no good 
                        for you.

                                 MOLLY
                        He is, he’s - 

                                 AMY
                        He is a mindless politician who’s 
                        running for office every second of 
                        the day. He has no moral compass. 
                        It’s all about power, and none 
                        about policy. 

                                 MOLLY

                        Think about it. You do all the 
                        work. You always have. Including 
                        having to ask him to prom.

                                 MOLLY
                        Well, I’m sorry I made the mistake 
                        of thinking you’d be happy for me. 

                                 AMY
                        Y’know, I had something to tell you 
                        too. But you’ve been so self-
                        absorbed, you never even bothered 
                        to listen. 

                                 MOLLY
                        What is it?

                                 AMY
                        I hooked up with Ryan.

           Molly pauses. Then, very sarcastically, begins to slow-clap.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        That’s obnoxious.

           They start raising their voices, and attracting the attention 
           of students and teachers walking into school.

                                 MOLLY
                        Bravo. How proud you must feel, 
                        having hooked up with a boy who, 
                        just yesterday, got detention for 
                        urinating on the bushes in the 
                        school courtyard. 

                                 AMY
                        At least Ryan actually likes me. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Yeah, he’s a great prospect. Real 
                        thinking man.

                                 AMY
                        You’re just jealous. 

           They’re now full-on yelling at each other. Mr. Schacter 
           approaches, and watches the fight with the other onlookers.

                        No, I think it’s great! I look 
                        forward to prom, when Ryan date-
                        rapes you and steals your 
                        virginity!

                                 AMY
                        Well, I look forward to the day you 
                        and Conor are married and you find 
                        out he’s having an affair and then 
                        you get depressed and drown your 
                        own kids!

                                 MOLLY
                        Take that back!

                                 AMY
                        No!

           Amy walks off in a huff. Molly yells after her.

                                 MOLLY
                        I am not going to drown my own 
                        kids!!

           Several students stop and stare at her.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Well I’m not. 

           INT. LAURA ASHLEY - DAY 

           Molly and her mom shop for prom dresses. Mrs. Carroll keeps 
           picking out dresses that look like couches.

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        How about this one?

                                 MOLLY
                        Ugh. No, mom. We shouldn’t even BE 
                        in this store. All these dresses 
                        are wrong.

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        Well, I’m sorry. But it’s been a 
                        while since I went to a prom.

                                 MOLLY
                        200 years, apparently. 

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        Didn’t Amy want to come?

                        Amy and I don’t have to do 
                        everything together. 

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        It’s just that you usually -

                                 MOLLY 
                        Things change, mom. People change. 
                        I can’t spend my whole life hanging 
                        out with the same person, can I?

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        I only thought you might prefer 
                        shopping for dresses with a 
                        contemporary. Someone with a better 
                        sense of what’s “cool”. 

                                 MOLLY
                        You’re cool, mom. Really. 

           Mrs. Carroll brightens. Picks up a hideous floral-patterned 
           dress with a butterfly collar.

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        In that case. I think I’ve found 
                        the winner.

           Molly fakes a smile. 

           INT. WHOREY STORE - DAY

           Amy and Karen are shopping for prom dresses, in a store that 
           sells skimpy, slutty-looking clothes.

           Karen sits in a chair, waiting for Amy to emerge from behind 
           the dressing-room curtain.

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        I’m not coming out.

                                 KAREN
                        Come on, I’m sure you look great.

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        I look like a prostitute. I’m not 
                        wearing this to prom.

                                 KAREN
                        If things go well with Ryan, you 
                        won’t have to wear it for long.

                                 AMY
                        Very funny.

                                 KAREN
                        You look hot! Ryan will love it. 

                                 AMY
                        But I don’t love it.

                                 KAREN
                        But who cares about you? This is 
                        your one chance to actually become 
                        a normal person at our high school, 
                        and not some crazy spazz trying to 
                        save the whales.

                                 KAREN
                        Whatever! You need to be a bigger 
                        slut, and prom is the perfect time.

           Off Amy, not super happy --

           INT. STUDENT NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY 

           Jonathan is laying out the paper by himself in the office. 
           Molly walks in. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I didn’t think anyone would be in 
                        here.

                                 JONATHAN
                        We’re pretty far behind on next 
                        week’s issue. I thought I could 
                        start laying out the features page.

                                 MOLLY
                        You mean I put us behind, right? 

                                 JONATHAN
                        No, I didn’t say that. 

           Awkward pause. Jonathan takes a beat, and turns to Molly. 

                                 JONATHAN (CONT’D)
                        There’s something I wanted to ask 
                        you -- it’s important. 
                                                                     (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)

She sits down, next to 
           Jonathan, and gives him her most condescending I’m-trying-to-
           be-nice-to-you face. 

                                 JONATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Molly -- 

                                 MOLLY
                        Jonathan...look, I - I can’t go to 
                        the prom with you. I’m sorry, but 
                        I’m going with Conor. 

           A beat. Jonathan stares at her. Stunned. 

                                 JONATHAN
                        I was going to ask if I could 
                        finally run that op-ed piece I’ve 
                        been pitching since the fall. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh. Really?

                                 JONATHAN
                        I’m going to prom with Julie.

                                 MOLLY
                        But Julie’s going out with Rick.

                                 JONATHAN
                        They broke up months ago. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Since when? 

                                 JONATHAN
                        Since...months ago. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh. I - um - I didn’t know that. 

           Jonathan heads back to work. Molly stands there awkwardly. A 
           little hurt, a little ashamed.

           INT. LUNCHROOM - DAY

           Molly carries her tray out of the food-line into the crowded 
           cafeteria. She scans the room and sees:

           Julie and Jonathan, sitting at a table, eating together.

           Amy and Ryan, near the other jocks - eating together.
                                           (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)

           (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)           Conor, eating alone. Molly smiles, starts to head over. 

           Conor smiles, and waves in a different direction, motioning 
           for someone to come join him. It’s Rose - she sits down with 
           Conor at his table. They’re now eating together.

           Molly stops short, standing alone with her tray. She pauses, 
           then heads out of the cafeteria. Alone. 

           EXT. HOTEL - AFTERNOON

           Ice sculptures and streamers are being brought in to the 
           hotel. A sign is being hung that reads “WELCOME KELLOGG 
           SENIORS: - ”, but the rest of the sign is obscured.

           CHYRON READS: 0 DAYS UNTIL PROM

           EXT. CONOR’S HOUSE - YARD - AFTERNOON

           MR. PIERSON and MRS. PIERSON cheerfully mill around their 
           yard offering refreshments to Mr. and Mrs. Carroll while 
           Molly and Conor pose for their pre-prom pictures. Molly opted 
           for a different dress from the one her mom chose. Conor puts 
           a corsage on Molly’s wrist. They both look nervous.

                                 MR. PIERSON
                        I’d like to propose a toast. To two 
                        talented young people with bright 
                        futures. I married my prom date.

           Mrs. Pierson blushes. Conor looks at his Dad, angry.

                                 MR. PIERSON (CONT’D)
                        But not everyone has to do that. 
                        Cheers!

           They all drink awkwardly. 

           EXT. MCMANSION - AFTERNOON

           In a neighborhood of large identical homes, Amy and Ryan get 
           their pictures taken with Ryan’s jock friends and their 
           dates.

           Everyone’s dresses look like they came from a sexed up 
           version of David’s Bridal. Amy’s dress is more low-key. She 
           didn’t go with the skank dress Karen picked out.

           Ryan quietly passes Amy a flask and winks. Amy takes it.
                                                                 (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                 AMY
                        What the hell.

           She takes a shot.

           INT. VOLVO - NIGHT

           The Carroll’s are driving to prom. Conor and Molly sit in the 
           backseat.

                                 MR. CARROLL
                        You kids want some tunes?

           Molly and Conor nod “sure”

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        Don’t be silly, Jim. Prairie Home 
                        Companion is on.

           The smooth voice of Garrison Keillor fills the car.

           INT. LIMO - NIGHT

           Amy and Ryan’s gang are packed in a limo. The limo is much 
           less comfortable than limos should be, especially with 
           sixteen teenagers in there. 

           The girls are drinking wine coolers. Jordan farts. Everyone 
           laughs, but then the smell hits. Ryan passes Amy the flask 
           again. She belts it. 

           EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

           The prom is totally at the second nicest hotel in town. 

           The party limo pulls up and Amy, Ryan and their crew stumble 
           out and lumber into the building.

           Jonathan and Julie exit a station wagon and follow. We now 
           see the full sign hung up over the Hotel entrance. It reads: 

           “WELCOME KELLOGG SENIORS: LITTLE MERMAID NOWHERE-TO-SWIM 
           GLOBAL WARMING PROM”

           A Volkswagon Beetle deposits Rose and her date - Norman. Just 
           as they are about to enter, the Carrolls pull up. 
                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)           INT. CARROLL CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Molly and Conor are getting ready to get out. 

                                 MRS. CARROLL
                        Now, be careful. And have fun. But 
                        not too much. Medium fun.

                                 MOLLY
                        Okay, Mom. Thanks for the ride.

                                 MR. CARROLL
                        You both look great.

                                 CONOR
                        Hey, there’s Rose and Norman!

           Molly frowns.

           Prom is in a basic hotel ballroom, ably dressed by loads of 
           volunteering mothers and daughters. The colors of the prom 
           are light blue and green. The centerpieces of the tables are 
           Disney themed. We see a menu for hors d’oeurves and desserts 
           filled with punny variations on the night’s theme: (Melted 
           Iceberg Salad, Kiss The Girl Frog Legs, etc.) 

           Amy sits at a table with the jocks. 

           Julie and Jonathan veer to avoid Christina and Harold - the 
           only couple on the dance floor.

           Molly and Conor walk in with Rose and Norman.

                                 CONOR
                        Let’s all sit together!

           Molly looks annoyed, but smiles. Norman gives a lame thumbs 
           up. 

           They walk by Amy’s table. Molly looks at Amy. Ryan has one 
           arm around her and with the other arm is shoving bread sticks 
           in his nose to the amusement of the table.

           They pass Julie and Jonathan. When Julie sees the awkwardly 
           assembled Molly/Conor Rose/Norman her eyes go wide.

PROM - BUFFET - LATER

           Molly loads a plate with chicken fingers. In the background, 
           prom continues apace. Kids are eating and being jerky and no 
           one is dancing except for Christina and Harold. 

                                 MR. SCHACTER
                        Hungry?

                                 MOLLY
                        My table asked me to get them some 
                        more chicken fingers.

                                 MR. SCHACTER
                        Ah. Having fun?

                                 MOLLY 
                        Sure. Of course. I should get these 
                        back to the table.

           Mr. Schacter watches her go, unconvinced.

           INT. PROM DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

                                 DJ
                        C’mon party people! It’s time to 
                        get down. G-g-g-g-et down. Spin it. 
                        Kellogg HIIIIIIGH. Dance!

           No one moves.

                                 DJ (CONT’D)
                        Fifty dollar iTunes gift card to 
                        the couple who dances on the secret 
                        spot!

           Kids jump up and head to dance.

           INT. PROM - AWKWARD TABLE - MOMENTS LATER

           Molly hears the DJ’s prompt and looks at Conor. He’s munching 
           on a chicken finger.

                                 MOLLY
                        Want to dance?

                                 CONOR
                        Sure.

           They get up.

                        You guys coming?

           Rose and Norman get up too.

           INT. HOTEL - LATER

           Molly, Conor, Rose and Norman dance in an awkward square.

           Nearby Amy and Ryan are getting pretty comfortable. Molly 
           sees them and looks concerned. The song winds down.

                                 NORMAN
                        I need a break. 

           He shuffles off. A new song starts...a slow song.

                                 ROSE
                        My favorite song!

                                 CONOR
                        Mine too!

           Conor and Rose stand, gazing at each other. Conor looks 
           awkwardly at Molly. Molly can’t deny it any longer.

                                 MOLLY
                        I need some more chicken fingers. 
                        So, um, catch you later.

           Conor makes a half-hearted attempt to stop her. Molly walks 
           off the dance floor, progressively moving at a faster pace. 
           She’s starting to cry. She blows by Julie and Jonathan.

                                 JULIE
                        Hey - hold on one sec.

           Julie darts after Molly. They head for the bathroom.

           INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Molly bursts in the door. The bathroom is full of weeping 
           clusters of girls. Literally, everyone in there is crying. 

           Molly grabs some paper towels and tries to stop her makeup 
           from running. Julie enters.

                                 JULIE
                        Hey. Are you okay?

                        No. He doesn’t like me. 

           She is crying a little harder.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        I’m such an idiot. All I did was 
                        chase him around - 

                                 JULIE
                        You’re not an idiot. It takes two -

                                 MOLLY
                        Or just one of me. I failed. F for 
                        Molly Carroll! 

                                 JULIE
                        This is the one department where, 
                        you know, effort doesn’t always 
                        equal success.

                                 MOLLY
                        But what did I do wrong?

                                 JULIE
                        Nothing. It’s my fault -

                                 MOLLY
                        No. I wanted to do it. It’s made me 
                        crazy. I didn’t even know you and 
                        Rick broke up.

           The bathroom door opens. It’s Principal Ganeshtha.

                                 PRINCIPAL GANESHTHA
                        Molly Carroll! There you are. 
                        Hurry. We need to do prom King and 
                        Queen announcements. C’mon.

           She exits. Molly looks in the mirror. Her makeup is streaked, 
           her eyes red. She looks like a particularly fancy raccoon.

                                 JULIE
                        Go do this. Meet me after and we’ll 
                        check on Amy.

                                 MOLLY
                        Why?

                                 JULIE
                        Have you not noticed? She and Ryan 
                        are dancing like some kind of gross

HOTEL - STAGE - MOMENTS LATER 

           Conor and Mr. Schacter are on stage.

                                 MR. SCHACTER
                        And now, to announce the prom king 
                        and queen, our co-class presidents. 
                        Conor Pierson and....

           He looks around.

                                 MR. SCHACTER (CONT’D)
                        Molly Carroll?

           Molly suddenly appears on the stage. She looks insane. The 
           crowd gasps. She smiles, and walks over to Conor, who is 
           holding the envelope. She opens it.

                                 CONOR
                        What’s up Little Mermaid Nowhere to 
                        Swim Global Warming Prom!

           People cheer. Molly opens the envelope.

                                 MOLLY 
                        Now for some awards that we give 
                        out based on nothing. The Prom King 
                        is Neil Brown.

           Cheering. Conor tries to take the card.

                                 CONOR
                        And the prom queen -

           Molly rips it back.

                                 MOLLY
                         is Emily Gann. Hooray. You did it.

           Everyone starts cheering. NEIL BROWN and EMILY GANN, two 
           people we have never seen before, approach the stage and take 
           their crowns.

                        In the movie we’d go to have sex 
                        and I’d prematurely ejaculate 
                        because it’s my first time. 

                                 JULIE
                        I think I’m in love with you.

           Amy and Ryan are hugging. He gives her a peck on the lips. 
           Then she gives HIM a much more intense kiss.

                                 RYAN
                        I think you should be prom queen.

           The DJ strikes up a song. We can hear people dancing. Molly 
           is walking off stage and Conor catches up to her.

                                 CONOR
                        What was that? You stole my line.

                        It was unprofessional.

                                 MOLLY
                        Unprofessional! What about just 
                        being a total shithead? If you 
                        wanted to go with Rose, why didn’t 
                        you just go with her?

                        Everyone else in the school does. I 
                        was such an ass. And all I wanted 
                        was a boyfriend.

                        Oh - so you were using me.

                                 MOLLY
                        No. Because the only boyfriend I 
                        wanted was you. I would have done 
                        anything for you. I DID everything 
                        for you. All semester all I’ve been 
                        trying to do is get you to somehow 
                        see, that I’m not just normal old 
                        Molly. That I’m pretty. Or just 
                        special. But I guess that’s not 
                        true.

                                 CONOR
                        You’re...really nice. I respect you 
                        very much. You have amazing 
                        qualities. 

           Molly looks at Conor, suddenly disgusted at his political 
           nonsense jargon. She brushes past him. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I’ve gotta find Amy. 

           INT. HOTEL DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

           Molly goes from person to person asking if they’ve seen Amy. 
           Finally someone gestures at the elevators. Molly heads over.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Molly exits an elevator and walks along the hallway trying to 
           listen for the party. She gets near the end of the hall and 
           hears a ruckus. She runs to the door and opens it. 

           Inside, the room is a mess. Kids are drinking. A couple guys 
           are pulling a gravity bong in the sink. Girls are passed out 
           on couches. Molly scans the room. Amy is nowhere to be found. 
           Her panic rising, Molly spies the door to the bedroom and 
           starts running at it.

                                 DANNY
                        You can’t go in there!

           Molly hits the door hard - it swings open revealing -

HOTEL BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ryan and Jordan standing on the bed, wearing only boxers, 
           with their ties fashioned in karate headbands, kicking each 
           other and hitting each other with pillows. Amy is lying on 
           the floor, reading a Gideon Bible.

                                 DANNY (O.S.)
                        ...that’s the dojo.

                                 MOLLY
                        Amy! 

                                 AMY
                        Molly. What are you doing here?

                                 MOLLY
                        I wanted to make sure you were 
                        okay.

                                 AMY
                        Oh yeah. I’m a little bored. This 
                        is the only book here!
                   (to Ryan)
                        Is this the championship?

                                 RYAN
                        Best of seven.

                                 AMY
                        Okay. Let’s go.

                                 RYAN
                        What?

                                 AMY
                        You fight. I’ll see you tomorrow.
                   (she gives him a kiss)
                        Okay?

           Ryan nods and smiles.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Sweep the leg. 
                   (to Molly)
                        C’mon, let’s go.

           The boys resume fighting.

HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Molly and Amy exit the elevator. Julie and Jonathan are 
           waiting on a bench, holding hands.

                                 MOLLY
                        Aww, cutesy.

                                 JULIE
                        Let’s get outta here! Amy, where’s 
                        the man-beast?

                                 AMY
                        Ultimate fighting.

           They start walking out. Jonathan lingers to talk to Molly.

                                 JONATHAN
                        You’re okay?

                                 MOLLY
                        Yeah.
                   (a beat)
                        I’m sorry I was such an ass.

                                 JONATHAN
                        A fool and his money are soon 
                        parted.

                                 MOLLY
                        What?

                                 JONATHAN
                        I was trying to think of something 
                        important to say.

           They laugh.

                                 JONATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Do you want me to punch Conor?

                                 MOLLY
                        No, I can punch him.

                                 JONATHAN
                        Good. I’m non-violent.

           They are about to reach the door when they hear a shout.

With Rose.

                        Are you leaving?

                                 MOLLY
                        Yeah. 

                                 CONOR
                        Do you want me to come?

           Molly pauses.

                                 MOLLY
                        No thanks. You can stay for a 
                        little bit right?

                                 CONOR
                   (smiles)
                        Yeah.

                                 MOLLY
                        Great. You have to get the deposit 
                        back from the hotel at the end of 
                        the night, pay the DJ, take down 
                        the decorations and put them in the 
                        recycling bin, then go door-to-door 
                        in the suites and make sure no 
                        one’s overdosing, dial-a-ride for 
                        anyone who needs one, and drive 
                        Principal Ganeshtha home. Thanks! 
                        Later. 

           Conor furrows his brow - confused. Amy grabs Molly’s arm, and 
           they head out with Jonathan and Julie. 

           INT. DENNY’S - NIGHT

           The crew is sitting at a table, eating breakfast. Julie pours 
           whiskey into their cokes. They giggle are having a good time. 
           A figure approaches the table. It’s Mr. Schacter.

                                 MR. SCHACTER
                        Well, hello.

           He looks disheveled, and maybe a little tipsy.

                                 MR. SCHACTER (CONT’D)
                        Fancy meeting you here.

           They stare in the weird disbelief you have when you see a 
           teacher outside of school.

                        Did you have a good time?

           Everyone looks sort of puzzled and starts laughing.

                                 MOLLY
                        No!

                                 AMY
                        Sort of.

                                 MR. SCHACTER
                        Well it’s nice to see you all here 
                        together. You’re a good group of 
                        kids. 
                   (beat)
                        After every prom, I like to come to 
                        this Denny’s and reflect on my 
                        misspent youth. My loves lost. 

           Mr. Schacter takes a long, creepy pause. 

                                 JULIE
                        Um, did something bad happen to 
                        you?

                                 MR. SCHACTER
                        Tonight’s not about me. It’s about 
                        you. And your prom. When I look at 
                        you guys, I think of something 
                        Yeats once wrote: “Think where 
                        man’s glory once begins and ends/ 
                        And I say my glory was that I had 
                        such friends.”

           Mr. Schacter, clearly drunk, bends down and kisses each of 
           them on the forehead - Julie, Jonathan, Molly, and Amy. Then 
           he leaves. 

                                 AMY
                        He is so weird. 

           We see them, in a brief moment of time lapse photography, eat 
           and talk through the night. 

           We FADE TO:

           EXT/INT. JONATHAN’S CAR - EARLY MORNING

                                 JONATHAN
                        Sure you don’t want me to take you 
                        all the way home?

                        Nah, this is fine.

                                 MOLLY
                        We’ll walk from here. 

           They get out. It is almost light out. Molly and Amy begin to 
           trudge home.

           EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING 

           Molly and Amy walking together, same as earlier. 

                                 MOLLY
                        It’s tomorrow. Prom’s over. Guess 
                        that’s the end of the plan. 

                                 AMY
                        I’m relieved. I was really starting 
                        to hate that plan. 

                                 MOLLY
                        But it worked for you.

                                 AMY
                        Kind of. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Is Ryan your boyfriend now?

                                 AMY
                        I’d prefer “friends with benefits.”

           Molly bumps Amy. She teeters in her high heels.

                                 MOLLY
                        There will be boyfriends at 
                        college.

                                 AMY
                        Yeah. And they’ll all be smart 
                        enough to be a Supreme Court 
                        justice with you.

                                 MOLLY
                        I’ll settle for not a douchebag.

                                 AMY
                        Who know. Maybe the right person 
                        will show up at the right time.

                                 MOLLY 
                        I never called home!
                   (she checks her phone)
                        I have sixteen missed calls!

                                 AMY
                        I’m gonna get in trouble! Isn’t 
                        that great? 

                                 MOLLY
                        Run!

           They turn to head in opposite directions. As they both sprint 
           off they turn and yell - 

                                 BOTH
                        Call me when you get home!
