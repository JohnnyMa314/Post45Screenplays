           EXT. M LTUN BOWL NG LAN S  -- DAY

           The old sign that once read “Milton Bowling Lanes” has been 
           vandalized, rendering it as "M LTUN BOWL NG LAN S". 

           A mockingbird lands on the last letter of the sign and begins 
           singing his lungs out.

           Below him, A CAT is electrified by the bird, every muscle 
           alive with predatory intensity, hiding behind the letters of 
           the sign as he stalks toward his prey. 

           THE BIRD senses something amiss and stops singing; he looks 
           around, but sees nothing; then nervously resumes his aria.  

           THE BIRD sings, blissfully unaware that death is in the air. 
           The cat freezes, inches away, staring at the bird with love 
           and hate, savoring the pending kill, until the bird senses 
           something amiss, slowly turns, and sees his executioner.

           The cat slays the mockingbird in an explosion of feathers,  
           which flutter down, revealing the title: “The Voices.” 

           INT. MILTON FIXTURE & FAUCET -- DAY

           The massive bathroom fixture factory is abuzz with 
           productivity, a nineteenth-century structure built of rough-
           hewn timbers within which resides a twenty-first century 
           computer-controlled assembly line.  

           CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS as four PINK FORK LIFTS move pallets of 
           bathtubs; their elegant trajectories across the factory floor 
           are as beautiful as a ballet.  Two MEN pack tubs into boxes.

           We focus on the younger of the two packers.  His name is 
           JERRY HICKFANG, early thirties, above-average intelligence, 
           jeans, a clean Dickies work shirt, and heavy, well-worn 
           gloves.  Jerry is mesmerized by the dance of the forklifts, 
           but continues to do his job well: he’s proud of his work.

           A BUZZER signals break time.  Manager DENNIS KOWALSKI, 38, 
           crosses to Jerry as he loads his final tub before break.

                                 DENNIS
                        Hey, Jerry.
                THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 2.

                                 JERRY
                        Hey, Mr. Kowalski.

                                 DENNIS
                        Call me Dennis, it's okay.  Just 
                        wanted to say, we're very pleased. 
                        You're doing a great job.

                                 JERRY
                        Thank you Mr. Kowalski.

                                 DENNIS
                        That's what I told that woman from 
                        the courts, "a great job" I said.  
                        She’s your lawyer?

                                 JERRY
                        Court-appointed psychiatrist.  
                        Thanks, Dennis, for saying that. 

           Jerry beams.  Dennis puts a friendly hand on his shoulder.

                                 DENNIS
                        No problem. So, Jerry, the thing 
                        is, is Milton Fixtures every year 
                        has the company party, a barbecue.

                                 JERRY
                        Okay.

                                 DENNIS
                        And, we get one representative from 
                        each department to help put it on, 
                        usually the new guy.  And the new 
                        guy in shipping, is you.

                                 JERRY
                        You want me to help plan a party?

                                 DENNIS
                        It's voluntary -- off the clock. 
                        There will be others, too, someone 
                        from Sales, a guy from Design, that 
                        cute French woman in Accounting, 
                        Chloe?  You want to do it?

                                 JERRY
                        Oh yeah, of course.  Yes.
                THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 3.

                                 DENNIS
                        Cool.  The first meeting is 
                        tomorrow night at five, in the 
                        sales conference room.  The company 
                        buys pizza and beer.  It'll be fun.

           Jerry nods.  He's into it.  Highlight of his week.

           EXT. M LTUN BOWL NG LAN S - NIGHT

           The shuttered bowling alley where the mockingbird was slain 
           is dark.  A rickety outdoor stairway leads to an attic door.  
           A light comes on behind the door.  This is Jerry’s home.

           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT / LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Jerry’s apartment in the bowling alley attic contains the 
           typical accoutrements of a bachelor’s home -- television, 
           stereo, couch, coffee table, pizza boxes, etc.   It isn’t 
           dirty and it isn’t clean; it isn’t bright and it isn’t dark, 
           but there’s something slightly artificial about how the place 
           looks, something screwy.  As Jerry enters, his friendly mutt, 
           BOSCO, greets him with a tail-wagging dance.

                                 JERRY
                        Oh yeah, hey Bosco, oh yes, oh 
                        Bosco, who’s a good boy?  Who’s a 
                        good boy?!!

           His sneering, pissed-off cat MR. WHISKERS watches the dog-
           human display of affection with disdain from a perch on the 
           back of the couch, where he sharpens his claws on the fabric.

           Jerry heads into his bedroom.  Bosco follows him.

           INT. JERRY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           A bachelor’s bedroom, again with all the typical stuff -- 
           bed, dresser, a couple rock posters, a pretty girl poster, 
           trinkets from State Fairs and tourist attractions.  The 
           bedroom seems idealized, yet lacking in detail -- but nothing 
           you can point to.  Just -- simplified.  Not quite right.

           Jerry pulls several shirts out of his closet, holding them up 
           and checking them out in the mirror one by one.  His ROOMMATE 
           yells from off-screen; his snarky tone is heavy with sarcasm.
                THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 4.

                                 ROOMMATE (O.S.)
                        What are you doing, Jerry?

                                 JERRY
                        Something for work.

                                 ROOMMATE (O.S.)
                        What, those assholes give you 
                        homework now?

                                 JERRY
                        No, I’m picking a shirt!  For 
                        tomorrow.  They got a thing they 
                        want me to do.

                                 ROOMMATE (O.S.)
                        Let me guess: they said jump and 
                        you said “how high.”

                                 JERRY
                        Shut up!

                                 ROOMMATE (O.S.)
                        You act like they’re doing you a 
                        favor to let you work there, like 
                        they should be able to fuck you in 
                        the ass whenever they want.  Some 
                        big privilege, letting you work 
                        “for free!” on their picnic.

                                 JERRY
                        How’d you know about the picnic?

                                 ROOMMATE (O.S.)
                        I’m not blind, Jerry.

                                 JERRY
                        I’m not talking to you!

           Jerry takes the abuse very personally; he SLAMS the door 
           between his bedroom and the living room, startling Bosco.  
           The closed door only spurs the roommate to shout even louder.

                                 ROOMMATE (O.S.)
                        They know about you at the company, 
                        they know you’re a freak and a 
                        weakling and a cry-baby. 

           Jerry wipes away a tear and shouts at the door --
                THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 5.

                                 JERRY
                        I am not a cry baby!

                                 ROOMMATE (O.S.)
                        You’re crying right now, liar. The 
                        only reason they don’t fire your 
                        ass is because you’re so hopelessly 
                        pathetic you amuse them.

           Jerry’s eyes fill with tears of rage.  Bosco, the dog, allows 
           Jerry to scratch his ears; it’s comforting and soothing.

                                 JERRY
                        I’m not pathetic, am I?  I’m not.
                            (scratches Bosco)
                        I’ll have fun working on the 
                        picnic, right, Bosco?  That doctor 
                        said it was good to reach out.     
                        And I did!  Aren’t you a good boy!?  
                        Rub your tummy now?  

           Bosco rolls over and Jerry rubs his stomach.  

           INT. MILTON SALES CONFERENCE ROOM - EVENING

           The party planning meeting.  Besides Jerry and Dennis, there 
           are eight others, among them CHLOE from accounting, a stylish 
           and attractive yet slightly out-of-place French woman in her 
           mid-thirties; trendy JOHN from Industrial Design; angry 30-
           year-old stoner DAVE from Personnel; and SHERYL, a blissfully 
           new-agey 25-year-old lesbian from Direct Sales.  Half-empty 
           pizza boxes are scattered along the long conference table.  
           Dennis leads; the meeting is ending.

                                 DENNIS
                        Before we break up here, I want to 
                        go over the assignments.

           Jerry raises his hand.

                                 DENNIS (CONT’D)
                        We’ll just go around the table, 
                        okay?  Can your comment wait?

                                 JERRY
                        I was just going to say that the 
                        picnic will be, um, a good place to 
                        reach out to form relationships 
                        with other humans.  And stuff.

                                 DENNIS
                        Duly noted, Jerry.  We all want to 
                        get out of here, so: John you’ll be 
                        setting up the barbecue grills in 
                        the parking lot, okay? Dave’s 
                        bringing drinks.  Sheryl’s 
                        providing decorations and Chloe’s 
                        doing the music. Any questions? 

                                 CHLOE
                        Yes, I got another idea, while we 
                        were sitting here ... you know the 
                        factory floor?  It’d be the perfect 
                        palce for a conga line.

                                 DENNIS
                        Like at a wedding?

                                 CHLOE
                        Yes, it’s fun, everyone can do it, 
                        kids like it.  We do it in France 
                        all the time.  Why not?

                                 DAVE
                        I’ll set my head on fire before I 
                        conga.

                                 SHERYL
                        Men are afraid to dance.  The male 
                        ego is too fragile.

                                 JERRY
                        I’m a man.  I’m not afraid.  I 
                        think it sounds real fun.

                                 CHLOE
                        Thank you, Jerry.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m not afraid either.  It’s not 
                        the coolest thing in the world, but 
                        it is a company party for a toilet 
                        factory we’re talking about here.  

                                 DENNIS
                        Settled, we’ll try a conga line.  
                        Moving on.  Jerry?

                        leftover pizza, please take it.

           Dennis stands; the others start to get up, some taking pizza, 
           others not.  Jerry throws a few cold slices in a box and 
           heads for the door.  Chloe intercepts him.

                                 CHLOE
                        Jerry?

                                 JERRY
                        Hey, Chloe.  What’s up?

                                 CHLOE
                        Can your sound system play music 
                        from an iPod?

                                 JERRY
                        I think so.  I’m setting it up 
                        tomorrow, in the break area, around 
                        five.  You could come by, and we 
                        can try it out.

                                 CHLOE
                        That sounds great.  See you 
                        tomorrow, Jerry.

           Jerry watches Chloe leave, takes one more slice of pizza 
           which he eats in one go, stuffing himself; then Jerry leaves 
           himself, as happy as he’s ever been.
                THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 8.

       7-A
           EXT. MILTON FIXTURES - NIGHT
                                                                    7-A

           Most windows are dark; the lot is empty: the factory rests.

       7-B
           EXT. MILTON FIXTURES - DAWN
                                                                    7-B

           The sun rises over the plumbing factory as workers drive in.

           INT. BREAK ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           A big bland room with a couple of snack machines, OSHA 
           posters, a few tables and a refrigerator.  Jerry, alone in 
           the room, connects the final cable in a P.A. system that 
           consists of a big amp and a CD player wired to two large, 
           industrial speakers on metal tripods.  “PROPERTY OF MILTON 
           FIXTURES” is stenciled on everything.

           Jerry hits “Play” and a Judas Priest song blasts out.  The 
           sound is loud and excellent, and Jerry plays some air guitar.

           Chloe leans in the door; Jerry has his back to her and thus 
           doesn’t notice her enter.  She checks the clock -- 5:25 -- 
           and then scoots around until she’s in Jerry’s field of view.

           Jerry abruptly stops playing air guitar then walks over and 
           turns off the stereo.  He laughs; Chloe holds an imaginary 
           lighter over her head.

                                 CHLOE
                        Rock on!

                                 JERRY
                        Thank you!  Goodnight, Milton!

                                 CHLOE
                        Well, it’s loud.

                                 JERRY
                        We are going to rrrock this picnic!

           Jerry jabs a fist into the air.  Jerry thinks he’s cool.  
           Chloe thinks he’s an amusing dork.  She holds up her iPod.

                                 CHLOE
                        Can we play music from this?

                                 JERRY
                        I think so.  Let me see.  
                THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 9.

           Jerry takes the iPod and studies it for a moment.  He pulls a 
           small plastic case from his pocket and rifles through it 
           until he finds a connector. He puts one end into the iPod; 
           then attaches the other end to his sound system.  He hands 
           the iPod (now tethered to the P.A. system) to Chloe.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Play a song.

                                 CHLOE
                        Any song?

                                 JERRY
                        Anything.  Just to see if it works.

           She hits “PLAY”; Dance to the Music blasts so loud it 
           distorts.  Jerry mouthes the words “TURN IT DOWN” and wheels 
           his finger around.  Chloe turns down the iPod and the 
           distortion goes away.  He flashes a thumbs-up to her.

           She sways to the song; so does Jerry for a few moments.  He 
           turns it down and they listen, a little awkwardly.

                                 CHLOE
                        Sounds pretty good, wow.

                                 JERRY
                        Great song.  People’ll have to funk 
                        out.

                                 CHLOE
                        What I thought, is that this word, 
                        “funk” means a mix of “fun” and --
                            (laughing at herself)
                        -- and “fucking.”  “Funky.”  

                                 JERRY
                            (blushing)
                        No.  It’s not that at all!  Not 
                        what you said, not fuh uh uh--

                                 CHLOE
                        What does it mean, then?

           They listen to the music for a moment as Jerry thinks.
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 10.

                                 JERRY
                        Funk?  It’s like this magic that 
                        takes over your whole body and for 
                        a second you get to feel like the 
                        coolest black guy in the world, 
                        exactly like Sly and the Family 
                        Stone, like you’re one of them.

                                 CHLOE
                        Hah hah.  That’s a great feeling.

           They listen to Dance to the Music for a moment, swaying, 
           until Chloe unplugs the iPod mid-song and prepares to leave.

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for setting everything up. 

                                 JERRY
                        Thanks for bringing over your iPod.  

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Maybe I’ll see you at work, too.

                                 CHLOE
                        Maybe.  I’m in accounting.

           Chloe leaves.  Jerry starts to take apart the sound system.

           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT / LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           As he comes home, Jerry’s mood is excellent; he pauses as he 
           enters to do a little dance of pure joy, singing Dance to the 
           Music with an almost female voice.  Tail wagging, Bosco 
           greets Jerry, who lets him lick his face.

                                 JERRY
                        You can smell her, can’t you, 
                        Bosco?  She’s a nice girl!  Her 
                        name’s Chloe!  She’s French I think 
                        and she has an iPod.  I like her.

                                 ROOMATE (O.S.)
                        She knows you’re a pathetic loser.

                                 JERRY
                        Shut up!
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 11.

           Jerry’s good mood is shattered; he freezes in place as he 
           watches Mr. Whiskers strut out and block his path.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Get out of here cat!  Shoo! 

           Mr. Whiskers not only holds his ground -- he talks back!

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Blow me.  Frog-lady’s never gonna 
                        like you.  Just fuck her and split.

                                 BOSCO
                        Ignore the cat, Jerry.  Chloe 
                        thinks you’re a real good boy.

           Just like in Beverly Hills Chihuahua, Jerry’s animals speak. 
           Mr. Whiskers -- the “roommate” -- is an abusive prick.  Bosco 
           is loyal and warm.  This is all normal and familiar to Jerry.

                                 JERRY
                        Thank you, Bosco.  I’m not 
                        listening to you, Mr. Whiskers.

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        She still thinks you suck.

                                 BOSCO
                        Go play in your shit-box, feline.

           Mr. Whiskers sneers disdainfully, then walks off, pimp-cool.

           INT. PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY

           A small, linoleum-floored room with a government-issued desk 
           and fluorescent lights, this ain’t no Park Avenue shrink, 
           this is government work.  However, there is a couch, there is 
           a comfy if threadworn chair, and the same nondescript 
           paintings found in any psychiatric office.  DR. HEATHER WEST, 
           in her forties, is carefully dressed in tight denim and 
           Navajo jewelry.  Jerry sits on the couch.

                                 DR. WEST
                        How are you doing, Jerry?

                                 JERRY
                        Very well, thank you.  Excellent.

                                 DR. WEST
                        Do tell.

                                 JERRY
                        Well ... they like me at work.

                                 DR. WEST
                        You’re a likeable man.

                                 JERRY
                        They’re having a picnic.  And they 
                        asked me to help out on it.  And I 
                        was afraid to say yes -- but I said 
                        yes anyway.  Yes, I said yes ...

                                 DR. WEST
                        And?

                                 JERRY
                        And now I’m going to put up the 
                        sound system.

                                 DR. WEST
                        That’s wonderful news.  You’re 
                        becoming a part of something.
                            (beat)

                        I don’t know.

                                 DR. WEST
                        Are you taking them?

                                 JERRY

                                 DR. WEST
                        You have to take them. 

                                 JERRY
                        Okay.

                                 DR. WEST
                        Any thoughts of suicide?

                                 JERRY

                                 DR. WEST
                        Do you ever hear voices?

                                 JERRY
                        Voices?  No.  Never.  Only when 
                        someone is talking to me.

                                 DR. WEST
                        You hesitated a little bit there --

                                 JERRY
                        It just reminded me of my mother.  
                        She told us the angels were talking 
                        to her, then the social workers 
                        took her out to that place “to help 
                        her.” She hated it there.  She was 
                        never the same after that -- well 
                        you know what happened.  By 
                        Christmas she was gone.

                                 DR. WEST
                        Angels was what she called her 
                        voices.

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah.  She said her angels did all 
                        kinds of interesting things.

                                 DR. WEST
                        Interesting, like what?

                                 JERRY
                        Burn your toast? The angels don’t 
                        want you to eat. Rain stops? The 
                        angels think you should go out and 
                        play. They were always around.

                                 DR. WEST
                        Your whole life? Even in Berlin?

                                 JERRY
                        Even in Berlin.  I thought lots of 
                        people saw them. I was just a kid. 
                        I didn’t know it was crazy shit.

                                 DR. WEST
                        Her angels were a coping strategy.  
                        The voices were real to her; angels 
                        were a reasonable attempt to craft 
                        a logical explanation.

                        I know, I know: “She was the best 
                        mother she knew how to be.  The 
                        things she did to me, it was her

                                 DR. WEST
                        Right.  Exactly.  Do you have any 
                        questions for me, Jerry?

                                 JERRY
                        Yes. I do. Kind of a big one.

                                 DR. WEST
                        Okay.

                                 JERRY
                        There’s a girl.  I like her.  She 
                        kind of likes me.  
                            (Jerry stops suddenly)

                                 DR. WEST
                        Go on...

                                 JERRY
                        And I don’t know how much to tell 
                        her, you know, about you, and this, 
                        and my mom and stuff.

                                 DR. WEST
                        And...

                                 JERRY
                        I don’t want to scare her away but 
                        I don’t want to lie to her either.  
                        I’m thinking if the subject comes 
                        up I’ll say something but if it 
                        doesn’t, I’ll leave it be.

                                 DR. WEST
                        You answered your own question, 
                        Jerry.  Why are you smiling?

                                 JERRY
                        We’re gonna conga tomorrow.

                                 JERRY
                        Yes, conga, like at a wedding!  
                        It’s gonna be amazing.

                                 DR. WEST
                        I’m sure it will be.  Enjoy 
                        yourself. See you next week, Jerry.

           A skeptical smile crosses her face.

           The plant has been halfheartedly decorated with a few sparse 
           streamers and crepe, like a public high school prom.  A conga 
           line snakes through the factory from one room to another; 
           Chloe is at the head of the line, Jerry is right behind her.  

           Everybody sings along with “Dance to the Music” except angry 
           Dave -- trapped in the middle of the line -- who is furious.

           While the conga line continues inside, the rest of the people 
           at the company party enjoy burgers and beer outdoors.

           DANCE SEQUENCE: Chloe and Jerry

           The conga line seems to be finished.  Everyone else has gone 
           outside; Chloe and Jerry are the only people still dancing.

           Chloe and Jerry face each other.  What happens next is a 
           subjective dance sequence of Jerry and Chloe funking their 
           hearts out.  It is a moment of beauty and happiness and flow.  

           Jerry is ecstatic; Chloe is having a good time. It seems to 
           go on forever.  It is heaven.  Jerry is in love.

           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT / LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Jerry bursts in the door, giddily funking out.

                                 JERRY
                            (muttering happily)
                        Dance to the music! Dance to the 
                        music!  Dance to the music!

           Bosco trots over.  Jerry drops to the floor to let Bosco lick 
           his face as he stares up at the ceiling, dizzy with joy.  

                                 BOSCO
                        You smell great, Jerry.  Is that a 
                        girl?  Ssssniff, mmmm.  Smells like 
                        a good girl!  Is she a good girl?

           Jerry sits up to make earnest eye contact with his dog. 

                                 JERRY
                        Oh, yeah, Bosco, she sure is, oh 
                        boy, what a day, what a day.

                                 BOSCO
                        You are one happy guy.

           Mr. Whiskers struts out, and watches for a moment, then:

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Did you fuck the bitch?

                                 JERRY
                        I don’t have to answer that.

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        You’ll never fuck her either -- 
                        because you disgust her.

                                 JERRY
                        Shut up!

                                 BOSCO
                        I’m thinking, this is a real good 
                        time for a walk, Jerr, walk, walk??

                        Okay, okay!  We’ll take a walk!

           Jerry fastens the leash to Bosco.  As they leave --

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        There’s a place in France, where 
                        the ladies wear no pants.  Too bad 
                        the thought of you makes her vomit!

                                 BOSCO
                        You’re a real piece of work, Mr. 
                        Whiskers!

                        Cat hater.

                                 BOSCO
                        I don’t hate all cats.  Only all 
                        the ones I’ve met.

           Bosco and Mr. Whiskers growl and hiss at each other until 
           Jerry yanks Bosco out the door.

           INT. MILTON FIXTURES - FACTORY FLOOR - DAY

           Jerry and his hungover coworker Tom load a bath tub into a 
           carton.  Jerry’s on a manic high.  He wears an MP3 player and 
           hum-sings as he works, waggling and swaying, dance-like --

                        Jerry -- give me a break here.

                                 JERRY

           After a short pause he turns his back on Tom and continues, 
           barely moving his lips.  The buzzer rings.

                        Jerr - shift’s over.

           Jerry nods; still humming his song, he heads into the locker 
           room, a few steps behind Tom.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM / MILTON FIXTURES - DAY

           Jerry tapes snapshots from the picnic into his locker.  Tom 
           stares, amused.  Jerry removes his headphones.

           He studies his face in a mirror on the door of his locker, 
           then slicks back his hair, spritzes with cologne, then pulls 
           on a nice white shirt with a collar, the kind of thing you’d 
           wear to church.  He leaves with purpose in his stride.

           INT. ACCOUNTING - END OF DAY

           Chloe is dolled up and ready to leave her office with four 
           other female coworkers when Jerry comes in.  The group has a 
           Sex-And-The-City vibe -- women getting ready to party.

                                 CHLOE
                        Jerry?

                                 JERRY
                        Hi, Chloe.  You said I should come 
                        up to accounting some time.

                                 CHLOE
                        I did?

                                 JERRY
                        Yes.  When we were getting ready 
                        for the picnic.

                        I don’t remember saying that.

           Chloe’s not that into having Jerry join them but Jerry’s 
           oblivious to her slight.

           ALISON, a shy, chubby bookkeeper, is almost going to say 
           something, but gets cut off by LISA, cute and flirty, the 
           office bohemian.

                                 LISA
                        Jerry -- hey.  Hi there.  I’m Lisa.

                        shipping.

                        The Accounting chicks are going to 
                        have a few drinks over at Friday’s, 
                        maybe you want to pack and ship out 
                        with us. 

                                 JERRY
                        I’d love to.  

                                 LISA
                        Well let’s get going then.

           Chloe glares at Lisa, and Lisa ignores her.

           INT. MILTON T.G.I. FRIDAY’S - EVENING

           The four drunk office ladies and Jerry share a table with a 
           couple dozen empty drink glasses, many of them decorated with 
           straws and umbrellas.  Shy Alison pays no attention; she’s 
           busy with her iPhone.  Chloe is drunk, finishing a story: 

                                 CHLOE
                        ... after I sell everything in 
                        France to move here, that’s when he 
                        says he’s “not the marrying type.”  
                            (the punchline)
                        Six months later, he marries Jill.  
                        Today, they have three kids, and 
                        I’m still in this “temp” job.

           Chloe’s friends roar with laughter.  Jerry does too.  There’s 
           a pause.  It’s that time of night, time to leave.  Lisa puts 
           a hand on Jerry’s back.
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 20.

                                 LISA
                        Hey, Jer, thanks for coming out 
                        with us.  You want to finish the 
                        Chimichurri Sliders?

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah, sure.

           Jerry eats the greasy remnants of the copyrighted food.

                                 LISA
                        You think you could give me a ride 
                        to the plant?  Or maybe home?

           Chloe shoots Lisa a look -- as if to say “are you crazy?”  
           Lisa misinterprets it to mean Chloe’s interested in Jerry. 

                                 LISA (CONT’D)
                        Never mind, I forgot you’re giving 
                        a ride to Chloe.

                                 CHLOE
                        No, no, no that’s okay.

                                 JERRY
                        I don’t mind.  I’d love to give you 
                        a ride, Chloe.  Let’s go.

           Chloe stares darts at Lisa.  Lisa doesn’t care; she’s getting 
           back at Chloe for cockblocking her.

           INT. JERRY’S TRUCK / MILTON FIXTURES PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Jerry’s got a nicely maintained crew-cab F-150.  The engine 
           is running.  Chloe, still drunk, sits at his side.

                                 JERRY
                        What are you doing this weekend?

                        Yeah, but Chen’s is way more fun 
                        than just egg rolls and fortune 
                        cookies -- you want to go?

                                 CHLOE
                        When?

                                 JERRY
                        Friday night.  I could pick you up 
                        after work.

                                 CHLOE
                        No, I don’t need a ride.

                                 JERRY
                        We can just meet there, then?
                            (Chloe says nothing)
                        The show starts at seven.

                                 CHLOE
                        There’s a show?

                                 JERRY
                        Yes! I don’t want to ruin the 
                        surprise, but you will love it.  
                        I’m going early to save seats. I’ll 
                        bring their card up to you, so you 
                        have the address.   

                                 CHLOE
                        Sure.  Thanks for the ride.

           She opens the door and runs/staggers toward her car.  

           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Jerry walks in, giddy.  Bosco races to greet him.  Mr. 
           Whiskers glares at them in disgust.

                                 BOSCO
                        Hey, buddy, smell like smoke!  
                        Mmmm.  How’d it go?

                                 JERRY
                        I have a date.  With Chloe from 
                        France.  On Friday night.
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 22.

                                 BOSCO
                        You’re a great guy! 

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Well, fuck me!  I’m an asshole.  I 
                        apologize, man, you were right.  
                        Cat food’s in the kitchen, Jer, and 
                        I can’t open the can.

           Mr. Whiskers head toward the kitchen.  Jerry follows.

           INT. ACCOUNTING - DAY

           Jerry walks through the Accounting Department.  He’s wearing 
           the same white shirt. Alison tracks his progress the way 
           NORAD tracks missiles.  Lisa spots him, waves him over.

                                 LISA
                        Hey, Jerry.

                                 JERRY
                        Hi, Lisa.

                                 LISA
                        What’s up?

                                 JERRY
                        Do you know which desk is Chloe’s?

                                 LISA
                        Right there. Got something for her?

                                 JERRY
                        Yes, she needs this address.  
                        Chen’s.  It’s the restaurant where 
                        we’re going to meet.

           Jerry holds a tacky restaurant card like it’s made of gold.

                                 LISA
                        Give it to me, I’ll make sure she 
                        gets it.

           Jerry gives Lisa the card, then glances across Chloe’s work 
           space, which has the usual knick-knacks and a few photos of 
           her vacation.  One of them shows her on a French beach in a 
           bikini, gorgeous and radiant.  Jerry stares.  Lisa notices.

                                 LISA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll make sure she gets it.

                                 JERRY
                        Okay, thanks Lisa.  It’s very 
                        important.

                                 LISA
                        I’ll make sure.

           Jerry leaves Accounting.  Alison exhales in relief.  Moments 
           later Chloe emerges from the back of the room.

                                 CHLOE
                        Is he gone?

                                 LISA
                        He’s gone.  What’s up with this?

           Chloe hands the restaurant card to Lisa.

                                 CHLOE
                        Some Chinese place. I think I said 
                        I might meet him over there.

                                 ALISON
                            (pleading, a little whiny)
                        You can’t!  Tonight’s karaoke.

                                 CHLOE
                        Oh, yeah, that’s right.
                            (re: Jerry)
                        He’ll get over it.

                                 LISA
                        So call the guy and tell him you 
                        can’t make it.

                                 CHLOE
                        I don’t want to upset him.  I’ll 
                        call him after the office closes.  
                        Leave it on voice mail.

                                 LISA
                        You’re a real sweetheart, Chloe.

           Lisa glares at Chloe.  Alison just looks uncomfortable.

           A kitschy all-you-can-eat Chinese restaurant with a big 
           aquarium, gongs, kites, paper dragons and other cheap 
           Orientalia, even a Chinese Elvis impersonator singing like a 
           maniac. At the festive tables, families celebrate birthdays; 
           junior high couples have first dates; people socialize.

           Jerry sits all alone at table for two, eating chow mein.

           A country bar with sawdust on the floor. It’s packed.  Chloe 
           is singing -- badly.

                                 CHLOE
                        And I-ee-I--ee-I, will always love 
                        you-ee-ou, ou ou, will always love 
                        YOU, oh oh.

           Lisa, Alison and a few other Accounting Ladies eat it up.

           Jerry stares into the massive fish tank, talking so his voice 
           appears to come from their mouths: “good night Jerry!” 

           Chinese Elvis now has transformed himself into a first-rate 
           martial artist, with nunchaku moves to rival Bruce Lee’s.

           Jerry swerves down a rainy road.  He turns on the radio; 
           Casey’s Last Ride by Kris Kristofferson starts to play.

           EXT. KARAOKE TAVERN - NIGHT

           The Accounting Ladies plus a few hangers-on hover in the 
           doorway looking out at the rain-soaked parking lot.

                                 CHLOE
                        My car is back at the plant.  I was 
                        going to walk -- but --

                        You’re the best, Lisa.

           Chloe gives her a drunken hug and they stagger out.

           EXT. MILTON FIXTURES PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Rain.  The factory is dark.  The huge parking lot is almost 
           entirely empty.  Lisa’s Celica pulls next to Chloe’s five-
           year-old Mustang.  The door opens.  
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 26.

           They exchange “goodbyes” and Chloe races from one car to the 
           other, quickly opening and then closing the door of her 
           Mustang.

           INT. CHLOE’S MUSTANG / PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Pouring rain.  Lisa drives away.  Chloe, alone in the 
           Mustang, puts a key in the ignition.  Tries to start it.  It 
           makes a sick whirring sound but does not start.

                                 CHLOE
                        Merde. 

           Chloe leans down to unlatch the hood.  Grabs a newspaper from 
           the back seat and uses it to cover her head as she gets out.

           EXT. MILTON FIXTURES PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Pouring rain.  Chloe checks the battery connection.  It’s 
           connected tight.  She tugs on the leads to make sure they’re 
           okay.  Lightning, then thunder, startle Chloe.  She closes 
           the hood and gets back into the car.

           INT. CHLOE’S MUSTANG / PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Chloe tosses the wet paper on the floor.  Pulls a cell phone 
           from her purse; it’s dripping wet.  When she flips it open 
           the screen is black -- destroyed by water.

           Chloe bangs the steering wheel a couple of times, then puts 
           her head in her hands and then just sits there, listening to 
           the downpour.

           INT. JERRY’S TRUCK - NIGHT

           Jerry navigates a back road while Casey’s Last Ride plays on 
           his radio.  He passes the gate to the factory, jams on the 
           brakes, does a U-Turn, and drives into the parking lot.

           INT. CHLOE’S MUSTANG / PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Chloe sees the truck pull into the parking lot.  She opens 
           her door (the old mechanical windows barely move) and yells.

                        Hey! Hey! I’m over here! Hello!

           She gets no response.

           INT. JERRY’S TRUCK - NIGHT

           As he has done much of the night, Jerry sits there, staring 
           straight ahead, while Casey’s Last Ride continues on the 
           radio.  He sings along -- sort of --

                                 JERRY
                        Chloe leaves the underground, Chloe 
                        Chloe Chloe, Chloe Chloe Chloe ...

           Through his drivers’ window WE SEE Chloe herself approaching 
           his truck.  She pounds on the window.  Startled, Jerry jumps, 
           then he sees who is at his glass.  An answered prayer.  An 
           angel from heaven.  A sign their love was meant to be.  
           Astonished and delighted he rolls down the window -- 

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Chloe.  It’s pouring!  Get in!

           Chloe races around to the passenger door.  Jerry reaches over 
           and pushes it open.  Chloe climbs up into the passenger seat 
           and then slams the door.

                                 CHLOE
                        Wow.  Thanks.

                        I forgot, your favorite restaurant, 
                        you didn’t get my message?

                                 CHLOE
                        I am so sorry.

                                 JERRY
                        You want to go get a cup of coffee 
                        or something?

                                 CHLOE
                        I suppose I owe you, why not.  I’m 
                        freezing.

                                 JERRY
                        Here, I have a blanket.

           Jerry pulls a blanket from the back seat and hands it to 
           Chloe.  She takes off her soaking-wet jacket and starts to 
           unbutton her soaking-wet shirt.  Jerry stares.

                                 CHLOE
                        Don’t stare, Jerry.

           Jerry is embarrassed.  He hides his head in his hands.

                                 JERRY
                        Oh, sorry, oh my God, sorry.

                                 CHLOE
                        It’s not the end of the world.

           She turns her back to Jerry and slips off her shirt and then 
           wraps herself in the blanket.  Jerry tries to fight the 
           overwhelming and conflicting emotions of lust, embarrassment 
           and rage.

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        So where should we go, Jerry?

                                 JERRY
                        I don’t know, Doran’s Diner?  They 
                        have a chili-cheeseburger pizza.

                        Chili-cheeseburger pizza?  Now?
                            (she laughs)
                        Why not!  It is that kind of night!  
                        We must eat one immediately.

                                 JERRY

                        Or nine!  To Doran’s!

           Jerry raises his hand to high-five; Chloe hesitates a moment, 
           then high-fives back.  Jerry drives out of the parking lot.

           The road is narrow and winding.  The rain continues with 
           occasional lightning strikes and pockets of blinding fog.

                                 CHLOE

                        That arty girl Lisa thinks you’re

                        My family moved here from Berlin 
                        when I was seven.  A kid has to go 
                        where his parents take him.

           A LIGHTNING STRIKE illuminates Chloe and for a moment she 
           switches from half-drunk office worker to a terrifying Angel 
           from Heaven, complete with wings and an otherworldly glow.  
           Then she changes back to a drunk office worker.

           They drive through a pocket of fog; Jerry waits until they 
           clear and are back onto the dark, rainy road before asking.

                                 JERRY
                        Okay.  There are lots of angels in 
                        the Bible, but only four have 
                        names.  Three are Gabriel, Michael 
                        and Raphael.  What’s the fourth?

                                 JERRY
                        Yes.  What’s his name?

                        I have no idea.

                                 JERRY
                        The reason everyone forgets his 
                        name isn’t because they don’t know 
                        who he is -- but because they 
                        forget he’s an angel --

           - but before Jerry can finish, a deer leaps into their 
           headlights.  Jerry jams on the brakes ... and skids.

           Jerry tries to make an evasive move but only succeeds in 
           slipping and sliding into a violent 360 on the wet, winding 
           road -- and then his truck careens straight into the deer 
           anyway.

       36C
           INT./EXT. JERRY’S TRUCK / WINDING, RAINY ROAD - NIGHT
                                                                    36C

           The five-point buck flips into the air and plunges headfirst 
           through the windshield, sending shards of safety glass, fur 
           and blood splattering across the truck cabin.

           Jerry’s truck finally comes to rest, half in the ditch.  The 
           bleeding buck thrashes and makes an uncanny, horrific dying 
           whine; its antlers and wounded face are inches from Chloe, 
           who SCREAMS in terror, now covered with fragments of 
           windshield and the red spray from the deer’s wound.

           Jerry kills the engine.  Chloe stops screaming.  And for a 
           moment all is silent except for the rain ... and then the 
           buck begins thrashing anew, his antlers narrowing missing 
           Chloe’s face with each jerky motion.  Scabby snot bubbles 
           accumulate on his nose, and his brown eyes betray 
           bewilderment and pain.  He turns to face Jerry.

                                 DEER
                        Kill me, Jerry.  Take your knife 
                        and cut my throat.  I want to die.

           Then the deer goes back to being an ordinary dying animal.

                                 CHLOE
                        Oh, God.

                        Careful!  Hold  still, Chloe!

           Chloe fights the door; it’s dented and difficult to move.  
           Jerry turns around, opens a large tool box behind the 
           driver’s seat and pulls out a huge buck knife.  The deer is 
           thrashing even more violently now -- 
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 32.

                        I gotta do it -- hold still --

           Jerry plunges the knife into the deer’s throat, which only 
           makes it accelerate its thrashing.  He pulls the blade down, 
           and across, with great effort; when he pulls the blade out a 
           great torrent of blood drenches Chloe, who screams louder 
           than she’s ever screamed before.  The deer twitches a few 
           more times, then goes limp, its face in Chloe’s lap.

           Then, as if nothing happened, Jerry finishes his riddle.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        The fourth angel is Lucifer.

           Chloe is in shock.

                                 CHLOE
                        What?

                                 JERRY
                        Don’t you get it?  Lucifer was an 
                        angel!  A fallen angel!

                        My God. 

           Chloe slumps down, then summons all her strength to push open 
           the passenger door.  She jumps out and runs into the dark 
           thick rainy woods.

                                 JERRY
                        Chloe!

           Jerry jumps out of his truck, into the rain.

           EXT. WOODS NEAR ROAD - RAIN - NIGHT

           Chloe runs through the dense forest, as fast as a woman in 
           night club shoes who is blitzed and half in shock can run.  
           She’s scared out of her fucking mind and drenched in blood.

           Jerry bolts off of the road and into the woods.  He’s got 
           Vibram-soled work boots, and a rain coat, and makes good 
           time.  He’s trying to be friendly and helpful.  Then again, 
           he’s still got that knife in his hand.

                                 JERRY
                        Chloe? Chloe!  Chloe, don’t run!

           Chloe comes to a steep, wet, leaf-covered ravine, and 
           stumbles, sliding face-first into a sharp bush, losing the 
           blanket and scratching her arm to shreds.  When she stands 
           one of her shoes comes off and drops down the ravine; she 
           leaves it behind and continues to run.

           Jerry lumbers forward, unflappable.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Chloe? Come on.  You’ll get lost!

           He pushes branches out of his way and when he gets to a 
           clearing, there, sobbing, face to the ground, is Chloe.  He 
           walks over to her and kneels by her side.

                                 JERRY
                        Chloe, Chloe, come on, you’re 
                        upset, it was just an accident.  
                        It’s cold out here.

           Chloe pulls herself to her knees and stares at Jerry, almost 
           uncomprehending; her eyes are bloodshot and glazed.  She 
           tries to stand, and slips; she grabs onto Jerry’s arm and 
           stands and then hits him, out of control, just throwing  
           punch after punch, kicking, screaming, out of her mind.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Chloe, Chloe!  Stop!

           He draws her close; she CRIES IN PAIN and pulls away, staring 
           aghast at a deep new PUNCTURE WOUND which has opened up in 
           her lung.  She staggers backwards a few steps, then looks up.

           Jerry holds the bloody knife.  He is as surprised as Chloe.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know how that happened, 
                        Chloe, I’m sorry, I hurt you --

                                 CHLOE
                        ... argrgggrlgle ... urrgglle ...

           Chloe’s efforts to speak are impaired by the blood filling 
           her trachea; her screams are muffled, as if underwater.  
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 34.

                            (she nods)
                        You’re suffering.  Chloe.  Chloe.  

           He pulls her close with one arm; holds her tight.  He 
           caresses her soaking wet hair.  She is helpless to resist.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        I love you.

           He plunges the knife deep into her heart.  Her complexion 
           grows pale from blood loss; her breathing stops; Chloe looks 
           at Jerry with unsurpassed dread -- and then dies.

           Jerry drops her onto the ground; then falls to his knees and 
           lets out a deep, primal scream before walking off into the 
           woods alone, disappearing into the rain.

           EXT. M LTUN BOWL NG LAN S - NIGHT 

           Punishing rain, lightning and thunder transform the decrepit 
           abandoned bowling alley into a sinister and dangerous place.

           The door opens, and Jerry enters, soaking wet and covered in 
           blood.  Bosco pads out.

           Bosco backs away and walks into another room.  Mr. Whiskers 
           awakens from a slumber atop the couch, and throws a withering 
           glance Jerry’s way.

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        What the hell have you been doing?

                        Shut the fuck up, Mr. Whiskers!

           Jerry heads for the bathroom.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Jerry peels off his clothing and shoes and throws them into a 
           trash bag, then climbs in the shower and scrubs himself from 
           head to toe with a stiff wire brush.  Blood and gore wash 
           down the drain.

           A LITTLE LATER

           Jerry dries off, wraps a towel around his ass and sits on the 
           (lid down) toilet seat, deep in thought.  A clawing/ 
           scratching sound alerts him to open the bathroom door. Mr. 
           Whiskers walks in, without saying a word, and takes a shit in 
           the litter box.

           Bosco nudges his head in, to see if the coast is clear.

                                 JERRY
                        It’s okay, Bosco.

           Bosco comes in.  Then, after a long pause, he talks; Jerry 
           has no trouble accepting it now.  He finds it comforting.

                                 BOSCO
                        Pretty bad situation, buddy.

                                 JERRY
                        I know.

                                 BOSCO
                        Maybe the thing to do is to go to 
                        the cops, explain everything.

                                 JERRY

                        Yeah.

                        I think you’re right.  I can get it 
                        off my chest. If I wait, it’ll be a 
                        million times worse. Thanks, Bosco.

                        You are both so fucking naive.  You 
                        go to the cops and say, hey man, I 
                        “accidentally” stabbed that French 
                        girl?  You think they’re going to 
                        nod and understand the way your 
                        stupid dog does?

                        Well, I do know: they’re going to 
                        throw your ass in jail where

                        But he did mean to do it.

                        Not the deer.  That was an

                        girl.  You wanted to kill her.

                        No, you’re not.  I’ve killed 
                        things.  On purpose.  Just for the 
                        sake of killing.  There’s no shame 
                        in it.  It’s instinct. Fight it and 
                        you become your own jailer.

                        The only time I ever feel truly 
                        alive -- is when I’m killing.

           Jerry thinks about it for a moment.

                        do something about her body, Jerr.

           Jerry is repelled by the thought and hyperventilates.

                                 JERRY
                        What do you mean, the body?

                        You’ve seen enough detective shows 
                        to know what happens if you leave a 
                        dead body lying around! Some hiker 
                        stumbles across it, and pretty soon 
                        it’s CSI: Milton, and guess whose 
                        hair and fiber and spit and blood 
                        are everywhere?  Yours, Jerry!  Go 
                        fucking get rid of the body!

           The whistle blows.  Jerry finishes packing one last tub then 
           heads for the exit.  Dennis Kowalski approaches.

                                 DENNIS
                        Hey, Jerry.

                                 JERRY
                        Hey Mr. Kowalski.

                                 DENNIS
                        I saw you on Friday.

           This sends a shock through Jerry.

                                 JERRY
                        You saw me?

                                 JERRY
                        No.  I didn’t see you at all.

                                 DENNIS
                        You were at Chen’s!  I saw you in 
                        the window, eating beef chow mein.

                                 JERRY
                        At the restaurant! Oh, yeah, it’s 
                        my favorite, Chen’s is, thank you 
                        thank you very much for seeing me.

                        I didn’t do it on purpose.

                        I know, I mean, just ... Thanks.  
                        It was good seeing you, too.

                        we’re trying to close out the books 
                        and she’s not answering her phone.  
                        Plus, her car is still in the 
                        factory parking lot.

                                 JERRY
                        That’s sad -- she was nice.  Maybe 
                        she went back to her own country, 
                        she wouldn’t need her car any more. 
                        I’m going to miss her a lot.  

           Jerry scurries away.  Dennis watches him.

           EXT. WOODS - TWILIGHT

           Long shadows make the woods look radically different from the 
           last time Jerry was here.  He carefully makes his way down 
           the edge of the ravine, and then stumbles on something.  He 
           looks down.

           Chloe’s hand sticks out from under a pile of leaves.  It’s 
           discolored and swollen except her manicure, which is perfect.

           He brushes leaves off of her; she’s been outside nearly three 
           days and is swollen, gooey and stinky.  Further, some woods 
           animal has started eating her stomach, none too neatly.  
           Jerry tries to lift up her body but gets slimed with bowel 
           oozing, is repulsed, and drops her.  He rolls her up in a 
           plastic tarp.

           Jerry’s truck is in a parking lot. The cab is full of plastic 
           boxes, and Chloe’s body is in the bed, under a tarp. He 
           starts the engine just as a POLICE CAR turns into the lot.  

           He watches nervously as the cop crosses the lot and pulls 
           alongside.  It’s DETECTIVE WEINBACHER, fifties, a kind face.

                                 DETECTIVE WEINBACHER
                        Hey, Jerry.  How are you doing?

                        Good!  Real good, Detective 
                        Weinbacher.

           Detective Weinbacher gets out of his car to examine Jerry’s 
           truck: the front end is smashed in, hood is accordioned, and 
           the windshield is shattered where the deer went through.  
           Blood and fur everywhere.  The bed of the truck is covered 
           with a tarp and the passenger seat is full of plastic boxes.

                                 DETECTIVE WEINBACHER

                        But you’re okay?
                            (Jerry nods)
                        What’d you do with the deer?  
                        That’s probably good meat.

                                 JERRY
                        I just left it on the side of the

                        going to write you up for hunting 
                        out of season.

           Jerry shakes hands with the detective for a few moments too 
           long and then Detective Weinbacher leaves.

           Jerry’s about to drive off when his cell phone rings.  His 
           ring tone plays Dance to the Music.  He lets it ring a couple 
           of times, then answers.

                                 DR. WEST

                            (speeding up)
                        Very bad.  But there are also 
                        moments of inspiration and beauty,  
                        when all the world makes sense and 
                        the elegant secret mechanics of man 
                        and God are revealed in their many 
                        dimensions, and the universe is 
                        laid out before mine eyes and it is 
                        a blessed place.

                                 DR. WEST
                        You totally stopped taking the 
                        pills, didn’t you?

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah.

                                 DR. WEST
                        Thank you for that honesty.  Our 
                        relationship depends on the 
                        cooperation of the State Department 
                        of Corrections. If you become 
                        noncompliant, I have to report 
                        that.

                                 JERRY
                        And they’ll put me away?

                                 DR. WEST
                        Let’s not find out.  Let’s make you 
                        compliant.  Take the pills.  Okay?

                                 JERRY
                        Okay.

           Then Jerry and Dr. West just sit there, staring at each 
           other.

           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jerry cuts up Chloe’s body.  On the counter next to the body 
           parts is a big PILL BOTTLE, which commands Jerry’s attention 
           and awe more than the pieces of dead Chloe.

           Bosco and Mr. Whiskers watch in curious silence.  Jerry 
           carefully saws off her head, looks at it, then puts it in the 
           fridge.  He continues working on the rest of her body, then 
           he suddenly is overcome with tears.

                                 BOSCO
                        What’s the matter buddy?

                                 JERRY
                        I really liked her.

                                 BOSCO
                        I know you did, buddy.  She was a 
                        good kid.  I bet you miss her a 
                        lot.
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 44.

           Mr. Whiskers hops up on the counter and rubs his head against 
           Jerry and, uncharacteristically, purrs.  Warmly.

                                 JERRY
                        I love you guys.

           Then Jerry gets back to cutting up Chloe: messy, hard work.  
           He sets down the cleaver, picks up the pill bottle, and 
           screws off the lid.  Mr. Whiskers whines, agitated, then --

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Don’t take those, unless you want 
                        to say goodbye to your old friends.

                                 JERRY
                        I’m not sure it’s a good idea to be 
                        talking to your cat, anyway.

                                 BOSCO
                        Yeah!

                                 JERRY
                        Or your dog, either.

           Bosco sighs.

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Take those drugs and you will enter 
                        a bleak and lonely world, Jerry.

           Jerry replaces the safety cap on the pill bottle without 
           taking one.  He opens the fridge to put the pills away.  
           CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD, now fully alive and lovely, looks at 
           Jerry disapprovingly.

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD
                        Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.

                                 JERRY
                        Hi, Chloe.

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD
                        Look what you did to me.

                                 JERRY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD
                        Imbecile!  That helps me a whole 
                        hell of a lot.

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD (CONT'D)
                        On Friday I was an accountant at a 
                        large American manufacturer and 
                        today I’m a severed head in a 
                        fridge.  Fucking sucks to be me, 
                        Jerry!

                                 JERRY
                        But what can I do now?

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD
                        Take the meds.  Take them.  TAKE 
                        THEM.

           Jerry pops out two pills, throws them back, then washes them 
           down with milk straight from the carton.  Chloe winks.

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD (CONT’D)
                        See?  That wasn’t so hard.

           Jerry slams the fridge.  Mr. Whiskers and Bosco stare at him 
           with big sad eyes, then walk away, silent.

           Jerry sits on his sofa and closes his eyes.

                                                       FADE TO BLACK:

           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           As Jerry opens his eyes, the apartment is dimmer than before.  
           He is in transition, as the drugs seize hold.  Mr. Whiskers 
           tries to talk but only succeeds in saying “meow” in a human 
           voice, then mews like a regular old cat.  Same with Bosco.

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  mew. mew. mew.

                                 BOSCO
                        Bark. Bark. woof. woof. woof.

           For the first time, we get an objective view of his 
           apartment, which is covered in cat hair, Styrofoam containers 
           filled with forgotten rotting fast food, etc. You can smell 
           the stench just by looking.  

           Bosco and Mr. Whiskers are ordinary pets; they don’t talk.

           Jerry slouches onto the couch and turns on the television.  
           It’s not tuned to a station, and shows STATIC.
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 46.

       53-A
           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
                                                                   53-A

           Hours later, Jerry hasn’t moved; the apartment is dark and 
           the only light is provided by the television’s static.

       53-B
           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT - DAWN
                                                                   53-B

           Jerry snores on the floor in an awkward position in front of 
           the static-filled television.  Ordinary-dog Bosco licks his 
           face a long time before Jerry opens his eyes.

           Jerry moves slowly, as if gravity has quadrupled and he 
           weighs a thousand pounds.  He goes to the kitchen.

       53-C
           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - DAWN
                                                                   53-C

           Bosco and Mr. Whiskers eat.  It takes Jerry a long time to 
           figure out how to throw away the pet food cans.

           THE PILL BOTTLE looms large.  Jerry lifts it and taps a pill 
           into his hand, then opens the fridge, looking for a drink.

           Inside, Chloe’s head is completely gray.  He’s shocked.

                                 JERRY
                            (very sad)
                        Chloe!  Oh, Chloe!  What happened 
                        to you?
                            (looking at his pets)
                        Hey Bosco!  Mr. Whiskers!  Hey!

           His pets just keep eating.  Jerry looks at the pill, then at 
           Chloe, then at his pets, and puts the pill into the sink.  
           After a pause, he dumps the entire bottle down the drain.

           He heads toward the bathroom.  We hear him VOMIT.

           EXT. ROADS OF MILTON - DAY

           Jerry drives toward work.  There is more and more light.  Two 
           pretty BUTTERFLIES enter his car, one on either side of his 
           head.  Jerry smiles when they start to sing like twins:

                                 BUTTERFLIES
                        Jerry & Chloe!  Chloe & Jerry!  
                        Jerry & Chloe!  Chloe & Jerry!

           It’s cute and freaky at the same time; Jerry likes them.

           INT. MILTON FIXTURES FACTORY - DAY

           Jerry packs tubs, smiling broadly.  Psychosis has its upside, 
           sometimes.  He works and is very happy.  The nightmare is 
           finished.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Five Sierra club birders push deep into the woods.  A BIRD 
           CALL makes them freeze in their tracks, tense --

                                 SIERRA CLUB LEADER
                        Shhh.  The song of the Yellow 
                        Bellied Sapsucker --

           The five birders, excited over this rare-bird sighting, 
           kneel, and heft giant binoculars to their eyes.  A WOMAN 
           BIRDER tries to stabilize herself on the steep, slick 
           terrain, and her hand hits something odd.  She looks down -- 

           -- and finds a woman’s shoe, with a hand-shaped bloodstain.  
           And next to that, part of an intestine.  The birder screams.

           EXT. WOODS - THREE HOURS LATER - DAY

           Yellow crime-scene tape blocks off a portion of the woods.  A 
           dozen red numbered flags indicate where evidence has been 
           found.  A few crime scene techs take photographs, samples, 
           and measurements.  Eight beat cops talk to the birders.  
           Beneath a pop-up shelter command post, Detective Weinbacher 
           talks to a young, pretty, cop, OFFICER DONNA APPLETON.

                                 DETECTIVE WEINBACHER
                        No.  That’s not the shoe you wear 
                        to hike deep into the woods.  
                        That’s not the purse you take 
                        hunting.  

                                 OFFICER APPLETON
                        A murder?

                                 DETECTIVE WEINBACHER
                        My guess is a murder, hastily 
                        committed, haphazardly covered up.  
                        An impulsive act.

           Appleton and Weinbacher exchange a glance -- this is a 
           gruesome tragedy, and a cool puzzle at the same time.  Action 
           News reporter SHEILA HAMMER, standing nearby with a 
           cameraman, crosses to Detective Weinbacher.

                        Detective Weinbacher, I overheard -- 
                        you think this is a murder?

           He nods.

                                 SHEILA HAMMER (CONT’D)
                        Could this person kill again?

                                 DETECTIVE WEINBACHER
                        That’s what I’m afraid of.

           Hammer, Weinbacher and Appleton consider the grave 
           implications of what may have occurred.

           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Jerry and Mr. Whiskers watch television while Bosco sleeps.  
           The show is Animal Planet, as Jerry sees it: nothing but 
           random shots of animals having sex: lions mounting lionesses, 
           dogs screwing in the street, turtles the size of small cars 
           mating, zebras fucking, even a bonobo orgy.  They stare.

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Change the the fucking channel

               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 49.

           Jerry grabs the remote and the scene on TV changes --

           Now it’s all kill shots.  Tigers kill zebras, polar bears 
           kill seals, sharks kill whales, crocodiles kill horses, one 
           after the other with no context or narration.

           Mr. Whiskers and Jerry stare at nature’s gruesomeness.  

                                 MR. WHISKERS (CONT’D)
                        Oh yeah, that’s more like it.

                                 JERRY
                        I feel better now.

           They watch for a minute, enthralled, then --

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Jerry is BACK! Yeah! Fuck those 
                        pills, man!  That headshrinker 
                        doesn’t care if you’re happy.  She 
                        just wants you to be obedient.

                                 JERRY
                        She’s not a bad person.

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Not if you want to be slave to 
                        drugs.  Just say “no”!!
                            (re: television)
                        Check it out!  Crocodile killed a 
                        motherfucking zebra!

                                 JERRY
                        God damn!

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Are you gonna kill someone else?

                                 JERRY
                        Me?  No.  Of course not.

           Bosco stirs from his slumber, and mumbles, half-asleep:

                                 BOSCO
                        Sick fucking cat.

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Why not, Jerr?  The connection you 
                        share with someone you kill is 
                        profound.

                                 MR. WHISKERS (CONT'D)
                        You create a sacred moment.  You 
                        become a God in their life, the 
                        last thing they will ever know, and 
                        they become part of your soul. 
                        Plus: you want to.

                                 JERRY
                        No!

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        You killed by accident and you 
                        liked it.  It felt good.  Now do it 
                        on purpose, Jerry.  Just once.  
                        Just to see what is inside you.

                                 JERRY
                        Shut up! I don’t have to listen to 
                        you.  You’re just a cat.

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        A cat that can talk and reason is a 
                        miracle for the ages --

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah?  So?

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        -- but a guy who talks to his cat 
                        is just pathetic.  Stop being a 
                        loser, loser.  Find another woman, 
                        a pretty one, and then kill her.  
                        And you will discover what it feels 
                        like to be truly alive.

                                 JERRY
                        By killing? 

           Jerry listens intently; what Mr. Whiskers is about to say is 
           forbidden knowledge from deep in Jerry’s tortured soul:

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Hunting and killing, are better 
                        than sex. When I watch another 
                        being’s life drain away in my own 
                        claws I feel like Shiva-Kitty, God 
                        of Death.

           Jerry is distraught, yet attracted; Mr. Whiskers alluring 
           description pushes all of Jerry’s buttons.  Bosco stands and 
           paces, agitated and upset.
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 51.

                                 BOSCO
                        What is wrong with you? I’m willing 
                        to kill if necessary to defend 
                        myself or Jerry, but to go out and 
                        kill for kicks?  That is fucked up.

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Without hunting, I have no purpose, 
                        no reason to exist.

                                 BOSCO
                        That is exactly the problem with 
                        cats my friend.

                                 JERRY
                        That’s a good boy.

                                 BOSCO
                        Did you hear that? I earned the 
                        right to be called a good boy.  I 
                        came up from the pound, see?  I saw 
                        dogs there who wanted to kill, 
                        ugly, scarred mongrels.  Nobody 
                        adopted them. They get hauled away, 
                        and word on the street is it does 
                        not end well.  That’s what happens 
                        to pets who kill.

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Asshole dog.  Hissssss.

           Mr. Whiskers hisses angrily at Bosco, ears pinned, back 
           raised, fur up; Bosco growls at him through snarled teeth; 
           and Jerry pulls them apart.  They go back to watching Animal 
           Planet, a particularly gnarly sequence involving a great 
           white shark and a seal.  Jerry stares, enchanted, thinking, 
           thinking, thinking...

           EXT. M LTUN BOWL NG LAN S - DAY

           A bright day, as surreally sunny as a raisin commercial.

           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - MORNING

           His kitchen is shiny and happy and bright and so is Jerry.  
           Mr. Whiskers and Bosco cheerfully chow down at their 
           respective bowls.  Jerry pours cereal into a bowl and sets it 
           down on the kitchen table and then opens the fridge.

           Inside, next to the carton of milk, Chloe’s head is awake, 
           mellow, happy, nice makeup, good hair.  She smiles a warm 
           smile, the smile you save for your very very favorite people.   

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD
                        Bon jour, Jerry!

                            (cheerily flirtatious)
                        Hi, Chloe!  Bon voyage faux pas?

                        Boy oh boy, those pills sure suck!

                                 JERRY
                        Tell me about it!  I only took ‘em 
                        because you told me to!

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD
                        Stupidest pills ever.  They made me 
                        look like a rotten Jack-O-Lantern.

                                 JERRY
                        You were stinky, too.  But now --
                            (takes a whiff of her)
                        -- you smell like spring flowers.  
                        And you’re grand prix pretty!

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD
                        A la mode, you’re so sweet, Jerry.  
                        What a beautiful day to come back!

                                 JERRY
                        A perfect day!  And I’m making 
                        cereal.  Honey Bunches of Oats with 
                        Almonds.  And two percent milk.

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD
                        Yay!

           He hefts her head out and puts it on the dining table, facing 
           himself, then sits down and pours milk on his cereal.

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD (CONT’D)
                        How’s the cereal, Jerry?

                                 JERRY
                        Super delicious. 

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD
                        Bon appetit!  Yummy yummy yummy.

           Jerry eats in silence for a moment.  Then:

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD (CONT’D)
                        Hey Jerry?

                                 JERRY
                        Umm hmm?

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD
                        Hey, Jerry, can you get me a 
                        friend?

                                 JERRY
                        A friend?

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD
                        It gets lonely in the fridge.

                                 JERRY
                        Kill someone?  On purpose?

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD
                        Yes!

                                 JERRY
                        I don’t know.

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD
                        Please, Jerry?  Si’l vous plait?  
                        Pleeeeeeeeeeeeease?

           Jerry locks eyes with her, and in his best “daddy’s got a 
           secret” face, he smiles and nods his consent.

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD (CONT’D)
                        Oh thank you thank you thank you 
                        thank you merci I love you Jerry.
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 54.

           Jerry winks at Chloe’s severed head, then goes back to eating 
           his cereal.  On the floor Bosco and Mr. Whiskers exchange a 
           glance: the Old Jerry is back!  After a couple bites, he asks 
           a question with his mouth full:

                                 JERRY
                        You’re not just a hallucination?  A 
                        product of my mental illness?

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD
                        Does it matter, if you’re happy? 

           Jerry shrugs.  He’s got his suspicions about his sanity; but 
           more than that he’s happy to be happy.  And he’s got a plan.

           INT. ACCOUNTING - DAY

           Lisa, the sexy bohemian of Milton Fixtures Accounts 
           Receivable, is in her cubicle, working intensely on a 
           spreadsheet, when she sees the reflection of a man in the 
           computer screen.  First, she primps a little -- her manicured 
           hands checking her hair, a quick check of the quality of her 
           breath in her hand, and then she turns around and pretends to 
           be startled when she sees Jerry.

                                 LISA
                        Hi, Jerry.

                                 JERRY
                        Hi, Lisa.

           Jerry is trying to look sharp, the best he knows how, hair 
           slicked back, T-shirt tucked in, and the way he leans on the 
           cubicle is a studied James Dean slouch.

                                 LISA
                        What’s up big guy?

                                 JERRY
                        I just happened to be over here, I 
                        thought I’d see what you’re up to.

                                 LISA
                        Same as always, figuring out how I 
                        can get out of here early tonight.

                                 JERRY
                        Early?  It’s past five.

                        Oh!  Want to grab a drink?

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah.  Want to go to Friday’s?

                                 LISA
                        Friday’s kind of sucks on Tuesday.  
                        You ever been to Grover’s Tavern?

                                 JERRY
                        No.

           INT. GROVER’S TAVERN - NIGHT

           A dark tavern with one pool table and a few booths; other 
           than a couple drinkers at the bar and one table of telephone 
           linemen, Jerry and Lisa are the only customers.  They sit at 
           a booth in the back, separated by baskets half-full with 
           fried things, and a few empty beer bottles and shot glasses.

                                 LISA
                        -- and the divorce was final.  He 
                        got the house and the car and I got 
                        the cat, and it was the best deal I 
                        ever made in my life.

                                 JERRY
                        What kind of cat?

                                 LISA
                        Part Siamese, part Tabby.  From a 
                        rescue.  Are you good with cats?

                                 JERRY
                        The real question is: are cats good 
                        with me?  Because they pretty much 
                        own us and not the other way 
                        around.

                                 LISA
                        Oh, my God you’ve got that right.  
                        My cat -- if I don’t do everything 
                        he wants me to do -- watch out!  I 
                        tried dry cat food on him -- and he 
                        tore up my couch!  Serves me right.

                        They’re very demanding.

                                 LISA
                        Oh, yeah!  What’s your cat’s name?

                        Mr. Whiskers.  And he is a son of a 
                        bitch.  How about you?

           Lisa laughs!  Jerry’s a funny guy -- and he likes cats!

                        him?  He’s probably tearing up my 
                        apartment right now ... He’s such a 
                        pig head.

                                 JERRY
                        Okay.

                        Oh.  I want to go somewhere else.

                                 JERRY
                        It’s a surprise.

           Lisa scoots over next to Jerry and puts a hand on his leg.

           EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

           Jerry stops his truck next to an abandoned rural farmhouse, 
           in a field overgrown with weeds.  In the moonlight the 
           farmhouse is equal parts romantic and terrifying.

           Jerry and Lisa get out of the truck.  As they move closer 
           together, we see that he holds in his hand a massive hunting 
           knife, the same one he used to gut Chloe.   He sticks it into 
           the pocket of his jacket on the opposite side from Lisa.  She 
           suspects nothing.

                                 LISA

                        it?

                                 JERRY
                        They had a lot of plans that never 
                        went anywhere.  Really, Mom just 
                        got disability checks.

           They take a few hesitant steps, then Lisa stops, afraid.

                                 LISA
                        What are we doing here?

                                 JERRY
                        I wanted to show you this place.
                            (sees her)
                        You’re afraid.

                                 LISA
                        A little.  What’s here?

           Jerry takes Lisa’s hand, partly to console her and partly to 
           reassure himself.  He points to a hefty chunk of cement that 
           sits in the middle of the path leading to the house.

                                 LISA (CONT’D)

                        It’s a hunk of concrete.

                                 JERRY
                        It’s from the Berlin Wall.

           A huge festive crowd shouts, sings and drinks as the Wall’s 
           demise is imminent.  They’re all ecstatically happy...
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 59.

           ... except for 6-YEAR-OLD JERRY, lost in a sea of legs and 
           knees and feet, terrified and separated from his mother.

                                 6-YEAR-OLD JERRY
                        Mama!  Mama!  Mama!  Mama!

           No one notices him; their eyes are on history.  Little Jerry 
           panics; he could be trampled and no one would know.

           Finally a pair of arms PICKS HIM UP.  Jerry’s startled.

           The crowd PASSES JERRY OVERHEAD, the ride of his life, while 
           in the background machinery chews away at the wall.

           Finally, his disapproving American stepfather MACK hands 
           Jerry to his mother KLAUDIA, thirties, whose bright eyes are 
           filled with love -- and frenzy.  She gives Jerry a flurry of 
           kisses, then, in German, she points things out:

                                 JERRY’S MOTHER
                        Look, Jerry! Dragons! My angels 
                        brought them here to Berlin!

           Jerry follows her gaze to a massive EARTHMOVER whose giant 
           claw RIPS away at the wall.

                                 6-YEAR-OLD JERRY
                        I see, Mama!  I see the dragons!

                                 JERRY’S MOTHER
                        They’ll destroy the barrier that 
                        keeps heaven and hell apart!

                                 6-YEAR-OLD JERRY
                        That’s wonderful!  Which one are we 
                        going to now mama? Heaven, or hell?

           Jerry looks up to see tears streaming down her cheeks.

                                 JERRY’S MOTHER
                        I wish I knew.

                        Maybe.  

           She touches it.  They walk a few steps; Jerry points:

                        That was my window.  I spent a lot 
                        of time alone.

                        Not really.  The kids called me 
                        “gesundheit” and “fahrvergnügen” 
                        and “the ultimate crying machine.”

                        Uh-huh.  So I used to stare out at 
                        the night sky and make believe the 
                        stars were my friends. Stupid, huh?

                        No, it’s sweet.  Can you show me?

                                 JERRY
                        You want to go inside?

                                 LISA
                        Yeah, lets’ go.  

           Lisa wraps her arm around Jerry’s waist and they walk 
           together toward the front door, each comforting the other.

           INT. JERRY’S CHILDHOOD HOME / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The front door creaks open and Jerry and Lisa go inside.  
           It’s a dusty home that’s been abandoned for years.  Jerry 
           turns on a flashlight; its beam flits past a giant spider web 
           and illuminates the living room, which still has a ratty old 
           couch, and cast-iron coffee table, covered with dust and 
           yellowed newspapers.

                                 LISA

           Jerry stares into the living room.

           INT. CORRIDOR WITH STAIRWAY - 1995 - DAY

           Jerry’s stepfather Mack is punishing Jerry.  Sitting on a 
           step is his mother Klaudia, now in her forties, prematurely 
           gray and rail-thin.  She winces at each CRACKING sound.

                                 MACK
                        Bunny Monkey is not real.

                                 12-YEAR-OLD JERRY
                        Bunny Monkey is my friend!

           Mack lays into 12-Year-Old Jerry’s ass with the hanger once 
           again, drawing blood.

                                 MACK
                        You got to learn reality from 
                        fantasy, Jerry, you got to!  It’s 
                        just a sock.  

           12-Year-Old Jerry grits his teeth, staring straight ahead: a 
           sock monkey with rabbit ears gives him encouragement.

                                 BUNNY MONKEY
                        Be brave, Jerry!

                                 12-YEAR-OLD JERRY
                        I love you bunny monkey!

           Mack lashes out repeatedly, bloodying 12-Year-Old Jerry’s 
           ass. Then Mack grabs the sock monkey and rips it apart.

                                 MACK
                        It’s a sock, Jerry.  A fucking 
                        sock!

           But Jerry sees it differently: as Bunny Monkey is torn 
           asunder by Mack, the brave little sock monkey taunts him:

                                 BUNNY MONKEY 
                        Go ahead!  Kill me if you’re a real

           Bunny Monkey is now only a pile of rags.  12-Year-Old Jerry

           The floor is rickety and someone has graffitied the walls.  
           Beer cans and cigarette butts litter the floor.  Holding each 
           other tight, Jerry and Lisa creep down the hall.

           They come to a door that has been kicked in; Jerry freezes in 
           place and looks through the door.

                                 12-YEAR-OLD JERRY
                        I promise.

                                 JERRY’S MOTHER
                        Never!  They don’t understand.  
                        They can’t understand.  What’s that 
                        sound?

           She hears something, and points toward the window.  12-Year-
           Old Jerry walks to the window as FLASHING RED AND BLUE lights 
           from approaching police cars grow nearer and brighter.  

                                 12-YEAR-OLD JERRY
                        It’s the hospital people.  They’ve 
                        got the sheriff with them.

                                 JERRY’S MOTHER
                        I can’t go back.  I can’t go back.  
                        I can’t go back.  I can’t go back.

           She puts out her arms; 12-Year-Old Jerry leans over the bed 
           and hugs her.  Jerry’s mother pulls away.  She pushes Jerry 
           back.

           Then she grabs a drinking glass from her bedside table, 
           smashes it, and jabs the glass into the side of her neck.  
           However, she doesn’t quite hit the artery.  Her neck slowly 
           oozes blood as she writhes in incredible pain.

                                 JERRY’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Finish it, Jerry.  Free me.  Free 
                        me.  Before they get here.  Do it.

                                 12-YEAR-OLD JERRY
                        I love you, mommy!

           12-Year-Old Jerry takes the water glass and jabs it again and 
           again into his mother’s neck; blood gushes from her artery 
           and her face turns ashen gray and her lips try to form words 
           soundlessly, and then she crumples to the side and is still.

           The door is kicked in.  Two sheriff’s deputies rush into the 
           room, followed by a social worker and two EMT’s.  12-Year-Old 
           Jerry stands by his mother’s bed, covered in blood, broken 
           glass in hand, seemingly guilty as sin.  The cops taser him 
           and he twitches violently before falling to the ground.

           INT. JERRY’S CHILDHOOD HOME / UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Jerry and Lisa stare into the empty room.

                                 LISA
                        Oh, Jerry, what is it?

                                 JERRY
                        My momma died in that room.

           Lisa turns quite tender, running her hands through Jerry’s 
           hair.  Tears form in her eyes.

                                 LISA
                        I never told anyone what I’m going 
                        to tell you.  I had an abusive 
                        father with all that entails.  
                            (quiet)
                        Every kind of abuse.  My mother was 
                        addicted to methadone and I was 
                        passed from family to family like 
                        an unwanted pet.  Things happened.

                                 JERRY
                        I’m sorry, Lisa.

                                 JERRY
                        Oh, oh, oh no.  That’s so sad.

                                 LISA
                        Yes.  But I also think that 
                        sometimes the worst circumstances 
                        make the best people.  You come 
                        back from the brink, and the whole 
                        world is beautiful.

           A long, pregnant pause.  And then they kiss.  Tentative at 
           first, and then a real kiss, filled with tenderness and 
           desire and the bond that only survivors share.

                        Take me home.

           Lisa takes Jerry by the hand and leads him toward the stairs.  
           BEHIND HIM, unseen by Lisa, Jerry drops his hunting knife, 
           and the two walk down the rickety stairs, entwined.

           INT. LISA’S BEDROOM AREA / STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Jerry and Lisa make love.  He’s inexperienced.  She’s okay 
           with that and is gentle and patient.  

           Nearby, Pighead licks his ass.

           INT. LISA’S BEDROOM AREA / STUDIO APARTMENT - DAWN

           Pighead the cat awakens Lisa, who slips out of bed.  The 
           apartment is one giant room, with some room dividers.  Jerry 
           cracks open his eyes and watches her, naked in the morning 
           sun, messy hair, self-assured, as she hugs her cat to 
           herself; then walks to the kitchen area and puts cat food 
           into a bowl.  She feeds Pighead, then returns to the bed, 
           climbing onto Jerry.

                                 LISA
                        That was a wonderful night, Jerry.

                                 JERRY
                        I think so too.

           Jerry hugs her.

                        You’re so mysterious.  The first 
                        time you came up to accounting I 
                        could tell there was something deep 
                        about you.

                                 JERRY
                        Hmmm.

                        Our night turned out a lot 
                        different than I had expected.

                                 LISA
                        Different, good?

                                 JERRY
                        Definitely.  I don’t feel alone.

                        Me neither.

           She kisses him.

           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Jerry enters.  Bosco races over and leaps on Jerry, tail 
           wagging, giving him a big slobbery kiss.

                                 BOSCO
                        You’re home, you’re home, the man 
                        is back, the man is back and he got 
                        laid! Bring her home, I want to 
                        smell her crotch.  Smells 
                        deeeelicious.

           Mr. Whiskers is more stand-offish, staring at Jerry from a 
           perch atop the couch.  He’s hungry and angry.

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Where the fuck’s my fucking food, 
                        fuck face?

           Jerry ignores Mr. Whiskers, and scratches Bosco’s ears.

                                 JERRY
                        That’s a good boy, good boy, good

           Mr. Whiskers plops down off the couch and stands stock-still 
           on the ground, staring at the disgusting human-canine public 
           display of affection, until Jerry catches his eye.

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Food!

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Food!  Now!

           Jerry starts walking toward the kitchen.

                                 MR. WHISKERS (CONT’D)
                        I left you a gift on the sofa, a 
                        little reminder of why you can’t 
                        leave us alone without FOOD God 
                        damn it.

           Right in the middle of the couch in a big hairy cat turd.

           INT. JERRY’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Jerry happily hums to himself, no particular tune, just love 
           coming through, he feeds Mr. Whiskers, he feeds Bosco, it’s a 
           beautiful morning.  And then he opens the fridge: inside is 
           Chloe’s severed head.

                        It got you this far, didn’t it?

           Jerry nods slowly, the weight of the world on his shoulders.

           INT. MILTON FIXTURES - FACTORY FLOOR - DAY

           Lost in thought, Jerry loads tubs.  Dennis Kowalski walks 
           over.

                                 DENNIS

                        Some problem with payroll or 
                        something.

           Jerry skulks off the factory floor.

           INT. ACCOUNTING - DAY

           Jerry walks over to Lisa’s cubicle.  She’s fluffed her hair, 
           and her silk camisole peeks out from her unbuttoned blouse.

           INT. COPY ROOM - DAY

           Jerry and Lisa make out like bandits in the cluttered copy 
           room, not much bigger than a closet.  She takes his hand and 
           sticks it under her skirt and grinds against him.

           There’s a knock at the door.  They both straighten out the 
           best they can.

                        Come in!

           It’s her coworker, Alison.  It’s perfectly clear what’s going 
           on but no one wants to acknowledge it.

                        No that’s okay.

           Lisa and Jerry laugh, then --

                                 JERRY
                        I gotta go.

           And with that Jerry leaves.  Alison pulls the door shut.

                        early thirties, white, lower or 
                        middle class.  Trouble fitting in.

                        having brown eyes, or being right-
                        handed -- or is it something you

                        the cat --

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Fuck you, blaming it on me.

                                 JERRY
                        No!  Hear me out.  I know what is 
                        good.  I want to lead a righteous 
                        and just life and be an upstanding 
                        member of the community.  But then 
                        Mr. Whiskers makes me do bad 
                        things.

                        I know right from wrong.  I try to 
                        be good.  But when I do certain 
                        horrible things, I am filled with 
                        terror and dread, standing outside 
                        myself.  Even though I know what 
                        I’ve done I also feel like -- it 
                        wasn’t me.

                        I know, but I want to be good!  In 
                        some sense it wasn’t me at all!  It 
                        was --

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        You going to say it was me?

                        There’s no such thing.  Everything

                                 JERRY
                        I kind of suspected.  But if 
                        there’s me, regular me, me who is 
                        talking now, and I want to be 
                        good... and then there’s you and 
                        you and you, trying to make me do 
                        something else, am I good?

           front door a crack, and sees Lisa standing outside.  She’s 
           dressed provocatively, and holds a cake.

           a mess; she runs her fingers through it.

                                 LISA
                        I’m imposing.  I can tell.

                                 JERRY
                        You look beautiful.

                        Thank you.  You look -- delicious.

                        I am so happy I met you.

                        I’m serious.  I feel like the 
                        luckiest guy in Milton.

           He means it.  Lisa can tell.  She blushes.

                                 LISA
                        I brought you a cake.

                                 JERRY
                        You are so amazing, Lisa.

                                 JERRY
                        No, it’s just ... what you heard 
                        is, I talk to my pets sometimes.  A 
                        lot of the time.  All the time.

                                 LISA
                        Me too.

                        And they talk to me.

                                 LISA
                        I totally know what you mean.

                                 JERRY
                        Thank you for the cake.

           He tries the doorknob.  It’s locked.

                                 JERRY
                        I should invite you in.  I want to, 
                        but it’s a disaster in there.

                        Plus I’m locked out.

                        Do you want me to wait while you 
                        try to get back in?

                                 JERRY
                        No, that’s okay.

                                 LISA
                        I don’t mind.  Really.  It’s not 
                        like I have a life -- ha ha.  How 
                        are you planning to get in?

                                 JERRY
                        There’s a skylight.  I can just 
                        climb up there.

                                 LISA
                        I’m pretty good at getting into

                        keys.

                                 JERRY
                        No!  I’ll go through the skylight.

           Jerry stands on the railing to the stairs; then he pulls 
           himself up to the roof.

           He sees down into his bedroom; Mr. Whiskers and Bosco look 
           back up at him.  He plunks down next to the skylight and 
           tries to pry it open.  It doesn’t budge.

           Lisa hears Jerry lumbering around on the roof.

                        Yes!  Fine.  Fine!

           She reaches into her purse and pulls out a credit card.  She 
           slips it between the door and the jamb and slips it around, 
           up and down, back and forth.  It opens the latch.

           EXT. BOWLING ALLEY ROOF - NIGHT

           Jerry pounds on the skylight, growing angrier and more 
           frustrated by the second. He doesn’t hear Lisa.

           EXT. M LTUN BOWL NG LAN S - NIGHT

           Lisa pushes the door open an inch.

           She peers in.

           Just a messy apartment.  Nothing horrific on first glance.  
           And then -- the bedroom door pops open -- and Bosco bolts 
           straight at the door.

           BACK TO SCENE / EXT. M LTUN BOWL NG LAN S - NIGHT

           Bosco jumps on the door with both paws -- forces it open -- 
           runs onto the porch and charges straight at Lisa’s crotch, 
           jamming his nose right in to her pudendum for a long, deep 
           whiff.  He’s not talking -- he’s just a dog now. Lisa drops 
           her purse and grabs Bosco’s collar.

                                 LISA
                        Jerry!

           EXT. BOWLING ALLEY ROOF - NIGHT

           Jerry’s intensely focused on trying to pry open the skylight 
           and still doesn’t hear Lisa calling him.

                        on, let’s put you back in.

           Lisa, focused on handling the dog and not on her 
           surroundings, drags Bosco into the apartment.

           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Lisa drags the rambunctious Bosco through the apartment 
           toward the bedroom.  The apartment, now seen objectively, is 
           a bleak, horrific mess.  Blood is smeared in the least-
           expected places.  Clothes and rotting food are everywhere.  
           Lisa notices none of this -- she’s staring at Bosco --

                                 LISA
                        Come on.  Let’s go.  Boy -- come on 
                        -- going to put you back where you 
                        were -- let’s go --

           With her foot she pushes open the bedroom door, and then 
           enters.

           Lisa finally pauses long enough to see Jerry’s bedroom as it 
           objectively is, a filthy, freaky mess, Forty Year Old Virgin 
           meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  She is appalled.  It takes 
           her breath away.  She lets go of Bosco, who immediately jams 
           his nose back into her crotch.

           Lisa backs out of the bedroom into --

           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           And now, she sees.  The blood.  The mess.  The stains.  The 
           cat shit.  The dog shit.  The rotting food. The filth.  The 
           windbreaker mostly covering Chloe’s severed head except for 
           Chloe’s hair sticking out -- Lisa’s eyes go wide with fear -- 
           in spite of the size, the shape, the darkening oily 
           bloodstain, Lisa does not let herself believe what she sees.

           As Lisa backs out of Jerry’s apartment she collides with 
           Jerry, who is standing just outside the door.

                                 JERRY
                        Lisa, I can explain.

                        Jerry, Jerry, no.  I’m going to 
                        leave.  I shouldn’t have come in --

                                 JERRY
                        This is not me.  I mean this is not 
                        what I’m really like.

                                 LISA
                        I apologize.

           She starts for the door.  Jerry, embarrassed and overwhelmed, 
           cuts off her progress.

                                 JERRY
                        No.  No.  Lisa -- I -- I -- give me 
                        a chance to explain --

           Lisa backs into the apartment, as Jerry walks toward her.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        I’m basically a good person.  I try 
                        to do the right thing.  I’m not a 
                        bad guy.  And, Lisa, I think I love 
                        you.

                        Noooooo!

           Jerry’s eyes are filled with the shock of seeing one’s 
           secrets splattered open for all the world to see, a deep and 
           epic humiliation beyond anything he’s yet experienced, as in 
           one instant the woman who moments ago believed he was a big 
           sweet guy now knows for certain he’s a psychotic killer.

           Lisa SCREAMS.

           Jerry hyperventilates.  Mr.  Whiskers jumps up on the couch 
           and begins yelling at him --

                        Don’t wuss out now!  If she gets 
                        away the whole world will know, the

           Lisa runs down the stairs.  Jerry chases her.

           Lisa gets to her car -- no purse, no keys.  She looks up -- 
           her purse is on the landing.  There is no traffic.  No 
           people.  She is all alone with Jerry, and he’s coming after 
           her like a freight train.  Lisa races into the field next to 
           the parking lot, running for her life.

           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

           Lisa runs at top speed.  Jerry pursues.  She gets to the end 
           of the field.  Looks both ways.  To her right is a ravine.  
           To her left, a thicket of trees.  She races for the ravine.

           Lisa skillfully darts down the ravine.  Jerry’s right behind 
           her.  Low-hanging branches scrape across her face and scratch 
           up her skin but she’s tough and keeps at it.  Jerry is right 
           behind her.  He stumbles.  Jerry crashes down the steep 
           ravine, falling onto Lisa.

           It’s a hard landing.

                                 JERRY
                        Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.

           Jerry pulls himself up.  He’s a fucked-up mess.  He looks at 
           Lisa.  She’s got a compound fracture to her left femur, bone 
           sticking out, blood everywhere, and is going into shock.

                                 LISA
                        Jerry.  Help me.  Please.

           He stares at her for a long, uncomfortable time.  Tears 
           stream down Jerry’s face as he leans over Lisa’s broken body.  
           He kisses her on each cheek.  She’s terrified.

                                 JERRY
                        Lisa -- I love you.

           And then, Jerry strangles Lisa.  It takes a long time.  And 
           after she’s dead, he lies down next to her body and weeps.

                        You seen Lisa today?

                        She’s not answering her phone, 
                        either.

                                 DAVE
                        She went out with that weird guy 
                        Jerry from shipping.

                                 ALISON
                        They were seeing each other.

                        What’s there to know?

           He hands her a Post-it.

           INT. ALISON’S CUBICLE - DAY

           Alison’s computer screen shows the Milton News headline, 
           “Local Boy Charged in Murder of Mother”, next to a picture of 
           young Jerry.  She’s appalled.

           EXT. M LTUN BOWL NG LAN S PARKING LOT - TWILIGHT

           Alison drives into the bowling alley parking lot and parks 
           her Subaru next to Lisa’s car.  She gets out.  Walks to 
           Lisa’s car.  It’s locked.  She peers inside.  She heads 
           toward the outdoor stairway that leads to Jerry’s apartment.  

           INT. JERRY’S KITCHEN - TWILIGHT

           Jerry is hung over, hair askew, shirt stained, ten-o’clock 
           shadow.  He dumps some dry dog food into the dog bowl, then 
           dumps out a can of cat food into the cat bowl.  As his pets 
           eat he opens the fridge and pulls out a carton of milk, 
           stopping briefly to stare at the two severed heads on his top 
           shelf before swigging milk straight from the carton.

           He closes the fridge, opens a can of tuna, and starts eating 
           right from the can.  Bosco abruptly stops eating --

                                 BOSCO

           Bosco races into the living room.  Jerry puts down his tuna 
           and follows Bosco; Mr. Whiskers pretends to be indifferent, 
           but then can’t help himself and races after them.

           INT. JERRY’S LIVING ROOM - TWILIGHT

           Bosco’s freaking out; even Mr. Whiskers is a little excited.

                                 BOSCO

                        don’t pee yourself.
                            (to Jerry)

           Jerry peers through the peephole in the door.

           Alison climbs the stairs to Jerry’s apartment.

           Jerry watches through the peephole.

           Alison is standing right outside the door.

           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT - TWILIGHT

           Jerry opens the door.  He stares at Alison until --

                                 ALISON
                        Hi.

           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - DAY

           Jerry opens his fridge to get some milk, reaching past three 
           heads: Chloe’s, Lisa’s and Alison’s.  Boscoe stares at him. 

                                 BOSCO
                        Hey, Jerry.

                                 JERRY
                        What?

                                 BOSCO
                        Remember last week, you said 
                        there’s an invisible line that 
                        separates good from evil, and you 
                        thought you’d crossed it.  And I 
                        said, “no!  you’re a good boy!”  
                        Remember? 

                                 JERRY
                        Yes, I remember.  So what?

                                 BOSCO
                        I’ve changed my opinion.

                                 JERRY
                        Now you think I’m evil, Bosco?

                                 BOSCO
                        I’m certain of it.  

           Bosco walks away, leaving Jerry to consider this judgment 
           against him from his dog.  He is, after all, still holding 
           Alison’s severed head.  Mr. Whiskers pads across to Jerry-- 

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Welcome to my world, Jerry!  

                                 JERRY
                        I’m not sure I want to go there.

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        You’re already there. Fuck the dog.  
                        Become what you’re meant to become.

           Jerry thinks about this, then puts Alison’s head into his 
           refrigerator, on the shelf below Chloe’s and Lisa’s heads.  
           Jerry stands back admires the heads.  For a long time they 
           are perfectly immobile on the refrigerator shelf.

           Then, Chloe opens her eyes, followed by Lisa, then Alison; 
           color returns to their cheeks; they wake up.

           Chloe’s severed head winks at Jerry.

                                 JERRY
                        What do you think I should do, 
                        Chloe?

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD
                        You can’t go back to work, but you 
                        can’t stay here, either.  Maybe 
                        now’s a good time to see if the cat 
                        knows what he’s talking about.

                                 ALISON’S SEVERED HEAD
                        She’s right.

                                 LISA’S SEVERED HEAD
                        I totally agree.

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Me-ow to that!

                                 JERRY
                        You think I should just go kill 
                        people for no reason?

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        For the pleasure it brings.

           Jerry thinks about it.  Closes the fridge.  Looks at Bosco’s 
           big sad eyes.  Then at the cat, who is happier than ever.

           EXT. M LTUN BOWL NG LAN S PARKING LOT - DAY

           Jerry chains Alison’s car to the bumper of his F-150.   
           Lisa’s car is parked next to it.

           EXT. RIVER BANK - A FEW HOURS LATER - DAY

           Jerry’s F-150 is parked at the river.  He unchains Lisa’s car 
           from the bumper.   Nearby, Alison’s car is parked on the 
           muddy river bank.   Jerry walks to the rear of Alison’s car 
           and tries to push it into the river.  It rolls forward a few 
           feet then sinks.

           Jerry revs his truck’s engine, then engages the transmission, 
           shoving Lisa’s car into the river.  He watches it sink.

           Dr. West sits at her desk filing government paperwork.

           Some CLUNKING and then the door opens and Jerry enters.  His 
           boots are muddy and his eyes are wild.

                                 JERRY
                        Hi.

                        Jerry, what’s wrong?

                        I have a lot of stuff I have to

                                 DR. WEST
                        What happened?

                                 JERRY
                        I stopped taking the drugs.

                                 DR. WEST
                        What?  Why?

                        Urrrr, no.  Kind of.  Mr. Whiskers 
                        did the talking -- but it was 
                        really me.  See?  I’m making 
                        progress.  It’s not the cat!  I

                        I’m sorry Dr. West!  Forgive me!  
                        I’m bad.  I’m an asshole.

                                 DR. WEST
                        Don’t be so hard on yourself.  I 
                        appreciate the honesty.  I’m

                        Uh, it is.  Kind of like that.  
                        Kind of like that, times three.

                        What are you saying, Jerry?

                        Three people, um, who aren’t alive 
                        any more.  Because of me.

                        Oh my God.

           On sensing the danger, Dr. West becomes very calm; aware 
           she’s with a killer, she doesn’t want to set him off.  But 
           underneath, she’s terrified and looking for escape.

                                 JERRY
                        But I feel terrible about it.  I 
                        need to tell someone.

                                 DR. WEST
                        Tell me.  Jerry?   I’m listening.

           As she listens, Dr. West reaches below her desk and -- out of 
           sight of Jerry -- pulls a cell phone out of her purse.  

                                 JERRY
                        So everyone was conga-ing and then 
                        I Danced-to-the-Music with that 
                        French girl, Chloe, right?  And 
                        then we were supposed to go to 
                        Chen’s Chinese Restaurant, okay?  
                        And then -- what are you doing?  
                        Dr. West!  

           Jerry stands, and sees that Dr. West has her cell phone in 
           her hands.  Jerry pulls it away from her --

                                 911 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        Nine one one what is the nature of 
                        your emergency?

                                                       DR. WEST
           Sorry.   Wrong number.
                                            Help me!  I’m being held 
                                            hostage.

                        What’s the matter ma’am? 

           Jerry takes her phone and smashes it under his boot.  Then he 
           yanks the land line out of the wall.  He puts Dr. West in a 
           headlock and lifts her up to her feet.

                                 JERRY
                        It was an accident!  I liked all of 
                        them and wish they were all alive.
                        Do you have any packing tape?

                                 DR. WEST
                        What?  Why?

           Jerry keeps Dr. West in a tight grip as he rummages through 
           her desk, pulling out drawer after drawer until he finds some 
           wide packing tape.  

                                 JERRY
                        I can’t let you go.  But I still 
                        need a lot of therapy.

       123-A
           EXT. M LTUN BOWL NG LAN S  -- DAY
                                                                  123-A

           A rusty Chrysler pulls into the parking lot and stops.  Dave 
           from Personnel gets out; he’s wearing full rain gear and 
           carries an umbrella.  He’s terrified.  Slowly Dave walks up 
           the stairway toward Jerry’s door.  He knocks and is answered 
           with FURIOUS BARKING and SHRILL MEWING.  

                                 DAVE
                        Alison?  

           No answer, except for animal noises.  He tries the door.  
           It’s unlocked.  He opens the door part way; Bosco immediately 
           RACES OUT, growling.  Dave backs against the porch railing 
           and drops his umbrella.  Dave’s getting soaked.

           Bosco is too weak to attack.  He humps it down the stairs, 
           then into the field.  Bosco’s followed shortly by Mr. 
           Whiskers, who runs right past Dave.

           Dave leans in the door; the stench is overpowering.  He gets 
           one glance inside and sees enough.  He staggers back down the 
           stairway, and throws up.  

           EXT. JERRY’S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY - STORM

           Jerry parks his truck at the edge of the fallow cornfield 
           with a view of the farmhouse where he was raised.   In the 
           storm, the weeds, the decrepit home and Jerry’s truck take on 
           an ethereal beauty.

           INT. JERRY’S TRUCK / CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY - STORM

           Jerry sits in the driver’s seat, talking to Dr. West, who is 
           bound and gagged with packing tape in the passenger seat.

                                 JERRY
                        We don’t have much time so we have 
                        to get into the big issues. 

           Dr. West nods.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Do you believe in God?

           Dr. West nods.
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 94.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        So do I.  But I think He has it out 
                        for me.  He cuts everyone else 
                        slack and then He shit all over me.  
                        And I want to know why.

           Dr. West shakes her head, like she disagrees.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Why would God put a little boy in a 
                        home with a father like that?  And 
                        make my mother lose herself so 
                        completely she wanted to die?

           Dr. West shrugs.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know either.  But if He is 
                        all-powerful, God must be okay with 
                        me killing people.

           Dr. West shakes her head in violent disagreement.  

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Ha!  A shrink who wants to talk.

           She smiles weakly and nods.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll untape you but only if we get 
                        the fast-track to mental health.  

           She nods.  Jerry reaches into the back of the truck.  Pulls 
           out a Swiss Army Knife.  Opens the scissor tool and carefully 
           cuts through the tape binding Dr. West’s mouth.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Start doing the silent shrink thing 
                        and I can’t predict what I’ll do.

           She nods her consent.  He gently pulls off the tape.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get into it.  Question one: 
                        God.  And why he made me, me.

           It is the psychotherapeutic command performance of all time, 
           and West gives it her all:
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 95.

                                 DR. WEST
                        Okay.  God.  I think, the world and 
                        everything in it and the way things 
                        turn out -- is God’s will.  A God 
                        so large we can only understand him 
                        indirectly.  We can comprehend his 
                        intentions only in hindsight.

                                 JERRY
                        The fatalistic hopeless God.  

                                 DR. WEST
                        No, not really.  See, God realized 
                        that people needed someone to lead 
                        by example, to walk the walk. 

                                 JERRY
                        You’re talking about Jesus?

                                 DR. WEST
                        Yes.  Jesus is God-like perfection, 
                        but on a scale humans can 
                        understand. 

                                 JERRY
                        Like -- bowling a perfect game? 

                                 DR. WEST
                        Possibly.  Sure.  Like that.

                                 JERRY
                        That kind of works for me.   God -- 
                        perfection.  Jesus -- same thing, 
                        but on a scale we can understand.

                                 DR. WEST
                        Yes.

                                 JERRY
                        We did God in forty-five seconds.  
                        Now: why do I hear voices?

                                 DR. WEST
                        A lot of people hear voices.  Or 
                        thoughts they can’t stop.

                                 JERRY
                        A lot of people?
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 96.

                                 DR. WEST
                        Yes.  It might be a voice telling 
                        them that they’re worthless or 
                        stupid.  It could tell them to 
                        indulge every desire -- drink that 
                        drink, take that drug, follow every 
                        sexual impulse.  Or it might be a 
                        cynical voice that says nothing 
                        matters, telling them that their 
                        efforts are insignificant.

                                 JERRY
                        Do you hear things like that?

                                 DR. WEST
                        I have thoughts.  Not exactly the 
                        same as you, but close enough.  
                        When I’m afraid or insecure, I have 
                        thoughts telling me I’m fat, that 
                        psychotherapy isn’t a worthwhile 
                        endeavor, that it’s not “real”.    
                        These voices tell me I should have 
                        aimed higher than a government job,   
                        that my potential was squandered 
                        ... and that I’m unworthy of love.

                                 JERRY
                        But none of that is true.  What do 
                        you do about it?

                                 DR. WEST
                        I can’t shut it off entirely -- nor 
                        would I want to -- but I can argue 
                        against it.  Just because you have 
                        thoughts, doesn’t mean you have to 
                        act on them.

                                 JERRY
                        I don’t have to act on them ... 
                        That’s it.  This is like ten years 
                        of therapy in ten minutes.  

           Jerry starts up the truck.

                                 DR. WEST
                        Where are we going?

                                 JERRY
                        Home.  Feed my pets.  I think I can 
                        handle them now.  As long as I 
                        don’t obey then.

                                 DR. WEST
                        What are you going to do with me?

                                 JERRY
                        I don’t know.

           A tear rolls down Dr. West’s cheek.

           INT. MILTON TOWNSHIP POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

           Dave BUZZES a buzzer at the bullet-proof window.  A rookie 
           DESK CLERK crosses to the window.

                                 DAVE
                        I’d like to report an emergency.

                                 CLERK
                        What kind of emergency?

                                 DAVE
                        A murder.  Maybe more than one.

           The Clerk stares at Dave as if he’s kidding.  He’s not.

           Jerry carries Dr. West, fireman style, over his shoulder up 
           the stairs to his apartment.  The door is flapping open.

           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jerry puts Dr. West -- hands and feet bound -- on the couch.  
           She SCREAMS.

                                 DR. WEST
                        Jerry oh my God what have you done--

                        Let me go for God’s sake -- what 
                        are you going to do -- what are you 
                        going to do?

                                 JERRY
                        I told you I don’t know what I’m 
                        going to do.

                        Wait here.  My pets need me.  

           Jerry grabs a roll of electrical tape and seals up Dr. West’s 
           mouth once again; then leaves.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Jerry wanders the woods, yelling:

                                 JERRY
                        Mr. Whiskers!  Bosco!  Mr.

                        Whiskers!  Bosco!  Boscooooo!

           As Jerry clears a tree, he’s nearly knocked down by Bosco, 
           bounding happily toward him.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Bosco!  Thatta boy!

           Jerry kneels down in the mud and lets Bosco lick the rain off 
           of his face.  

                                 BOSCO
                        I love you I love you I love you I 
                        love you Jerry I love you.

                        I love you too Bosco.  Come on boy.  

           Jerry grabs Bosco’s collar and tows him out of the woods.

           No response.

                        I’m cold I’m wet I’m hungry.

                                 JERRY
                        I know you are boy.

           Jerry hauls Bosco up the stairs and into the apartment.

           Mr. Whiskers is standing on top of the fully restrained Dr. 
           West, staring into her terrified eyes, when Bosco and Jerry 
           walk in the door.  Mr. Whiskers looks at them --

                                 MR. WHISKERS 
                        Hey losers.

           Bosco walks to Dr. West and jabs his nose right in her 
           crotch, backs up and shakes himself dry on her, and then 
           licks her face.

                                 MR. WHISKERS (CONT’D)
                        Is this the bitch you’ve been

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Knowing your track record, I give 
                        it, maybe, an hour until you kill 
                        her.

                                 JERRY
                        I’m not going to kill her.

           CLOSE ON DR. WEST’S FACE staring up --

           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT - REALISTIC VIEW - NIGHT

           We enter Dr. West’s realistic point-of-view, where the 
           apartment is filthy and the animals can’t talk (and are 
           disgusting).  But Jerry’s still speaking in English.

                                 JERRY
                        You’re the sickest cat in the 
                        world, saying shit like that.

           The cat just MEWS; it’s a real cat.  

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        I am not going to cut her throat.  
                        I will not kill Dr. West. 

           The cat MEWS again.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        I hear you.  And I’m going to 
                        ignore you, Mister Whiskers.  

           Dr. West is straining to say something.  Jerry walks into the 
           kitchen and returns with a large knife.  There’s still a 
           little blood on it.  He holds it up to Dr. West’s throat -- 
           and cuts the tape around her mouth so she can talk.

                                 DR. WEST
                        Oh my God.

                                 JERRY
                        You’re welcome.

           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

           And now we’re back in Jerry’s point of view, the skewed 
           universe we’ve been seeing for most of the movie.

                                 DR. WEST
                        Jerry, I’m scared.

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        She wasn’t scared last week when 
                        she threatened to send you back to 
                        the slam!  

                                 JERRY
                        What do you want?

                                 DR. WEST
                        I want to make a call.

                                 MR. WHISKERS 
                        She’ll call the cops.

                                 JERRY
                        You’ll call the cops.

                                 DR. WEST
                        No!  I just don’t want to be alone.

                                 JERRY
                        Okay, I got an idea.

           Jerry walks to the kitchen, followed by Bosco and Mr. 
           Whiskers.  Opens the fridge.  

                                 CHLOE’S SEVERED HEAD
                        Bon jour, Jerry.

           Jerry picks up Chloe’s head by the hair and carries her out 
           to the living room.  Dr. West is apoplectic; nearly in shock 
           as Jerry sets the talking severed head on the coffee table so 
           it faces Dr. West.  We still see what Jerry sees.

           Dr. West faces the severed head and SCREEEEEAAAMS.

           Chloe’s severed head SCREAMS back.

           Mr. Whiskers and Bosco SCREAM right along with them.
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 102.

                                 JERRY
                        Bosco!  Mr. Whiskers!  Dr. West!  
                        Chloe!  Cut it out!  SHUT!  UP!

           One by one, they quiet down.  Just then, Jerry sees BLUE AND 
           RED lights flashing across his window -- just for an instant.  
           Then it stops.  Mr. Whiskers bounds over to the window; so 
           does Bosco.  

                                 BOSCO
                        Something weird Jerry.

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        I got a bad feeling about this Jer.

           Jerry crosses to the window and looks out --

           EXT. M LTUN BOWL NG LAN S -- NIGHT -- JERRY’S P.O.V.

           Half a dozen black and white cop cars are arrayed along the 
           perimeter of the bowling lane parking lot; several more are 
           rolling in behind them, lights off.

           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           Jerry freezes in place.  His cat, his dog, his 
           psychotherapist and the severed head of his first victim look 
           at him with worried anticipation.

                                 JERRY
                        It’s the cops.

           Mr. Whiskers, Bosco, Dr. West and Chloe all nod.

                                 BOSCO
                        Cops.  Cops everywhere.  Grrrrr.

                                 JERRY
                        I have a plan.
                            (to Dr. West)
                        You did the best you could.  It’s 
                        not your fault.

                                 DR. WEST
                        What are you going to do to me?

                                 JERRY
                        Nothing.
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 103.

           He picks up Mr. Whiskers and holds him tight, then heads for 
           the bathroom.  Bosco follows behind him.

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Put me down put me down I’ll claw 
                        your eyes out God damn it put me 
                        down you fucking psycho.

           Jerry ignores him.  They go into the bathroom.  Jerry slams 
           the door behind him.  Dr. West is left alone on the couch, 
           still taped up. 

           INT. JERRY’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Jerry sets down Mr. Whiskers, who climbs onto the sink; Bosco 
           sits next to the toilet.  Jerry stands in the bath tub.  At 
           the end of the tub is an access panel, which he opens.  
           Inside, the building infrastructure is revealed: pipes, 
           framing, and electrical conduit.  

           Mr. Whiskers races past Jerry and bolts into the crawl space, 
           disappearing into the dark.

                                 BOSCO
                        This is your whole plan?  To go 
                        into the bowling alley?

                                 JERRY
                        It’s the best I’ve got.

                                 BOSCO
                        Okay, buddy.  

           Jerry picks up Bosco and shoves him through the access panel.  
           Bosco’s none too happy about it --

                                 BOSCO (CONT’D)
                        Easy, Jerry!  I can’t go in there!  
                        Help.  This is awful.  Jerrrrry!

           And then Bosco’s gone.  Jerry ducks into the cramped 
           crawlspace after Bosco, and jams himself in.

           INT. CRAWLSPACE - NIGHT

           The crawlspace expands into an attic; one side is used for 
           storage; 
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 104.

           on the other, twenty-six mute pin setting machines wait in 
           vain for bowlers.  Bosco is nervously walking around sniffing 
           things; Mr. Whiskers is nowhere to be seen.

                                 JERRY
                        Come on, boy.

           Jerry leads Bosco to the door at the end of the crawlspace.  
           They go through.

           INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT - REALISTIC VIEW - NIGHT

           Dr. West, hands and feet bound, looks around in disgust at 
           the apartment, and especially at the rotting severed head 
           that’s across from her on the coffee table.  She swallows her 
           disgust and rolls off the couch onto the floor, inadvertently 
           knocking into the coffee table.  The head falls off. 

           Dr. West keeps her shit together and crawls toward the 
           telephone across the wretched, foul floor to the phone.

           Reaching for the phone, Dr. West knocks the receiver off of 
           the cradle.  With her nose she presses 9.  Then 1.  As she’s 
           reaching for the final 1, all hell breaks loose.

           The DOOR explodes open --

           A CYLINDER is hurled in and fills the room with tear gas.

           A dozen STATE POLICE in gas masks storm the room and take up 
           positions, ready for a full-on confrontation.

           Dr. West, terrified, tears streaming down her face, yells --

                                 DR. WEST
                        I’m here!  Don’t hurt me!  

           A FEMALE COP, in an alien-looking gas mask, kneels next to 
           Dr. West and puts a Kevlar-wrapped hand on her shoulder.

                                 FEMALE COP
                        It’s going to be okay.

           Dr. West just stares.

           INT. M LTUN BOWL NG LAN S  -- NIGHT

           While Bosco and Mr. Whiskers watch, Jerry finds the light 
           panel and flips a few switches.  Most of the old fluorescent 
           tubes flicker eerily but provide little useful light.  Many 
           of the lanes have been used for storage, of furniture, 
           clothes, boxes -- junk.  Jerry keeps flipping switches, and 
           many of the ancient pin-setting machines grind to life.

           Then, a brilliant light shines down on Lane 11.  A bowler, 
           obscured by junk, throws a strike.  The ball comes back to 
           him, and Jerry is drawn to Lane 11 as if by a tractor beam.

           There, a man dressed head to toe in white robes, with long 
           dark hair and a beard, winds up to throw the ball again --

                                 JERRY
                        Jesus?

           It is indeed Jesus.  And He doesn’t want to be interrupted; 
           He puts a finger to His lips, for Jerry to be quiet.  Jerry 
           looks at the automated scorekeeper and realizes: the savior 
           of all mankind is one strike away from a perfect game.

           Jesus winds up again.  Releases the ball.  Jerry, Bosco and 
           Mr. Whiskers watch transfixed as the ball rolls down the lane 
           and -- it’s a strike.  Jesus throws a celebratory fist in the 
           air -- 300!  Bosco and Mr. Whiskers stare in awe.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        That’s a perfect game.  So You 
                        really are Jesus?
                            (Jesus nods)
                        Wow, You’re a good bowler.

                                 JESUS
                        Thanks, Jerry.  

                                 JERRY
                        You’re much heavier than I thought.

                                 JESUS
                        My Father’s genes.

                                 JERRY
                        Oh.  I feel better now that You’re 
                        here.  We have something in common. 
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 106.

                                 JESUS
                        Hardly!  I’m the Son of God, and 
                        you’re a serial killer.

                                 JERRY
                        I meant, bowling.

                                 JESUS
                        Bowling?  Bowling makes up for you 
                        killing four people?  As King of 
                        Kings I hear some pretty crazy shit 
                        but that’s gotta take the cake.

                                 JERRY
                        I only killed three people.  Three 
                        and a half if you include my mom.

                                 JESUS
                        You killed your mother -- it should 
                        count double!  And, since I am all 
                        knowing: you never bowl, anyway.  
                        Look at this place.  It’s a wreck.

                                 JERRY
                        I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

                                 JESUS
                        Shut up.  I know, you’re sorry.  Do 
                        you want to be forgiven?

                                 JERRY
                        Sure -- what do I have to do?

                                 JESUS
                        You have to be willing.  Can you 
                        forgive yourself? 

                                 JERRY
                        I think so.

                                 JESUS
                        Then it’s done.  Can you forgive 
                        others?  Like your stepfather? 

                                 JERRY
                        No.  Not him.
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 107.

                                 JESUS
                        If you can’t cut some slack to the 
                        guy who raised you, even if he 
                        botched the job, how can you expect 
                        forgiveness from people you killed?

                                 JERRY
                        I hadn’t thought of that. 

                                 JESUS
                        It’s important.  He’s right there.

           Jesus points to the hard plastic seats at the end of the 
           alley, where Mack sits, nursing a beer.   

           Jerry walks towards his stepfather, and takes the seat next 
           to him.  Mack bristles.

                                 JERRY
                        Mack?

                                 MACK
                        I always worried you’d wind up like 
                        this, Jerry.  I wasted my life.  I 
                        didn’t want you to waste yours.  
                        But -- here you are.  A worthless 
                        piece of shit just like me.

                                 JERRY
                        Jesus!  He’s still a dick.

                                 JESUS
                        He is who he is.  His life wasn’t a 
                        picnic -- and he never killed 
                        anyone.  If you want peace you have 
                        to forgive him.

           Jerry turns to Mack and stares him straight in the eye.

                                 JERRY
                        You did the best you could.

                                 MACK
                        Yeah, I guess so.  Thanks, psycho.

           Mack wanders off into the darkest part of the bowling alley; 
           as soon as he disappears, Mr. Whiskers bounds out, and jumps 
           on Jerry’s lap.  Jerry pets his cat while Jesus watches.

                                 JERRY
                        Why did you put me through this?  
                        This life of hell on earth? 

                                 JESUS
                        It’s part of the bigger picture 
                        that you cannot understand.  Trust 
                        Me, there are no mistakes.

                                 JERRY
                        How is it possible that a guy who 
                        hears voices and kills women is not 
                        a mistake?  

                                 JESUS
                        Incomprehensibility is its own 
                        virtue.  The mystery of life 
                        enshrouds man at all times and must 
                        be accepted on its own terms.  Your 
                        deeds shed light on the world, 
                        because they are senseless.

                                 JERRY
                        I don’t follow that.

                                 JESUS
                        Me neither.  We’ll never fully 
                        understand -- that’s My point!  

                                 JERRY
                        Okay.  One more thing: am I going 
                        to survive this night?

           Jesus shrugs.  Jerry knows what that means.

           EXT. M LTUN BOWL NG LAN S  -- NIGHT

           The parking lot is filled with police cars, an ambulance, and 
           lots of state police.  

           INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

           Dr. West, freed of her bonds, a blanket around her shoulders, 
           debriefs Detective Weinbacher.

                                 DETECTIVE WEINBACHER
                        We believe he’s in the bowling 
                        alley.  Do you think he’s armed?
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 109.

                                 DR. WEST
                        I don’t know.

                                 DETECTIVE WEINBACHER
                        Then have to assume he is.  We’ll 
                        be entering with maximum force. 

                                 DR. WEST
                        Please don’t hurt him.  He’s ill.

                                 DETECTIVE WEINBACHER
                        Our first priority is our own 
                        safety.  

           Off Dr. West --

           EXT. M LTUN BOWL NG LAN S  -- NIGHT

           A dozen state police pull on body armor and adjust their 
           weapons as Detective Weinbacher them gives final directions:

                                 DETECTIVE WEINBACHER
                        On my count, two of my guys will 
                        breach the east wall to insert 
                        explosive distraction devices.  Do 
                        not enter until the building is 
                        fully secured.  Is that clear?

           The cops all nod their consent.

           EXT. M LTUN BOWL NG LAN S -- MINUTES LATER -- NIGHT

           Two cops rush away from the bowling alley; moments later 
           HISSING GAS inside is followed by an EXPLOSION.

           Weinbacher keeps his hand up -- don’t go in -- 

                                 FEMALE COP
                        It’s on fire, sir.

                                 DETECTIVE WEINBACHER
                        Wait.  Let him come out.

           Dr. West and the cops and the ambulance attendants and half a 
           dozen onlookers watch helplessly as flames spread within the 
           bowling alley.  Through the filthy windows they can see the 
           fire quickly ignite everything that can burn.
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 110.

                                 DR. WEST
                        My God, do something!

                                 DETECTIVE WEINBACHER
                        Fire department’s on the way.  
                        Jerry controls the situation.  He 
                        can exit the building at any time.

           The downstairs of the bowling alley burns brightly.  A WINDOW 
           blasts out, propelled by a torrent of flame.  The pillar of 
           fire recedes and is followed by a backdraft which 
           turbocharges the horrific conflagration.

           INT. M LTUN BOWL NG LAN S  -- NIGHT

           Flames burn bright.  Jerry’s on the ground, choking on the 
           dark smoke.  Mr. Whiskers races around frenetically, like a 
           balloon that’s deflating; Bosco runs in worried circles. 

           A secondary explosion spreads relentless flames and grim 
           smoke through the bowling alley.

           Jerry’s breathing is increasingly labored as smoke fills his 
           lungs.  He stops breathing, and he’s utterly motionless.  

           The camera moves toward Jerry, getting closer until his face 
           fills the screen: it’s utterly immobile and gray.  Hold for 
           an uncomfortably long time on him, so long you may think the 
           movie is over.  And then hold some more.  Because it’s not.  

           As we stay on Jerry’s face, music begins to play: the intro 
           to Dance to the Music.  The light changes, and color returns 
           to Jerry’s face.  His eyes POP open.  And we pull out.  And 
           everything has changed.

           INT. MILTON LANES - JERRY’S FINAL REVERIE - NIGHT

           The bowling alley is as good as new -- better than new.  The 
           bright flashing lights and shined floors are hyper-real, as 
           glossy as the stage from an excellent, elaborate rock show.  
           Multicolored sparklers ignite; mylar confetti drifts down.

           The thick black smoke is now stage fog.  Busting through the 
           door are twenty state police; but not the brutes who stood 
           outside.  No, these are cool and sexy dancers, ten men and 
           ten women in stunning cop-like outfits that render them 
           awesomely fabulous.  When they throw off their gas masks, 
           their hair and make-up are spectacular.
               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 111.

           Behind them, a stage rises from the floor, holding Sly and 
           the Family Stone, circa 1969, at the peak of their beauty and 
           musical prowess.  Sly gestures for Jerry to stand up.   

           Jerry leaps to his feet.  He’s got a great new haircut; and 
           he’s wearing an astonishing sequined rock star version of the 
           clothes he had on before.  Behind the cop dancers are Mack, 
           Jerry’s mother, Lisa, Chloe and Alison, lively and healthier 
           than they ever looked when they were alive. 

                                 JERRY
                        Mom!  Dad!

                        Alison?

                                 ALISON
                        Oh yeah!

                        Sorry I killed you guys!

           Jerry smiles at his parents, and Chloe, Lisa and Alison, and 
           the cops, and Sly and the Family Stone.  Then, Jesus emerges 
           from the mist, and He throws another strike.

                                 JERRY

               THE VOICES /  Production Draft #4  / December 18, 2012 112.

                                 JESUS
                        Hi, Jerry!

                                 JERRY
                        Thanks for coming.

                                 JESUS
                        Wouldn’t miss it for the world.

                                 JERRY
                        Are my pets going to be okay?

           Bosco and Mr. Whiskers, idealized to the highest standards of 
           beauty that a dog and cat can achieve, step forward. 

                                 JESUS
                        You betcha!  

                                 JERRY
                        Hey there, Mr. Whiskers!  Hey 
                        there, Bosco!

                                 BOSCO
                        Hi, Jerry!  You’re a good boy!   

                                 MR. WHISKERS
                        Let’s get it on!  Dance, people!

           Jerry and his parents, Mr. Whiskers and Bosco, Lisa and Chloe 
           and Alison, Jesus, and the state police line up, and they 
           dance together, finding the connection in death that they 
           never enjoyed in life, a unified dance troupe of loving 
           friends and family in Jerry’s insane oxygen-deprived mind, 
           exuding togetherness, beauty, and joy.

                                                            FADE OUT:
