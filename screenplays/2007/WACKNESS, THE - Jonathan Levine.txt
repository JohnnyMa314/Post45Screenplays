                    DR. SQUIRES’ OFFICE - DAY

           A wood-paneled Park Avenue doctor’s office.  Fancy framed 
           stuff on the walls.  

           LUKE SHAPIRO, 17, clad in Girbaud jeans, visor and pocket t, 
           sits across from DR. JEFFREY SQUIRES, 40, who wears a v-neck 
           sweater and khaki pants.  

           Silence passes between them as they sit awkwardly.  Then:

                                 LUKE
                        I don't get to lie on the couch or 
                        nothin'?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Would you like to lie on the couch?

                                 LUKE
                        Is that a trick question?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Why would you think that?

                                 LUKE
                        No reason.
                             (beat)
                        I'll stay right here.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        So, what’s on your mind, Luke?

                                 LUKE
                        Nothing.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Well--

                                 LUKE
                        I mean, I guess I can make 
                        something up.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Fine.  Make something up, then.

                                 LUKE
                        OK.  Let's see.  I’m having trouble 
                        -- getting laid.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Common problem.  How old are you 
                        again, Luke?

                                 LUKE
                        Old enough to be getting laid.  And 
                        getting older every day.
                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Have you ever gotten laid?

                                 LUKE
                        Two years ago I fucked Katie 
                        Randall in Battery Park, but she 
                        had drunk two 40's and the cops 
                        came and broke us up before we, 
                        before I, busted--

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        So she was drunk?

                                 LUKE
                        She weighs, like, sixty pounds and 
                        she drank 2 40 ounce bottles of 
                        Crazy Horse.  You do the math.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Crazy Horse?

                                 LUKE
                        Look, Dr. Squires--

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Call me Jeff.

                                 LUKE
                        Look, Jeff -- Dr. Squires -- how 
                        much do you need?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        You're the one who needs this.

                                 LUKE
                        How much?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        A quarter.

           Luke digs into his backpack, pulls out some bags of weed:

                                 LUKE
                        I can give you two eighths.  It's 
                        the same--

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I can do the math, Luke.

           Luke holds on to two baggies, puts the rest back.

                                 LUKE
                        Here you go.
                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        That entitles you to another--
                             (checks his watch)

                                 LUKE
                        Forty-eight minutes.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Forty-eight minutes.  If you leave 
                        now, you're getting ripped off.

           A beat.  A skeptical glance from Luke.  Then,

                                 LUKE
                        I’m not really feeling all this 
                        feeling shit today, Dr. Squires. 
                        Maybe some other time.

           He puts his backpack on, turns to leave.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        If you want to talk, Luke, you know 
                        where to find me.

                                 LUKE
                        And if you wanna smoke...

           Dr. Squires looks at him, nods.

                                 LUKE
                        Tell Stephanie I say whassup. And 
                        tell her she owes me.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                             (pulls out a bong)
                        Uh-huh.

                                 LUKE
                        You ever feel kind of like a fuck-
                        up, you know, buying weed from the 
                        same guy who deals to your 
                        daughter?

           Dr. Squires takes a big bong hit, exhales into a paper towel 
           roll.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Stepdaughter.

                                 LUKE
                        Stepdaughter.  Exactly.  Later, Mr. 
                        Squires.

           Luke lets the door close behind him, but before it does:
                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I'm a doctor, Luke!

                                 LUKE
                             (to himself)
                        Dr. Squires.

           Luke examines the people in the waiting room, waiting.  He 
           shakes his head.  Suckers.

           And Tribe Called Quest’s “Check the Rhyme” drops on the 
           soundtrack.

           Luke rolls up one pantleg, and hops on a bike, puffing away 
           at a cigarette.  As he moves through the flaring sun, 
           voiceover:

                        Once upon a time -- 1994 to be 
                        exact -- on an island called 
                        Manhattan, lived a kid named me...

           Now, illustrations our hero, riding his bike through 
           Manhattan.  The pictures feel classic, like Eloise at the 
           Plaza.

                        Luke Shapiro.  Aside from the fact 
                        that I sell weed, there’s nothing 
                        much remarkable about me. And even 
                        the drug thing’s just a cry for 
                        help, really.

                    SUBWAY DAY

           Luke sits on the subway, holding his bike, bobbing his head 
           in his headphones. 

                                 LUKE (V.O.)
                        But there’s so much more to me than 
                        just dealing weed.  I am a true 
                        life person, with likes and 
                        dislikes.  For instance, I like 
                        summer.  I like the summer stench 
                        that I smell in the subway.  I like 
                        alliteration (I learned that shit 
                        in Latin class).  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LUKE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        I like seeing the sweaty girls on 
                        the train in short skirts and 
                        sometimes I like seeing their 
                        panties, when I can see 'em.

           Luke stares at a BORIQUA sitting across from him.  She 
           crosses her legs, he leans forward to get a glimpse.  She 
           crosses them back.

                                 LUKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I like fly ladies.  I like tank 
                        tops.  I like short skirts.  I like 
                        my impure thoughts.

           A thought bubble floats out of Luke’s head.

                                 LUKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Do you know what I would do to 
                        them?  Well, first I'd roll them a 
                        big blunt, and they would be very 
                        impressed with my blunt-rolling 
                        skills which are, in a word, mad 
                        impressive.  And then I'd put on 
                        some music--

           Luke pulls his headphones out of his Walkman.  Music fills 
           the subway car.

           ANGLE ON the subway car in its entirety.  It is filled with 
           FLY LADIES, all dressed in the same white tank top and short 
           skirt.  In the center, tables covered with fancy tablecloths, 
           meticulously interspersed with glasses of red wine.  Luke 
           gets up and begins walking through the subway, avoiding the 
           tables, addressing the audience:

                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                        And they'd start to move their 
                        heads. And then their long fucking 
                        legs.  And now, they leap up from 
                        their seats cuz they're filled with 
                        a sensation--a seriously sinful 
                        sexual sensation that makes them 
                        drip inside and all they're 
                        thinking is Shapiro, Shapiro, 
                        Shapiro.

           The female-filled subway car leaps to its feet in jubilation.  
           Girls dancing with each other, to rap music, mouthing 
           "Shapiro," holding their hands between their legs, riding 
           subway poles, etc.

           Then, a DING:

                                 SUBWAY CONDUCTOR
                        Watch the closing doors.

                                                       BACK TO REALITY.
           The subway car, moments later.  Typical subway crowd.  Doors 
           slide open.  Teeming masses in suits pile in. 42nd Street.  
           Luke just stares ahead, looks at a couple men in suits.

                    LUKE'S HOUSE DUSK

           Luke walks his bike through the front door, leans it against 
           the wall. The apartment is small, well-decorated, messy.  

           MOM and DAD yell at each other, animatedly, in the living 
           room.  Luke walks right between them, headphones still on.  

                                 LUKE (V.O.)
                        Mr. And Mrs. Shapiro are my 
                        parents.  I guess they were in love 
                        once, but I can’t quite figure out 
                        how. Thing is, one-on-one, I like 
                        them just fine.  It's cool to say 
                        you don't like your folks, but I 
                        really don't mind 'em.  What I do 
                        mind is them yelling at each other 
                        24/7.  That I fucking mind a lot.

           Luke enters his room, closes the door, gives it the finger.  
           He takes off his shirt, splashes some Nautica cologne on his 
           neck, and puts a new shirt on.

                                 LUKE (V.O.)

                        much money these days, but he's a 
                        workaholic just the same.  I hardly 
                        see the guy, which is all right by

                                 TELEPHONE SPEAKERBOX
                        Yeah, hold one sec.

                        I do.

           A sentimental sigh from the crowd, and the chapel rises to 
           their feet.  The Bride wipes tears away.

                                    DAY

           Luke opens a mini-fridge, pulls out a big brick of weed.  He 
           weighs some out, puts it in a little baggie.

                                 LUKE
                        Dad's a true businessman, an 
                        entrepreneur and shit.  which sucks 
                        cuz he has to wear a suit, but 
                        which is cool for him, I guess, 
                        because he feels successful.  He 
                        mostly stays out of my business, my 
                        dad does.  I think he might even 
                        know I’m dealing, but he never 
                        tried to bother me about it much.

                        I mean, it’s the 90’s.  Dealing 
                        weed isn’t exactly a capital 
                        offense.

                    KITCHEN - DAY

           Luke opens the fridge.  It’s bare.  He begins snacking on the 
           few items that are there: celery, pie, etc.

                                 MOM (O.S.)
                        I can make you a sandwich.

           Luke turns, sees his mother:

                                 LUKE
                        Cool.

                                 LUKE (V.0.) (CONT’D)
                        My moms is cool too.  I talk to her 
                        sometimes about, you know, the 
                        issues facing the American teenager 
                        and whatnot.

           INT. LUKE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Luke sits in his room, meticulously weighing out portions of 
           marijuana on a digital scale. He places them into baggies. 
           Next to the weed, the yearbook, open to a picture of Luke and 
           JUSTIN, taken several years ago. Both of them wear sports 
           uniforms, backwards, like KRISS KROSS.

                                 LUKE (V.O.)
                        I have exactly no friends, unless 
                        you count Justin, who is my best 
                        friend by default.  

           Luke’s pager vibrates.  He checks it:

                                 LUKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        You’ll see how sad that is in just 
                        a second.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT

           Luke, wearing headphones, is on the lookout while JUSTIN, 17, 
           skinny, shaved head, in Triple Fat Goose and hooded 
           sweatshirt, catches a tag on a wall:

                                 LUKE
                        I still don’t understand why you’re 
                        tagging your own block.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Cuz I want everybody to know it’s 
                        mine.

                                 LUKE
                        Yo, I think you just drew over that 
                        kid Kato’s tag.  He’s in the 
                        Decepticons.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Fuck Kato.  That herb’s like 12

                        I gotta bounce, Shapiro.

                                 LUKE
                        Where you going?

                                 JUSTIN
                        Party.

                                 LUKE
                        Cool.  Can I go with you?

           Justin thinks for a moment.  Then:

                                 JUSTIN
                        No.
                                 LUKE
                        I understand.

                                 JUSTIN
                        See you tomorrow, Shapiro.  I’m 
                        Swayze.

                                 LUKE
                        Peace.

           And Justin’s gone.  

           And Luke steps up to the wall, brandishes a marker.  He is 
           writing next to Justin’s tag, when:

                                 KATO (O.S.)
                        Shapiro!

           Luke turns around, sees KATO, 15, a small Asian kid wrapped 
           in a sea of North Face.  Behind him, his BOYS, all similarly 
           young and small.

                                 LUKE
                        Kato.  Hey.

                                 KATO
                        Sup? You got beef?

                                 LUKE
                        No, Kato.  No beef.  No beef 
                        whatsoever.  I’m practically a 
                        vegetarian.

           Kato steps forward.  Quickly, Luke turns, starts to RUN.

           But before he can, they’re on top of him--pummeling him with 
           a flurry of Timberland boots and prepubescent fists.

                                 LUKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        If you’re ever in a position to 
                        take a beating like this, the best 
                        thing to do is curl up in a ball 
                        and cover your head.  You’d be 
                        surprised how little this kind of 
                        shit hurts. Just collapse into the

                    LUKE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Luke watches The Robin Byrd Show.  On TV, a girl dances in 
           front of a neon heart.  He holds a beer to his swollen eye.  
           A trickle of blood drips from his lip.

           He puts his hand down his pants 

           On TV, the stripper slides off her panties and reveals,

           A COCK.

           Luke spits out his beer, flips the TV off. 

                                                                 BLACK.

           Graduation day. Luke, clad in CAP and GOWN, deals to UNION, a 
           16-year-old with white-girl dreads:

                                 LUKE 
                        You’re lucky it’s so much weight.

                        Cool.

           She pulls some money, hands it over.  Luke slides the bills 
           into his pocket.  He eyes Union up and down, steels himself:

                                 LUKE
                        Listen, Union, now that I’m 
                        graduating--
                                 UNION
                        Oh my God!  You’re graduating!  
                        That’s so amazing. I’m totally 
                        jealous.

           Luke looks down at his outfit:

                                 LUKE
                        Uh, right.

                        So, like, now that I’m graduating--
                        you think maybe we could, you know, 
                        chill?  Maybe go see a movie or 
                        smoke out and play video games or 
                        listen to Phish or, like, whatever 
                        you do?

           Union looks at him sadly:

                                 UNION
                             (lying)
                        Yeah. Sure. I have your number...

                                 LUKE
                        That’s cool. I mean, I was just 
                        asking.

                                 UNION
                        Yeah. Totally.

           They look at each other for an awkward beat.  Then:

                                 LUKE
                        OK. I should run, I guess. Peace, 
                        Union.

                                 UNION
                        Peace, Luke.

           Luke hops on his bike.  As, once again, the beat drops.

           And Union calls after him:

                                 UNION (CONT'D)
                        Congratulations again!

           EXT. GRADUATION - CONTINUOUS

           The graduation ceremony is in full swing.  A HEADMASTER reads 
           names at a lectern.  
           In the crowd, MR. AND MRS. SHAPIRO, Luke’s parents, late 
           40’s, nervous.  Their son is nowhere to be seen.  As Luke’s 
           classmates approach the stage to receive their diplomas we

           INTERCUT with:

           Luke delivering weed, in his graduation gown, to people 
           across Manhattan.   All of them, the graduates and the 
           potheads, framed in portraiture, their faces mixed and 
           matched. 

           As the Headmaster intones name upon name. Until we arrive at--

           EXT. LAGUSTUS POMONA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Luke, sweaty. He rides his bike up to an ornate brick 
           building. He pulls out a chain, ties the bike to a lamppost, 
           and hauls ass up the stairs.

           EXT. GRADUATION - CONTINUOUS

           The Headmaster continues to read names: Preston, Rothchild, 
           Samuels... 

           Luke’s Mom looks up, anxious.

                                 HEADMASTER
                        Shapiro.

           Luke’s nowhere to be seen.  His parents sweat.

                        Shapiro?

           Suddenly, Luke BURSTS onto the stage. His parents breathe a 
           sigh of relief.  

           Luke trips, falls into the Headmaster, who hands him a 
           diploma.

           Luke walks downstage, opens it proudly. 

           But there’s nothing inside.

           EXT. LAGUSTUS POMONA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           The Shapiro family stands frozen.  A perfect picture.  
           Through a gritted smile, Luke speaks:

                                 LUKE
                        Noticed there was no diploma...
                                 DAD
                        I just owe the school a little 
                        money, Lucas. Let’s not let it ruin 
                        a magical day.

           Luke shoots his dad a look, as a flashbulb POPS.

           And Luke walks off, grabs an hors d’oeuvre.  In the 
           background, “It’s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday”.

           Dr. Squires approaches, just as a couple TEENAGE GIRLS walk 
           by.  He follows them with his eyes:

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        It’s enough to make you want to be

                        Oh, great.  Here’s my wife.

           Here’s MRS. SQUIRES, in her early 40s. She looks like it 
           takes every ounce of her energy to maintain her frigid 
           beauty. She puts her arm through Dr. Squires’.  He kisses her 
           cheek.

                                 LUKE
                        And here’s your daughter.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Stepdaughter.

           STEPHANIE, 17. She’s beautiful, in a party dress, smoking a 
           cigarette and, somehow, walking in SLOW MOTION.  Luke stares 
           at her, worshipful.

           Then:

                                 LUKE’S DAD (O.S.)
                        Lucas?  Aren’t you going to 
                        introduce us?

           Luke looks at his Mom and Dad:

                                 LUKE
                        Right.  Mom, Dad.  This is

                        Congratulations, Shapiros.  You 
                        must be so proud.

                        little flower graduated Come 
                        Loudly, no?

           Stephanie looks down, shakes her head.

                                 MRS. SHAPIRO
                        How lovely!  You just missed Cum 
                        Laude, didn’t you, dear?

                        I was busy with my after-school 
                        activities, ma.

                        Yes, Mrs. Shapiro, your son has 
                        many extra-curricular activities.

                                 MR. SHAPIRO
                        What are those, Luke?

                        The yearbook staff seems to have 
                        neglected to note your 
                        achievements.

           Luke, in suit and tie, sits around a table with his parents 
           and two OLDER PEOPLE.  The OLD MAN holds up a glass:

                                 OLD MAN
                        Congratulations, Luke. To your 
                        future.

           They toast.

                                 OLD MAN (CONT'D)
                        So--what’s next for you, Luke?

                                 LUKE
                        I start college in the fall.

                                 OLD MAN
                        And then?
                                 LUKE
                             (not understanding)
                        And...then?

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Your career, Luke.  What are you 
                        going to do?

                                 LUKE
                        From what I can see, it doesn’t 
                        really make much difference.  They 
                        all seem kind of the same.

                                 DAD
                        Nothing could be further from the 
                        truth, Luke.  

                                 LUKE
                        You’re right, dad.
                             (to Old Man)
                        I’m thinking about getting into 
                        music.

                                 MOM
                        This is the first I’ve heard of 
                        that.
                             (to Older Couple)
                        Luke’s very good at math.

                                 DAD
                        Exceptional.

                                 LUKE
                        Yes.  Yes I am.
                             (beat, to Older Couple)
                        I’m thinking about becoming a 
                        mathematician.

           The Older Couple nod.  Luke’s dad looks at him, confused.

                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                        I mean, a banker...

           The older man furrows his brow.

                        A fireman.

           They’re now completely confused.

                        Good form tonight, Lucas.  A true

                        I don’t care.

                    SOHO APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The entryway of a Soho apartment building.  Luke stands up 
           straight, smooths out his hoodie, rings the doorbell.  Before 
           its chime has even finished, the door swings open.  

           On the other side, Justin, a cigarette dangling from his 
           mouth. Behind him, the commotion of a party.

                                 LUKE
                        You paged me?

           Justin looks from side to side:

                                 JUSTIN
                        Get in here.

                    BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Justin waits anxiously as Luke sifts through his backpack, 
           pulling out a couple different-sized bags of weed:

                                 LUKE
                        I didn’t know there was a party 
                        tonight.

                                 JUSTIN
                        It’s a graduation party.

                                 LUKE
                        I just graduated.
                                 JUSTIN
                        Yeah.  I know.

                                 LUKE 
                        So, can I grab a beer or something?

           Justin looks at him for a beat:

                                 JUSTIN
                        Naw, man.  They can’t see you here.

                                 LUKE
                        Why not?

                        Cuz you weren’t invited.

                        But I’m your friend.  You invited 
                        me.

           Justin looks through his wallet:

                                 JUSTIN
                        I don’t have inviting privileges.  
                        I’m lucky to be here myself.

                        Just take it.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Yeah, man.  I told you, Rollo and I 
                        are going to Europe to try to bang 
                        American art history students.

                                 LUKE
                        You never told me that.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Yes I did.

                                 LUKE
                        And you’re gonna take it on the 
                        plane?
                                 JUSTIN
                        I’ll put it in my shoe.  They never 
                        check that shit.

           Luke’s pager vibrates. He checks it:

                                 LUKE
                        Can I at least use the phone?

                                 JUSTIN
                        Come on, man.  No offense, but if 
                        anyone sees me here with you, I’m 
                        never gonna get laid--

                                 LUKE
                        Uh-huh.

                                 JUSTIN
                        I really appreciate it. 

                                 LUKE
                        No problem.

                        Well, have a nice summer, I guess.

           Luke starts to exit:

                                 JUSTIN
                        Wait.  I’ll check if its clear.  

           Justin opens the door, exits.  

           Leaving Luke, just standing there.  He stares at himself in 
           the mirror.

           The door opens. Stephanie on the other side:

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Oh.  Shapiro.  Sorry.

                                 LUKE

                        maybe?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        From what?
                                 LUKE
                        I’m not sure.

           Stephanie pulls out a pill and an ATM card, starts to cut up 
           a line:

                                 STEPHANIE

           Stephanie snorts.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        You got a cigarette?

           Luke hands her a pack of cigarettes.  She pulls one out, 
           lights it, offers the pack back to him.

           Luke shakes his head.

                                 LUKE
                        Quit.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        You quit?

                        Think so.  I just quit.

           Steph shrugs.

                        You feel different?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Nope.

                                 LUKE
                        Me neither.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        We have our whole lives to feel 
                        different, Shapiro.

           Steph checks herself in the mirror, pulling her shirt tight, 
           pushing her tits out, smoking away:

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                        What’cha doin’ after tonight?

                                 LUKE
                        You know what I'm doing.  I'm going 
                        to hippie school.
                                 STEPHANIE
                        I mean for the summer.

                                 LUKE
                        Chillin.  Making money.

                        Why?  You wanna go steady?

                        Yeah.  Sure.

           Silence.  Then:

                                 LUKE
                        What are you doing?  For the 
                        summer?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I’m interning for one of daddy’s

                                 STEPHANIE
                        That’s confidential.  But he runs

                                 LUKE
                        That’s awesome.  Congratulations.
                             (beat)
                        So I guess we’ll both be here all 
                        summer, huh?  All alone.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Yeah, but we’ll never hang out.  

                                 LUKE
                        Oh.

           They look at each other.  Awkward silence:

                                 STEPHANIE
                        You know, now that you’re at the 
                        party, you may as well stay--

                                 JUSTIN (O.S.)
                        Don’t go putting thoughts in his 
                        head.

           Justin appears in the doorway.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Come on, Justin.  It’s fine.

           Luke looks at Justin with pleading eyes.
           EXT. NEW YORK ROOF - NIGHT

           A big banner reads, CONGRATULATIONS CLASS OF 1994.  Music 
           blares, and everyone dances close.  Everyone, that is, except 
           Luke. He’s perched on the water tower, high above.

           He lights a roman candle, fires it off the roof.

           And, through the smoke, the crowd MORPHS:

           Into a Bacchanalian spectacle: the Garden of Earthly 
           Delights.  Young, nude, and fucking.  All of them.

           Luke looks at them, rubs his eyes.

                                                       BACK TO REALITY.

           Luke’s POV:

           His classmates dancing, talking, drinking, smoking.  He scans 
           the crowd.  As we pass each individual, we see Luke’s 
           impression of their conversation, in SUBTITLES at the bottom 
           of our screen.

           Rollo, laughing, to a girl: “Shapiro’s never gonna get laid.”

           Justin: “I can’t believe he actually stayed.”

           It continues like this, as we pass over various teenagers, 
           until we reach Stephanie.  She looks up.

           And Luke, locking eyes with her.  All his lust focused into 
           one bittersweet gaze.

           Luke: “I love you.”

           And Steph stands there for a moment, looks at him.  A 
           subtitle begins to form beneath her, until 

           Rollo approaches, obliterating the half-formed words, 
           replacing them with his own: 

           “Yo--let’s fuck.”

           EXT. ROOF - DAWN

           Luke sits on the roof, smoking a joint.  Next to him, a 
           couple kids grope at each other.  And over there, a kid 
           throws up.  

           Beneath, the City that Never Sleeps does just that.

           Luke tosses the joint over the side, pushes himself up.
           INT
                    APARTMENT   - DAWN

           Luke walks out into the hallway, rings for the elevator.  

           The door opens, 

           And there’s Justin, getting his dick sucked by a TEENAGE 
           GIRL.  

                                 LUKE
                        I’ll take the stairs.

           Right before the doors close:

                                 JUSTIN (O.S.)
                        Have a good summer, Shapiro!

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - NIGHT

           Luke catches a tag on a building, walks on.

           INT
                    ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           Luke rides in an elevator.  He looks at himself in the 
           display panel.

           INT
                    LUKE'S HOUSE NIGHT

           Luke quietly enters.  He walks past his pops, who lies, 
           illuminated by the light of the TV, asleep in his suit.  Luke 
           turns the TV off.

           INT
                    PARENTS’ ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Moms is asleep on the bed, also in her clothes, watching the 
           same TV program.  Luke turns the light, and the TV, off.

           INT
                    LUKE’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

           The next morning--well, the next afternoon.  

           NY1 on the TV: all New York news, all the time. In the bottom 
           of the screen, a display.  The time, 1:59, the temperature, 
           92 degrees. 

           Luke lies in bed, eyes open. His alarm goes off. He looks at 
           the clock: 2:00 PM.
           INT
                    LUKE’S LIVING ROOM
                                        DAY

           Luke wipes his eyes, enters the living room, where

           His DAD, in a suit, is on the phone, speaking with some 
           urgency:

                                 DAD
                        I don’t have it. No, I didn’t say I 
                        won’t have it, I said I don’t have 
                        it right now. I’ll have it soon, 
                        though. How soon? I can’t answer 
                        that.  
                             (whispers)
                        You want me to beg, I’ll beg. 
                        Please bear with me.  I have a 
                        family. Please. Yes. That seems 
                        reasonable.  Very reasonable.  
                        Thank you...

           Luke walks past him into the

           KITCHEN

           He pours himself a glass of orange juice.  In the background, 
           the phone call continues. 

           His mom enters.  She looks like she hasn’t slept:

                                 MOM
                        You’re not going to eat breakfast?

                                 LUKE
                        I’m not hungry.

                                 MOM
                        You have to eat something, honey.  
                        You’ll waste away.

           Luke downs the OJ quickly, looks at his mom: 

                                 LUKE
                        I gotta run.

           He walks to the front door.  From the other room:

                                 MOM
                        Where are you going?

                                 LUKE
                        Someone’s gotta work around here.
           INT
                    BASEMENT - DAY

           Luke lifts several barrels of flavored ice into a vendor’s 
           cart emblazoned with the words: DELICIOSO COCO HELADO.  

           Finally, one last CONTAINER.  He opens it:

           It’s filled with bags of WEED.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Luke rolls the Italian Ice cart past the Merry-Go-Round. 

           There’s a boombox attached to it.  Music blares.

           MONTAGE:

           At the bottom of our screen, the temperature and time, a la 
           NY1.  

           Luke DEALS to various customers in Central Park, scooping 
           bags of weed from his cart.  

           He sells to hippies in the meadow, kids uptown, older folks 
           by the zoo.  At each location, the temperature and time 
           change on our display, until we reach...

           INT. DR. SQUIRES’ OFFICE - DAY

           Luke sits across from Dr. Squires.  Silence. Then:

                                 LUKE
                        Dr. Squires, can you, like, 
                        prescribe medicine and shit?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Of course, Luke.  

                                 LUKE
                        Cuz some people--psychiatrists--

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Psychologists.

                                 LUKE
                        I’ve been researching it.  They 
                        can’t.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Well, I can, Luke.  Why do you ask?
                                 LUKE
                        It’s for me.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        No shit.

                                 LUKE
                        Well, I think, recently, that I’m 
                        depressed.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Recently?

                                 LUKE
                        For the last 3 years or so.
                             (beat)
                        I don’t sleep good.  And, I think--
                        I think too much.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        You ever hear the saying the 
                        unexamined life is not worth 
                        living?

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah.  Maybe the examined one isn’t 
                        either.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Don’t talk like that.
                             (beat)
                        Does this have anything to do with 
                        Kurt Cobain?

                                 LUKE
                        The point is, who says it all has 
                        to be so sad like that, you know?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Is something going on, Luke...at 
                        home?

                                 LUKE
                        Of course something’s going on at 
                        home.  This is what you get paid 
                        for?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Perhaps you’d be better off seeing 
                        a psychic, Luke.

                                 LUKE
                        I don’t really want to talk about 
                        it.
                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Men do the things they need to do 
                        to become the men they want to be.  
                        Do you understand?

                                 LUKE
                        Sure.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        That includes asking for help.
                             (beat)
                        Lucas, do you know what I would 
                        give to be you again?  Not you, 
                        specifically, but me at your age?  
                        It doesn’t get any better.

                                 LUKE
                        Please tell me that’s not true.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        You’re fucking living, Luke.  It’s 
                        a great thing, living. Get your 
                        heart broken.  Find yourself face 
                        down in the gutter.  Get your pulse 
                        up.  Make a true mess of yourself, 
                        son!

                                 LUKE
                        That what you tell all your 
                        patients?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        You’re not depressed, Luke.  You’re 
                        sad. There’s a difference.

           Luke looks at him:

                                 LUKE
                        And what about you?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        What about me?

                                 LUKE
                        Are you depressed or sad?

           Dr. Squires holds the lighter to his bong:

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I’m both.

                    DR. SQUIRES’ HOUSE - EVENING

           ...Exhales. Smoke fills Dr. Squires’ meticulous Fifth Avenue 
           home as he pulls pulls at a joint, watching TV.  On the 
           screen, Rudy Giuliani holds a press conference:

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        This guy’s going to ruin the city.

           His wife enters, getting undressed.  She’s gotten her shirt 
           off, revealing a black lace bra beneath.

                                 MRS. SQUIRES
                        He’s cleaning up the city.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Yeah, well--I like it dirty.

                                 MRS. SQUIRES
                        Stop smoking grass, please.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        The kids call it weed.

                                 MRS. SQUIRES
                        Well, you’re not a kid.  So stop 
                        smoking it or I’ll call Mayor 
                        Giuliani and he’ll drag you 
                        downtown.

           Dr. Squires looks around:

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Couldn’t be much worse than this

           Luke puts a Nintendo game in the system, presses Power.  

           It doesn’t work.

           He removes the game, blows on it, inserts it again.

           “The Legend of Zelda” appears on the screen.  

           Luke moves around, stabbing monsters.

           EXT. DR. SQUIRES APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Bob Seger blares.  Dr. Squires sips a cocktail, looks from 
           his terrace onto Central Park.
           Now, the music cuts off.

           Dr. Squires turns, sees his wife, in her nightgown:

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I was listening to that.

                                 MRS. SQUIRES 
                        Do you have any of those pills 
                        left?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I just finished them.
                             (beat)
                        You OK?  What do you need?

                                 MRS. SQUIRES
                        I’d like some of those pills.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Yeah, they’re good. 
                             (beat)
                        Shouldn’t take too many, though.

                                 MRS. SQUIRES
                        Right.  Brush your teeth before you 
                        come to bed, please.  

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Sure.

           Dr. Squires walks back over to the stereo, turns the music 
           up.

                    LUKE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Luke lies on his bed, his pants around his ankles, Strech 
           Armstrong on the radio, Zelda on pause on the TV--and 
           Stephanie’s yearbook page open next to him.  

           It’s got pictures of Stephanie as a kid, and then a big one 
           of her as the fully blossomed teenage girl she has become.  
           With tits and stuff.

           The camera pans across the page, past yearbook quotes: 

           “It’s only life after all.” Indigo Girls

           As we pass each quote, a couple bars from the quoted song 
           play.  Then,

           “But now all we have is memories...” Mary J. Blige
           And now, pan over to the B&W shot of Stephanie herself.  
           She’s at the beach, wearing a tank top.  Luke looks at it, 
           intently:

           Suddenly, it fills with color.  The ocean begins moving 
           behind her.  And then, so does Stephanie.  She slides one 
           strap off her shoulder.

                                 STEPHANIE
                             (smiling)
                        What do you want from me, Luke?

           Luke’s hand moves down...

           LUKE’S POV: his own feet, his hand, stroking.  And, at the 
           foot of the bed, the beach, the sea -- and Stephanie.

                                 LUKE
                        I, uh, I don’t know...

                                 STEPHANIE
                        You can tell me.  After all, I’m 
                        just in your head.  Be honest...  
                             (beat)
                        Do you want to do dirty things to 
                        me?

                                 LUKE
                        I mean, no...not really...not 
                        especially dirty.  Just 
                        kinda...normal dirty.

           Stephanie lies down, her back on the sand...

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Do you want to fuck me?
                             (beat)
                        On the beach?  In the sun?

           Luke starts stroking faster.

                                 LUKE
                             (smiling)
                        May-be.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Touch my shoulder.  It’s warm.  
                        Slide your hand between my thighs. 
                        Come to the sun, Luke.  Come.  
                        Come.

           The flaring, vibrant sun.  Luke’s on the beach.  He stares 
           right into it.  Stephanie on top of him, riding.  Luke, about 
           to climax--

           Just then, a knock:
                                 DAD (O.S.)
                        Lucas.

           Luke sits up quickly, zips up, walks over the door, unlocks 
           several locks.

           He opens the door:

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah.

                                 DAD
                        Please turn off the air 
                        conditioner.  The electric bill is 
                        through the roof. 

                                 LUKE
                        But it’s 90 degrees out.

                                 DAD
                        Just do it, Luke.

           Dr. Squires looks in the mirror, rubs his eyes.  

           He brushes his teeth, opens the bathroom cabinet:

           A cornucopia of pharmaceuticals.  He grabs a pill bottle, 
           examines it:

           LITHIUM. He pops one.

           INT. LUKE’S ROOM - DAY

           Luke, eyes open in the morning light, his face coated with 
           sweat.  His feet are in his mini-fridge, which has been moved 
           to the bottom of his bed.  He stirs.

           INT
                    LUKE’S LIVING ROOM
                                        DAY

           Luke wipes his eyes, enters the living room, where

           His parents are yelling at each other:

                                 MOM
                        How am I supposed to live?  How am 
                        I supposed to function?

                                 DAD
                        You're not.
           When Mom notices Luke she storms towards him:

                                 MOM
                        Your father lost all our money.  We 
                        have to move to--I don't know, 
                        somewhere poor.

                                 DAD
                        Your mother and I are getting a 
                        divorce.

                                 MOM
                        Don't you dare tell him that.  
                        That's not even true.  That's not 
                        true, honey.

                                 DAD
                        Yes it is.  Your mother is a raving 
                        lunatic.  She's only with me for my 
                        money.  And I don't have any money 
                        now.

           Luke notices his Dad's face is all scratched up.

                                 LUKE
                        What's wrong with your face?
                             (to Mom)
                        What's wrong with his face?

           Mom looks down.

                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                        Did you fucking scratch him?

                                 MOM
                        He hit me.

                                 DAD
                        I did not, you lying bitch, but I 
                        will now.

           Luke turns to Dad:

                                 LUKE
                        You guys are acting like you're 
                        fucking twelve years old.

                                 MOM
                        Stop cursing.

                                 LUKE
                        Fuck off!

           Luke goes into his room.

           Luke, on his phone, stressed:

                        Well, can he see me today?  It’s

                             (beat)
                        OK.  Thanks.

           He hangs up, reaches under his bed, pulls out--

           A BOX.  Luke opens it.  It is filled with stacks of twenties.  
           Luke starts counting some out.

                    LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Mom watches TV, sullen, by herself.  Luke approaches her, 
           holds out a couple bills:

                                 LUKE
                        For dinner.

           She looks up at him, touched:

                                 MOM
                        I can’t take that from you.

           Luke drops it on the floor, walks out.

                                 MOM (CONT'D)
                        I love you, honey.

           And the door slams.

                                 LUKE
                        To bitch about your parents. It’s

                        anywhere, for that  matter.  I have

                        will even look at me, other than my 
                        mom. And my parents fight all the 
                        time. Basically, I’m just trying to 
                        get to college before I put a

                        I’m sorry, Luke. I can’t do that.

                                 LUKE
                        Well then, how do you suggest I

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I suggest you talk about it.  With

           EXT. DR. SQUIRES OFFICE - DUSK

           Luke exits Dr. Squires office, walks over to his ice cart, 
           begins to unlock it.  Just then, from O.S.:

                        Shapiro!  

           Luke looks, sees Stephanie coming home.  She’s walking a WEST

                        This is Jesus Christ.  From my

                        Uh, your stepdad paged me.

                        That guy smokes more weed than I 
                        do.

                        Dr. Squires?  Not really.  He gives 
                        me a ton of money, though.  But you 
                        should hear about some of the 
                        fucked up people who come into that 
                        guy's office.

                                 LUKE
                        He tells you that shit?
                                 STEPHANIE
                        Sure.

                                 LUKE
                        He's not supposed to tell you that.  
                        There's confidentiality.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Well, he does.  Like this one guy 
                        he sees is a chronic masturbator.

                                 LUKE
                        Uh-huh.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        The guy masturbates seven times a 
                        day. And even when he's drained his 
                        nuts, he just lies in bed with his 
                        hands in his pants.  He got fired 
                        from work because of it.  And one 
                        time, he started jerking off in Dr. 
                        Squires' office.

                                 LUKE
                        No way.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I don't think my mom likes him much 
                        either.

                                 LUKE
                        The masturbator?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Dr. Squires.

           Now, Jesus Christ lifts his leg, goes on Luke’s cart:

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                        Jesus Christ!  No!

                                 LUKE
                        It’s ok.

                                 STEPHANIE
                             (re: cart)
                        What is this thing?

                                 LUKE
                        Summer job.

           She looks at him, curious.

                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                        My cover.  For my parents.
           He opens the top, Steph looks inside.

                                 STEPHANIE
                             (genuine)
                        Cool.
                             (beat)
                        Hey, take my number, Shapiro. Call 
                        me some time.

                                 LUKE
                        Call you?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Yeah.

                                 LUKE
                        You mean, like, for weed?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        To hang out.  There’s no one else 
                        around. And it gets lonely in the 
                        city with no one to talk to.

           She gives Luke her phone number, and she walks away.

                                 LUKE
                        OK.  So, I’ll call you...

           But he’s talking to himself.

           INT. LUKE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Luke enters his house. It’s filled with cardboard boxes. His 
           dad is sifting through one:

                                 LUKE
                        What is this?

                                 DAD
                        Walkmen.  From Singapore. I got a 
                        guy who wants six thousand of 
                        these.

                                 LUKE
                        That’s good.

                                 DAD
                        Good? It’s great. Do you know how 
                        much money I stand to make?

           Luke picks up a Walkman, starts playing with it.

                                 LUKE
                        They don’t rewind.
                                 DAD
                        No?

                                 LUKE
                        I mean, there’s no rewind button. 
                        Just fast forward.

                                 DAD
                        So you fast forward and flip the 
                        tape. It’s the same as rewinding.

           Luke tries that.  The Walkman jams.

                                 LUKE
                        This one seems broken.

                                 DAD
                        Shit.

           Luke’s Dad examines the Walkman.

                                 LUKE
                        Most people use CDs now anyway.

           Luke enters his room, as his dad fumbles with the Walkman.

           INT
                    ELEVATOR - DAY

           Elevator doors swing open, reveal two large BLACK MEN.  With 
           UZIs.  They stand in front of what looks like an empty 
           gallery space, brightly lit with wood floors.

           They look at Luke with piercing red eyes.

                                 LUKE
                        Jesus, guys. A little dramatic, 
                        don’t you think?

           The men are unfazed.  Then, from OS:

                                 PERCY (O.S.)
                        Is that you, Luke?

                                 LUKE
                        It’s me.

           From behind the two large men, PERCY, a skinny black man in 
           sunglasses, an oversized Phillies Blunt t-shirt, and baggy 
           jeans, emerges:

                                 PERCY
                        Mr. Luke.  How you livin’, boy?  

                                 LUKE
                        Barely.
           They give each other a pound.

                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                        What’s with the heavy artillery?

                                 PERCY
                        Dis fucking Giuliani, man.  You 
                        can’t be too careful.

                                 LUKE
                        You’re gonna shoot Giuliani?

           Percy puts his finger to his lips, smiles:

                                 PERCY
                        Don’t tell nobody.

           INT
                    27TH STREET DRUG HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Percy stands behind a large bar in an empty room.  Luke sits 
           at the bar, drinking Coke from a straw.  Percy grabs a 
           remote, points it toward the stereo, turns it up, til it’s so 
           loud they both have to yell:

                                 LUKE
                        What is this?

                                 PERCY
                        Dis be the new shit, man.  Biggy 
                        Smalls.  

                                 LUKE
                        It’s dope.

                                 PERCY
                        Dis cat is gonna change the world, 
                        man.  

           Percy begins pulling giant bricks of weed from behind the 
           bar, laying them on the counter:

                                 PERCY (CONT'D)
                        So, today we got for your smoking 
                        pleasure: the bubble gum, the 
                        northern lights, and, of course, 
                        the purple haze.

           Luke stares off into the distance.

                                 PERCY (CONT'D)
                        Everyting OK, man?

                                 LUKE
                        Parental trouble.

                        What about dem?

                        They’re dicks.

                                 PERCY
                        I tell you, man.  You’re a kid, and 
                        you look at your parents, at the 
                        older generation, and how dem act, 
                        and you think, I’m never...I am 
                        NEVER...going to do the shit they

                        Not me.

           Percy laughs.

                                 LUKE
                        Thanks, Percy.

                                 PERCY
                        Now, how much you need?

           Luke hesitates:

                                 LUKE 
                        I need a little more this month,

                        you back once I unload it.

                                 PERCY
                        How much more?

                                 LUKE
                        Another 5 zs.

                                 PERCY

                        Luke.
                                 LUKE
                        Not really.  Just a lot of debt.

                        good for it.

                        what happens if you fuck me, Luke?

                        What?

                        You get fucked, Luke.

           Luke looks at him, nervous.

                                 LUKE
                        Thanks, Percy.

           Luke takes the weed from him, puts it in his backpack.

                                 PERCY 
                        OK, soldier.  You be careful out

                        looking at everyting and everybody.  
                        Even white boys like you.

           Luke walks away.

                                 LUKE
                        I’m always careful, Percy.

                                 PERCY
                        I know.  Dat why I like you.
                             (beat)
                        Luke!

           Luke turns around, Percy hands him a tape.

                                 PERCY (CONT'D)
                        It’s called “Ready to Die”.

           EXT. HELL’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Luke exits Percy’s den, looks across the street -- a sign: 
           “SHO-WORLD.  TIMES SQUARE’S LAST ALL NUDE PEEP SHOW.”
           INT
                    BOOTH - NIGHT

           Luke inserts a quarter into a slot, and a window slides up, 
           revealing:

           3 OBESE HISPANIC WOMEN.  They sit on little stools, eating 
           McDonalds.  Naked except for thongs.

           One of them walks over to Luke.

                                 OBESE HISPANIC WOMAN
                        You wanna pay me?  

                                 LUKE
                        For what?

           She sticks her tits through the window.

                                 OBESE HISPANIC WOMAN
                        Five dollars to touch.

           Luke fumbles through his pocket for a five, hands it over.  
           He begins to fondle her sweaty breasts.  He wipes the sweat 
           off on his pants.  She moves closer, until her breasts take 
           up the entirety of the window.  He plays with her faceless 
           nipples...

                                 DR. SQUIRES (O.S.)
                        What about women, Luke? 

           INT. DR. SQUIRES OFFICE - DAY

           Luke lies on the couch now:

                                 LUKE
                        They don’t like me.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Lucas, back when I went to school, 
                        drug dealers had no problem getting 
                        girls.  In fact, that’s why I 
                        always wanted to be one.

           Luke sits up, looks at the doctor:

                                 LUKE
                        Dr. Squires, were you popular in 
                        high school?

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        Well, I wouldn’t say popular, no.  
                        I wasn’t one of the cool kids if 
                        that’s what you’re asking.  I 
                        played baseball; I was a debater...
                                 LUKE
                        Did you ever want to kill yourself?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Not until much later.

                                 LUKE
                        Then you must have been popular. 
                        I’m not.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Surely there’s someone in your 
                        school, Luke...something?

           Luke looks at him:

                                 LUKE
                        Well, there is this one girl.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        That’s fantastic, Luke.  Who is 
                        she?  Does Stephanie know her?

                                 LUKE
                        Naw.  She, uh, goes to school 
                        downtown.

           FLASH: Luke, masturbating to Stephanie’s yearbook photo, 
           covers Dr. Squires’ face with his hand.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        So what’s the problem?

                                 LUKE
                        I’m not sure she’s so into me.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I can't imagine why, Luke.

                                 LUKE
                        Thank you.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Make her like you, Luke.  That's 
                        what I did with my wife.

                                 LUKE
                        How's you do that?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Feign disinterest. Not lack of 
                        interest, but disinterest.  Be a 
                        neutral party.

                                 DR. SQUIRES (cont'd)
                        Then, when you are least 
                        threatening to her, grab her and 
                        stick your tongue so far down her 
                        throat that she starts to gag from 
                        pleasure.

                                 LUKE
                        Can I grab her tits too?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Baby steps, Luke.

                                 LUKE
                        Right.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Pursue her, Luke.  You're the 
                        perfect age for it.  You haven't 
                        yet been systematically numbed to 
                        the allure of romance.  You still 
                        have your youthful--.

                                 LUKE
                        OK.  I got it.

                                 DR. SQUIRES 
                        Young men need sex, Luke. All men, 
                        actually.
                             (beat)
                        I can get you a hooker, if you’d 
                        like.

                                 LUKE
                        I was this close to respecting you.

           The doctor takes a bong hit, exhales.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Big mistake, Luke.
                             (beat)
                        Call your girl.

           Luke nods, opens the door.  Dr. Squires calls after him:

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        You don’t need medication.  You 
                        just need to get laid!

           Luke shrugs, turns around, and walks out, as the RECEPTIONIST 
           smirks.

           INT. LUKE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Luke sits on his bed, restless.  He pulls out the piece of 
           paper--
           With Steph’s number on it. He looks at it.

           EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT

           Dr. Squires sips a cocktail, looks down over Central Park.

           Beneath, a couple, walking through the park on a beautiful 
           summer’s night. 

           Dr Squires calmly throws a water balloon at them.  

           It splatters.  They run.

           Now, he picks up a phone book. He’s about to drop it when,

           The phone rings. Dr. Squires runs to it.

           INT. LUKE’S BEDROOM

           Luke sits, alone on the phone:

                                 DR. SQUIRES (O.S.)
                        Hello?

           Luke deepens his voice:

                                 LUKE
                        Oh.  Hello?  I’m looking for, um--

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Luke?

           A long pause.

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        Luke, is that you?

                                 LUKE
                        Dr. Squires?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        It’s OK, Luke. I know why you’re 
                        calling.

                                 LUKE
                        You do?

           Silence.

                        I can help, Luke. Let’s grab a 
                        drink.  I’ve got just the place.

           A pause.  A long one.  Luke thinks.  Then:

                                 LUKE 
                        OK.

           INT
                    DOWNTOWN BAR - NIGHT

           A dive bar, dotted with a few drunks.  Luke and Dr. Squires 
           sit at the bar.  Luke drinks a beer, Dr. Squires a whiskey.

                                 LUKE
                        It’s dead in here.

                                 DR. SQUIRES 
                        Strange.  This place used to be 
                        packed.
                             (beat)
                        The city’s not the same anymore, 
                        Luke.  It really used to be 
                        something down here. The girls, the 
                        drugs, the music--the fucking 
                        music.  Speaking of which...

           Dr. Squires gets up, goes to the jukebox.  “In the Flesh” by 
           Blondie plays.

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        What kind of music do you listen 
                        to, Luke?

                                 LUKE
                        Tribe Called Quest. Pharcyde. De La 
                        Soul.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        That’s rap music, right? I don’t 
                        know that stuff.

                                 LUKE
                        I’ll make you a mixtape. 

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I’d like that.
                             (beat)
                        Maybe I’ll make you one too.

                                 LUKE
                        What kind of music do you like?
                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I like old stuff.  Bob Seger.  
                        Bruce Springsteen.  Some classical: 
                        Brahms, Hayden.

                                 LUKE
                        Word.  Hayden’s dope.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        You’re serious?

                                 LUKE
                        No, Dr. Squires.  

                                 DR. SQUIRES 
                        Hey, Luke.  Why couldn’t Mozart 
                        find his teacher?

                                 LUKE
                        Why?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Because he was Hayden.

                                 LUKE
                        That’s not funny.  Buy me another 
                        drink, please.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                             (to bartender)
                        Another Bud, right here.

           Luke and Dr. Squires sit there, in silence, for a moment.  
           Then:

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        Lucas, I hate my wife.

                                 LUKE
                        I hate my parents.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I need to get laid.

                                 LUKE
                        We both need to get laid.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Luke, I’ve never cheated on my wife 
                        before.  Ever.  But I want to now.  
                        It is my mission. You have no idea 
                        how much I want to.  And not just 
                        because I want my face buried in 
                        the stinking soaked panties of some 
                        delectable young nubile.

                        Lucas, I need a whole lotta fixin.

           Luke looks at him.

           Suddenly, a group of LOUD TEENAGERS enters, all really drunk.  
           Luke looks over:

                                 LUKE
                        Union?

                                 UNION
                        Oh my God--Luke!

           Union approaches. She hugs Luke.

                                 UNION (CONT'D)
                        I can’t believe you’re here.  It’s 
                        been totally forever.
                             (beat)
                        We dropped in to look at all the 
                        weird old people.  Oh my God!  Wait 
                        one second!

           Union runs off.  Dr. Squires looks after her with wide eyes:

                                 LUKE
                             (to Dr. Squires)
                        Don’t even think about it.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        This is the mystery girl?

                                 LUKE
                        Naw.  But that don’t mean she’s 
                        fair game.

           Union returns with a tall, dorky looking blonde kid.  He 
           stumbles to the bar.

                                 UNION
                        Luke--this is Gruden.  My date to 
                        the Midsummer Night Cancer Ball. 
                        It’s for charity.

           Luke gives Gruden a pound.  Union whispers to Luke:
                                 UNION (CONT'D)
                        He’s from Rotterdam. He’s a joke.

           Luke nods.

                                 LUKE
                        Sup.

                        Gruden, I’m Hayden.

                        Like the classical guy?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Yes--I was named after him.  Mother 
                        said my soul represented the 
                        metaphysical embodiment of his most 
                        sublime chord.

                                 UNION
                        That’s so awesome.  Do you like the 
                        Grateful Dead?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Followed them for four years after 
                        college.

           Union is smitten.  Gruden throws up.

           The bartender arrives:

                                 BARTENDER
                        Hey!  You kids are too young to be 
                        in here.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Come on. They’re all 18.

           The bartender looks at him.

                                 BARTENDER
                        The drinking age is 21.

           Dr. Squires is skeptical.  Luke confirms this with a nod.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT

           Luke and Dr. Squires lead a parade of formally attired 
           teenagers down the street:

                                 DR. SQUIRES 
                        Since when is the drinking age 21?
                                 LUKE
                        Since forever.

           EXT. APARTMENT ROOF - NIGHT

           On the roof of a beautiful loft, kids drink, smoke, 
           freestyle, etc.  Gangstarr on the radio.

           In the corner, Dr. Squires talks to a couple KIDS, who roll a 
           blunt:

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        So this is called a what?

                                 KID 1
                        A blunt.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        A blunt.  I like that.

                    BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Luke, alone, stands in the corner.  He sips a beer, awkward. 
           Squires approaches:

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        What are you doing?

                        Well get out there and make 
                        something happen.

                        Talk to one of them, Lucas. That’s

                        Then you can get acquainted with 
                        them, you know, vaginally.

                    LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Luke, stoned, wanders around a party.  People are hooking up 
           everywhere.  Luke ambles on, muttering to himself:

                                 LUKE
                        Dr. Squires?

           Luke peeks into a bedroom, sees two young SILHOUETTES against 
           the wall, having sex.

                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                        Dr. Squires?

                        Wrong room, gaywad!

           Luke continues to wander.  

           He walks through the hallway, looks from side to side.  Then, 
           he hears something:

           Moaning.  From within the closet.

           Luke turns, swings the door open to find,

           Dr. Squires and Union, going at it.  Union is in her bra.  Dr 
           Squires has half of his shirt off.

                                 LUKE
                        We’re going.

           EXT. SOHO STREET - DAWN

           Dr. Squires and Luke walk:

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Luke, remember when I said I’d 
                        never cheated on my wife before?

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Total lie.

                                 LUKE
                        So, you gonna tell her?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Wasn’t planning on it.

                        Besides, she’s taken so many Xanax, 
                        I’d be surprised if she sees 
                        daylight today.

                        And what happened to getting fixed 
                        first?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Sometimes getting laid is getting 
                        fixed, you know?  Except for dogs.
                             (beat)
                        Break out that blunt.

           Luke pulls out a joint:

                                 LUKE
                        This is a joint.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I know that.

           EXT. TIMES SQUARE   - MORNING

           Dr Squires pisses against a wall.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        This city is a disaster, Luke.  
                        It’s not like it used to be.  It’s 
                        plastic.  It’s one big fucking 
                        Happy Meal.

                                 LUKE
                        Some people like Happy Meals.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Some people like the Yankees too, 
                        Luke.  It doesn’t mean they’re 
                        right.

           He zips up.

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        Look around you, Luke...
                             (beat)
                        Is this what you want for your 
                        mind?  For your life?  You want it 
                        to become like this city?  Sweep 
                        all those nasty things under the 
                        rug?  Make everything OK?
           They walk on, past a homeless person. Dr. Squires offers him 
           a hit of weed.  He declines.

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        He puts the homeless people in 
                        prison, you know that?  These 
                        people are sick, mentally.  And 
                        they’re being put in jail.  What do 
                        you think about that?

                                 LUKE 
                        Doesn’t seem right--

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        No.  No it doesn’t.  And that’s why 
                        I don’t want you on medication, 
                        Luke.

                        You may as well go open up a 
                        Starbucks in your brain.  Do you 
                        follow me?

                                 LUKE

                        Don’t jump at the quick fix.  This 
                        whole fucking city wants a quick 
                        fix...

                                 LUKE
                        Uh-huh.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Embrace your pain.  Make it a part 
                        of you.  You don’t want to be like 
                        them. I don’t want you to be like 
                        them.

                                 LUKE
                        So you’ve never taken that stuff?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Jesus, Luke. I’m on all of it. But 
                        I don’t want you to be like me 
                        either.

           Luke looks at him. They continue to walk.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        You know, sex is a drug too, Luke.  
                        More powerful than any synthetic 
                        pharmaceutical.
                                 LUKE
                        Is that why you go around trying to 
                        fuck little girls?

           Dr. Squires stops, looks at him:

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        No.  I did that because you were 
                        too much of a pussy to do it 
                        yourself.

           Luke ignores him, starts tagging a wall.  Dr. Squires looks 
           on, curious:

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing, Luke?

                                 LUKE
                        Taggin’ this wall.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Tagging? What is that? Some sort of 
                        teenage ritual?

                                 LUKE
                        I’m just kinda putting my stamp on 
                        the wall.  So people know I was 
                        here.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        That’s illegal, isn’t it?

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah.

           Dr. Squires reaches out his hand:

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        May I?

                                 LUKE
                        I guess.  Just be careful.

           And Dr. Squires grabs Luke’s sharpie.  He walks over to the 
           wall, neatly writes:

           DR. JEFFREY SQUIRES, M.D.

           Luke looks at it, smiles:

                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                        Excellent penmanship.

           Then:
                                 POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)
                        Hey!  You two!  Stop right there!

           Luke looks at Dr. Squires. Dr. Squires looks at Luke, and...

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        It’s a good thing I’m wearing 
                        these.

           Dr. Squires drops to one knee, pumps up his Reebok pumps:

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        Forrest Gump, Luke. Forrest Gump.

                        What are you talking about?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Running.

           Dr. Squires takes off.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Stop!

           The cops haul ass after Squires.  Luke just watches him.

           He doesn’t get far.

           INT. COP VAN - DAWN

           Luke, Dr. Squires, and an assorted menagerie of New York’s 
           Illest ride in the back of a patrol van.  Dr. Squires hollers 
           to the front:

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Who put you up to this, boys?  
                        Giuliani?  You guys got some kind 
                        of quota to fill?  Used to be, you 
                        could lick a sheet of acid, hold up 
                        a bank, and fuck a whore in Times 
                        Square without you fellas batting 
                        an eyelash. Now, one blunt and 
                        we’re thrown in the paddy wagon?  
                        This whole city is fucked.  We give 
                        you CHARACTER!

                                 HOMELESS GUY
                        Man, shut the hell up.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Come on, now, brother.  Join the 
                        revolution! 
                             (beat)
                        What are you in here for?
                                 HOMELESS GUY
                        I stabbed my wife in the pussy.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Oh.  Well--

                                 LUKE
                        Hey, maybe we should just keep this 
                        on the DL?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        The DL?

                                 LUKE
                        Quiet.

           INT
                    THE TOMBS - NIGHT

           Dr. Squires stands in the corner, taking it all in.  Luke 
           looks at him, furious:

                                 LUKE
                        What you got to smile about?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        This is fun.

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah. Real fun.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        At least I’m not stuck in that 
                        iceblock of a bed with my so-called 
                        wife--I’m fucking living. I should 
                        be so lucky to get the gas chamber.

                                 LUKE
                        I wouldn’t get your hopes up.  I 
                        don’t think misdemeanor possesion’s 
                        gonna merit the death penalty.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Fucking Giuliani.

           Suddenly, at the bars:

                                 COP
                        Squires, Shapiro.  You made bail!

           INT
                    TOMBS - MORNING

           Luke and Dr. Squires exit the cell to find,

           STEPHANIE, waiting for them, holding up a set of car keys.
                                 STEPHANIE
                        Hi, stepdaddy.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Hi, precious.

                                 LUKE
                        Hey, Steph.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Hey Shapiro.  Thanks for getting my 
                        stepfather thrown in prison. You’re 
                        quite an influence.

                                 LUKE
                        But--

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        It was my fault.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I know.
                             (beat)
                        What’cha doing now, Shapiro?

           Dr. Squires looks at her:

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Shapiro’s busy.

                                 LUKE
                        No I’m not.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Yes you are.

           Steph looks at both of them, funny.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Dr. Squires -- how about you take 
                        the car back to the garage and I 
                        won’t tell my mom about this whole 
                        little arrest thing?

           Dr. Squires looks at her, furrows his brow.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Don’t touch my daughter, Luke.

                           LUKE
                                                        STEPHANIE
           Stepdaughter.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Steph catches a tag on a park bench, as Luke passes her a 
           spliff:

                                 STEPHANIE
                        So what’s the deal with you and my 
                        stepdad? Are you guys, like, gay 
                        together?

                                 LUKE
                        We’re friends, I guess.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Weird.

                                 LUKE
                        Not really. He’s very immature.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Yeah, he and my mom fight about 
                        that all the time.

                                 LUKE
                        I know.
                             (beat)
                        We got more in common than you 
                        think, Steph.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Your parents too?

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah.

           EXT. UPTOWN POND - DUSK

           Luke and Stephanie sit over the water.  Luke stares at it, 
           intently.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        What you trying to do?

                                 LUKE
                        Find my reflection.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        It’s not in there.

                                 LUKE
                        No shit.  This water’s mad dirty.
                                 STEPHANIE
                        So, why did we never hang out in 
                        high school?

                                 LUKE
                        Cuz I was a loser, I guess.  Not a 
                        loser, really.  I was the most 
                        popular of the unpopular--

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Or the most unpopular of the 
                        popular.

                                 LUKE
                        Right.  Either way.  You’re out of 
                        my league.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        So I’m slumming now?

                                 LUKE
                        You could say that.  
                             (beat)
                        Want a beer?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Sure.

           Luke gets up, grabs a beer from his cart, opens it with the 
           bottle opener on the side.  Now, Biggie plays: “Everyday 
           Struggle.”

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                        Very handy.
                             (beat)
                        Hey, who is this?

                                 LUKE
                        Notorious B.I.G. Just came out. 
                        Real dope.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        You should make me a mix some time.

                                 LUKE
                        Definitely.

                        Wanna smoke?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        OK.

           The sun goes down, and they smoke, catching each other’s 
           eyes, glancing away.  Biggie fades out on Luke’s stereo...
                                 LUKE
                        It’s kind of nice.  With no one 
                        else around.

           Stephanie stares at him, smiling:

                                 STEPHANIE
                        It is, isn’t it?

           And Luke kisses her.  And music swells,

           Until she pushes him away.  And the music stops.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 LUKE
                        Nothing.
                             (beat)
                        Did it feel good?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Let’s try again.

           They do. And music swells. Longer now. They part. It stops.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                        Weird.

                                 LUKE
                        Did it feel good?

           Steph smiles, kisses him, full on. Music swells. For real, 
           this time.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREET - LATER

           Luke leaves Steph’s building, pushes his cart down the 
           street. Now, he steps away from it.

           And, as music continues on the soundtrack, he DANCES down the 
           street.

           The panels beneath him glow with his every step.  Like in 
           Michael Jackson’s “Billie Jean” video.

           INT. STEPHANIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Stephanie enters her house.  She hears yelling.

           In the background:
                                 MRS. SQUIRES
                        This is the kind of example you 
                        want to set for Stephanie?  Smoking 
                        pot all the time like a goddamn 
                        child? That’s not what I want for 
                        her. Or me.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        You’re drunk.

                                 MRS. SQUIRES
                        So are you.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        You’re more drunk.

                                 MRS. SQUIRES
                        I can’t talk to you about this 
                        anymore.  It’s all a big fucking 
                        joke and I can’t talk to you about 
                        anything anymore...

           Stephanie enters her room, closes the door quietly.

           INT
                    LUKE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Luke enters the house, stoned out of his mind.  His mom is 
           up, in the kitchen. 

                                 MOM
                        Can I make you something to eat, 
                        honey?

                                 LUKE
                        Absolutely.
                             (beat)
                        I mean, yeah.  What do we have?

                                 MOM
                        Some fruit.  Some leftover 
                        stuffing.  Some bagels.

                                 LUKE
                        That’s fine.

                                 MOM
                        What?

                                 LUKE
                        Just put some stuffing on a bagel, 
                        please.
                             (beat)
                        With some fruit on top.

           His mom looks at him, furrows her brow:
                                 MOM
                        Sure.

           Mom enters the kitchen, starts to cook.  From the other room:

                                 MOM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        So, how was your night?

           Luke walks over to the TV, turns it on. “Taxi”. The theme 
           song plays:

                                 LUKE
                        I think I’m in love.

           She rushes back in.

                                 MOM
                        That’s wonderful! Who’s the lucky 
                        girl?

                                 LUKE
                        Stephanie Squires.

                                 MOM
                        Her family’s very wealthy, Luke.

                                 LUKE
                        I know.

                                 MOM
                        Well, that’s good.

                                 LUKE
                        It’s not like we’re getting 
                        married, mom.

                                 MOM
                        You never know.  This is around the 
                        time when I met your father--

           His mom reenters the kitchen.  Luke winces.

                                 LUKE
                        Right.

                    DR. SQUIRES HOUSE - NIGHT

           Stephanie eats ice cream on the couch, smokes a cigarette, 
           watches “Three’s Company.”

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        You’re up late.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Couldn’t sleep.
                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        You have a nice day with Luke?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Nothing.
                             (beat)
                        Do you like him?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I don’t know.  What do you care?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Do you like like him?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Maybe.  Yeah.

           Dr. Squires face drops.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                        Look, I’m not really in the mood 
                        for a father-daughter moment, Dr. 
                        Squires.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Well, can I watch TV with you?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        What about your wife?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        She took a valium and passed out.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Sounds about right.
                             (beat)
                        Grab a seat.

           Dr. Squires sits next to her. His DOG jumps onto his lap.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        So, fill me in.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Well, there’s been a big 
                        misunderstanding, and Mr. Ferley 
                        thinks Jack’s gay.

           Dr. Squires lights a bowl:

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I think I’ve seen this one.
           INT
                    LUKE’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Luke exits his bedroom.  His dad’s in a suit, in the kitchen.  

                                 DAD
                        Morning, Luke.
                             (beat)
                        You’re up early.

                                 LUKE
                        Couldn’t sleep.
                             (beat)
                        It’s mad hot.

           Luke notices his dad looking at a piece of paper.

                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                        What’s that?

                                 DAD
                        Nothing.

           Luke snatches it.  An eviction notice.  

                                 LUKE
                        We’re getting evicted?

           Luke’s Dad stops pouring his juice.

                                 DAD
                        Keep your voice down.  I’ll take 
                        care of it.  I’ve got a big deal 
                        coming through. It’s no problem.

           He snatches the notice from Luke’s hand.

                                 LUKE
                        Where would we go?

                                 DAD
                        I don’t know.  Downtown, maybe?  
                        Jersey?  Not everyone has to live 
                        on the Upper East Side.

                                 LUKE
                        Well, I can’t live in Jersey.

                                 DAD
                        Look, I messed up.  But I’m trying 
                        to fix it.

                                 LUKE
                        Well, fix it.
                                 DAD
                        All I can do is try.

                                 LUKE
                        Be a man, dad.  Fix it.

                                 DAD
                        What should I do, Luke?  Deal pot?

                                 LUKE
                        I don’t think you’d be very good at 
                        that.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Luke moves through the park, dealing with newfound intensity.

           MONTAGE:

           Portraits of Luke’s various clients, across New York City.  
           Luke deals to them, in rapid-fire, making that paper.

           INT. DR. SQUIRES’ OFFICE - DAY

           A dishevelled Dr. Squires, lost, pretends to listen to a 
           patient.

           EXT. PROMENADE - NIGHT

           Luke and Stephanie smoke a joint on the Promenade.  The city 
           glows in the distance.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Luke moves though the park, selling ices, dealing weed.  The 
           portraits fly by now,

           Mixed and matched with Dr. Squires’ patients.  All of them 
           intermingled, pulsing to the beat...

           INT. LUKE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Luke presses stop on his boombox, scribbles his tag on a 
           label, slaps it on a tape. 

           INT. DR. SQUIRES’ OFFICE - DAY

           Luke sits across from Dr. Squires, who seems vaguely 
           uninterested:
                                 LUKE
                        So, I’ve been dealing a lot more--

           Dr. Squires pulls out a bong, takes a hit.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Uh-huh.

                                 LUKE
                        I’m trying to help my folks a 
                        little, you know.  I just feel a 
                        lot of pressure--

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        You’re totally wrong for each 
                        other.

                                 LUKE
                        Huh?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I want you to stop seeing 
                        Stephanie. She is not for you.

                                 LUKE
                        What’s so bad about me?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        She’ll break your heart, Luke.  
                        She’s just bored.

           This hurts.

                                 LUKE
                        That’s not true.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Fine.  Ignore my advice. I’m trying 
                        to help you, Shapiro.  What? You 
                        think she’s hot? You want to fuck 
                        her? The next thing you know, 
                        you’ve wasted your entire life on a 
                        girl you have nothing in common 
                        with, Luke.

                                 LUKE
                        I was just following your advice, 
                        Dr. Squires. Living? You know?
                             (beat)
                        Wait--who said anything about my 
                        entire life?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        This is it, Luke. This is your 
                        life. The choices you make.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DR. SQUIRES (cont'd)
                        And I guess you’ve chosen to be a 
                        hoodlum drug dealer who latches 
                        onto the only girl who will pay 
                        attention to him, simply because 
                        he’s scared of being alone.

                                 LUKE 
                        What about you?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        What about me?

                                 LUKE
                        Telling me not to take medication.  
                        Your “you don’t want me to be like 
                        Times Square” fucking metaphor.  
                        You said so, you’re on half that 
                        shit yourself.  You’re a hypocrite.
                             (beat)
                        Why are you even hanging out with 
                        me anyway?  Don’t you have friends 
                        your own age?  Don’t you feel like 
                        a fucking weird old idiot, just, 
                        like, trying to relive your high 
                        school years cuz you fucked them up 
                        the first time?
                             (beat)
                        Maybe that’s it.  Maybe you’re 
                        jealous...

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Don’t, Luke--

                                 LUKE
                        You want to be me, right?  With 
                        your daughter...

           Dr. Squires looks at him, eyes steel:

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Stepdaughter.
                             (beat)
                        I believe our time is up.

           Luke looks at him, focused.

                                 LUKE
                        I guess so.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        This was a short one, so I’ll just 
                        charge you a dime bag.

           Luke pulls some weed out of his pocket--and a mixtape:

                                 LUKE 
                        I made this for you.
           Dr. Squires looks at it.

                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                        It’s a mixtape.

           Luke walks out as Dr. Squires studies the tape.

           INT. LUKE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Luke enters his house.  There’s his dad, watching TV, 
           surrounded still by boxes of Walkmen:

                                 TV ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        ...The New York Mets Dwight Gooden 
                        was admitted to the Betty Ford 
                        clinic today for cocaine 
                        addiction... 

                                 DAD
                             (re: TV)
                        What a mess.

                                 LUKE
                        You fix it?

                                 DAD
                        Please, Luke.  Don’t talk to me 
                        about this right now.

                                 LUKE
                             (re: boxes)
                        What happened with the walkmen? I 
                        thought you had someone who wanted--

                                 DAD
                        What do you want from me, Luke? I 
                        have no idea what the hell I’m 
                        doing. Is that what you want to 
                        hear?

                                 LUKE
                        I want you to make me feel better.

                                 DAD
                        I want someone to make me feel 
                        better too, Luke. I really do.

                                 LUKE
                        Listen, dad.  I have some money.

                                 DAD
                        That’s very sweet, Luke--

                                 LUKE
                        Real money.
           Now, his mom enters:

                                 MOM
                        What are you guys talking about?

                            DAD
                                                          LUKE
           Nothing.
                                              Nothing.

           EXT. DR. SQUIRES APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Luke’s mixtape blares from Dr. Squires’ stereo.

           Dr. Squires sits on the ledge of his balcony, looks down. He 
           wobbles, as he takes a swig. 

           Now, he holds up a water balloon, tosses it.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Luke and Stephanie push Luke’s cart down a path in the park.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Hey, I’m not going to get arrested, 
                        am I?

                                 LUKE
                        Just act calm, and follow my lead, 
                        everything will be fine.
                             (beat)
                        Relax.  Here, let’s listen to some 
                        music.

           Luke switches on a little boombox affixed to the cart handle.  
           Out pumps “Juicy” by Biggie.

           Stephanie smiles.  Luke looks down the path:

                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                        That’s her.

           They approach a woman, dressed in cutoff sweatshirt and black 
           jeans, sort of almost pretty, 42.  This is ELEANOR.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Thank God.

                                 LUKE
                        Hey.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Who’s this?
                                 LUKE
                        This is my friend, Stephanie.  
                        Stephanie, this is Eleanor.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Nice to meet you.

                                 ELEANOR
                        She’s hot.

           Luke nods, embarrassed.

                                 ELEANOR (CONT'D)
                        Sorry to move the location, I’ve 
                        just been hearing all these 
                        nightmare stories about fucking 
                        Giuliani.  And I had to do it 
                        today, cuz I have a guy coming into 
                        town tomorrow and we have nothing 
                        to talk about unless we’re stoned 
                        but he fucks like...well...he’s a 
                        nice guy. Actually, he’s a fucking 
                        asshole, but here we are.

           Stephanie smiles.

                                 ELEANOR (CONT'D)
                        Let me ask you something about 
                        guys, Luke. Why are they all so 
                        fucked up?  Am I intimidating?  Am 
                        I intimidating because I play an 
                        instrument?

                                 LUKE
                        No.
                             (beat)
                        You play an instrument?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Yes, Luke.  I’m a musician.  God, 
                        you don’t know anything about me.

                                 LUKE
                        I mean, I don’t really need 
                        to...know anything about you.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I was in a band, Luke: Emergency 
                        Breakthrough.  We were big in the 
                        80’s.  Well, we were big in 1982. I 
                        play keyboard and I fucked Ronnie 
                        Wood.

                                 LUKE
                        The football player?
                                 ELEANOR
                        No, Luke.  He’s in the Rolling 
                        Stones. Jesus, you know nothing 
                        about music.

                                 LUKE
                        Sure I do.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Hip hop is not music, Luke.  It is 
                        noise.
                             (beat)
                        Please tell me I don’t look as old 
                        as I sound...
                             (to Steph)
                        What about you, darling?  You got 
                        any insight into guys?  Why am I 
                        asking? Of course you don’t. You 
                        picked a real handful with this 
                        one.

                                 LUKE
                        We’re not exactly...

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Yes we are.
                             (beat)
                        He’s the love of my life.

           She takes hold Luke’s hand.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Yeah. You guys have real good 
                        chemistry. How’s the sex?

                                 LUKE
                        You know, Eleanor, you can really 
                        just tell me how much you want and 
                        leave it at that.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Fifty of the bubble gum, please.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Luke pushes his cart through the park--with Steph:

                                 STEPHANIE
                        He OD’d when I was 6. At least, 
                        that’s the story they tell me. He 
                        was this very handsome, like, 
                        famous photographer, and my mom was 
                        a model.
                             (beat)
                        I have very good genes.
                                 LUKE
                        You miss him?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I didn’t know him well enough to 
                        miss him. But I’m definitely 
                        missing something.

           They walk on, in silence:

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                        I think when I get to college, I’m 
                        gonna change my name to Mary J. 
                        Squires.

                                 LUKE
                        That’s cool. I like that.

           INT
                    STEPHANIE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The door opens.  Luke looks from side to side.

                                 LUKE
                        He’s not here is he?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I told you already.  There’s no 
                        way.  He’s got patients til 6.
                             (she looks around)
                        Ready?  Run.

           They run into Stephanie’s room.

           INT
                    STEPHANIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Luke and Steph make out, under the covers, when:

                                 DR. SQUIRES (O.S.)
                        Steph?

           They both recoil, look at each other in horror.  Luke nods 
           with his head: talk to him.

           Luke crawls under the covers, hides:

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Yeah?

           The door opens.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                        You’re home early.
                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        My last patient cancelled.  
                        Actually, he killed himself 
                        yesterday.  Is someone here?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Just me.

           Meanwhile, Stephanie grabs Luke’s hand, puts it between her 
           legs.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Why are you in bed?

                                 STEPHANIE
                             (smiling wide)
                        I feel like shit.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I heard laughing.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Answering machine.

           He sits down.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Do you want some soup?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Not right now, thanks.  I think I’m 
                        going to stay in bed.  For a while.

           Dr. Squires sits in the chair, quietly, for a beat.  
           Stephanie looks at him, smiles, nods.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Well, feel better.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Thanks.

           And he gets up, exits.

           The door closes, and Steph pulls the covers back over her, 
           looks at Luke.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                        Close one.

                                 LUKE
                        I gotta get out of here, Steph.  If 
                        he catches me--
           INT
                    DR. SQUIRES HOUSE - LATER

           Dr. Squires, naked, in the lotus position.

           As Luke sneaks by.

           Just as Luke gets to the front door,

           His PAGER starts going off.

           Squires looks around, curious.

           Luke grabs it, quick, turns it off,

                                 DR. SQUIRES (O.S.)
                        Shapiro?

           Luke turns to the doctor who stands, naked.

                                 LUKE
                             (sheepish)
                        Look, Dr. Squires, I think maybe 
                        you should get used to this...

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Get used to it?

                                 LUKE
                        I mean, it doesn’t really affect 
                        you...

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I want you out of my house.

                                 LUKE
                        You know, maybe you should take 
                        care of your own shit before you 
                        start worrying about my...shit.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I’m getting my gun.

                                 LUKE
                        You don’t have a gun.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        My wife does.

           Dr. Squires walks away, quickly, but not before shooting a 
           look at Stephanie, who stands in her doorway:

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        Sick, huh?

           And Luke bails.
           INT. DR. SQUIRES’ BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Dr. Squires looks in his bathroom cabinet.  In the bedroom, 
           his wife’s asleep in all her clothes, on the bed.

           He looks at the lithium,

           Grabs the bottle, opens it,

           Dumps the pills down the toilet.

           INT. DR. SQUIRES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Dr. Squires enters his bedroom.  His wife watches television.  
           On it, an idyllic beach: Goodness Gracious, Barbados.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I’m a mess. 

                                 MRS. SQUIRES
                        I know.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        You used to help me when I got like 
                        this.

                                 MRS. SQUIRES
                        We used to do a lot of things.

           They watch TV, quiet.  Couples splash around on the sand.

                                 DR. SQUIRES 
                        Looks like fun.

           His wife turns to him:

                                 MRS. SQUIRES
                        We went there on our honeymoon.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Right.

           Silence:

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        Wanna go back?

                                 MRS. SQUIRES
                        Sure.
           INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - DAY

           Luke sits across from a couple WHITE HOODLUMS.  They snort 
           ritalin.  Looks like they’ve been here for days.  Hip hop 
           blasts:

                                 LUKE
                        Y’all sure you don’t want some 
                        more?  I can make you a deal this 
                        time...I’m trying to unload a 
                        little extra...

                        What is this, Crazy Eddie’s? I told 
                        you, just an eighth.
                             (to Hoodlum 2)
                        Such a cute kid.

                                 HOODLUM 2
                        Shapiro, when you going to college?

                                 LUKE
                        I don’t know, like a month or so...

                        Fuck college. I’d stay here if I 
                        was you.  You got a good business 
                        going...  

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah.

                                 HOODLUM 2
                        Take it from me, Shapiro.  College 
                        is wiggity wiggity wack. 

           Luke gets a page.

                                 HOODLUM 1
                        Except the pussy.

                                 HOODLUM 2
                        Yeah, the pussy’s good.

                                 LUKE
                        Yo, can I use your phone?

                                 HOODLUM 1
                        Yeah.  Please.  Use my phone to 
                        coordinate a drug deal.

           Stephanie watches The Box in her bra and panties, smokes a 
           cigarette.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Yo.

                        What the fuck is it?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        What do you mean?  Nothing.

                                 LUKE
                        You paged me 911.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Oh.  Just wanted to see what you 
                        were doing this weekend...

                                 LUKE
                        Shit.  Steph, don’t page me 911 
                        unless it’s an emergency.  I 
                        thought someone died.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Come on.

                                 LUKE
                        Serious.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        OK.  My bad.  Anyway, what are you 
                        doing this weekend?

                                 LUKE
                        Nothing.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Good.  My folks are going to 
                        Barbados, which means my house in 
                        Fire Island is open.  I was 
                        wondering if you wanted to join me 
                        out there for some beachcombing.

                                 LUKE
                        Like, a date?
                                 STEPHANIE
                        Like a honeymoon.

                                 LUKE
                        I do.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        You know what people do on a 
                        honeymoon. Don’t you, Luke?

                                 LUKE
                             (smiling)
                        I think so.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I’ll meet you at Penn Station 
                        tomorrow at 3.  Bring weed.

           Luke hangs up, ecstatic.

           INT. DR. SQUIRES’ HOUSE - DAY

           Dr. Squires, in sunglasses and Hawaiian shirt, stands in 
           front of the mirror.  De La Soul blares as he raps to 
           himself.

           De La Soul continues as Luke sprays some Nautica cologne on 
           his armpits.  He sings along in the mirror.

           INT. DELI - DAY

           Luke walks up to the counter, hands a pair of MAGNUM CONDOMS 
           to the CLERK.  Behind him a BIG BLACK MAN:

                                 CLERK
                        These are magnums...

                                 LUKE
                        Uh-huh.

                                 CLERK
                        You know what that means?

                                 LUKE
                        Word.

           The Big Black Man smirks.

                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                        Actually, what does it mean?

                    PENN STATION - DAY

           Luke stands under the big arrivals/departures board.  
           Stephanie approaches, wearing a sundress.  She looks 
           beautiful. 

                                 LUKE
                        Wow.  You look beautiful.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I know!

           EXT. OCEAN BEACH ROAD - NIGHT

           Luke and Steph walk past a crew of Long Island drunks, duffel 
           bags in tow.  

           EXT. FIRE ISLAND FERRY - DUSK

           The sun sets over the Atlantic.  Luke and Steph, on the top 
           of the ferry.  She’s chilly.  He gives her his sweatshirt.

           EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

           Luke and Steph drop their bags, drop their clothes, and run 
           into the ocean.

                                 LUKE
                        It’s mad warm.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Global warming.

           Steph swims closer to him, touches him.  He shudders:

                                 LUKE 
                        Fuck, dude.  Don’t do that shit...

                                 STEPHANIE
                        What?

                                 LUKE
                        I’m scared of Jawses.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        There are no Jawses here.

                                 LUKE
                        You sure?
                                 STEPHANIE
                        Positive.

           And they swim in the warm black sea.

           EXT. STEPHANIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           They enter Stephanie’s beach house.  It’s sparse, wooden, 
           filled with shells, an old TV, an old stereo.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Want some wine?

                                 LUKE
                        Got anything stronger?

           Stephanie looks through the cabinets.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Let’s see--whiskey?

                                 LUKE
                        Hmm.  I’ll try it, I guess.  
                        Anything to mix it with?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        There’s some juice boxes...

                                 LUKE
                        Good.

                        Hey, I made this for you.

           Luke pulls a mixtape from his bag, drops the tape into an old 
           silver boombox.

           Stephanie beams:

           “Roni” by Bobby Brown plays.

           Stephanie squeezes the remainder of a Hawaiian Punch juice 
           box into a glass of whiskey.  She grabs her glass of wine and 
           walks outside to the 

           HOT TUB

           Where Luke sits, drunk, stoned, dazed.  He looks up, smiling:

                        This whiskey is a lot of drunk.

                        No shit.

                        Maybe.  Sorry.  I mean, I’ve just 
                        never really been in this situation

                                 STEPHANIE
                        What situation?

                        I guess I’m just wondering...what 
                        happens...when everyone comes back.  

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Like, do I turn into a pumpkin?

                        I don’t know.  But it doesn’t

           Luke and Steph make out in their bathing suits.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Take these off.

           Stephanie slides Luke’s bathing suit around his ankles. He’s 
           so scared now.

           She flips him on his back, gets on top.

                                 LUKE
                        Condom--? 

                                 STEPHANIE
                        That’s what the pill’s for, 
                        Shapiro.

                                 LUKE
                        O...K...

           He’s inside her now.  Stephanie moves up and down, quickly: 

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Um, you’re not hard.

                                 LUKE
                        Fuck.  No?  Man.  
                             (beat)
                        I’m really drunk, I think.

           Now, the tape stops.
                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                        I gotta flip the tape.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Nuh-uh.  We’re having sex.

                                 LUKE
                        But...my drunk.  I mean, my dick.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I’ll make coffee.

                    STEPHANIE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The mix continues now:  Outkast, “Crumblin’ Erb”.  Luke sits 
           at the counter.  Luke sips his coffee.

                                 LUKE
                        I never drank coffee before.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I drink it all the time.  It’s like 
                        ritalin.

                                 LUKE
                        Hey, Steph...Not to be, like, a 
                        bitch or nothin’, but, um...

                                 STEPHANIE
                        What is it?

                                 LUKE
                        I’ve kinda never had sex before.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        You’re a virgin?

                                 LUKE
                        Nah.  I’ve just never officially 
                        had sex.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Right.
                             (beat)
                        I thought you fucked Katie.

                                 LUKE
                        I was, like, real faded and I never 
                        really--it was more like third 
                        base...

                                 STEPHANIE
                        She thinks you fucked her.
                                 LUKE
                        Well, OK, but, listen, that’s why 
                        I’m nervous and, like, maybe that’s 
                        why--the thing with my dick...

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Don’t worry, Shapiro.  I’ve done it 
                        like 100 times. I’ll teach you.  
                        You will be my student of sex.

                                 LUKE
                        OK.  I’m down.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        You sober yet?

           Luke looks down at his crotch:

                                 LUKE
                        Probably.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Then it’s time for our first 
                        lesson.

                        OK.  Now put it in.

           Luke moves.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                        Ow.  Ow.  Slowly.  Slower.

                        OK.  That’s good.  Now move in and--

           Suddenly, Luke shudders, convulses.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                        No fucking way.

                        You fucking came.
           EXT. BEACH - DAWN

           Luke sits on the beach, sullen, as the sun rises.  Stephanie 
           plays around in the water, on her back, looking up at the 
           horizon and the faint sliver of orange that streaks above it. 

           Luke looks at her, mouths to himself:

                                 LUKE
                        I love you.

                        Stephanie, I love you.

                        I got mad love for you, shorty.  

           Luke shakes his head, closes his eyes.  Stephanie dives into 
           a wave.

                    BARBADOS HOTEL ROOM - DAWN

           Dr. Squires sits on the bed, across from his wife.  The TV is 
           on.  The sun is rising.  A bottle of champagne passes between 
           them.

                                 DR. SQUIRES 
                        I haven’t stayed up all night in 10 
                        years.

                                 MRS. SQUIRES
                        Yes we did.  

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        We did?

                                 MRS. SQUIRES
                        We did.  New Year’s Eve, 4 years 
                        ago.  Remember we found that coke 
                        that you hid from the 80’s?  And we 
                        did it and then we made love on the 
                        balcony covered in these giant 
                        blankets and we woke up Steph and 
                        you told her we were out there 
                        trying to save a sick pigeon?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I do remember that.

           Dr. Squires laughs, sighs:

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        What happened to us, Kristen?
                                 MRS. SQUIRES
                        You’re kidding, right?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Yeah.  I’m kidding.

           He takes another sip of champagne.

           EXT. OUTDOOR SHOWER - DAY

           Luke showers in the sun.  Next to him, a deer eats some 
           grass.

           Now, Stephanie enters, a towel wrapped around her.  Luke 
           looks at her, smiles, nervous.  He puts some shampoo in his 
           hair.

           Stephanie drops her towel, steps behind Luke, starts to rub 
           the shampoo in.  Luke turns around.  Stephanie kisses him.

           She reaches down, slides him inside her.  He shudders, moves 
           closer, pushes her back against the wooden shower door.

           An animated deer joins the first, real-life one, eating 
           grass.  Now another.  An animated songbird lands on the 
           showerhead, chirps.

           And Luke and Stephanie fuck.  And it’s good.  Really good.

           Porn on Spectravision.  And Dr. Squires fucks his wife.  She 
           sits on his lap; they both face the TV screen.  Behind it, a 
           mirror.  Alternate focus between the mirror and the TV.

           EXT. OUTDOOR SHOWER - DAY

           Stephanie slumps into Luke, her head on his shoulder.  She 
           smiles wide. They stand like that, for a while.  The shower 
           continues to hit them, sprinkled with sunlight.  Then:

                                 LUKE
                        I love you.

           Stephanie backs up, looks at him:

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Whoa, dude.

           INT. LUKE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Luke opens the front door to his house, enters.  He drops his 
           duffel bag in the hall.  It’s quiet.

                                 LUKE
                        Dad?  Mom?

           Luke walks into the living room.  Nothing.

                        Mom?

           He enters his parents’ room.  Nothing.  Now, from the 
           bathroom, he hears muffled cries:

                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                        Mom.

                        I’m fine, honey.  It’s OK.

           Luke opens the door a crack.  His mom is sitting at the sink, 
           crying.

                                 MOM (CONT'D)
                        Leave, Luke.

                        Mom.  Mom.  It’s gonna be fine.

                                 MOM
                        I can’t be poor, Luke.  I don’t
                        know how to do it.

           She breaks down now.  Luke sits next to his mother.  She 
           points to a pill bottle on the counter:

                                 MOM (CONT'D)
                        Hand me that.

           Luke grabs the bottle.  Valium.  He fills a cup with water. 
           Gives it to her.  She pops it.

                                 LUKE
                        Mom.  What happened?  What did he 
                        do?
                                 MOM
                        He risked everything.  Over and 
                        over again.
                             (beat)
                        I’m sorry.  This isn’t fair to you.

                                 LUKE
                        It’s cool.  I can take it.

                                 MOM
                        You can.  I know that.
                             (beat)
                        I just wanted it to be easy for 
                        you.  And it’s always 
                        so...fucking...hard.

                                 LUKE
                        What?

                                 MOM
                        Everything.

                                 LUKE
                        It’s gonna be fine, mom.  I talked 
                        to dad.  He said so. 

                                 MOM
                        OK, sweetie.  OK.

                    LUKE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Luke opens his refrigerator.  It’s filled with weed. More 
           weed than he could possibly unload himself.

           He puts his face in the pillow, and starts to cry.

           On his dresser, his pager vibrates.  Over and over again.

           EXT. PAY PHONE - DAY

           Luke dials.  On the other end, Stephanie’s machine:

                        Hey.  It’s Steph.  Leave a message.

                        Yo.  Steph.  Hey.  It’s me, Luke. I 
                        know you said you’d call me this 
                        week, and it’s a week from when you 
                        said that...so, well, I guess
                        there’s still time in the week,
                        really.

                        Technically, there’s still a few 
                        hours left.  I hope you’re aware of 
                        that... (beat) Listen, are you not 
                        calling me back cuz I said I love 
                        you?  Cuz that’s stupid.  I mean, I 
                        didn’t mean it really.  And even if 
                        I did, I’m going to college in 
                        three weeks so it’s not like it 
                        matters.  You know what?  Fuck it.  
                        I meant it.  I do love you.  I’m 
                        not scared to say it.  I fucking 
                        love you and if that scares you, 
                        well...then fuck you. You know 
                        what?  Fuck off.  You’re a
                        bitch.  Goodbye.

           INT. DR. SQUIRES’ OFFICE - DAY

           Dr. Squires sits in his office, stoned.  He stares at his 
           degrees, tries to crush them with his forefinger and thumb. 
           Then, a knock:

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Come in...

           Luke opens the door:

                                 LUKE
                        Hey.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Shapiro?

           Luke stands there, sullen:

                                 LUKE
                        She got bored.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        With all due respect to my 
                        stepdaughter, Luke--fuck her.  Fuck 
                        ‘em all.

                                 LUKE

                        Couldn’t save your marriage, huh?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Turns out it’s not worth saving.

           Silence.  They stare at each other.
                                 LUKE 
                        Dr. Squires, remember when you told 
                        me that shit about men doing the 
                        things they needed to do to become 
                        the men they need to become...or 
                        something?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        No.

                                 LUKE
                        Well, I need your help.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        What is it, Luke?

                                 LUKE
                        Do you know anyone who could maybe 
                        use some weed?  I have a little 
                        extra weight to unload this month.

           Dr. Squires thinks:

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        We could probably work something 
                        out.

           He smiles, and Biggie drops on the soundtrack.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY

           Luke and Dr. Squires roll down the street.  They look 
           different now.  Almost...badass.

                                 LUKE
                        If we’re gonna do this, Dr. 
                        Squires, we’re gonna do it right. 
                        You gotta be a little more careful.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Don’t worry, Luke. I’m not going 
                        back to prison.

                                 LUKE
                        Good.  Let’s establish a few ground 
                        rules. Number 1: We use pagers. 
                        Someone pages us, and we call them 
                        back from a payphone. We never use 
                        home phones for this type of stuff. 
                        Never.

           FLASH: Luke talks on a payphone, catches a tag on it.
                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        That’s great, Luke. I already have 
                        a pager for my medical practice.

                                 LUKE
                        Number 2: We sell weed by the gram, 
                        by the eighth, and by the ounce. 
                        Gram’s the highest profit margin 
                        but it’s also the most potent. 
                        That’s why we try to encourage 
                        people to buy the grams...

           INT. APARTMENT ON W 83RD STREET - DAY

           Luke and Dr. Squires sit across from an OLDER MAN:

                                 LUKE
                        Look, Principal Edwards, I can give 
                        you 2 grams for $125.  Anything 
                        less than that, I don’t make a 
                        profit.

                                 PRINCIPAL EDWARDS
                        You always were very good at math, 
                        Luke.

           Intercut LUKE AND SQUIRES’ DRUG DEALS with a SUBWAY MAP, 
           illustrating their location across Manhattan.

                                  LUKE
                        Number 3: you make half of all 
                        sales on any clients you refer...

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Oh, don’t worry about that, Luke.

                                 LUKE
                        What do you mean?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I don’t need the money.

                                 LUKE
                        Wait...so why are you doing this?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        You know, for fun.

           Luke and Dr. Squires push Luke’s ice cart across the city, 
           licking ices as they go. Biggie blasts from the boombox.

                        so real. It’s like therapy, really.

                        And I’m still Eleanor.

           They stare at each other, smile.

                                 LUKE
                        So...how much you want?

                                 ELEANOR
                        A quarter.  I’m going to New 
                        Hampshire to meet that guy.  The 
                        fucker.  So, I’m...you know...just, 
                        packing and stuff and then I was 
                        thinking...I need some grass!  I 
                        almost forgot!  So, that’s how this 
                        happened.

                                 LUKE
                        So, a quarter, then?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        He doesn’t appreciate you.

                                 ELEANOR
                        How’d you guess?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        He couldn’t possibly.  

                                 ELEANOR
                        That’s a compliment, right?

           Dr. Squires nods.

                                 ELEANOR (CONT'D)
                        Let me find my purse.  

           She searches the house frantically.  

                                 ELEANOR (CONT'D)
                        Here it is!
                             (beat)
                        And here’s...this.

           She hands Luke a CD.
                                 LUKE
                        Thanks.  
                             (beat)
                        Greatest Hits?

                                 ELEANOR
                        It’s really only 3 songs and a lot 
                        of remixes.  It’s actually kind of 
                        more like one song.

           Dr. Squires looks at the CD.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        You were in Emergency Breakthrough?

                                 ELEANOR
                        I was.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        No shit!  I loved your music.

                                 ELEANOR
                        No shit!
                             (beat)
                        See, Luke?  I’m not just making 
                        this stuff up.
                             (to Dr. Squires)
                        I’m trying to educate him.  Show 
                        him there’s a whole world beyond 
                        rap music.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        You should listen to this woman, 
                        Luke.  She’s as smart and talented 
                        as she is beautiful.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Awww.  
                             (to Luke)
                        He’s crazy, right?

                                 LUKE
                        A total lunatic.

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

           Luke and Dr. Squires, in the elevator:

                                 DR. SQUIRES 
                        Nice girl.  That Eleanor.

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah.
                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Thanks for letting me come with 
                        you, Luke.  I feel this is a big 
                        step in our relationship.

                                 LUKE
                        No problem. Just don’t be yourself.

           INT. PERCY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Two large BLACK MEN.  Carrying UZIs.  They stand, stoic.

           Elevator door swing open, as Luke walks out confidently.  
           Behind him, Dr. Squires freaked out.  Luke turns to him:

                                 LUKE
                        It’s OK.

           Dr. Squires nods, takes a step forward, looks at the UZIs, 
           the men who carry them.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Uh-huh.

                                 PERCY (O.S.)
                        Who the fuck are you?

           Dr. Squires looks up, sees Percy.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Who the fuck are you?

           Luke interjects, quickly:

                                 LUKE
                        He’s with me, Percy.  He’s cool.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I’m cool, Percy.

                                 PERCY
                        Ima be the judge of that.

           Dr. Squires stands right in front of one of the UZI GUYS, 
           staring at him intently.

                                 UZI GUY
                        Stop that.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Sorry.

           Percy eyes him skeptically.
           INT. PERCY’S ROOM - DAY

           Dr. Squires and Percy, smoking a SPLIFF, stoned out of their 
           minds. Percy’s holding a GLOCK. Nas blares. Luke sits, bored.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        The drowning represents your 
                        inability to get a handle on your 
                        life, what you’re doing, perhaps 
                        your business. And the girl--well, 
                        I don’t know.  When in doubt, I 
                        usually go with your mother.

                                 PERCY
                        Me mum.  Dat make a lot more sense 
                        now.

                                 LUKE
                        Listen, guys...I hate to interrupt, 
                        but--Percy, I need more.

                                 PERCY
                        Luke needs more. How much more Luke 
                        need?

                                 LUKE
                        Another 10 zs.

                                 PERCY
                        How you gwana unload an extra 10 
                        ounces dis week, boy? 

                                 LUKE
                        I’ve expanded my client roster.

                                 PERCY
                        You sure riskin’ a lot, boy.

           Percy cocks his gun, dramatically, points it to Luke, who 
           shudders a bit:

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Hey, easy. He’s just a kid.

           Percy drops the gun, looks at Squires, stoic:

                                 PERCY
                        He ain’t no kid...
                             (to Luke)
                        Ain’t dat right, Luke? You a man, 
                        boy.
           INT
                    DR. SQUIRES CAR - LATER

           Dr. Squires and Luke, in the car.  Luke counts his money:

                                 LUKE
                        11 grand, plus another 10 zs to 
                        unload, at a grand a z... It’s a 
                        start.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        You know, it’s funny, Luke--you and 
                        me, we have the same job-- but 
                        you’re giving people the real shit.  
                        I just give them chemicals.  I 
                        prescribe lies.
                             (beat)
                        I want to do this, Luke.

                                 LUKE
                        Do what?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        What you do?  I can do it, Luke.
                        You’ll need someone to follow in 
                        your footsteps.  When you’re gone.

           Luke sees his house.

                                 LUKE
                        What is wrong with you, Dr. 
                        Squires?  You’ve been acting really 
                        weird--

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I’m fine, Luke.  Totally fine.  I’m 
                        just--unfulfilled.

                                 LUKE
                        Well, this isn’t for you.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        But it’s for you?

           Dr. Squires stops the car.  Luke just looks at him.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

           The camera moves through the city, past people, faces, 
           streets and signs.  All the while, in the middle of our frame

           THE MIDDLE FINGER, held up high.

           It moves past everyone, everything.  Cool kids downtown, 
           hoodlums uptown, old people, young people,  babies and dogs. 
           Until the finger stops, at a pay phone, picks up the 
           receiver...

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Luke, on the phone again:

                        Hey, Steph...so, I guess you’re 
                        ignoring me, huh?  That’s a shame, 
                        cuz it’d be nice to hang out or 
                        whatever before I go to school.  
                        The school year is rapidly 
                        approaching, as you know and, well, 
                        I miss you.  Call me back.

           INT. DR. SQUIRES’ HOUSE - DAY

           Dr. Squires looks at his wife, who stands at the front door, 
           bags packed:

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I love you.

                                 MRS. SQUIRES
                        No you don’t.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Don’t leave me here. Don’t leave me 
                        all alone. Please.

                                 MRS. SQUIRES
                        It’s for the best, Jeffrey.

           From the other room, Stephanie watches, as her mother 
           approaches her, caresses her face tenderly:

                                 MRS. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        I will be back in just a few weeks, 
                        sweetheart.  Then we’ll deal with 
                        the separation.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        OK.

                                 MRS. SQUIRES
                        Goodbye, Jeff.

           And Dr. Squires watches her walk away.

                        ...I miss you.  Call me back.

           Then, her phone rings again.  She picks up, quickly:

           Justin, in triple fat goose and hoodie, on the phone.  Behind 
           him, Rollo catches a tag on a park bench:

                        Why you callin’ me Shapiro?

           EXT. LUKE’S BUILDING - DAY

           Luke approaches his apartment building.  Something’s wrong. 
           There’s a truck there, a moving truck.  
           His mother’s on the curb, smoking a cigarette.  His father is 
           talking to the movers:

                                 DAD
                        Easy with that!  That was my 
                        father’s.

           Luke goes up to his mom, frantic:

                                 LUKE
                        What happened?

                                 MOM
                        What do you think? 

           He runs up to his dad:

                                 LUKE
                        Dad.  Wait!  I have money.  I have 
                        money.
                             (to the movers)
                        Put that down! I have the money.

                                 DAD
                        Luke.  Stop.

                                 LUKE
                        Would you please listen to me, dad?  
                        I have twenty six thousand dollars.  
                        That should be more than enough. 

                                 DAD
                             (sadly)
                        Oh, Luke.

                                 LUKE
                        What?

                                 DAD
                        It’s not enough, Luke. Not even 
                        close.

           Luke looks at him, angry.

                                 LUKE
                        You fucking promised...

           Luke’s dad looks at him, with disdain:

                                 DAD
                        Grow up, Luke.

           Luke turns red with anger.  He lifts his fist.  His father 
           looks at him.
                                 DAD (CONT'D)
                        Not like that.
                             (beat, to mover)
                        Easy with the silver!

           Luke drops his fist.  He sits on the curb next to his mom, 
           looks at her.  At her cigarette.

                                 LUKE
                        You got another?

                                 MOM
                        You smoke?

                                 LUKE
                        Everything.

           INT. DR. SQUIRES’ HOUSE - DAY

           Dr. Squires moves through his decimated apartment with a 
           SHARPIE.  Several items already have his TAG on them. 

           He starts writing on the couch. When Stephanie enters:

                                 STEPHANIE
                        What are you doing?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Marking my territory.

           A beat:

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Need any help?

           INT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

           Luke walks through the darkness of Central Park, barely 
           holding it together.  He walks by Tavern on the Green, sees 
           tourists dining in their suits.

           Twinkling lights swirl around them.  Luke looks at them, from 
           their steaks to their cufflinks...

           Luke takes his pager off his belt, clips it to the handle of 
           his ice cart.

           He rolls the cart up to a SLEEPING HOMELESS PERSON.

           And walks away.

           As the pager starts to vibrate.
           EXT. 42ND STREET - NIGHT

           Dr. Squires walks through Times Square.  He approaches Sho- 
           World, the peep show Luke attended before.  He walks to the 
           door, sees a sign:

           CLOSED BY ORDER OF THE MAYOR

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Fucking Giuliani.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAWN

           Morning comes to New York.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Luke sleeps on a HOTEL COT.  His parents on the bed next to 
           him.  He turns over, opens his eyes.

           LUKE’S POV

           His parents, sleeping, next to each other, quiet. Peaceful.  

           Now, his dad, almost subconsciously, turns and spoons his 
           mom.  He nuzzles her.  She makes a little noise, pulls him 
           close.

           Luke smiles quietly, closes his eyes.

           As the theme to “Legend of Zelda” rises on the soundtrack.

           EXT. HOTEL - DAY

           Luke hops on his bike, rides with a newfound sense of 
           control.  He’s on a quest.

           EXT. STEPHANIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           He rides his bike up to Steph’s awning, hops off it.

           INT. STEPHANIE’S FRONT DOOR - DAY

           Luke rings Steph’s doorbell.  She opens the door:

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Shapiro?
                                 LUKE
                        Look, Steph, I know the summer’s 
                        almost over, but I think we can 
                        make this work.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Luke...

                                 LUKE
                        Hear me out.  People do the long-
                        distance thing.  And it’s not like 
                        we’re going to school so far from 
                        each other, you know?  I mean, it’s 
                        like a 4 hour train ride. We could 
                        alternate weekends--

           From inside:

                                 JUSTIN (O.S.)
                        Is that Shapiro?

                                 LUKE
                        Is that Justin?

           Now, behind Stephanie, Justin, shirtless, just waking up:

                                 JUSTIN
                        Yo, do you have any weed?

                                 LUKE
                        No.

                                 JUSTIN
                        OK.

           Justin turns around, reenters the house. Luke looks at Steph, 
           angry.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Luke...

                                 LUKE
                        Where’s Squires?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        He just left for Fire Island.

                                 LUKE
                        With your mom?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        She’s in rehab.

                                 LUKE
                        Peace.
           He walks to the elevator.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Wait.

           Luke turns around.  She didn’t expect him to.  So she says:

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                        It’s for the best, Luke.

                                 LUKE
                        Right.  Everything’s always for the 
                        best.

           The elevator comes.  And Luke is gone.

           INT. FIRE ISLAND HOUSE - DAY

           “Lithium” by Nirvana plays.  Jesus Christ (Dr. Squires’ dog), 
           wanders through the house, which is a complete mess.

           Attached to his collar, a note: “MY OWNER HAS KILLED HIMSELF. 
           PLEASE TAKE CARE OF ME.”

           A noose hangs from the rafters.  Pills and other assorted 
           drugs are strewn across the house.

           Dr. Squires snorts a line off the kitchen counter.

           Then, a KNOCK. Who could that be?

           He walks to the front door, opens it.

           There’s Luke.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Luke.  How are you?

                                 LUKE
                        Shitty.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Yeah.  Dark times.

                                 LUKE
                        We got evicted.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        You’re homeless now?

                                 LUKE
                        I guess so.

           Dr. Squires looks from side to side:
                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Don’t let the mayor see you.

           Dr. Squires grabs Luke, pulls him inside.

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        I apologize for the mess.  I wasn’t 
                        expecting company...

                                 LUKE
                        You’ve been doing all these drugs?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        It’s an experiment.  An experience.  
                        Life.  Salvation.  Drugs.
                             (beat)
                        Go ahead.

                                 LUKE
                        I haven’t done most of this before, 
                        Jeff.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Come now, Lucas. Be a pal.  Do it.

           MONTAGE:

           Luke and Dr. Squires ingest lines of coke.  They take pills, 
           eat sandwiches, drink wine, smoke pot, play Trivial Pursuit, 
           grill a salmon, take more pills, and

           EXT. BEACH - SUNSET

           Sit on the beach. 

           SPLIT SCREEN: Dr. Squires and Luke, next to each other.  We 
           watch them from behind, the ocean in front of them.  Yet the 
           ocean looks different to each one.  To Squires it is vivid, 
           pulsing.  To Luke, it is almost black and white.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        The ocean. This is all I need.  
                        Forget the city.  The city is 
                        wrong.  I just want to wrap myself 
                        in the ocean.

                                 LUKE
                        I cannot speak.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        That’s the spirit, Luke.
                             (beat, to the ocean)
                        Hit me with it!  Fucking hit me! 
                        You don’t think I can take it?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DR. SQUIRES (cont'd)
                        I can take everything you throw at 
                        me, fucking sea.

           Dr. Squires drops eyedrops in each eye, looks at Luke:

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        Liquid acid.

           A HOT GIRL walks by, walking a dog:

                                 LUKE
                        I want to...vagina.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        You said it.
                             (beat)
                        I should have known as soon as she 
                        told me she didn’t like dogs.  
                        There’s certain people you just 
                        can’t trust.  You know, Luke?

           Squires looks at Luke, whose face is shown in NEGATIVE.  Luke 
           turns to him, in slow motion:

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        Stop being so negative.  

           He starts cracking up, then regains composure:

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        Luke, listen to me.  I may not 
                        always be here for you, so I have 
                        to get all this out, OK?  
                             (beat)
                        Never trust anyone who doesn’t 
                        smoke pot.  Or listen to Bob Dylan.  
                        Do you hear me?  Never trust anyone 
                        who doesn’t like the beach, Luke.  
                        And never, ever, trust anyone who 
                        says they don’t like dogs.  If you 
                        meet someone who doesn’t like dogs, 
                        alert the authorities immediately.  
                        And sure as shit don’t marry them.

                                 LUKE
                        OK.  OK.

           Dr. Squires looks out at the ocean.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Nothing’s OK, Luke.  None of it is 
                        going to be OK.  Everything is 
                        going to be terrible.
                             (beat)
                        I tried to kill myself twice today, 
                        Luke.
           Luke looks at him.

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        Once with pills -- turns out I have 
                        a very high tolerance for those. 
                        And once by hanging...
                             (beat)
                        Hanging is very hard, Luke.  I 
                        should have lost some weight.

                        Oh well.

                                 LUKE
                        Dr. Squires, what are you talking 
                        about?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I don’t know, Luke.  I just--

           He shakes his head.

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        I’m done.

           Dr. Squires looks at him, distraught:

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        I’m pathetic.

           And Dr. Squires starts to cry.

                                 LUKE
                        I am too.  We all are.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        My wife left me.  I’ve lost my 
                        daughter.  And my patients.  And--
                        I’ve just made a mess of 
                        everything.  

                                 LUKE
                        No...

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Yes. This is last call, Luke. And 
                        I’m glad you’re here to see me off.

           Dr. Squires stands.

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry. I’ll go to heaven. I’m 
                        wearing my aquasox.

                                 LUKE
                        Where are you going?
                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        In there.
                             (beat)
                        I’m ready to die, Luke.

           He walks to the ocean. Luke gets up too.

                                 LUKE
                        Stop fucking around, Jeff.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I’m a weird old guy.  You said it 
                        yourself.

           Dr. Squires enters the water. Luke stands at the shore.

                                 LUKE.
                        I didn’t mean it, Dr. Squires.  
                        You’re my friend.  Actually, you’re 
                        my best friend.  So come back.  Do 
                        it for me.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        You’re not worth it, Shapiro.

           He keeps walking:

                                 LUKE
                        So that was all bullshit, huh?  All 
                        that stuff about embracing your 
                        pain, making it a part of you?

           But the doctor keeps walking.  Luke walks in after him, 
           yelling.

                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                        You can’t do this! You can’t just 
                        give up.  Life is fucking hard and 
                        it’s filled with pain and awful, 
                        awful things but we take it and we 
                        get through it!  We don’t give up! 
                        Because we have friends...we help 
                        each other!

           Luke’s in the water now, waves crashing over him. Dr. Squires 
           is nowhere to be seen.

           EXT. BEACH - SOON AFTER

           Luke, spent, exhausted, wet and crying, stumbles onto the 
           shore.  He turns back to the ocean, looks at it. Tears stream 
           down his face. Jesus Christ yips at the water.

                                 DR. SQUIRES (O.S.)
                        Luke...
           He turns around.  There’s Dr. Squires, sitting on a towel, 
           stoic. Jesus Christ runs to him. Now, Luke approaches, sits 
           down next to Squires, breathless.

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        That was really fucking cheesy, 
                        what you just said.

                                 LUKE
                             (smiling)
                        The world has a enough assholes, 
                        Dr. Squires. Don’t be another one.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Now you sound like me.

           He smiles.

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        Let’s go to the city. Fill my 
                        prescriptions.

                                 LUKE
                        Sounds good.

           INT
                    DR. SQUIRES HOUSE - LATER

           Dr. Squires sits, freshly showered, in a robe.  

           Luke hands over a bag full of pill bottles:

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Thank you, Luke.

                                 LUKE
                        How you feeling?

           He shakes his head.

                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                        Don’t do that again, please.  You 
                        scared me.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I’m sorry.

                                 LUKE
                        Look, Dr. Squires...I have to get 
                        back.  To my folks.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Where are you living these days, 
                        Luke?  
                                 LUKE
                        We’re moving in with my 
                        grandparents. In New Jersey.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I’m sorry to hear that.

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah, well.  I’m sorry to live it.

           Dr. Squires smiles.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I’m sorry about Stephanie too.

           Luke looks down.  He can’t talk about this.

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        She would have been a lucky girl.

           Luke looks at him, nods sadly.

                                 DR. SQUIRES (CONT'D)
                        Good luck in school.  Try and fuck 
                        a black girl -- I never got the 
                        chance to do that in college.

           Luke smiles.

                                 LUKE
                        Baby steps.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        I can’t answer that.

                                 LUKE
                        It wasn’t a question.
                             (beat)
                        Peace, doc.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Peace out, Luke.

           INT DR. SQUIRES HOUSE - DAY

           Luke walks out, rings for the elevator.

                                 STEPHANIE (O.S.)
                        Luke.

           He turns, sees Steph.
                                 LUKE
                        Hi.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Look, Luke, I’m sorry.  It’s --

                                 LUKE
                        Do me a favor, Steph -- don’t say 
                        nothin’, OK?  Just stand there 
                        until I leave.  Let me look at you.
                             (beat)
                        I want to remember this. I’ve never 
                        done it before.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Done what?

                                 LUKE
                        Had my heart broken.

           And they stare at each other, like that, for a moment, eyes 
           locked. And the elevator door DINGS.

                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                        Thanks, Steph.  Take care of 
                        yourself.

           He steps into the elevator.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        You too, Shapiro.

           She stands there, not knowing what to do -- or say -- next,

           As the elevator door closes.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

           Luke steps out onto the sun-soaked New York Street. He puts a 
           tape in his walkman: DR. SQUIRES’ MIX.  He puts his 
           headphones on. 

           Luke presses play:  “Stephanie Says” by the Velvet 
           Underground.  And he steps on, into the sun, narrowly 
           avoiding, 

           A WATER BALLOON that drops from above, splattering to pieces.

           EXT. NEW JERSEY HOME - DAY

           A single-story home in New Jersey.  Quiet, suburban.

                    BEDROOM - DAY

           Music continues, as Luke sits in a room, packing.  He looks 
           at his diploma: blank. He folds it, puts in a suitcase.

           His Mom appears in the doorway:

                                 MOM
                        Time for lunch, sweetie.

           INT . DINING ROOM - DAY

           Luke sits at lunch, across from his MOM and DAD.  Two OLDER 
           PEOPLE are with them as well, Luke’s GRANDMA and GRANDPA:

                                 DAD
                        Mom, you know I don’t like 
                        meatloaf.

                                 GRANDMA
                        In your house, you can set the 
                        menu.
                             (beat)
                        Oh, I’m sorry--you don’t have a 
                        house, Mr. Bigshot!  Meatloaf’s 
                        what we’re eating.

                                 GRANDPA
                        You love your mother’s meatloaf.

           Dad shakes his head.  Mom smiles.  And then, 

           Grabs her husband’s hand. He squeezes hers.  

                                 GRANDPA (CONT'D)
                        Can I have some more Dr. Pepper, 
                        Evelyn?

           She comes over, pours some in his glass.  He holds it up:

                                 GRANDPA (CONT'D)
                        To your success, Luke.  
                             (beat)
                        To the college man.

           Mom and Dad raise a glass.  They all toast.

                                 GRANDMA
                        Have you given any more thought to 
                        what you’re going to be? As far as 
                        a profession goes?

                                 DAD
                        Mom, he’s got time--
                                 GRANDMA
                        I’m just asking.

                                 LUKE
                        I was sort of thinking about 
                        becoming a shrink.

           Mom and Dad look at each other, impressed.

                                 GRANDPA
                        It’s a very interesting field, 
                        psychology...

                                 LUKE
                        I figure I’m an expert cuz everyone 
                        around me is so fucking crazy, you 
                        know?

           Now they shudder.

                                 GRANDPA
                        You said it, mister.

                        Turn the TV towards me.

                                 DAD
                        Sure, dad.

           Now, music swells again:

           --Luke sits on an Amtrak train, looks out the window. 

           --A quaint home in Jersey.  Luke’s mother lies asleep. The TV 
           on.  We pan away, to the living room, where 

           --Luke’s father lies asleep.  Watching the same show. 

           --Percy is taken into the Tombs, escorted by New York City

           EXT. PROMENADE - DUSK

           Dr. Squires sits on the Promenade, stares at the skyline. 
           Alone. The World Trade Center glows golden by twilight. He 
           looks down at his hand: a pill. He pops it in his mouth, sips 
           a 40 to wash it down.

           Now, his pager starts to vibrate.  He looks at the number.
           EXT. PAYPHONE - DUSK

           Dr. Squires on a payphone.  He calls:

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        Someone paged me from this number?

                        Listen, I’m sorry to bother you, 
                        but Luke gave me your number. He 
                        said I should page you.  I hope 
                        it’s OK.

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                        It’s OK.  Yes.

                                 ELEANOR
                        So, listen, what are you doing 
                        tonight?

                                 DR. SQUIRES
                             (smiling)
                        No plans.

           EXT. NEW HAVEN TRAIN PLATFORM - NIGHT

           Luke stands on the platform as the train switches from diesel 
           to electric.  It’s cold.  He can see his breath. He walks to 
           the end of the platform, checks to see if the coast is clear, 
           And lights up a joint. He pulls at it, looks into the 
           fluorescent night, The cold industrial gray that is 
           Connecticut. He draws another hit.  Lou Reed wails on the 
           headphones. A conductor makes an announcement. 

           Final boarding call.

           Luke flicks his joint, right at the camera.  As we go

                                                                 BLACK.
