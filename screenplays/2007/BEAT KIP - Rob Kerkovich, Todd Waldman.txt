                        over the pussies...

           A caveman approaches a woman with a smile. He hands her a 
           dead bird.  She smiles back.  Suddenly a big burly caveman 
           comes up from behind and mounts her.  They start having sex.  
           She smiles as the other caveman just watches.

                        of his life terrorized by his three

                        retarded fingers don't mess up the 
                        security code.

                                 EVERYONE
                        Oh bla di, oh bla da, life goes 
                        on... Bra!

                        Ok, you guys have a good night now!

           Peggy, another assistant, approaches Michael. 

                                 PEGGY
                        I don't know how you put up with 
                        that.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hey, it's all part of the game. If 
                        they're NOT calling me retarded 
                        that's a bad thing. Means I'm not 
                        standing out.

                        or something.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh I can't. Gotta date with my 
                        girlfriend.

           INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Candles are being lit, romantic music is being played. We see 
           Michael checking his teeth and hair in the mirror. He sits 
           down at the kitchen table.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hi honey.

           We pan over to see that Michael is actually talking to his 
           computer. He has just started up a video chat with his 
           girlfriend, SUZIE.

                                 SUZIE
                        Hi.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You look great, less pixelated 
                        tonight.  Almost like you're right 
                        here instead of 3000 miles away. 
                        How was class?

                                 SUZIE
                        It was fine. Michael, we need to 
                        talk-

                                 MICHAEL
                        Um...aren't you forgetting 
                        something?  It's our 3 year and 2 
                        month anniversary.

                                 SUZIE
                        Oh right.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Check your email right now.

                                 SUZIE
                        Okay.

           Michael grins as we see Suzie check her email and read aloud.

                        you to know you are his

                                 MICHAEL
                        No, actually it is.  You just give 
                        the confirmation number when you go 
                        into any store-

                        I'm talking about what I'm going to 
                        say next. I think we should break 
                        up.

                                 MICHAEL

                        working for me anymore.

                        Not working? What are you talking 
                        about? I mean, it's tough yeah, but 
                        it's all about finding clever 
                        solutions.

           On the computer screen, we see Suzie begin to take off her 
           bra. Then the image freezes.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)

                        That's not the point. The point is, 
                        out of three years, we've actually 
                        only been in the same state for a 
                        total of eight months. I just feel 
                        like we're desperately trying to 
                        hold on to the first two weeks of 
                        our relationship. But we've changed 
                        so much.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Changed? I'm still the same guy who 
                        wakes up at 5AM just to wish you 
                        good morning.

                                 SUZIE
                        I know and that's the problem. 
                        You're the same guy who has nothing 
                        to talk about except how much you 
                        love me, or how shitty your job is.  
                        Do you know how tired I am of 
                        hearing how Barry beat you up in 
                        some new and humiliating way each 
                        day?    

           Michael sits there in silence.  He takes a deep breath.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Okay, baby, this is natural. Let me 
                        just look up some prices right now 
                        for a ticket to Philadelphia-

                        need to experience college...and 
                        there's so many different people

                        Shit. It's not important. Michael, 
                        we just need some kind of break. We 
                        can talk more about this later. I- 
                        I gotta go, goodbye.

                                 MICHAEL

                        I gotta go.

           The screen freezes again, leaving a fuzzy freeze frame of 
           some stranger standing in her doorway. When the connection 
           returns, we see that Suzie has signed off.

           Michael hasn't moved, and clearly hasn't slept. His alarm 
           goes off. 8:30AM. He reaches over, grabs his cell phone, and 
           begins dialing...

           INT. THE WATERMANS' HOUSE - KITCHEN

           CLIFF STAVAROS leans against the kitchen counter, slowly 
           sipping a glass of ice water. He completely ignores the fact 
           that his cell phone is ringing.  

           He is wearing a Spider-Man costume, which is a size too small 
           for him, revealing a hairy belly. The Spider-Man mask is 
           rolled back and perched on his head like a skull cap, 
           revealing his whole face. Across from him, stands MS. 
           WATERMAN. She is an attractive mom in her early 40's.

                                 CLIFF
                        So I said, "Yes, Toby Maguire and I 
                        DO have the same body type. But I 
                        will not stunt double for someone 
                        who does not have a proper fitness 
                        regimen. I just won't."

                        So what happened next?

           EXT. THE WATERMANS' HOUSE - BACKYARD

           We see a dozen 8-YEAR OLDS running around the back yard, 
           screaming and yelling and doing kid things. An attractive 20 
           YEAR OLD GIRL is sitting on a folding chair, watching the 
           kiddie chaos. We slowly zoom out to reveal someone in a 
           Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle suit staring at her from another 
           folding chair 10 feet away. Inside the turtle outfit (Rafael) 
           is JOSH.

                                 JOSH
                             (muffled)
                        Hey.

           The girl looks around, not sure where the voice came from.

                             (waving)

           She's still confused.

                        Hey.

           Another awkward beat.

                                 JOSH (CONT'D)
                        Heh. I don't usually wear this.

                        I mean- it's a pretty heavy suit.

           A pause.

                             (sliding his chair closer)
                        I'm actually an actor. 

                                 GIRL
                        Hell of an agent you've got.

           Josh laughs heartily underneath the mask. Too heartily.

                                 JOSH
                        Good one... Humor!  The gift of the

           BAM!  A cupcake comes flying out of nowhere and smacks Josh 
           in the head, sticking to his forehead.  JIMMY WATERMAN 
           approaches. It is his birthday party.

                                 JIMMY
                        Why don't you stop hitting on my 
                        sister and start entertaining us, 
                        Frogman.

                                 JOSH
                        Ok, I'm a Teenage Mutant Ninja 
                        Turtle, not a Frogman. Jeez...

                        What's a Teenage Ninja Mute Turtle?

           Josh slowly turns back to Jimmy.

                        fell off the short bus today!

           Michael stares back, vacant.

                                                       CUT TO:

           A quick montage of a delirious Michael spilling coffee on 
           himself, dropping a stack of photocopies, and getting yelled 
           at by Barry.

                                                       CUT TO:

           Michael staring at his computer screen. We see that he's 
           looking at Suzie's Myspace page. He scrolls down and sees 
           that under "Relationship" it says "single".

                                 MICHAEL
                             (crushed)
                        Fuck you.

           He looks over at the "comments" section and sees a recent 
           post from some guy named "KIP RICE". It reads, "You made the 
           right decision."

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        What the fuck?

           Michael clicks on Kip's page. John Mayer's "Your Body Is a 
           Wonderland" starts to play. Michael quickly turns the volume 
           down.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                             (reading)
                        "Interests: Playing guitar, 
                        drinkin' beer, cars (fuck yeah!), 
                        hanging out with Stench and Dan." 

           Michael looks down and sees a picture of a guy named "Stench" 
           doing a keg stand while flipping off the camera.  He keeps 
           reading.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        "Favorite Movies: Armageddon, The 
                        Program, Troy, and especially 
                        Garden State- that movie changed 
                        everything for me." 

           Michael shudders.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Music: I listen to anything that 
                        doesn't suck- Limp Bizkit, Chris 
                        Daughtry, Linkin Park, Creed. 

           Michael's fist clinch.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Who I'd like to meet: Don Rumsfeld.
                        Roger Clemens. The Rock. And God. 
                        I've got some questions for him. 
                        Like where's my laundry bitch?

           Michael recoils.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        "Where's my laundry bitch?"

           Michael clicks on Kip's photos. There are several with him 
           holding some sort of beer, wearing backwards baseball hats, 
           and flipping off the camera. 

           Michael scrolls down and freezes. There are four pictures of 
           him with Suzie. One was obviously taken by him and reads "Me 
           and the Suze".

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Probably just friends...

           Michael scrolls down to the last photo: Kip and Suzie making 
           out. Michael's eyes well with tears.  He puts his head on 
           the table.

                                 BARRY
                             (suddenly over Michael's 
                              shoulder)
                        Woah ho! Look at her! Hey guys, 
                        gather round!  Corky has a hot 
                        girlfriend!

           Michael's head rises up.  He clutches the keyboard, eyes now 
           full of rage.

                                                       CUT TO:
           INT. CLIFF'S CAR, AFTERNOON

           Cliff's beat up convertible drives down a residential street. 
           Inside, Josh is no longer wearing the Ninja Turtle costume, 
           but Cliff is still wearing the Spider-man suit, arms rolled 
           up. The two stare forward, silent. Finally...

                                 JOSH
                        "What about this dick"...

           CLIFF says nothing.

                                 JOSH (CONT'D)
                        What about this dick... Yes, Cliff, 
                        what about that dick? What about 
                        that dick could possibly have made 
                        you say "What about this dick" in 
                        front of 13 eight year olds?

                              the car lighter)
                        I was in with the moms.

                                 JOSH
                        Really? That's fucking great! 
                        Jesus, you always do this!

                                 CLIFF
                        What-

                        Anytime there's a slightly 
                        attractive mother, you disappear!
                        Off you go! On your little web of

                        ever even landed one of these

                                 CLIFF
                        Just because I haven't TOLD you I 
                        did, doesn't mean I haven't, buddy.

                                 JOSH
                             (dialing his cell phone)
                        Bullshit! I'd be the first person 
                        you'd tell. Probably in front of 
                        the poor woman's son... Christ...
                        Why isn't Michael picking up his 
                        phone?

           Barry and the others are crowded around Michael's desk, 
           laughing at the computer screen.

                        I didn't touch her. God no... But I 
                        DID send her pictures of my

                                 BARRY
                        My Blockbuster Entertainment Award!  
                        What the hell are you doing?!

                                 MICHAEL
                        I'm GROWING A PAIR OF BALLS BARRY!  
                        DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY A PAIR IS!?  
                        HERE I'll SHOW YOU!

           Michael sticks out his middle finger and then walks away.  
           Barry is speechless.  Josh and Cliff sit there in shock.  

                                 CLIFF
                        Do you guys validate?

                                 BARRY
                        GET OUT!

           INT. JOJO'S COFFEE SHOP - LATER THAT DAY

           The guys are in a booth at a crappy coffee shop.

                                 MICHAEL
                        And then I saw some pictures of her 
                        with this Kip guy on her myspace 
                        page...and they were making out.

                                 JOSH
                        Jesus.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I know.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Bitch.

           A beat.

                                 MICHAEL 
                        Do you know what the first thing I 
                        thought of when Suzie dumped me?

           The guys look at each other.  Silence.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        I thought: This is my fault. And 
                        what creative thing can I do to 
                        apologize and get her back? Maybe 
                        write her a poem. Or a song. Or 
                        take pictures of us and make a 
                        collage telling the story of our 
                        relationship. 

                                 JOSH
                        Mike, there's nothing wrong with 
                        that. You're creative, that's all.

           Michael pulls out a folded collage from his pocket. All three 
           guys look at it. There are cut outs of couples, and bunny 
           rabbits, and words that say "I'm sorry" in different 
           languages. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Oof.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Y'see, I realized something. I'm a 
                        pussy. I am a fruity pussy.

           Cliff chuckles.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        You, Cliff, are a fruity pussy.

           Cliff recoils slightly.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Josh, you too, are a fruity pu-

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, I get it. We're fruity 
                        pussies. Why is this news to you 
                        all of the sudden?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 MICHAEL
                        Because I realized we're not 
                        winning in life. We're losing. All 
                        due to our fruity pussy nature. You 
                        wear a Ninja Turtle outfit for a

                                 JOSH
                        That's because I don't want to be 
                        Spongebob Goddamned Squarepants.
                             (to Cliff)
                        How many times do I have-

                                 MICHAEL 
                        I want to kick this fucking Kip 
                        guy's ass.  I'm through being Woody 
                        Allen.  I'm now Clint Eastwood.  I 
                        mean, what the hell would Clint 
                        Eastwood do to the guy that stole 
                        his chick?

                                 JOSH
                        Yes.  Brilliant.  Why Eastwood?  
                        Why not "What would O.J. Simpson 
                        do?"  You know what, we've evolved 
                        Mike. We know we don't need to 
                        fight because we can write poems or 
                        whatever and be cool with that.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Except that shit doesn't work 
                        anymore. I'm going to go to 
                        Philadelphia and I'm going to get 
                        Suzie back. And the only way to do 
                        that is if I beat the shit out of 
                        this guy. And you guys are coming 
                        with me.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You guys need to do this as much as 
                        I do. Josh, how many times were you 
                        picked on in elementary school? How 
                        many times in high school were you 
                        shoved by kids who were freshmen?

                        Frat guys yelled shit about you 
                        when you walked past their house?

                        More than I care to remember...

                        Right. Now say you could take one 
                        of those people, one who made you 
                        into who you are today, someone who 
                        deserves every punch you can land 
                        and just beat the crap out of them. 
                        I guarantee you you'd feel better.

                                 JOSH
                        I- I don't know.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You'll go there with us and you'll 
                        do this and you will feel better 
                        about yourself than you ever have 
                        in your life... Plus I know you, 
                        you don't want to be left behind.

           Josh thinks for a moment. Cliff starts smiling 
           uncontrollably. 

                                 JOSH
                        Shit... Fine, let's do it.

                        good night's sleep and meet up 
                        tomorrow.

                                 JOSH
                        No, I mean let's go right now.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What do you mean right now?

                                 JOSH
                        Right fucking now. If we don't 
                        leave right now I could change my 
                        mind.

                        We can't afford that. You just quit 
                        your job and I'm pretty sure we're 
                        not getting paid today.

                                 CLIFF
                        Not to worry.

                        We're drivin' this motherfucker.

           EXT. JOJO'S COFFEE SHOP - AFTERNOON

           The three guys are walking to Cliff's car, looking confident 
           and ready to rock.

                                 JOSH
                        What's this asshole's name?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Kip.

                        He's fucking dead.

           SLO-MO CONTINUOUS as the guys walk coolly to Cliff's car, get 
           in, and exchange meaningful looks that say "it's on". Cliff 
           starts the car.

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. TWISTY MCNIFF'S - NIGHT

           The guys share a table at the restaurant Twisty McNiff's, a 
           family restaurant in the style of T.G.I. Friday’s and 
           Bennigan’s. The place is teeming with loud families ordering 
           platters of fried things. Business men and women are finally 
           “cutting loose” for the weekend. 

           The guys are dressed in mismatched, clearly used, suits. 
           Cliff's tie has piano keys on it.

                                 JOSH
                        I’m really uncomfortable with this. 

           A cheery waitress approaches the table.

                        Cliff, I really don't think this is 
                        a good idea...

                        How else are we gonna roll into 
                        Philly and beat the shit out of 
                        someone if we don't do a practice 
                        run on a stranger first? This isn't 
                        some fun little jaunt we're going 
                        on.

                        We're at a fuckin' Twisty McNiff's!

           Just then a waiter wearing a sparkler helmet high fives a 
           customer's child and screams "Happy Birthday" into his face.

                                 CLIFF
                        EXACTLY. You wanna find an asshole, 
                        you get yourself to a chain 
                        restaurant.

                        Cliff, I don't know man. What if 
                        they describe us to the police, and 
                        then we're tracked down... We could 
                        go to jail-

                        asshole, someone who REALLY 
                        deserves an ass-kicking. Then 
                        Michael and I follow, and the rest 
                        goes as planned. Now get in there.

                        Fine, I gotta run to the bathroom 
                        first.

           Josh grabs a shoddy briefcase and walks into the bathroom.

                        How will we know who the biggest 
                        asshole is?

                                 CLIFF
                        Oh, we'll know.

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. TWISTY MCNIFF'S BAR - LATER

           Michael and Cliff still sit at the table. 

                                 MICHAEL 
                             (nervously)
                        Where the hell is he? It’s been 15 
                        minutes.

                                 CLIFF
                        Don’t worry. He’s- Oh... Oh God...

           Cliff has looked at the entrance to the bar area. There 
           stands Josh, wearing what appears to be prosthetic makeup- he 
           looks like Eric Stoltz in “Mask”.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What the fuck is that?!

                        He looks like fucking Mask!

                        It’s from this play we did at 
                        school where he had a skeletal 
                        disease. Christ almighty. He must 
                        keep it with all the kid 
                        costumes...

           Josh stands by the bar, looking confused and nervous. He 
           saunters up to a to a bunch of business men.

                                 BUSINESS MAN 1
                        So I say to the lady, "FUCK YOU" 
                        that's who I am!

           All the guys start to laugh.

                                 JOSH
                        BA HA HA HA!  You really told that 
                        bitch!  BA HA HA! Bitches! When 
                        will they learn?!  Know what I 
                        mean?

           Complete silence from all the business men.

                                 BUSINESS MAN 1
                        Who the hell are you?

                        Get the fuck out of here.

                                 JOSH
                        Fair enough!

           Josh saunters over to another area of a bar and sits next to 
           a man in black, who is huddled over a drink.

                                 JOSH (CONT'D)
                        You, dear sir! Let me buy you a

                        What?

           Cliff, with a confused Michael in tow, approaches Josh.

                                 CLIFF
                        Six days to live?! We better get

           A man in a tie from the other end of the bar raises his 
           drink.

                        Funny story, no.  She died.  But I 
                        realize now as I tell it, it's not 
                        that funny. Guess you had to be

                        Don’t be modest!  Bobby Templeton's 
                        wife is dead, this guy over here is 
                        going to die, and my baby girl just 
                        got diagnosed with autism.  I 
                        insist you have a drink with me.

           Drinks are set down in front of the MAN IN BLACK.

                                 MAN IN BLACK
                        Well..uh...I guess...I can’t refuse

           Cliff elbows Michael.

                             (awful acting)
                        Oh God, Don! I totally forgot to 
                        collate those Anderson expenditures 
                        on the horizontal shareholding.  
                        I'll do that right now by going 
                        back to the office.

           Michael leaves.  The bartender comes back and sets the drinks 
           down in front of them.

           The boys lift their glasses to their mouths. When they see 
           that the man has downed his drink they throw theirs over 
           their shoulders. Cliff pockets some peanuts from a bowl.

           EXT. TWISTY MCNIFF’S - LATER

           Cliff and Josh exit the restaurant, holding the drunk MAN IN 
           BLACK.

                                 JOSH

                        Hey guys, I’ll give you a lift. My 
                        Taurus is back here!

           Cliff leads them behind the building. Then, from the shadows, 
           Michael jumps at them, grabbing the man’s arms and holding 
           them behind him. The guys awkwardly wrestle with the man.

                                   CLIFF
                        Everything’s cool! Everything’s

           They drag the man to a back alley and push him against a 
           wall.

                                 JOSH
                        Wait hold on! 

           Josh wrestles with his prosthetic makeup.

                                 CLIFF
                        I can’t hold him!

           The man is squealing in a high pitched voice, wild-eyed. Josh 
           finally gets the makeup off.  Cliff slams the guy against the 
           wall, causing him to double over.

                                 CLIFF

                        nothing personal.  Hadoken!

           Josh hits the man's chest with both palms, which is 
           apparently a maneuver from the Street Fighter video game.

           The man feebly raises a hand towards Cliff, who “deflects” 
           with some supposed martial arts moves and hits the guy in the 
           side of the neck.  It looks like it irritates the guy more 
           than anything. 

           Cliff then quickly steps onto a crate and jumps onto the man, 
           attempting a flying elbow. His elbow misses and the two 
           become entangled, Cliff struggling to get back to his feet.

                        Yeah...I think he's had enough.

                                 JOSH
                        You've gotta be kidding me! I 
                        didn't just punch a stranger for 
                        nothing! I'm not going to jail by 
                        myself.

                                 CLIFF
                        Come on Michael, we gotta practice.

           Michael looks down at the man and tentatively kicks him.

                                 MICHAEL
                        There.

                                 JOSH
                        Great.  It's settled then, we're 
                        gonna get our asses kicked.  Let's 
                        go. 

           Josh starts to walk away.  Michael doesn't move, he just 
           stands still, looking down at the man in black. Suddenly, the 
           man morphs into Kip. 

                                 DREAM KIP
                             (staring right at Michael)
                        That's right, I fucked her.

           Michael's eyes widen. 

                                 DREAM KIP (CONT'D)
                        I did her from behind so I could 
                        watch Sportscenter.

           Michael lunges at the man, furiously choking him.  During the 
           scuffle, various articles start to fall out from the man's 
           pockets.  

                                 MICHAEL 
                        WHY'D YOU FUCK HER!?! SHE’S MINE!!! 

                                 JOSH
                        Cliff-

                        OK, MICHAEL! 
                             (tries to pull him off, 
                              but is thrown aside)

                                 MICHAEL
                        You like that!?  What's up now?!

                                 MAN IN BLACK

                        Oh LOOK! You dropped your things! I 
                        guess you want them back, huh?
                             (picking things up)
                        Oh what we do we have here? A 
                        crucifix?!

                        here! Then you probably want 
                        your... Bible, huh? WHERE’S YOUR 
                        GOD NOW!? 

           Cliff and Josh slowly approach from behind. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        What else do we have down here? 
                        OOOH! A collar! A white collar! A

                        You’re a fucking priest and I’m 
                        going to hell.

                        That’s uh...oooh...that’s my B.

           The boys all look at each other with stunned looks on their 
           faces.  They are going to hell.  Suddenly-

                                 MAN IN BLACK
                             (spitting out the sock 
                              gag)
                        Dear Jesus, please don't stop.  I 
                        deserve to be punished!! 

                                 GUYS
                        What?

                                 MAN IN BLACK
                        My life is full of lies! I've taken 
                        to drink, I'm addicted to scratch 
                        n' wins, and I wear a HAIRPIECE!!!

                                 MICHAEL

           Cliff kicks the man in the stomach.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Cliff!  No!  Look, we made a 
                        terrible mistake.  We’re sorry.  We

                        Polanski.  Excuse us!

           The boys get into the car and speed off. 

                                 MAN IN BLACK
                             (sobbing)

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           The boys are screaming their heads off as Cliff speeds down 
           the highway.

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - EVEN LATER

           All the lights are off as the three boys share the bed. 
           Michael is wide awake, as Cliff sleeps soundly in the middle 
           of the bed. Josh's eyes are shut.

           A slight creak is heard. Michael looks confused. Another 
           creak. And another. It dawns on Michael that those are the 
           sounds of bedsprings. Someone is having sex in the room next 
           door.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Please tell me this isn't 
                        happening.

                             (eyes still closed)
                        It's happening.

           A pause.

                        How'd your parents meet?

                                 JOSH
                        What?

                                 MICHAEL
                        My parents met when my dad was 
                        calling this one girl to ask her on 
                        a date. The sonofabitch called the 
                        wrong number and ended up talking 
                        to my mom for a half an hour. He 
                        asked her out instead, and the rest 
                        is history. They were two years 
                        younger than I am right now...

           A pause.

                                 JOSH
                        My parents were 35 when they met. 
                        My mom was my dad's secretary at an 
                        accounting firm. They were both 
                        married at the time. To other 
                        people. I was conceived in a closet 
                        at an office Christmas party. All 
                        of which I learned at the age of 
                        19, when my half-sister called the 
                        house. 

           Michael's cell phone rings, a very loud obnoxious tune. 
           Michael bolts upright and frantically looks for his phone. He 
           locates it on the other side of the room and picks it up.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hello?

           Through the phone we hear Suzie, obviously drunk. In the 
           background a party rages.

                                 SUZIE
                        Hey.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Suzie? Hey!

           Josh sits up.

                                 SUZIE
                        How are you?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well, I could be better.

                                 SUZIE
                        I probably shouldn't have called 
                        you... It's just- I thought about 
                        you today. About your Elijah Wood 
                        impression.

                        The one where's he got Sean Astin's
                        dick in his mouth?

                        Yeah... This is- I shouldn't have 
                        called.

                                 MICHAEL 
                        No, I'm glad you did, I miss you so 
                        much-

           Josh approaches from behind and rips the phone out of 
           Michael's hands. He hangs it up.

                        gets bored and throws some memory 
                        at you, and you immediately cave?! 
                        You were being a fruity pussy. And 
                        I'm not-

           Michael slaps Josh in the face.

                             (confused)

           Josh pinches Michael's arm.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Ow! You pinched me, you bitch.

                        Well, don't slap me.

           Josh pinches Michael again.

                                 MICHAEL
                        OW! You-

           Michael lunges at Josh and the two begin rolling around, 
           slapping, pinching, pulling hair, and squealing. Cliff wakes 
           up.

                                 CLIFF
                        Woah! What's going on?!

                        Mrff brrf!!!

           Cliff gets out from under the covers and jumps on top of the 
           guys. He's wearing nothing but black briefs.

                                 CLIFF (CONT'D)
                        Break it up you two!

                        Ew! Cliff get off me! You're not 
                        even doing anything to me! Ugh, I

                                 CLIFF
                        YIELD!!!

           The boys suddenly hear someone clear their throat and look up 
           to see the NIGHT MANAGER standing in the open door to their 
           room. He's holding a set of keys.

           Josh and Michael look accusingly at Cliff.

                        You have five minutes to leave. 
                        Otherwise, I'll have my eleven year 
                        old daughter come in here and beat 
                        the three of you to a pulp.

           INT CLIFF'S CAR - NEXT DAY

           A sign reading "TULSA 250 MILES" is passed in the car. The 
           three boys are silently listening to the Eurythmics' "Sweet 
           Dreams", until:

                                 CLIFF
                        I would have kicked the shit out of 
                        the cocksucker's daughter.

                                 JOSH
                        He was huge though, his off spring

                        I bet she doesn't know martial 
                        arts, my man.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Do you?

           Cliff nods proudly.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Why did we never know that? Josh 
                        did you?

           Josh shakes his head.

                        There's so much about me, you don't 
                        know, boys.

                                 JOSH
                        Fuck.  Lost another station.  

           Cliff starts to fiddle with the dial.

                        Good evening, a car bomb went off 
                        in Baghdad this morning claiming 
                        the lives of 137 Iraqi civilians 
                        and sixteen U.S. Soldiers --

                        I've never been more depressed in 
                        my life. We need to be getting 
                        pummped up right now. Go back to 
                        fucking Creed.

           Cliff does. A ballad plays.

                        Those guys are younger than us.  

           A beat.

                        Fucking soldiers, dude. Out there

                                 MICHAEL 
                        You ever wonder what it would be 
                        like if we were in the army?

                                 CLIFF
                        The three of us in the army would 
                        be amazing.  We'd be unstoppable.  
                        We'd combine our unique skills to 
                        become a elite fighting unit.

           EXT. PHILADELPHIA SKYLINE - LATE AFTERNOON

           A quick montage as the guys drive past a sign that says 
           “Philadelphia 17 miles”. We see the car drive past several 
           Philly landmarks, like the LOVE sign, Benjamin Franklin’s 
           statue, the Rocky steps, etc.

           EXT. UPENN CAMPUS - DAY 

           The boys exit Cliff's parked car, stretching.

                                 JOSH
                        Alright, Mike. What's the plan?

                                 MICHAEL
                        To find the guy that's been fucking 
                        my girlfriend and beat the shit out 
                        of him. Then win her back.

                                 JOSH
                        Right.

           The guys start walking.

                        We should've had more sex in 
                        college.

                                 JOSH
                        We should've just HAD sex in 
                        college. Where are we going, by the 
                        way?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well, I figure the best way to find 
                        Kip is through Suzie. And on 
                        Thursday's she has Economics. Which 
                        if I remember right, is in this 
                        building.

           Michael stops 30 yards away from a large building. 

                                 JOSH
                        Wait, Michael, you really think you 
                        can see Suzie and be fine?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Please. I'm a professional. Plus, 
                        we don't have to talk to her, all 
                        we gotta do is follow her. I'll be 
                        fine.

           Michael turns around to see Suzie exiting the building. She 
           stops to check her cell phone.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                             (eyes widen)
                        Oh my god... Baby girl. BABY. 

           Michael immediately pulls out a folded piece of paper from 
           his pocket. 

                                 JOSH
                        Oh shit, it's the collage.

           Michael starts walking straight for Suzie.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Pooh bear your honey pot has come 
                        for you! 

                                 CLIFF
                        Mikey!

           Josh and Cliff start to follow after Michael. Just then, 
           Suzie is picked up from behind by a tall, muscular guy with 
           long hair. It's Kip, in the flesh. He turns her around and 
           plants a huge kiss on her cheek.

           Michael's face shifts into a rage.

                                 MICHAEL 
                        WHAT THE-

           BAM!  Michael is tackled by Cliff and Josh who hold him down 
           as he goes into a fit.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        You motherfucker!  I'll fucking 
                        kill you-

           Josh tries to put his hand over Michael's mouth, as they roll 
           behind a bush.

                                 JOSH
                        CALM DOWN!  CALM DOWN!

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Josh pinches Michael. Michael slaps Josh. Cliff is attempting 
           the same wrestling move he tried in the motel.

                                 CLIFF
                        Yield!  Yield!

           We see Suzie and Kip talking while in the background a bush 
           furiously shakes about. 

                                 SUZIE
                        Kip!  You're always sneaking up 
                        behind me....

                                 KIP
                        Guilty.

                                 SUZIE
                        What a lovely surprise...

                                 KIP
                        You're a lovely surprise... Mmm, 
                        you smell so good and shit.

           Michael, Josh and Cliff continue to wrestle on the ground 
           behind the bush.

                                 CLIFF
                        Boys!  We can't tear ourselves 
                        apart like this or the assholes
                        win.  We've got to keep it 
                        together!

           The boys separate and roll onto their backs huffing and 
           puffing. Meanwhile, Kip says his goodbyes to Suzie and heads 
           off.

                                 JOSH
                             (jumps up)
                        They're on the move.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Alright alright. Look, you two 
                        follow Kip. We need to know where 
                        he goes, who his people are, 
                        everything. I'll stay here and 
                        stalk Suzie.

                                 JOSH

           Cliff disappears, leaving Josh to follow Kip. Nervously, Josh 
           puts on a mustache.

           staring after her, picks up the muddied collage and follows.

           INT. UPENN STUDENT COMMONS - DAY

           Kip is sitting with a bunch of his fraternity brothers at one 
           of the tables. They're laughing and being obnoxious. Several 
           tables away, Josh is staring at them, drinking a smoothie. 
           His mustache remains intact, but he now wears sunglasses as 
           well.  Kip and his friends argue about which is the better 
           Austin Powers movie.

                        What terrible people...

           Just then, an ATTRACTIVE GIRL walks up to Josh with a plate 
           of brownies.

                                 GIRL
                        Would you like a brownie on behalf

                                 JOSH
                        God yes. I haven't eaten in two 
                        days.

                        I know Mom, it's really weird: I 
                        never go out two nights in a row... 
                        I'm actually ENJOYING college. For 
                        the first time... 

           Michael listens intently.

           Cliff and Professor Atherton enter a huge lecture hall full

                        for her.  He's a PHD student in

                        continuing on the journey or living 
                        an existence with no meaning.

           Some of them are clapping.  

                                 CLIFF
                        No one talks to Professor Cliff 
                        Charles Stavaros Cliffson that way!

                        those who stay!   

           He waves a pack of cigarettes at the exiting students.  Soon 
           the class is empty except for Josh.

                        I was into it.

           EXT: PENN CAMPUS - EARLY EVENING

           Cliff is on his cell phone talking to Michael while a dazed 
           Josh follows behind him.

                                 CLIFF
                        Alright, we'll see you in 15.  
                        Okay, so Michael's going to meet us 
                        at the bar.

                                 JOSH
                        Cool.  Man, Kip really obliterated 
                        you back there.  First Michael's 
                        girlfriend, then your pride.  This 
                        guy is a fucking assassin!

                                 CLIFF
                        I COULD HAVE PUT HIM IN HIS PLACE 
                        IF I WANTED TO- Wait, are you 
                        stoned?

                                 JOSH
                        Totally.  Here hold up a sec.  Keep 
                        talking.

           Josh starts running in place.

                                 CLIFF
                        What are you doing?

                                 JOSH
                        I'm running in place to speed up my 
                        metabolism.  To get sober.

                        Jesus, I can't believe you're

                        wrong, you have to get on your back 
                        and bicycle kick in the air.  Like 
                        this.

           Cliff gets on his back to show him.  Josh joins him.

           INT. DUBLIN'S BAR - LATER

           Kip is holding court with a group of students.  He is the 
           life of the party.  Everyone is laughing.

                                 KIP
                        So yeah, I mean this Campbell stuff 
                        is all over the first Star Wars.  
                        That one scene, where they are in 
                        the bar.  That's like when Campbell 
                        talks about meeting your enemies 
                        and allies.  Luke meets Han Solo 
                        despite the fact that Obi Wan calls 
                        it "A retched hive of scum and 
                        tyranny."

           People ooh and ahh.  A guy high fives him.  Girls melt for 
           some reason.  About 15 feet away with their backs turned, 
           Josh and Cliff sit with beers.

                                 JOSH
                        It's "retched hive of scum and 
                        VILLAINY" you pretentious fuck.

           Through the door Michael comes in looking like hell. 

                                 CLIFF
                              (whispering) 
                        Mikey!  Over here.

           Michael makes his way over to the table.  

                                 JOSH
                        Alright, lemme get you caught up.  
                        I got stoned, wasn't my fault, 
                        Cliff taught a comparative lit 
                        class, but was humiliated by Kip, 
                        who 5 seconds ago misquoted Star 
                        Wars, and now we hate him more than 
                        ever and want blood. 

           Michael stares blankly back at him.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           Cliff grabs two salt shakers and a pepper shaker.

                        So here's the plan.  It's Twisty

                        time we know what we're doing.  
                        Josh slaps the mustache on and 
                        fakes a seizure-

                                 MICHAEL
                        We're leaving.

                        What?

                                 MICHAEL
                        We're going home.  The mission is 
                        over.  We failed.  We're leaving.

                                 JOSH
                        Mikey, you can't quit on us now.  I

                        guy now more than ever. We can't 
                        stop now.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes, we can.  Guys, it's over.  I 
                        lost.  He won.  He may be an 
                        asshole, but he's got her and she's 
                        happy.  Let's go. Maybe if we get 
                        back by Sunday I can beg Barry for 
                        my job back.

                                 JOSH 
                        I can't fucking believe this!    

                                 MICHAEL
                        I'm going to the bathroom and then 
                        let's get the hell out of here.

           Michael gets up and wanders to the back of the bar --

           INT. BATHROOM DUBLIN'S BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Michael opens the door and proceeds to the bathroom.  A frat 
           guy is washing his hands.  Michael nods and heads to the 
           urinal.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        urinal, I took a shit in there!  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Delightful.

           The frat guy exits.  Michael sighs and heads to the stall.  
           He unzips his pants and starts to pee. Suddenly, we hear soft 
           moans coming from the adjacent stall.

                                 GIRL'S VOICE
                        Oh God, yes. I want you in my

                                 GUY'S VOICE
                        Well, say "ah". Doctor's gotta 
                        check those tonsils.

           Michael shudders.

                                 GUY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                        And don't look me in the eyes. I 
                        can't stay hard if you- Oh. 
                        Volcano!

           Michael quickly buckles his pants and turns to leave. He goes 
           to the sink.

                                 GIRL'S VOICE
                        Dammnit, this is a new shirt.

                        Jesus! 

           The girl quickly exits the stall. We see that it's Heather 
           from Cliff's class. She sees Michael and bolts out of the 
           bathroom. The guy then emerges. It's Kip. Michael sees him in 
           the mirror, his eyes widen.

                                 KIP
                             (walking to the sink)

           He walks out. Michael watches him go. Then turns and looks at 
           himself in the mirror, balling his fists.

                        face getting it on with some girl 
                        in the bathroom.  It's obvious that

                        I care deeply about. I may have

           Cliff moves to get out of his seat and go after Kip.  Michael 
           and Josh restrain him.

           Someone hands the boys a flyer.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well, that works.

           EXT. LAMBDA SIGMA DELTA FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT

           We see three figures standing on top of a hill. Ahead of them 
           about 100 yards away is a huge Victorian frat house where 
           loud music plays.  A huge banner lays across the building 
           that says "LSE welcomes you to the Full Moon Frat-cas.

           Josh pulls a mask over his face.  He's wearing his Teenage 
           Mutant Ninja Turtle outfit.  

           We pan over to see Cliff in his Spiderman costume, and 
           Michael wearing a purple Willy Wonka outfit complete with a 
           cane.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I gotta tell you, I feel like a 
                        real badass right now.

                                 CLIFF
                        Yeah.

                                 JOSH
                        Me too.

           The three of them, Willy Wonka, Spiderman, and Raphael start 
           walking towards the house.

                                 MICHAEL
                        So, I'm sure y'all don't want to 
                        hear this, but I ran into Rachel 
                        today and she said this Kip guy is 
                        a real maniac.

                                 CLIFF
                        Rachel?  Suzie's lesbo roommate?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I've told you, she's not a lesbian.

                                 CLIFF
                        Chick's got a nose ring... 

                                 JOSH
                        That's not indicative of sexual 
                        preference, idiot.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Buddy, my dykedar is second to 
                        none.  If that girl doesn't eat 
                        carpet, I'm a horse's ass.  

           Josh and Mike share a look.

                                 CLIFF (CONT'D)
                        In fact, I'll put 10 bucks on it.

                                 JOSH
                        Fine, it's all monopoly money at 
                        this point.

           They’re almost at the house.  Michael stops and beckons the 
           boys.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Let's do this.

                                 CLIFF 
                        If we get separated, the rendezvous 
                        point is... 
                             (looking up and down the 
                              street)
                        Where light never falls and 
                        darkness is our cloak-

                                 MICHAEL
                        How bout the Student Union?

                                 CLIFF
                        Fine.

                                 JOSH
                        Fine.

           They enter the party.

           INT. LAMBDA SIGMA DELTA FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT

           An army of COLLEGE KIDS all wearing various costumes are 
           partying and participating in various "party" activities.

           In the middle of the party, a DJ spins 80's music while 90 
           kids or so go crazy on the dance floor.  Various other kids 
           sing, make out, do keg stands and just generally have the 
           time of their lives.  

           The boys stare at the chaos with equal parts disgust and 
           longing.  Michael snaps out of it.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Let's split up and find our boy.

           The guys split up and start asking around --

           INT. FRAT HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Cliff is walking around the kitchen.  Checking girls out.

                                 RANDOM GIRL
                        Hey look it's Professor Cliffson! 

           A bunch of people cheer. Michael approaches, and stares down 
           Cliff. 

                                 CLIFF 
                        Um, have any of you seen that Kip 
                        guy from class?

                                 RANDOM GIRL
                        I think he's outside.

                                 MICHAEL
                        C’mon, let's grab Josh and move.

                                 CLIFF
                             (turning back)
                        Who's the coolest BA of them all?

                                 CROWD
                        YOU ARE!!!

           EXT. BACK YARD OF LAMDA SIGMA DELTA - CONTINUOUS

           The guys walk in the back where Chili lights and tiki torches 
           decorate the yard.  Most people hang out by the keg smoking 
           cigarettes. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Keep at it.

           The guys split up. We see Michael ask several people with no 
           results. Michael gets more and more frustrated. He looks for 
           the guys. He sees Josh talking to a GIRL IN A YELLOW JUMPSUIT 
           with white boots. She’s holding a video camera. 

                                 JOSH
                             (to the girl, taking his 
                              mask off)
                        I don’t fucking believe it! You’re 
                        dressed as April O’Neill!! From the 
                        Ninja Turtles!

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                        You’re goddamn right I am! You’re 
                        the first person to notice...

                                 JOSH
                        You don’t even know... If I got 
                        down on my knees right now and 
                        asked you to marry me, would you?!

                                 APRIL
                        Only if you owned an XBOX 360!

                                 JOSH
                        AHH!!!

           Michael turns to his left and sees CLIFF handing out beers to 
           various people, laughing.

                                 CLIFF
                        You could read the Art of War by 
                        Sun Tzu, which I find quite 
                        amateurish, or you could pick up 
                        The Tao of Pooh by Benjamin 
                        Something-or-other.

           He pauses for a second, reflective.

                                 CLIFF (CONT'D)
                        Man, that book really changed my 
                        whole perspective.

           Michael has had enough.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Jesus, guys WHAT THE FUCK!? 
                             (to the entire party)
                        HEY!!! KIP RICE!  KIP RICE!  I AM 
                        LOOKING FOR KIP RICE!!!

           The whole party quiets down, Josh and Cliff quietly move 
           towards Michael. THREE GUYS dressed as NINJA's move forward.  
           Michael is startled by what he just said.

                                 NINJA 1
                        Hey, Willy, we know Kip.  Is there 
                        a problem?

                                 MICHAEL
                        No, no problem here.  I-I just want 
                        to have a few words with him.

                        brothers so we can deal with any 
                        problem you might have.

                                 JOSH
                        Oh fuck, the frat guys are Ninjas.

                                 MICHAEL
                        So he’s not here?  

                                 NINJA 2
                        He might be, but see we’re 
                        screening all his calls tonight.  
                        How can we help you?

                                 JOSH
                             (to Michael)
                        If he’s not here let’s just take 
                        off-

                                 MICHAEL
                        I can handle this.

                                 CLIFF
                        No fear!

                                 MICHAEL
                        (turns to Cliff and Josh)
                        I got this Cliff...

           Michael looks back at the Ninjas, he's scared, but doesn't 
           want to back down.  His adrenaline is pumping and he can't 
           control himself.  

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Yeah, I got a message.  
                             (clearing his throat)
                        You can tell Kip to watch his 
                        fucking back because I’m gonna find 
                        him and fuck his face!  

           Laughter.  Cliff and Josh both look down, ashamed.  

                                 NINJA 3
                        So... You’re gonna have sex with 
                        his face... Cool.  I’ll give him 
                        that message.

                        Let's just get this over with.

           The ninja starts to pour beer all over Michael's head.  The 
           second and third ninja join in.  They all laugh.  It drips 
           all down Michael's hat and drenches him.  The Frat Ninjas and 
           the kids laugh.  

                                 JOSH
                              (steps forward) 
                        Let’s go Michael.

           Michael, defeated, starts to turnaround

                                 SUZIE O.S.
                        Holy Christ.  Michael!?

           Michael turns around to see SUZIE dressed as DOROTHY from the 
           Wizard of Oz.  They lock eyes.  She clearly doesn't know 
           whether to be happy or pissed. Michael's heart is beating a 
           mile a minute.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hey.  Suzie.  Um, hey-

           Suzie runs up and hugs Michael. Then immediately pulls away.

                                 SUZIE
                        What the fuck are you doing here? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Um...I...

                        Hey Suz, is Willy Fag-a and the 
                        oompa loompa fag-a's bothering 
                        you?!

           All the guys laugh at the lame joke.  

                                 NINJA 1 (CONT'D)
                             (to other ninjas)
                        You see, putting fag at the end of 
                        something makes it funnier.

           They all nod in agreement.  Cliff grabs Michael's hat and 
           steps forward.

                        Ha ha!  Funny, funny FUN-NAY!  

           The crowd silences as Cliff comes face to face with the 
           Ninjas.

                        on someone your own size.

           Cliff is still about a foot shorter than the smallest Ninja.  
           A huge Ninja steps forward from the back.  He's the ROIDS 
           ASSHOLE of the group.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (horrified)
                        Okay Cliff-

                                 SUZIE
                        What the hell is going on?

                                 CLIFF
                        Hey Suze. (he winks at her.)

           Cliff finishes his beer throws it to the ground and then 
           bows.

                                 CLIFF (CONT'D)
                        Now, I’ve never faced a Ninja 
                        before, but I think I’m up to the 
                        challenge.  Joshy, give me a beat.

                                 JOSH
                        Cliff, let's get the hell out of 
                        here.

                                 CLIFF
                        Just give me a beat bro.

                                 JOSH
                        I thought you knew a martial art.

                                 CLIFF
                        I do, it just needs a beat.

                                 JOSH
                        What the fuck kinda martial art is 
                        this?

                                 CLIFF
                        GIVE ME THE GODDAMN BEAT! YOU”RE 
                        EMBARRASSING ME!

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (5)

           Josh hesitantly starts clapping his hands.  

                                 CLIFF (CONT'D)
                        That's good. Now jazz it up a 
                        little...

           Cliff begins to dance around in front of the Ninja, 
           performing a bastardized version of capoeira. He’s cagey and 
           balletic as he moves around.  Josh claps fiercely and 
           offbeat.  The ninja’s look confused.  

           Cliff works himself up furiously darting around and cart 
           wheeling.  He approaches the Ninja who promptly punches him 
           square in the face.  

                                 CLIFF (CONT'D)
                             (high pitched and whiney)
                        OWWW!  My nose!

           He and his buddies slap hands and laugh.  Cliff composes 
           himself and then walks over and extends his hand.  

                                 CLIFF (CONT'D)
                        You beat me.  Fair and square, 
                        let's just shake, and we'll be on 
                        our way. 

           Everyone laughs.

                                 NINJA 4
                        Ha, fine,
                             (extending his hand)
                        If this will get-

           BAM!  Cliff slaps the Ninja with Michael's wet hat across his 
           face.  Ninja 4 stumbles backwards disoriented.

                                 CLIFF
                        Ohhhh, didn’t like that did you 
                        Frat Ninja?  Don’t fuck with us.

           All of the Ninjas start to approach the boys.  

                                 NINJA 1
                        You guys really picked the wrong 
                        house.  BOYS!

           Then out of nowhere 6 more NINJA's approach. They vary in 
           shapes and sizes. Some fat, some short, all carrying red cups 
           full of alcohol.  They begin to surround the boys.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh shit. RUN!!

           Josh and Cliff take off through the back door.  

           Michael grabs Suzie's hand and sprints towards the front of 
           the house.  The ninjas split up and pursue them.

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Cliff dashes through the kitchen still holding his nose with 
           Josh right behind him.

           Josh can sense one of the ninjas getting closer so he slides 
           over a kitchen table and opens up the refrigerator door into 
           one of their faces as Cliff exits into the party. 

           Suddenly a Ninja jumps onto Josh's back and begins choking 
           him.  Josh backs up and into the stove, he gropes around and 
           accidentally turns on the range, burning his assailant who 
           immediately lets go. 

           Josh turns around and punches the Ninja in the face, but 
           hurts the hell out of his hand.  All the random people in the 
           kitchen begin to clap.  

                                 JOSH
                             (clutching his hand)
                        Aaagh!!

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. FRAT HOUSE STAIRWAY

           Cliff runs up a stairway but is tripped by a pursuing NINJA 
           and falls on his face.  He tries to crawl upstairs but the 
           Ninja is trying to pull him down; he can’t get away. 

           Cliff frantically pulls out a cigarette, lights it, turns 
           around and burns the Ninja’s hand.  The Ninja, stunned, lets 
           go of CLIFF’s leg.  

           Cliff scurries up the stairs.  Suddenly another NINJA comes 
           rushing at him from down the hall.  

           Cliff back peddles and stops right in front of a couple 
           making out.  Cliff takes a look and realizes it’s Heather 
           wearing a princess outfit.  He taps her on the shoulder.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 CLIFF
                        Baby, can you help your BA out with 
                        something?

                                 HEATHER
                        What now you perv!  Can't you see- 

           The Ninja fast approaching throws back his arm to punch.  
           Cliff takes the girl and violently pushes her in front of 
           him.  The Ninja connects with the Heather's face.  They both 
           go down.  

           Suddenly another NINJA ducks out of a room and starts heading 
           towards him.  Cliff runs and stops in front of a space where 
           an ironing board is in the wall.

                                 NINJA 4
                             (running)
                        I’M GONNA FUCKING KILL YOU!

           Cliff pulls out the ironing board and it catches the Ninja in 
           the stomach, clothes-lining him.

                                 CLIFF
                             (smiling)
                        Ha.  You’ve been ironed.

           He looks up to see a CHUNKY AWKWARD LOOKING GIRL at the end 
           of the hall. She shakes her head disapprovingly. 

                                 CLIFF (CONT'D)
                        Fuck you.

           Cliff takes off running. He ducks into a room --

           EXT FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT

           Michael and Suzie run along the side of the house pursued by 
           several Ninjas.  They reach a dead end with a locked gate.

           Michael furiously tries to get the gate to open but it won't. 
           He grabs Suzie and ducks back into a side door--

           INT. FRAT HOUSE DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Michael and Suzie are right in front of the dance floor.  
           Michael scans the room for exits, but sees none.  He sees a 
           kid dressed as the shower from the Karate Kid in the middle 
           of the dance floor and gets an idea. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           As Ninjas approach, he grabs Suzie and runs into the middle 
           of the dance floor --

           INT SHOWER GUY COSTUME 

           Michael and Suzie come up into the shower costume. The shower 
           guy is drunk off his ass and doesn’t even notice.  Michael 
           begins steering the shower towards the exit.    

                                 SUZIE
                        Michael, what the hell is going 
                        on!?  Why are you here?  Why did 
                        you pick a fight with the LSE
                        Ninjas?

                                 MICHAEL
                        First of all, the whole ninja thing 
                        wasn't part of the plan, ok? The 
                        plan was to drive out here-

                                 SUZIE
                        You guys DROVE out here?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah. Drive out here and- Wait, 
                        move left!

                                 SHOWER GUY
                        JILL?!

           Michael keeps maneuvering the shower --

           INT FRAT HOUSE DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           THE NINJA’s POV as they see a shower quickly heading towards 
           the back.  

                                 NINJA
                        That must be them!

           The Ninjas race through the crowd of dancing students 
           searching for the shower.

           Eventually they all reach the other side of the dance floor.  

                                 NINJA 1
                        Over there!

           CONTINUED:

           Against a wall we see the shower costume leaning against a 
           wall.  The Ninjas grab the curtain and pull it back revealing 
           only the drunk shower guy.

                                 NINJA 
                        Damn, where did he go!

           INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM - NIGHT

           Cliff is face down on the floor, presumably in the same 
           position he was when he dove in there. Al Green plays on a 
           stereo and the entire room is lit with black lights.  It's 
           full of frat boys making out with girls and the air is thick 
           with marijuana smoke. 

           Cliff begins to crawl forward on his hands and knees, like 
           he’s in a trench.  Suddenly, the door whips open. Josh runs 
           in, panting. The make-outers don’t notice. 

                                 JOSH
                             (whispering)

                        Jesus! We gotta get the hell out of

                        I don’t know. I took off into the 
                        kitchen. It was fucking amazing-

           The door whips open. Josh and Cliff grab each other and 
           scream like women.  

           Michael and Suzie enter.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Quick they're coming! Hide!

                        The closet!  Get in the closet!

           The four of them run into the closet. They all stand in 
           silence. A slight smacking is heard. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        You guys hear something?

           He turns and bumps into two people making out. One is Rachel, 
           Suzie's roommate, the other is a girl.

                                 SUZIE

                        I want my 10 bucks!

           Suddenly, the closet door flies open. The awkward, chunky 
           girl from the hall points a finger at the closet as three 
           Ninjas make to grab the guys. 

                                 GUYS
                        SHIT!!!

           They are pulled from the closet and surrounded by the Ninjas.

                                 NINJA 1
                        Alright you motherfuckers.  No one 
                        comes into our house-

           A wild look comes over Cliff's face.

                                 CLIFF
                             (running to the nearest

                        Every man for himself!! Rendezvous 
                        Rendezvous!!!

           Cliff throws himself through the window.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Cliff!!  What the fuck!?

           CONTINUED: (2)

           Everyone, including the Ninjas, look at the broken window and 
           then outside at Cliff, who's lying in a heap of glass and 
           broken window pane.

           Michael stops and grabs Josh.

                                 JOSH
                        Rendezvous.

           They split up, with Michael and Suzie running out the front 
           door and Josh running to the back yard. 

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. FRAT HOUSE 

           Michael and Suzie run up the hill towards the center of 
           campus.

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. FRAT HOUSE BACKYARD

           Josh looks around at the spot where Cliff landed but he's 
           nowhere to be found.  He jumps the fence and takes off. 

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. FRAT HOUSE FRONT YARD

           Ninjas everywhere run in all directions out of the house. 

           INT FRAT HOUSE ROOM - NIGHT

           Kip is passionately making out with a hot GIRL on a futon.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 GIRL
                        Oh god...do me Kipper.

                                 KIP
                        SHHHH!  What'd I say about talking!

           Suddenly a frat Ninja busts through the door.

                                 FRAT NINJA
                        Hey dude, we've got a situation.

           Kip throws off the chick and stands up.

                                 GIRL
                        Ow!

                                 KIP
                        What's going on?

                                 FRAT NINJA
                        Some dude dressed as Willy Wonka 
                        said he was looking for you and 
                        then one of his buddies hit Dan in 
                        the face.  I think it was the TA 
                        from comparative religion class.

                                 KIP
                        Cliffson?  

                                 FRAT NINJA
                        Then Wonka grabbed Suzie and they 
                        took off.

                                 KIP
                        MY Suzie?! Let's roll.

           Kip and the other Ninja take off as the girl just lies in a 
           clump on the floor.  

           EXT: PENN CAMPUS - NIGHT

           Suzie and Michael are running on a huge lawn.  Suzie stops. 
           Michael keeps running.

                                 SUZIE
                        Alright Michael! Stop! STOP!

           Michael turns around and slows down, putting his hands on his 
           knees.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What!?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 SUZIE
                        Michael, why the hell are you 
                        here?!

                                 MICHAEL
                        The truth?

                                 SUZIE
                        Yeah.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Josh and Cliff got into a fight 
                        over how many steps Rocky climbed 
                        and we figured the best way to 
                        settle it was-

                                 SUZIE
                        I don't need this shit.  See ya.

           She starts to walk away.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Fine!  Bye!  

           Michael looks around completely lost.  He turns around and 
           jogs back towards Suzie.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Just do me one last fucking favor, 
                        look at it as a parting gift or 
                        something, just point out the 
                        direction of the student union.  
                        I've got a rendezvous to get to.

           Suzie points left.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Thanks!

                                 SUZIE
                        You're welcome! 

           Michael turns around and walks behind her.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You know Suz, some chicks would 
                        find it ROMANTIC that their ex-
                        boyfriend drove 2000 miles to-

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 SUZIE
                        Romantic!?  Is that what this is?  
                        You're in a fucking Willy Wonka 
                        outfit!  Somewhere on campus your 
                        buddies Spiderman and Raphael the 
                        mutant Ninja Turtle are running 
                        amok.  You're going to get your 
                        asses kicked by frat Ninjas.  This 
                        is not romance, it's a Saturday 
                        morning cartoon!

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh I'm sorry, would you like me to 
                        crush a beer on my head and 
                        serenade you with the Spin Doctors?  
                        Hey, have you seen that bitch God 
                        around here because I need to know 
                        where my laundry is!

           Michael turns and walks away.  Suzie turns around and walks 
           towards him.

                                 SUZIE
                        At least he has a life!  At least 
                        he doesn't spend every second 
                        analyzing "tone" in my email or 
                        obsessing over what my friends 
                        think of him.

           Suzie turns and walks away.  Michael turns around and walks 
           towards her.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oooh, low blow Ali! It's a good 
                        thing I've lost the ability to feel 
                        pain now that I've got a permanent 
                        image burned into my brain of you 
                        and Bigfoot on my computer screen.  

           Michael turns and walks away.  Suzie turns around and walks 
           towards him.

                                 SUZIE
                        Michael, I'm sorry about that.  
                        It's not how I wanted to...it 
                        wasn't fair.  But it was the right 
                        decision.  We're broken.  That's 
                        why they call it a breakup.  Let it 
                        go.

           Suzie turns and walks away.  Michael turns around and stands 
           there defeated.  He's about to walk towards the Student Union 
           when he notices something.

                                 MICHAEL 
                        Oh, I'm the one who needs to let 
                        go!?  Yet you're the rock of 
                        Gibraltar still wearing the bean 
                        necklace I gave you for our second 
                        anniversary!  

                                 SUZIE
                        Whatever, it's just a nice piece of 
                        jewelry.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Then take it off.  You never EVER 
                        wore jewelry before we met.  It was 
                        one of the reasons I was first 
                        attracted to you.  

           Suzie stops and turns around.

                                 SUZIE
                        You want me to take it off?

                                 MICHAEL 
                        Yeah!

                                 SUZIE
                        Fine.  Indian giver.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh you know that's not what this is-

                                 SUZIE
                        Here.  I'll- Fuck, I can't get it-

           Michael comes up behind her.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Here, let me.  

           He fiddles with the strap.

                                 SUZIE
                             (giggling)
                        Ha.  My neck. That tickles.

                        I'm just trying to-

                        your dirty neck and- FUCK!  NINJAS!

           He pushes Suzie to the ground.  Running past a nearby 
           building are three ninjas. Michael and Suzie crawl behind a 
           bush.

           Josh has ducked behind a lamppost and is hiding as he sees 2 
           NINJA’s crossing a bridge in front of him.  He’s trying not 
           to move.  

           They don’t see him, and he’s almost in the clear, when APRIL 
           O’NEIL comes walking down the other way with two friends. She 
           sees Josh ducking behind the lamppost.

                                 APRIL

                        go mutant ninja boy?!

           Josh squirms and turns around to shush her when the NINJA’s 
           who were walking away start to come back towards him.  

                                 JOSH
                        Oh...oh no...shhh...

                        What’s the matter?!  

           The Ninja’s still pretty far away, pick up their pace.

                                 JOSH
                        Look, God must be trying to punish 
                        me or something, I'm really sorry 
                        but you've got to shut the fuck up 
                        right now.

                                 APRIL
                        What?!

           Josh grabs her and pulls her behind the lamppost.  April 
           shocked starts to squirm. The ninja's quicken their pace.

                                 GIRL 1
                        Let her go!

           Josh’s eyes widen. The Ninja’s start to run, and then Josh 
           grabs April’s hand and starts running with her.  They 
           disappear into the night as the Ninjas give chase.

           EXT. UPENN CAMPUS NIGHT

           Cliff is limping around campus.  He's confused and battered 
           with a tattered Spiderman outfit.

           He looks in every direction and then falls to the ground.

                                 CLIFF

           Michael and Suzie are still quietly lying behind the bush 
           they dove behind. Michael checks and sees that the coast is 
           clear.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Ok. I'm leaving your life. You can 
                        send me the necklace.

           Michael moves to get up.

                        Michael, wait, I don't want to end 
                        like this.

                        The plan was to come out here, beat 
                        up that Kip guy, and win you back. 
                        Which is quickly becoming less and

                                 SUZIE
                        But you've never been in a fight.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, I was gonna figure that one 
                        out as I went. 

                                 SUZIE
                        I don't understand why you'd do 
                        that... That's really un-Michael
                        Davidson.

                                 MICHAEL
                        No, it is. Because I love you, and 
                        I was willing to try anything if it 
                        was a chance to get you back. But 
                        look- there's a fine line between 
                        love and obsession. I realize that. 
                        And I'm sorry for the times when I 
                        accidentally put pressure on you. 
                        But I also don't want to feel 
                        guilty for loving you. It's weird- 
                        I've never been so angry at someone 
                        and loved them so much at the same 
                        time... 

                                 SUZIE
                             (starts to tear up)
                        Michael, I'm so sorry that I hurt 
                        you. It's just- I don't know what-

                                 MICHAEL
                        Suzie, it's fine. You've made a 
                        choice, and I have to live with it.

                                 SUZIE
                        I don't know why you love me so 
                        much...

                                 MICHAEL
                        You're Suzie.

           Suzie hugs Michael. He's surprised at first, and then hugs 
           her back, trying to sort everything out in his head. They 
           hold each other for a moment. Their faces start to drift 
           closer and closer. They kiss.

           Suzie pulls away abruptly.

                                 SUZIE 
                        Um... Yeah...

           Silence.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        We should go.

                                 SUZIE

                                 JOSH
                        I feel a little nervous out in the 
                        open like this.

                                 APRIL
                        Well, you told me you had to get to 
                        the Student Union, right? 

                                 JOSH
                             (looking around)

                                 APRIL
                        For a vigilante, you’re kind of a 
                        pussy.

                                 JOSH
                        Well that’s the whole point of 
                        becoming a vigilante...  

                                 APRIL
                        I don’t really follow.

                                 JOSH
                        This may be difficult to realize, 
                        but I’m not exactly the most self-
                        confident of people. 

                                 APRIL
                        Well, you approached me at that 
                        party with no problem.

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, but I was wearing this Ninja 
                        outfit and really didn't give a 
                        fuck anymore. Usually I can’t speak 
                        to women. 

                                 APRIL
                        You’re speaking to me.

                                 JOSH
                        That’s because I’m too worried 
                        about dying.

                                 APRIL
                        Well maybe you should always worry 
                        about dying. It makes you cute. 

           Suddenly, a faint whimpering is heard.

                        What the hell is that?

           The whimpering grows louder and becomes gentle sobbing. Josh 
           looks around for the source and sees nothing. Then he looks 
           up above him... Cliff is sitting on a tree branch, wearing 
           the spiderman top and crying his eyes out.

                                 JOSH 
                        Oh my God... Cliff!?

           Josh pulls out a cigarette and lights it, somewhat awkwardly.

           We cut to Josh settling himself next to a shaken Cliff on the 
           branch.  Josh has the cigarette in his mouth, which he takes 
           out and hands it to Cliff.

                        Well we’ll work on that.

                        Ok.

           He starts climbing down. Josh looks down to April and mouths 
           something like “I have no idea how that worked...” 

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT: PENN COURTYARD - NIGHT

           Cliff walks next to APRIL and JOSH who are engaged in a deep 
           conversation.  He’s talking a mile a minute but they don’t 
           hear anything he’s saying.

                           CLIFF
                                                          APRIL
                                              What was your major?
           My brothers man, they just 
           don’t GET what I do...

                                                          JOSH
                                              ...you haven’t even seen me 
                                              act. How can you say that?
                           CLIFF
           ...Plus my car needs a lot of 
           work so that’s been on my 
           mind...

                                                          APRIL
                                              ...I’m positive. We’re here 
                                              by the way.
           ...if I can just get 120 
           bucks, I can sign up for this 
           long distance "network".

           They stop.

                                 JOSH
                        Hmm?

                                 APRIL
                        The student union.

           The guys see Michael and Suzie peering from behind an 
           archway.

                                 CLIFF
                        Mikey!!!

           They run to the archway. The guys all hug.

                                 JOSH
                        Suzie, this is April.

                                 APRIL
                        Actually, my name is-

           Josh claps his hands to his ears.

                        Oh shit, fuckin' Ninjas...

           Everyone hides behind the archway as a couple Ninjas run by.

                                 NINJA 1
                        I'm tired of running!

                                 NINJA 2
                        We're all supposed to meet up at 
                        the Franklin Button by 12:30 if we 
                        haven't found them. I just want  
                        some tacos. 

           They run off.

                                 SUZIE
                        Alright, thank god. Listen, the 
                        fountain is that way, and I live 
                        this way. You guys can all crash at 
                        my place. No more ninjas, no more 
                        craziness. Let's go.

           Suzie and April start to walk off. The boys look at each 
           other, but don't move. 

                                 SUZIE (CONT'D)
                             (turning around)
                        C'mon!

           The guys look off to where the ninjas ran. They check in with 
           each other and all nod.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Suzie, we're not coming with you. 

                                 SUZIE
                        Oh Michael, you cannot be serious. 
                        You don't have to do this. I'm 
                        here. I'm right here. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I know... But this is something 
                        that we all have to do.

                                    JOSH
                        Michael, they're getting away. If 
                        we're gonna follow them-

                             (grabbing Michael's hands)
                        This is suicide. We can all just go 
                        back to my place... 

           The ninjas get farther away.

                                 JOSH
                        Michael...

                              hands)
                        Let's go. 

                                 SUZIE
                        Why? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        We gotta get into a fight. 

           Michael hugs a frustrated Suzie.

                                 JOSH
                             (to April)
                        So uh... The next time you're in LA-

                                 APRIL
                        Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna be in 
                        LA anytime soon.

                                 JOSH 
                        Oh... Well, um, I guess this is 
                        goodbye...forever?

                                 APRIL
                        Yeah... I guess.

           She looks around for a second, then begins leaning in for a 
           kiss. Josh’s eyes widen. He panics. 

                                 JOSH
                             (extending his hand)
                        See ya.

           April looks shocked. She shakes his hand, confused.

                                 APRIL
                        Um. Bye.

                                 JOSH
                        Bye.

           CONTINUED: (3)

           April turns and walks towards Suzie. Josh watches after her, 
           his expression unaltered.  Michael lets go of Suzie and turns 
           around.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Let's move.

           Josh, Michael and Cliff turn around and start jogging away.

           The guys are standing at Cliff's car, which is parked next to 
           several maintenance golf carts, pulling ninja costumes out of 
           the trunk.

           EXT. UPENN CAMPUS - NIGHT

           Several ninjas, including Kip, are milling about in front of 
           the Franklin Button, a large statue of a broken button. 
           Others join up from all different directions. Two misshapen 
           ninjas (Josh and Michael) walk up, fear in their eyes. 

                                 JOSH
                             (whispering)
                        You really think this is going to 
                        work?

           Kip gets everyone's attention by belching.

                                 KIP
                        Alright, fuck these guys. I'm going 
                        back to the house to drink beer and 
                        fuck bitches.

           The ninjas all let out a cheer and then disperse.

                                 NINJA 1
                        Hey! Who wants tacos?!

           Half a dozen Ninjas yell out affirmatives. Josh and Michael 
           approach Kip.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hey, Kip. We got a surprise for 
                        you.

                                 KIP

                        I uh, had mine taken away.  I had 
                        the opportunity to have sex with a 
                        Tri Delt on Friday but opted 
                        instead to get to know her better.

                        Well, I think when you see what I

           EXT. CLIFF'S CAR - NIGHT

           Michael, Josh, and Kip approach Cliff's car. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        We didn't want to say anything back 
                        there, since we knew how special 
                        this would be for you. 

           They open the trunk, revealing Cliff, duct tape over his 
           mouth and hands.

                        Cliffson?!

           Josh rips off the tape on Cliff's mouth.

                                 CLIFF
                        Oh man! Don't hurt me! Please! I'm

                              Cliff)
                        Oh, fuck yeah.

           Kip cocks his fist back, about to smash Cliff's face.  
           Suddenly, from behind, Josh grabs Kips arm in mid-punch. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        HA!!  Playing possum!

           Cliff grabs Kip by the other arm. Michael takes off his mask 
           and approaches the writhing Kip.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hi. I'm Michael Davidson, the guy 
                        that was dating Suzie. You're a 
                        terrible person, and now I'm going 
                        to hurt you-

           Kip kicks Michael in the nuts.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                             (falling to the ground)
                        Agh!

           Kip headbutts Cliff, sending him reeling back. With his now-
           free arm, Kip punches Josh solidly in gut, dropping him. 

                                 KIP
                        Jesus Christ, are you kidding me? 
                        Nice speech. Hi Michael, nice to 
                        meet you. I'm Kip Rice, the guy 
                        that's fucking Suzie. 

           He kicks Michael.

                                 CLIFF
                        You sonofabitch!

           Cliff jumps on Kip's back.

                                 KIP
                        FUCK! Get off me!!!

           Josh gets up and jumps on Cliff's back, screaming. Michael 
           pulls himself off the ground and charges all three of them. 
           They hit the ground, a mass of bodies, all flailing.

                                 KIP (CONT'D)
                        Get the fuck off me, you pussies!

                                 MICHAEL
                        You stole my girlfriend!

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Wretched hive of scum and 
                        VILLAINY!!!

           The tornado of bodies rolls down a hill, next to the school's 
           parked maintenance carts. When they stop, Kip is pinned. 

                                 KIP
                             (struggling)
                        Oh, you motherfuckers have NO IDEA 
                        what you're messing with.

           Michael rears back to finally punch Kip. 

                                 NINJA (O.S.)
                        Hey!

           The guys turn to see six ninjas standing at the top of the 
           hill, all holding taco bags.

                                 KIP
                        Get down here!

           The ninjas charge down the hill.

                                 JOSH
                        GO! GO!

           The three guys jump off of Kip.

                                 CLIFF
                             (pointing to the nearby 
                              parked carts)
                        The carts!

           The guys all jump onto the nearest cart. Cliff gets behind 
           the wheel and hits the "ON" button. Nothing happens.

                                 JOSH
                        Start it!

                                 CLIFF
                        I can't!!!

           The Ninjas are getting closer. Kip picks himself up off the 
           ground. Cliff is frantically hitting the button.

                                 MICHAEL
                        C'MON!

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           The electric motor starts. Cliff slams on the gas pedal and 
           the tiny cart shoots forward, straight towards Kip. 

                                 KIP
                             (diving out of the way)
                        Fuck!

           The ninjas jump into three carts.

                                 KIP (CONT'D)
                             (getting into one)
                        Don't let 'em go!

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. UPENN CAMPUS - NIGHT

           The guys are driving through campus, with frat ninjas hot on 
           their tails.

                                 JOSH
                        Oh god!  They're gaining on us!

                                 MICHAEL
                        Where are we going?!

                                 CLIFF
                        I don't know!  Stop pressuring me!

           A ninja carts slams into the back of the boys'. The guys 
           scream. One ninja jumps onto the roof of the boys' cart. 

                                 THE BOYS 
                        AAAAGHHH!!

           The ninja reaches down and tries to grab hold of the steering 
           wheel. 

                                 CLIFF
                             (slapping at him)
                        Stop it!

                                 JOSH
                        Mikey! Help me!

           Josh leans on his back and starts to push at the roof with 
           his legs. Michael reaches up and applies more pressure. 
           Suddenly the golf cart's roof becomes unhinged and flies off, 
           with the ninja still on it. The airborne roof and ninja slam 
           into the golf cart behind them, sending it careening into a 
           nearby bike rack.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 CLIFF
                        YEAH!

           The second ninja cart pulls up alongside the guys. It veers 
           into them. Cliff veers back. The carts grind against each 
           other. Josh kicks out at one of the ninjas who grabs his 
           foot, pulling him halfway off the cart.

                                 JOSH
                        Guys guys!!!

           Michael grabs Josh and pulls back.

                                 MICHAEL
                        JOSH!

                                 CLIFF
                        HOLD ON!

           Cliff veers away from the ninjas, pulling off the one holding 
           Josh.  Michael notices several grounds keeping tools on the 
           side of the cart.  Michael picks up a rake, swings, and 
           embeds it into the ninjas' front tire, blowing it out. The 
           ninjas' cart loses control and tips over.

                                 CLIFF (CONT'D)
                        Ha ha- OH!

           Kip slams his cart into the boys. He's got two ninjas with 
           him.

                                 JOSH
                        Watch out!!!

           Both cars speed into a nearby fountain, crashing. Everyone is 
           thrown out into the water.

           EXT. UPENN FOUNTAIN - NIGHT

           Michael lifts his head out of the water, dazed. His eyes come 
           into focus in time to see Kip's fist smash into his face.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (grabbing his nose)
                        Fuck!

           Michael, eyes watering, looks to his left. Josh is wrestling 
           with Ninja 1, while Cliff is being dragged out of the wrecked 
           cart by Ninja 2. They try their best to cover their faces but 
           are getting beaten pretty bad. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        You piece of shit. I'm gonna-

                                 KIP
                        You're gonna what?! 

           Michael dives towards Kip, who easily redirects him into the 
           water. Meanwhile Josh starts throwing wild, uncontrolled 
           punches at Ninja 1, who is easily countering them. 

           Cliff is trying his best to dance fight, but is either 
           slipping or getting walloped by Ninja 2. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Hold on! Wait- I can't stand up! 
                        Please-

           Another punch to the kidney. Meanwhile, Kip is having his way 
           with Michael, who keeps failing to tackle him. 

           The boys are becoming more and more battered and bloody. This 
           isn't what they expected; they can barely get a punch in. 

           After a particularly brutal shot to the jaw, Michael drops 
           down to the water. 

                                 KIP 
                        Damn it man, you and your friends 
                        are the biggest pussies I've ever 
                        seen. 

           Heaving, Michael looks to his left. Josh is crumpled against 
           the fountain's edge, eyes barely open. To his right, Cliff is 
           on his knees and clutching his side, tears in his eyes. 

                                 KIP (CONT'D)
                        Was it worth it? Driving 3000 miles 
                        to get your asses kicked?

           Michael looks at Josh again, who's now staring hard back at 
           him. Michael turns back to Cliff, who's also looking right at 
           him. The three boys all stare at each other, the events of 
           the past three days, of the past 24 years, racing through 
           their heads. Suddenly, they all seem to make the same silent 
           decision. They stand. 

           The Ninjas, somewhat taken aback, glance at each other. Ninja 
           2 then turns and quickly puts Cliff in a headlock. Cliff 
           promptly sinks all of his teeth into the Ninja's forearm.

                                 NINJA 2
                        AAAAGGGHHHH!

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Kip, smiling a little, throws another successful punch at 
           Michael, who quickly stands back up. 

                                 KIP
                        You ok? You ready?

           He punches. Michael goes down but stands up even quicker.

                                 KIP (CONT'D)
                        Alright, that's fine. I'll be here 
                        all night.
                             (another punch)

           Meanwhile, Ninja 1 rushes Josh, roughly tackling him. Josh, 
           expressionless, pulls off the Ninja's mask, wraps his hands 
           around the Ninja's hair, and rips out two clumps. Ninja 1 
           shrieks in pain and falls back. Smiling, Josh places the 
           strands of hair on his own head.

                                 JOSH
                             (weakly)
                        Hey look, I'm a douchebag. 

                                 NINJA 1 
                        You little bitch!

           Ninja 1 roughly kicks Josh.

           Elsewhere in the fountain, Cliff is in a tiny game of cat and 
           mouse, barely avoiding Ninja 2's advances. 

                                 CLIFF
                             (panting)
                        Alright... It's time we do this 
                        Greco-Roman style...

           Cliff takes off his pants. And his underwear.

                                 NINJA 2
                        What the fu-

           Cliff, bottomless, rushes Ninja 2, who tries to shrink away 
           but is too late. Cliff wraps his arms around him.

                                 CLIFF
                        Yield! YIELD!!!

                                 NINJA 2
                        AAAGGGGHHHH!!! Get your dick off 
                        me!

           Michael stands up yet again. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Just stay the fuck down, dipshit.

           Josh gets violently shoved onto his back. Before Ninja 1 can 
           reach him though, he starts to violently kick, splashing 
           water everywhere and preventing the ninja from getting close. 

                                 NINJA 1
                        Cut the shit- Ow! Fuck! Fight me!

           Ninja 2 throws a half-naked Cliff off of him. 

                                 NINJA 2
                        Please, dude... Put your pants on.

                        What about this dick?!

           Ninja 2 shudders. Meanwhile, Ninja 1 tries to get a hold of 
           Josh, who feebly starts to sing.

                                 JOSH

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 JOSH AND CLIFF
                             (lying prone)
                        Some of them want to abuse you!

                                 NINJA 2
                        And mine took his pants off!

                                 NINJA 1 
                             (broken)
                        I can't do this anymore man, these 
                        guys are fucking nuts!

                                 NINJA 2
                        Yeah, dude. This is more trouble 
                        than it's worth!

           The ninjas get out of the fountain.

                                 KIP
                        Fine! Go home! I can take these 
                        idiots.

           Kip watches the Ninjas storming off. Cliff and Josh continue 
           to sing the Eurythmics.

                                 KIP (CONT'D)
                             (walking over to Josh)
                        Yeah guys, keep singing! You think 
                        I give a shit?!
                             (walking to Cliff)
                        You guys are fucking losers. You 
                        can't fight to save your lives! 
                        You're bitches!

           Michael lifts his head and musters what's left of his energy 
           to stand one more time. 

                                 KIP (CONT'D)
                             (seeing Michael)
                        Oh that's rich! It's the little 
                        engine that could!

           Kip marches back over to Michael, who wobbles slightly.

                                 KIP (CONT'D)
                        Not done yet, huh? Cool. Y'know, 
                        the reason Suzie wants me isn't 
                        because of my big dick. It's 
                        because I'm a man, and men-

           BAM!!! Michael punches Kip in the mouth. Stunned, Kip stands 
           there for a moment. Suddenly, rage fills his eyes. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (5)

           He reels back and punches Michael square in the side of the 
           head. Michael stumbles, but immediately swings his fist with 
           everything he has. It connects with Kip's face and sends him 
           flying backward into the water. Unable to stop the momentum, 
           Michael falls as well.  

           Kip's shakes the cobwebs and blood starts to pour out of his 
           nose. He looks up and sees Josh and Cliff hauling themselves 
           over to Michael, who grabs hold of them and picks himself up. 

           The three of them stand there. Michael spits out a tooth, 
           Josh is holding one of the rakes from the carts, and Cliff 
           still has no pants on. 

                                 MICHAEL
                             (fire in his eyes)
                        COME ON YOU MOTHERFUCKER!

                                 CLIFF
                        Stand up!

                                 JOSH
                        Let's do this!!!

           Bruised and ruined, but unbelievably amped, the guys continue 
           to scream war cries at Kip. He looks in the direction that 
           his accomplices ran.

                                 KIP
                        GUYS!!!!

           Nobody answers. He looks back at the boys. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED!!!

                                 JOSH
                        YOU PIECE OF SHIT, LET'S GO!!!

                                 CLIFF
                        AAAAGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!

           Wild eyed and insane, he sees that these guys will never give 
           up. Never stay down.

                                 KIP 
                             (standing)
                        I- I'm sick of wasting my time on 
                        you pussies. Fuck- fuck off.

           He walks out of the fountain, and disappears into the 
           darkness, defeated.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (6)

           The guys stand for a moment, still screaming triumphantly. 
           Voices hoarse, they finally stop. Their knees buckle and they 
           collapse back into the water. 

                                 MICHAEL
                             (nothing left)
                        Holy shit... That was- 

                                 JOSH
                        Amazing.

                             (weeping)
                        I love you guys!

                                 MICHAEL
                        We love you too Cliff. Although I'm 
                        not getting near you til you put 
                        the hog back in the pen.

           They all get up, but immediately clutch themselves in pain 
           and fall back down.

                                 GUYS
                        AAAGGHH!!!

           EXT. SUZIE'S DUPLEX - DAWN

           Suzie and April are sitting on the front steps sipping tea, 
           waiting for the guys.

                                 SUZIE
                             (seeing something)
                        Oh my God.

           Cliff's convertible rattles its way over a hill and pulls up 
           in front of Suzie's place. The guys pour out, looking like 
           raw hamburger.

                                 APRIL
                        Christ...

           The three boys limp over to the girls. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hello ladies. We were just in a 
                        fight.

                                 JOSH
                        It was awesome.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           Suzie runs to Michael and hugs him.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (wincing)
                        Ow.

                                 SUZIE
                        I can't believe you're alive. 
                             (pulling away)
                        Why are you so stupid!?
                             (she starts to hit him)

                                 MICHAEL
                             (in incredible pain)
                        Please- please stop. 

           Suzie kisses Michael.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        I'm bleeding from every part of my-

                                 SUZIE
                        I don't care.

           She kisses him again. Josh turns to April.

                                 JOSH
                             (grabbing her wrist)
                        C'mere baby.

                                 APRIL
                        What?

                                 JOSH
                        I just got the ever living shit 
                        beaten out of me. The last thing 
                        I'm scared of at this point is 
                        kissing you. 

           He kisses April, who kisses him right back. Cliff's face 
           drops slightly. He looks around for his kiss, but no one is 
           there. Suddenly, his eyes catch sight of Rachel walking home.

                                 CLIFF
                             (to himself)
                        The lesbo!

           Cliff quickly limps to Rachel, grabs her, and kisses her. She 
           immediately slaps him.

           INT. SUZIE'S APARTMENT

           Michael and Suzie mill about her living room. Through the 
           window, we see Josh, Cliff, and April, hanging out by Cliff's 
           car.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You guys moved the couch.

                                 SUZIE
                        Yeah. A while ago...

           A pause. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        So... 

                                 SUZIE
                        Could you please explain the last 
                        24 hours to me? Because I honestly 
                        think I'm going to wake up in a 
                        second and find that none of this 
                        happened.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Heh. Well, you are dressed as 
                        Dorothy.

                                 SUZIE
                        Jesus.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, sorry.

                             (sitting down)
                        Michael, listen. The Kip thing. I 
                        want you to know that it wasn't 
                        even about him. As a person, I 
                        mean. I just needed to feel- I 
                        needed to break out, y'know?

                        But seeing you here, seeing what 
                        you would do for me, I weigh that 
                        against that feeling, and I see 
                        that I would be so incredibly 
                        stupid to lose you.  

           Michael looks up and beams.

                                 SUZIE (CONT'D)
                        It's only seven months.  We can 
                        make it work.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Wow. That's pretty much EXACTLY 
                        what I wanted you to say...

                             (moving closer to him)
                        Yeah?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah. Which is why this hurts so 
                        much. 

           Michael takes a breath.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        We shouldn't be together. 

                                 SUZIE
                        What?

                                 MICHAEL
                        You need to be here Suzie. I mean, 
                        be HERE. You need to do college 
                        things, and live your life, and not 
                        feel chained to some guy thousands 
                        of miles away. You were right about 
                        that. I mean, maybe you could've 
                        waited a little longer to throw up 
                        that "for sale" sign, but-

                                 SUZIE
                        I'm sorry.

                                 MICHAEL
                        No, I'm sorry, that was cheap.

           He looks out the window and sees Josh and Cliff, proudly 
           displaying their war wounds to April.

                        If there's one thing this trip has 
                        taught me is that I'm fucking 
                        insane. I've got so much shit to 
                        figure out. I don't even have a 
                        job. And if we got back together, 
                        that's all I'd have. I'd latch onto 
                        it and we'd get stuck in the same 
                        situation all over again.

           Suzie stares at him, eyes welling up.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        I love you, y'know.

                                 SUZIE
                             (full on crying)
                        I love you...

                                 MICHAEL
                        And look, if you and I should be 
                        together, then you and I will be 
                        together. But right now, I think 
                        this is how it should be. How I'm 
                        gonna feel five minutes from now is 
                        a different story...

           They sit in silence for a moment.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                             (standing up)
                        Ok. We should go. 

                                 SUZIE
                        Alright.

           Suzie leans in for a kiss, which Michael turns from, hugging 
           her instead. His eyes tear up. They pull apart.

                                 MICHAEL
                        See ya.

                                 SUZIE
                        Call me.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I will. 

           Michael walks out the door.

                                                       CUT TO:
           EXT. SUZIE'S DUPLEX

           Cliff is standing on one side of the car, Josh and April 
           stand on the other.

                                 CLIFF
                        How much longer do I have to stand 
                        over here?!

                                 JOSH
                        One second!!!
                             (turning to April)
                        So, thanks for helping us. And 
                        making out with me.

                                 APRIL
                        Anytime.

                                 JOSH
                        I'm gonna need your number now.

                                 APRIL
                        You got it.

           April takes a scrap of paper out of her purse and writes her 
           number as Michael steps outside.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You guys ready?

                                 CLIFF
                             (getting in the car)
                        Let's ride!

           April gives Josh her number. 

                                 JOSH
                             (looking at the paper)
                        Who the hell is "Leia"?

                                 APRIL
                        Me.

           Josh's jaw drops.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Let's go Josh.

           Josh gets in the car.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 APRIL
                        Try not to kick so much ass on the 
                        way back, ok guys?

                                 CLIFF
                        Baby, you can't tell Michael Jordan 
                        to stop playing professional 
                        football. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Cliff, I think you took a couple 
                        shots during that fight.

                                 CLIFF
                        Who's driving? I'm driving!

                                 JOSH
                        I don't think-

           Cliff starts up the car.

                                 APRIL
                        Bye!

                                 GUYS
                        See ya!

           The guys drive away.

                                 MICHAEL
                        How's everyone feeling?

                                 JOSH
                        We got in a fucking fight.

           Michael pulls the collage out of his pocket. He unfolds it 
           and looks at it. 

                                 JOSH (CONT'D)
                        Cliff, you're driving on the wrong 
                        side of the road.

           Michael folds the collage back up, and throws it out the 
           window. Cliff's convertible drives into the distance, on the 
           wrong side of the road. 

           THE END.
