           A MAN’S VOICE, warm and lyrical, whispers to us from the 
           darkness...  

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Once upon a time, not long ago, not 
                        far away, there was a boy.  And he 
                        was a very special boy, indeed.

           A BIRDIE MOBILE, twirling in a gentle breeze, hangs over a 
           CHILD’S CRIB in a cosy, homey little nursery.  

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But “specialness,” like beauty, is 
                        often in the eye of the beholder.

           ANGELA and CHARLES LEAVITT, proud parents, arms entwined, 
           gaze down with limitless adoration at --

           THEIR SON, LOWELL A. LEAVITT (AGE 0), eyes bright, tiny 
           hands grasping up toward us.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Others might call him “cursed.”

           A far off RUMBLE of THUNDER...

           INT. LEAVITT LIVING ROOM - DAY

           ... becomes the JINGLING of a SET OF KEYS.  Charles jingles 
           them to distract LOWELL (AGE 2), as Angela struggles to 
           feed their son a spoonful of stewed beets.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It began small.  A missing 
                        pacifier.  A misplaced toy.  But 
                        soon, it became clear that certain 
                        things -- important things --

           Uninterested in the beets, Lowell giddily grasps for the 
           keys.  As Charles finally hands them over, we...

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           CHARLES AND ANGELA overturning couch cushions, peeking 
           under rugs, searching the house, high and low.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        -- should never be playthings for 
                        this particular little boy.
           Lowell watches from his highchair, cheeks wet with tears.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And as the little boy grew --

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           LOWELL (AGE 4), in a booster-seat, watching while Charles 
           and Angela continue searching.  They un-pot potted plants.    

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        -- So his problem grew too.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           LOWELL (AGE 6), on the couch, as one side tilts high into 
           the air.  Charles holds it up, while Angela sweeps 
           underneath it with a METAL DETECTOR.  

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And grew, and grew, until --

           EXT. LEAVITT HOME - DAY

           Angela VIDEO-TAPES LOWELL (AGE 8), straddling his brand-new 
           BIKE.  A red bow on the handlebars.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        -- everything he touched --

           Charles gives him a push, and the boy pedals away down the   
           tree-lined street, happily honking the horn.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        -- seemed to vanish into thin air.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           LOWELL walks back up the street, lugging all that’s left of 
           his bike...  The HANDLEBARS.  Mournfully honking the horn.  

           EXT. LEAVITT HOME - DAY

           Rain pours down.  LOWELL (AGE 9) holds a DOG LEASH, hand 
           cupped to his mouth, calling.  And calling.  And calling.

                                 LOWELL
                        Buster?  Bus-ter!?  BUSTER!!!!!
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        For you see, this special little 
                        boy was one of the few.  Those 
                        unlucky, unhappy few --
                            (sad beat)
                        -- who was simply born to lose.

           Again, a RUMBLING of THUNDER.  LIGHTNING FLASHES, and we...

                                                               SMASH TO:

           A SHEET OF PAPER, AS IT

           dances against the gloomy gray clouds of a drizzly morning 
           sky, just beyond the leaping, jumping, desperately  
           grasping fingers of...

                                 LOWELL (O.S.)
                        Oh come on!  Come back!  This isn’t 
                        fair!  It’s -- it’s --

           LOWELL (AGE 10), red rain poncho flapping out behind like 
           Superman’s cape, pursues the paper down a suburban street.  

                                 LOWELL
                        It’s barely even breezy out today!

           The paper flits over a THICK THORNY HEDGE.  Lowell hitches 
           up his BACKPACK, fights his way through its branches. 

           EXT. VACANT LOT

           He bursts out on the hedge’s far side, BACKPACK GONE.  For 
           a brief moment, he considers going back for it, but the 
           paper wafts onward, and he reluctantly runs after it.

           EXT. CHAIN-LINK FENCE

           The paper floats up and over.  Lowell scales it, but as he 
           clears the top and leaps down, the wire SNAGS his SWEATER.  

           A STRING of YARN UNRAVELS OUT behind him as he hurries on.

           EXT. BACK ALLEY

           The paper settles into the gutter, stuck in a leafy muck.  

           Lowell leaps from the curb into what looks like a shallow 
           puddle, but winds up with his LEFT GALOSH stuck        
           ankle-deep in a goop-filled pothole.
           HOONNNNNK!!!  

           A GIGANTIC GARBAGE TRUCK barrels toward him, its BRAKES 
           SCREAMING -- LOCKING UP -- SKIDDING -- NO TIME TO STOP --

           Lowell desperately tries to free his foot.  At the last 
           second, his sock pops loose, he stumbles clear, just as --  

           The Ten-Ton Truck ROARS PAST, his ABANDONED GALOSH SUCKED 
           under its screeching tires.

           THE PAPER 

           flutters free on the gust of wind, and with a graceful  
           loop-the-loop and a whoosh...  

           Vanishes into a STORM DRAIN.  

           LOWELL 

           stares after it.  Exhausted.  Defeated.  Not surprised.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           BRRRRRRIIIINNNNNNGG!  

           Fourth-graders stampede for the door, piling their homework 
           papers on the desk of MS. MOTT, a harried woman in      
           horn-rimmed glasses.

                                 MS. MOTT
                        Carefully, children.  Carefully 
                        now.  Thank you, Kathleen.  
                        Geoffrey, we ask, we don’t take.

           She scoots out the stragglers, deflating in relief.  

           Until she notices...

                                 MS. MOTT
                        Lowell?

           Still seated, shaggy brown head buried in his hands.

                                 LOWELL
                            (muffled)
                        Present.

                                 MS. MOTT
                        Class is over, Lowell.  Quickly 
                        now, quickly.  What have you got 
                        for me today?
           He looks up.  Hopeful.

                                 LOWELL
                        Respect and admiration, Ms. Mott?

           She looks to the pile of homework papers.  Sighs, "Again?".

           EXT. AMELIA EARHART ELEMENTARY - DAY

           Lowell tails Ms. Mott down the steps, a towering stack of 
           books awkwardly balanced in her arms.

                                 MS. MOTT
                        You're a bright boy, Lowell.  No 
                        one's questioning that.  But  
                        twenty-seven lost homeworks?

                                 LOWELL
                            (glumly)
                        Twenty-eight.

                                 MS. MOTT
                        Twenty-eight.  And every year it’s 
                        gotten worse.  Now, you tell me:  
                        How can I pass a student who hasn’t 
                        turned in a single assignment?

                                 LOWELL
                        Wait, now you're not gonna pass me?  
                        You're gonna -- what?  Hold me 
                        back?  But, that's not fair!

                                 MS. MOTT
                        You have to learn to accept 
                        responsibility, Lowell.  No one 
                        else lost those papers.  You did.

                                 LOWELL
                        So, now I lose a whole year too?!

           Ms. Mott opens her Volvo's trunk.  Piles her books inside.

                                 LOWELL
                        It's not my fault.  It's my curse.

           He kicks a hydrant -- forgetting that his only galosh is on 
           his other foot.  He YELPS in pain.  Hopping.

                                 LOWELL
                        See!?

           She looks at his half-unraveled sweater, his sad bare sock.
                                 MS. MOTT
                        Lowell, you know if there's ever 
                        anything you want to talk about?  
                        Anything you want to tell me...?

                                 LOWELL
                        Like what?

                                 MS. MOTT
                        Like if something’s going on with 
                        you?  Or at home?

           He clams up.  Stares down at his feet.  Ms. Mott studies 
           him, deciding.  She shouldn't do this, but --

                                 MS. MOTT
                        Alright, look.  I'll make you a 
                        deal.  Remember that book report I  
                        assigned last week?

                                 LOWELL
                        That dog really ate it.  I swear! 

                                 MS. MOTT
                        Lowell, this is your last, best and 
                        only chance to graduate fourth 
                        grade, so cut the excuses.  I’m 
                        giving you one last opportunity.  
                        One last assignment.  The book 
                        report to end all book reports.  

                                 LOWELL
                        Which book?

                                 MS. MOTT
                        Surprise me.  But, by tomorrow, by  
                        3 P.M., that paper must-must-must 
                        be in my hands.  Do you understand?
                            (kindly)
                        You can do this.  There's no curse.    

           Lowell looks at her books piled in her trunk.  Hopeful. 

                                 LOWELL
                        So, then you think I could maybe... 
                        sorta...  borrow one of your boo--

           -- SLAM.  She closes it.  Pockets the keys.

                                 MS. MOTT
                        Isn’t that what libraries are for?
           INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

           The LIBRARIAN blocks the way, a linebacker in floral print. 

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.

           She holds a paper print-out in her hand.  On it, a MUG-SHOT 
           PHOTO of Lowell with the words:  “DO NOT LEND TO THIS BOY.”

                                 LOWELL
                        But I won't lose this one, honest!   

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        Ha!  This isn't a lending library.  
                        Not anymore.  Not for Lowell A. 
                        Leavitt.

                                 LOWELL
                        But I promise.  I swear on, on...
                            (sees a nearby shelf)
                        On the entire religion section.

           Brandishing a hefty book, she backs him toward the doors...

                                 LOWELL
                        On all the words in that 
                        Dictionary.

           Out the doors...

                                 LOWELL
                        On the Dewey Decimal System itself!

           SLAM.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

           Lowell hikes home.  Passing the vacant lot he ran through 
           this morning, he stops abruptly, puzzled.  

                                 LOWELL
                        Where’d this place come from?

           Instead of a chain-link fence, wedged between the two 
           houses, he sees a squat little storefront.  The sign reads:

           “FAMOUS LOST WORDS, RARE BOOK PURVEYORS.”

           Through the window, Lowell sees shelves cluttered with 
           BOOKS of every shape and size.  He digs in his pocket, but--
           CLINK!  CLINK!  CLINK!  A handful of CHANGE tinkles out of 
           his pant leg, bouncing into a sewer grate.  He pulls out 
           his pocket to reveal a HOLE in the fabric.  Allowance gone.  

           THUNDER CRACKS.  RAIN POURS.  Lowell marches glumly uphill.

           EXT. LEAVITT HOME - EVENING

           Lowell stands in the rain outside the front door.  Breathes 
           deep, quietly turns the knob.

           IN THE LIVING ROOM

           Lowell slips off his poncho.  Slides off his galosh.  
           Across the room, the PHONE MACHINE blinks RED -- A MESSAGE.  

           ARGUING VOICES emanate from the kitchen:

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        You know that isn't what I said!

                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        It's obviously what you meant!

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Oh that’s right, you read minds!

           Lowell drags a chair to the phone table.  Clambers 
           precariously atop it.  Reaches for the ERASE BUTTON and -- 

                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Lowell?

           -- CRASH!  Loses his balance in spectacular fashion.  

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Lowell sits on the sofa, his head buried in his hands.  A 
           message PLAYS on the answering machine: 

                                 MS. MOTT (V.O.)
                        ... and furthermore, Mr. and Mrs. 
                        Leavitt, had you bothered to return 
                        any of the dozen messages I've 
                        left, maybe things wouldn’t’ve 
                        gotten this far out of hand. 

           REVEAL Charles and Angela, giving their boy their best 
           parental death stares.  He buries his head even deeper.
                                 MS. MOTT (V.O.)
                        As it is, I can't pass your son if 
                        he doesn't turn in this report.  On 
                        a suitable book.  Or some kind of 
                        book.  Or really any boo--    

           BEEP!  Angela jabs the STOP BUTTON.

                                 ANGELA
                        How long did you think you could 
                        keep this from us?  Erasing our 
                        messages?  Lying, Lowell?

                                 CHARLES
                        Dumb, buddy.  Real dumb.

                                 LOWELL
                        It's not my fault, it's my curs--

                                 ANGELA
                        -- Don't even start that.  Do not. 

           She turns to the bookshelf, fuming.

                                 ANGELA
                        I don’t know what we have that he 
                        could possibly write a report on.  

                                 CHARLES
                        Think he'd like your new Doctor 
                        Phil?  That’s about fourth-grade 
                        level, isn’t it?

                                 LOWELL
                        Mom...

                                 ANGELA
                        I swear, Charles.  One more joke.

                                 LOWELL
                        Dad--

                                 CHARLES
                        Oh, what then?  Slam a few doors?  

           Lowell squeezes between them.

                                 LOWELL
                        Mom!  Dad!  Listen!  I can just go 
                        to the bookstore down the block.  
                        Really!  But I, I...  
                            (sighs)
                        ... I lost my allowance again.  
           They look down at him, as if remembering he's still there.

                                 ANGELA
                        "Bookstore?”  What bookstore?

                                 CHARLES
                        No bookstore on our block, pal.

                                 LOWELL
                        Well unless I'm losing my mind  
                        too, there was ten minutes ago.

           INT. FAMOUS LOST WORDS, RARE BOOKS - NIGHT

           The door creaks open.  Charles and Angela usher Lowell in.

                                 CHARLES
                        How long's this been here?

           Angela steps over some RAT DROPPINGS.  DINGS the desk bell.

                                 ANGELA
                        Long enough for the rats to make 
                        themselves at home.  Hello?

                                 A MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                            (from the back)
                        Browse!  But, don’t touch!

                                 CHARLES
                        Excuse me?

                                 A MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Browse!  Browse!  No touching!

           Angela scowls at his tone.  Charles shrugs at Lowell. 

                                 CHARLES
                        Well, you heard him.  Go on. 

           Lowell eyes the cobwebby shelves, the shadowy aisles.

                                 LOWELL
                        You sure?

                                 ANGELA
                        Go.  Find something you like.
           IN THE SHADOW AISLES

           Fluorescent lights flicker overhead.  Sputter and crackle.   
           Lowell creeps between the looming shelves, knees knocking.

                                 LOWELL
                        I don't like this.

           A SCUFFLING SOUND.  The boy whips around, heart pounding --
           But there’s nothing there.  Just an empty aisle.  Lowell 
           relaxes, laughing at his own jumpiness, when --

           SUDDENLY, A BOOK 

           Tips off a shelf, tumbles into his arms.  OOMPH!  

           The boy catches it, engulfed in a cloud of dust.  Hacking, 
           choking, he looks it over.  Thick.  Old.  Bound in scraps 
           of leather, stitched together like Frankenstein’s monster.  

                                 LOWELL
                        How did this...?

           He looks up toward the shelf The Book fell from.  There, in 
           the empty book-shaped space, A PAIR OF TWINKLING LIGHTS.

           Lowell looks closer, curious.  The lights BLINK.  EYES.

           INT. FRONT DESK, FAMOUS LOST WORDS - NIGHT

           Lowell BOLTS out of the stacks, hugging The Book.  He runs 
           to his parents, white as an albino ghost.

                                 LOWELL
                        Mom!  Dad!  I-- I-- s-s-saw...

           In the shadows behind the desk, ANOTHER SET OF TWINKLING 
           EYES regards him, an OLD MAN shambles out.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Do you know what I see, my boy?

           His crooked back tents his jacket like the ridged fin of 
           some prehistoric fish.  His tangled beard, which looks as 
           though it's never been cut, sweeps his feet as he stands.

                                 OLD MAN
                        I see a boy who doesn't do as he's 
                        told.  Browse, I said.
                            (leaning in)
                        But don't touch.
                                 ANGELA
                        I'm sure he didn't mean any harm.   
                        Did you, Lowell?  He just gets 
                        excited whenever he finds, um... 

           Angela takes The Book from Lowell’s numb grasp.  She turns 
           it over in her hands.  No title, no author.

                                 ANGELA
                        This one, honey?  You’re sure?

           The Old Man's gaze saps Lowell's power of speech.  He nods.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Quite an eye your boy possesses.  

                                 CHARLES
                        I don't see a price.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Ah, but that's a very special book.   
                        “A price” would only cheapen it.

                                 CHARLES
                        Look, you're talking to an 
                        accountant here, alright, pal?  Can 
                        we buy the book, or can't we?  

           The Old Man clicks his tongue as he considers.  

                                 OLD MAN
                        No.

                                 CHARLES
                        Fine.  Let's just go to Barnes and--

                                 OLD MAN
                        No.  But, your son may borrow it.  

                                 ANGELA
                        Borrow it?  Oh no.  Thank you, but, 
                        that’s really not a good idea.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Nonsense.  Perhaps someday you'll 
                        return the favor.  But all I ask is 
                        you return the book.
                            (winks at Lowell)
                        And what kind of boy couldn't be 
                        trusted with that?

           Off the Leavitts' uneasy looks...
           INT. UPSTAIRS HALL, LEAVITT HOME - NIGHT

           Lowell stands in his socks at his bedroom door.  Charles 
           holds out The Book.  But, Angela holds him back a moment.

                                 ANGELA
                        Now Lowell, this is very important.  
                        I need your word.  No “curses”.  

                                 CHARLES
                        You're not gonna lose this one,  
                        right?  You promise?  You swear?    

                                 LOWELL
                            (sighs, rote)
                        I’m not gonna lose it.  I swear.

           Angela hands him a pencil and paper.  He turns to go in --

                                 ANGELA
                        And no going in that closet either, 
                        Lowell, you hear me?  You waste too 
                        much time in there as it is.

           He scurries into his room.  The lock LOCKS.

                                 CHARLES
                        “Return the favor?”  I swear, if 
                        that weird old guy's knocking on my 
                        door come April 15th...

                                 ANGELA
                        Charles.  Just drop it.

           She heads downstairs.  He stews, then follows after her.

           INT. LOWELL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lowell FLICKS on the lamp, revealing his desk, his chair, a 
           bed bolted to the hardwood floor.  No pictures.  No 
           posters.  No toys or piles of dirty laundry.  Oddly empty. 

           The sound of ANGRY VOICES seeps up from downstairs.  Lowell 
           opens the window a crack, so the PATTER OF RAIN drowns out 
           his arguing parents.  He settles down at his desk.

                                 LOWELL
                            (writes)
                        Alright.  “The book I read for my 
                        report was...”
                                 (MORE)
                                 LOWELL (CONT'D)
                            (opens it)
                        The--

           A SUDDEN BREEZE flips the pages like a flip-book, blowing 
           his pencil off the edge of his desk --

                                 LOWELL
                        Hey!

           It rolls across the floor and... drops directly into the   
           HEATING VENT.  Clatters down the duct as it falls.  Gone.

           Lowell sighs.  Powerless and pencil-less, he turns to --

           INT. CLOSET - NIGHT

           A dozen locks UNLOCK.  The door creaks open.  The light 
           flips ON.  Now, we see why Lowell's bedroom is so empty.   

           Everything he owns is in here.  We see SHOE-TREES of single 
           sneakers, every right shoe missing its left.  Heaps of 
           pants, holey pockets hanging out.  And lining the walls, 
           like safe-deposit boxes, stacks of TUPPERWARE CONTAINERS.  

           Lowell keeps everything he hasn't lost inside his “vault”.

           He pulls a LEDGER BOOK from a shelf, scans it:

                                 LOWELL
                        Let's see.  “Baseball cards”... 
                        “Bubblegum”... 'Bubblegum, ABC”...
                            (finds it)
                        There.  “Backup Pencils:  B314.9”.

           Runs his finger down the Tupperware stack, until he finds 
           the one labeled “B314.9”.  Popping it open, he pulls out a 
           pencil...  but it's a NUB.  Like it's been CHEWED DOWN.

                                 LOWELL
                        Hey.  Who’s been eating my --?   

           He steps in something squishy, looks down...  RAT POOP.

           EXT. LOWELL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The closet door flies open and Lowell storms out, peeved.

                                 LOWELL
                        Mom!
           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Halfway down the stairs, Lowell stops.  Something is wrong.  
           No angry arguing voices emanate from the kitchen.  Instead:

                                 CHARLES (O.S.)
                        ... I'm serious, Angela.  How do 
                        you tell a ten year-old boy...  our 
                        son... ...this?

           Curious, Lowell presses an ear to the door.  Eavesdropping.

                                 ANGELA (O.S.)
                        The truth.  We tell him the truth.

                                 CHARLES (O.S.)
                        Just like that?  A divorce?

                                 ANGELA (O.S.)
                        We tell him we lost our love, 
                        Charles.  Somewhere, somehow, we 
                        just lost it.

           Lowell stops breathing.

                                 ANGELA (O.S.)
                        He’ll find a way to understand.

           INT. LOWELL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           CRASH!  In the closet, Tupperware towers topple like 
           dominoes.  Shoetrees go timber.  A ledger comes flying out 
           the open door.  And then out storms Hurricane Lowell.  

           He tips over his chair.  Tears up his homework paper. 

           Snatches The Book and FLINGS IT -- SMASH!  Right into his 
           LAMP, plunging the room into darkness.  Oops.  Lowell 
           slinks over to where The Book lies.  Open.  He brushes off 
           bits of lamp, revealing its TITLE:

                                 LOWELL
                        “The Lann...  Land of...”

           Too dark.  LIGHTNING FLASHES outside, so Lowell carries The 
           Book to the window, holds it up near the glass. 

           As another FLASH splits the sky, he reads aloud:

                                 LOWELL
                        “The Land of Lost Things.”
           Just as that last syllable leaves his mouth -- THE WINDOW 
           BLOWS WIDE OPEN!  SNAPPING THE COVER SHUT ON HIS FINGERS!  

           He drops The Book, it BOUNCES off the windowsill, and --

                                 LOWELL
                        -- No! --

           -- TUMBLES OUTSIDE!

           EXT. WINDOW - NIGHT

           Lowell leans out in the driving rain, frantic to see where 
           it went.  He spots it teetering on the edge of the gutters.  

           He reaches out for it, but --

           It’s too far for him to reach.  Quickly, he ducks back in.  
           Reemerging moments later, pulling on his poncho, flashlight 
           in his teeth, he steps onto the ledge with his one galosh. 

                                 LOWELL
                            (flashlight in mouth)
                        Othay.  Eathy.  Don’th lookth down.  

           He crawls toward the teetering book, gripping the gutter.  
           IT CREAKS under his weight.  He reaches out...   

           He GRABS THE BOOK.

                                 LOWELL
                        Gotcha!  Whew... That wasn’t so ba--

           A horrifying SCREECH, the gutter’s brackets detach from the 
           house, the far end dropping like a stone, CRASHING down 
           into the alley below, transforming it into a SLIDE.

                                 LOWELL
                        Oh craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaap!!!

           Lowell skids down the slide, losing hold of The Book and --
           SPLASH!  Lands in a puddle in the alley below.  He 
           scrambles to his feet.  CLICKS ON his FLASHLIGHT, to see --

           THE BOOK, carried by the rainwater, floating closer and 
           closer in toward...

           AN OPEN STORM GRATE  

           It circles the opening like a drain and -- before Lowell 
           can save it -- SPIRALS DOWN into the inky black sewers.
           Lowell stares after it.  Cold, wet.  But not beaten yet.  
           He takes one last look up at his open window.  His home.

           INT. SEWER - NIGHT

           SPLASH!  Lowell cannonballs into waist-deep water.  He 
           comes up, sputtering, flashlight swiveling.  Spots The Book 
           as it floats into the mouth of a shadowy stone tunnel.

           He chases after it.  Weaving through twists and turns.  THE 
           BOOK floating ahead.  Always mere inches out of reach.

           Racing along a half-submerged service catwalk, he dives for 
           The Book.  Seizes its leather jacket.  His flashlight finds

           A PAIR OF FERAL EYES peering back.  A GIGANTIC PACK-RAT.  
           Teeth.  Claws.  Five feet tall.  Lowell recoils, trips --

                                 THE PACK-RAT
                            (It talks?)
                        Give me your hand!

           It reaches for him.  But too late --  

           Lowell falls --

           -- and SPLASH!  Finds himself suddenly drowning in BLACK 
           WATER.  Rushed along by a current.  Tossed, turned, and...

           EXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT

           Lowell breaks the surface, gasping for air in a FAST RIVER.  

           He grasps desperately at a passing root.  Drags himself 
           into the shallows.  Bellies up in the mud at the edge of a 
           JUNGLE.  Dead quiet, but for his ragged, gasping breaths.

           EXT. CLEARING, RAINFOREST - NIGHT

           Squeezing swamp juice from his sweater, Lowell emerges from 
           the overgrown undergrowth.  Utterly lost.  No idea where to 
           turn, what to do.  He sees something YELLOW flicker between 
           the foliage.  He pushes through the leaves and discovers...

           A LEFT GALOSH among the ferns.  Just like the one he lost.

                                 LOWELL
                        That's...  That's...
           But, before he can finish, a HUGE HAIR-COVERED CREATURE 
           swings down from the trees, SNATCHING the galosh with its 
           prehensile tail and toting it back up into the treetops.

                                 LOWELL
                        Hey!  That's mine!

           The HALF-MAN HALF-APE freezes, mid-climb.  Casually turns.

                                 MISSING LINK
                        Yours?

                                 LOWELL
                        You talk?

                                 MISSING LINK
                        I speak.  With polite tone and 
                        proper manners.  Now, “Yours?”

                                 LOWELL
                        I-- I lost it.

                                 MISSING LINK
                        And I found it.  Finders keepers.

           Leaves rustle as the creature climbs higher.

                                 LOWELL
                        Wait!  No!  Don't go!

                                 MISSING LINK
                            (sing-song)
                        Manners.

                                 LOWELL
                        Please, just don't go.

                                 MISSING LINK
                        Give me one reason I shouldn't.

                                 LOWELL
                        You gotta help me!

                                 MISSING LINK
                        That's a request, not a reason.

                                 LOWELL
                        'Cause, 'cause it's dark and wet 
                        and I -- I only had a half-day of 
                        cub-scouts my whole life.  I can't 
                        find my flashlight.  I practically 
                        drowned.  There was this humongous 
                        rat, and I'm, I'm...
                                 MISSING LINK
                        I said one reason.

                                 LOWELL
                        I'm lost, okay!?

           It smiles, a Cheshire grin.

                                 MISSING LINK
                        Eureka.  Evolution is not a myth.  
                        Of course you're lost, you silly 
                        little creature.  If you weren't, 
                        you wouldn't be here.

           A CRASHING SOUND echoes through the jungle.  Lowell spins.  
           Heart beating a bah-zillion times a second.

                                 LOWELL
                        Wh-what was that!?

                                 MISSING LINK
                        Like I said, finders keepers.  And 
                        losers, well...  Losers better dry 
                        their eyes and run!

           It cackles like a monkey, swings away into the treetops.

           CRASH!  DARK SHAPES tear through the tree-line, swarming 
           into the open.  GIANT RATS.  Claws.  Teeth.     

           Lowell runs -- splashing through streams, crashing through 
           bushes, racing -- CRACK!  Straight into a low branch.

           He blinks, splayed out on his back.  The jungle canopy 
           swims overhead.  The rats race closer...  closer...  

           At the last moment, A SHADOW sweeps over him.  CLAWED FEET 
           snatch him by his shoulders, lifting him skyward.

           A sound surrounds him -- WHUMP, WHUMP, WHUMP...    

           Everything goes suddenly...

           BLACK

           Whispers:

                                 MALE VOICE #1
                        A boy?  Here?  But how?

                                 MALE VOICE #2
                        What kind of ill-fated boy could 
                        find his way here?
                                 MALE VOICE #3
                        Hold your beaks and be still.  He 
                        returns to us...

           INT. CAVE - NIGHT

           Lowell opens his eyes.  Blinks.  BOLTS UP into a sitting 
           position, scuttles back against the rock wall, SCREAMING!  

           THREE GIANT BIRDS

           huddled over him, LEAP BACK, just as shocked.  They’re --  

                                 LOWELL
                        Pigeons?!

           At first glance, they might appear to be ordinary pigeons 
           you’d feed see in the park.  But from claw to beak, they're 
           OVER SIX FEET TALL, they have opposable wing-tips, and...  

                                 PARCIVAL (#3)
                        Peace, lad.  We mean you no harm. 

           They TALK.  PARCIVAL, the largest and the leader, his beak 
           a crisscross of battle scars, approaches.  Cooing gently.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Are you wounded?  Are you well?

                                 LOWELL 
                        Wh-what are you?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        I am Parcival.

                                 RINALDO (#1)
                            (chimes in)
                        Protector of the Pigeon Realms!

                                 ORLANDO (#2)
                        Champion Knight of the Lost Cause!  

                                 RINALDO
                        First Finder of All That is --

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Thank you, that'll do.  May I 
                        present Squires Rinaldo and 
                        Orlando?  Gallant young fledglings 
                        in service of the flock.

           The two young birds raise wings in a salute.  Lowell gapes.
                                 PARCIVAL
                        Have you any notion where you are?  
                        Your name, lad?  Can you tell me 
                        your name?

                                 LOWELL
                        L-L-Low--

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Go on, go on, it's alright.

                                 LOWELL
                        Lowell A-Armstrong Leavitt.

           A pause.  The pigeons stare, stunned.

                                 ORLANDO
                        “Lowell Armstrong Leavitt?”

                                 RINALDO
                        The “Lowell Armstrong Leavitt?”

           Lowell nods, confused.  He's instantly SMOTHERED IN WINGS.

           INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - NIGHT

           Lowell squirms helplessly as the three birds haul him down 
           a shadowy passage, deeper into the earth.

                                 LOWELL
                        What are you doing?  Where are you 
                        taking me?  Let go!

                                 ORALANDO
                        Are you certain this is wise, 
                        brother?  Bringing him here?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        The boy must be brought before the 
                        Elders.  They’ll know what to do.

           Ahead, LIGHT FLICKERS.  They round the bend to REVEAL...

           A GUARD POST

           Torches in wing, TWO PIGEON GUARDS snap to attention, 
           saluting as Parcival approaches.  Rinaldo pulls one aside, 
           quietly whispering to him.  The bird nods, and with a   
           wide-eyed glance at Lowell, hurries off into the darkness.  
                                 LOWELL
                        Where is he going?  What is this 
                        place?  Hey, are we underground?

           The other pulls open the gate -- it looks like a large 
           section of a bird cage -- allowing them in.

                                 LOWELL
                        Is anyone ever gonna answer me!?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Patience, lad.  Patience.

           As they move onward, the tunnel opens into a large open 
           cavern.  Torches cast wavering light across a honeycomb of 
           cramped caves, several stories high.    

           PIGEONS poke their heads out, emerging from their homes as 
           they boy and the birds march past.      

                                 LOWELL
                        You guys live down here?

           “Live” might be too strong a word.  This place looks more 
           like a refugee camp.  Many of the birds look hungry, weary, 
           wounded, or all three.  Missing feathers, wings in slings.  

           They whisper, point as Lowell is led past.

                                 LOWELL
                        What kind of pigeons are you? 

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Homing Pigeons, to be precise.

           A SQUAB CHICK, newly hatched, shyly toddles toward them.  
           She presses a filthy SOCK into Lowell’s hands.  Written on 
           it in faded marker: “LOWELL”.   

                                 LOWELL
                        This is...  
                            (remembering)
                        I lost this at the mall.  In the 
                        escalator.  Last June!  How'd you 
                        get it?

                                 SQUAB CHICK
                        Found!

           She squeals happily and scampers back to her proud pigeon 
           parents.  Lowell stares, flabbergasted. 
                                 LOWELL
                        Where am I?

           Parcival turns to him, just long enough to break the news. 

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Somehow, lad.  Don’t ask me how.  
                        You have found your way...
                            (beat)
                        To The Land of Lost Things.

           Before Lowell can process that, he’s ushered onward into...

           INT. PIGEON PARLIAMENT - NIGHT

           Hundreds of milling birds fill the cave, some so worked up 
           they're molting.  Lowell stands on the plateaued top of a 
           stalagmite, feeling like the lone worm in a nest gone nuts.  

           An EGGHEAD ELDER tries to quell the chaos from his perch. 

                                 EGGHEAD ELDER
                        Order!  Order, I say!  All of your 
                        queries can be addressed if we 
                        behave in an orderly--

                                 PINT-SIZED ELDER (O.S.)
                        Flock orderly!  We want answers!

           He hovers up to Lowell like a hummingbird, poking at him.

                                 PINT-SIZED ELDER
                        Who sent you?
                            (poke)
                        What do you want here?  
                            (poke)
                        Are you looking down your beak at 
                        me?  Why, you little...

           A BALDING ELDER tears out his own plumage in distress.

                                 BALDING ELDER
                        Why you?  Why us?  Oh, why me?  

                                 EGGHEAD ELDER
                        Can you be more precise about this 
                        “book” you followed?  Author?  
                        Publisher?  I.S.B.N.?
                                 LOWELL
                        I told you.  I didn’t even get a 
                        chance to read it.  I couldn’t even 
                        tell you the plot.

           A GRIZZLED ELDER puffs his chest, squints his good eye.

                                 GRIZZLED ELDER
                        Aye, that’s what this is.  A plot.  
                        Pack-rat plot, sure as eggs.  Clear 
                        as day.  Whole thing reeks of rat.    

                                 EGGHEAD ELDER
                        You think everything reeks of rat.

                                 GRIZZLED ELDER
                        Everything do.  And so do that boy!

           Overlapping arguing, squawking.  Suddenly, something 
           horrifying occurs to the Balding Elder.  He shrills:

                                 BALDING ELDER
                        Oh, my feathers, the Beacon!  What 
                        if he’s come for the Beacon!  Oh, 
                        it's the end!  The end of the wo--

           -- SLAP!  A pint-sized wing returns him to his senses. 

                                 BALDING ELDER
                        Ow.

                                 PINT-SIZED ELDER
                        Have you all lost your bird-brained 
                        minds?  However, why-ever he's 
                        here, this boy brings trouble. 
                            (grave)
                        Or have you forgotten who'll come 
                        looking for him?

           Murmurs buzz from pigeon to pigeon:  “The Finder-Keeper!”  
           “No, not the Finder-Keeper!"  Lowell leans to Rinaldo:

                                 LOWELL
                        Who's the Finder-Keeper?

           The Egghead raises his wings, again quieting the crowd.

                                 EGGHEAD ELDER
                        Gentlebirds, hens, I think we can 
                        all agree, there is but one thing 
                        to be done here.  The right thing.
                            (a solemn pause)
                        Get rid of the kid!
                                 PINT-SIZED ELDER
                        And quick!

           The pigeons erupt in agreement.  A multitude of wings 
           reaching up to drag Lowell down off of his stalagmite.

                                 LOWELL
                        Hey!  Wait!  It’s not my fault!

           Carrying him across the cave like a crowd surfer, until --

                                 PARCIVAL
                            (his voice rings out)
                        By the Beacon!  You're homing 
                        pigeons.  Or have you all forgotten 
                        what that means?

           He stands before the pigeon mob, an immoveable feathered 
           force.  Rinaldo and Orland take up positions beside him. 

                                 PARCIVAL
                        We are supposed to see that lost 
                        things are found.  It is our duty.  
                        Our life!  And what could be more 
                        important than a little lost boy?

           The frenzied flock, cowed, lowers the boy to the ground.  
           Birds look down in shame.  Just then, a CRUMB OF DIRT falls 
           from the cave roof, bounces off the Balding Elder's head.

                                 BALDING ELDER
                            (looks up, mumbling)
                        The sky is falling...?  oh my 
                        feathers, the sky is falling...

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Listen to your hearts, brothers!  
                        The only thing we need fear is--

           The cave RUMBLES.  The MARCH of a THOUSAND CLAWED PAWS.

                                 GRIZZLED ELDER
                        RATS!

           Pigeons panic.  Feathers fly.  Parcival turns toward 
           Lowell, but...  He’s GONE.

           INT. PIGEON CAVERN - NIGHT

           Flanked by Orlando and Rinaldo, Parcival dashes out of 
           pigeon parliament -- 
           Into absolute chaos.  RATS swarm through the entrance, 
           trampling the gate and overwhelming the guards.  They wear 
           mismatched suits of armor, wielding HARPOONS and NETS.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        It’s a raid!  We must find the boy!

           Two RAT SOLDIERS rush towards him.  He sends the rodents 
           sprawling with a SWAT of his wing.

                                 ORLANDO
                        Parcival!  There!  Look!

           He turns, to see the tail end of a RED RAIN PONCHO vanish 
           into a side tunnel.  As they fight their way toward it -- 

           INT. SIDE TUNNEL - NIGHT

           Lowell stomps along, wiping his sniffly nose on his filthy 
           sock, oblivious to the sounds of battle echoing behind him.

                                 LOWELL
                        Stupid big birds.  Don’t want me 
                        around?  Fine.  I’ll find my own...      

           He rounds a corner and -- Instantly DIVES BACK, pressing 
           anxiously against the wall.

                                 LOWELL
                        Okay, wrong way.

           TWO RAT SOLDIERS spin in his direction, sniffing the air.

                                 RAT SOLDIER #1
                        Do you smell something?

                                 RAT SOLDIER #2
                            (wrinkles his snout)
                        Socks?

           Realizing he’s seconds away from discovery, Lowell BOLTS 
           from his hiding place.  Darts across into another tunnel.

                                 RAT SOLDIER #1
                        The boy!  There he goes!  He’s --

                                 RAT SOLDIER #2
                        -- Mine!

           The rats scurry after.  Shoving to be first.
           Lowell races through the passageway, looking fearfully over 
           his shoulder.  SHADOWS of the TWO RATS LICK at his heels.

                                 LOWELL
                        Oh crap, oh jeeze, oh man, oh...

           He dashes around the next bend and -- Skids to a dead stop.  

                                 LOWELL
                        ...Rats.

           A DOZEN, to be specific.  A beat as Lowell and the rodents, 
           equally surprised, blink at one another.  Then...

                                 RAT SOLDIER #12
                        He’s --

                                 ELEVEN RATS IN UNISON
                        -- MINE!

           Lowell backpedals, frantic, but both sides of the tunnel 
           are now blocked.  He’s trapped like a...  Well, you know.     

                                 LOWELL
                        Listen, can’t we just talk about...
                            (He sees the answer in their 
                             beady eyes.  It ain’t yes.)
                        Okay.  Somebody?  Anybody!  HELP!

           Readying nets, the rodents creep closer, closer, until...  

           A BREEZE stirs the hairs on Lowell’s head, an unmistakable 
           sound fills the tunnel -- WHUMP!  WHUMP!  WHUMP! -- WINGS!

           PARCIVAL, ORLANDO, RINALDO

           SOAR down the tunnel like fighter jets in formation, coming 
           up behind the Rat Duo, who turn, eyes wide as 1, 2...

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Duck, lad!  Duck!

           ... Orlando and Rinaldo PLUCK the rats off their paws, 
           carrying them past Lowell at breakneck speed, and releasing 
           them like perfectly timed bombs -- AIMED AT THE OTHER RATS.

                                 RINALDO
                        Incoming, you villainous vermin!

           Like frantically squeaking furry cannonballs, the two rats 
           CRASH RIGHT INTO the twelve, scattering them like tenpins.
           The birds alight beside Lowell.  Seeing the three powerful 
           pigeons, the dazed rats pick themselves up and run for it.   

                                 ORLANDO
                        That’s right!  You’d best run!

                                 PARCIVAL
                        They may run now, but they’ll be 
                        back.  Quick, lad.  This way.

           But Lowell, shaking off his momentary gratitude, shrugs him 
           off.  Marches resolutely the opposite direction.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Where are you going?  Lowell?

                                 LOWELL
                        I don’t know, okay?  I’m lost!

           His outburst ECHOES:  "Lost...  lost...  lost...  lost..." 

                                 LOWELL
                        I don’t know how I got to this 
                        place -- where there’s giant birds, 
                        and humongous rats, and, and...
                            (waves his sock)
                        My socks?  And I don’t know why.   
                        I don’t know anything.  All I want 
                        to know is how I get home!

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Lad, home is precisely where we’re 
                        trying to take you.

           A beat.  Lowell stares at them, trying to seem tough, but 
           he’s so scared, and alone, and truly in need of a friend.

                                 LOWELL
                        You promise?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        On my honor.  I swear it.

           The strength with which this bird speaks, it’d be utterly 
           impossible not to trust him.  Lowell softens.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Good.  Now, have you flown before?

                                 LOWELL
                        One time I lost my luggage before 
                        we even got to the airport.
                                 PARCIVAL
                        Just don’t lose your grip.

           As Parcival hunkers down for Lowell to board, we SMASH TO:

           THE WALLS OF THE TUNNEL, ZOOMING PAST AT ASTOUNDING SPEED

           Parcival rockets along the passageway, Orlando and Rinaldo 
           flanking.  A wind-blown Lowell hangs on for his dear life.   

                                 LOWELL
                        This is awesome!  This is amazing!
                        Oh, I think I’m gonna throw up...

           The tunnel curves upward into a natural “chimney”.  The 
           birds pull into a climb, rocketing toward an opening above.

                                 RINALDO
                        Fret not, lad.  We shall have you 
                        home sooner than you can say --

           EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

                                 LOWELL
                        -- RATS!

           The pigeons emerge from underground, right into the midst 
           of an ARMY.  RATS everywhere.  Crowding the jungle, 
           swarming as far as their eyes can see.  

                                 ORLANDO
                        Look out!

           A VOLLEY of HARPOONS crisscrosses all around them.  The 
           pigeons bank and weave among the trees.  

                                 RINALDO
                        They’re everywhere!  They’ve never 
                        come in such numbers before!

           Parcival looks back at Lowell, realizing.  

                                 PARCIVAL
                        We’ve never had something they 
                        wanted so badly before!

           BOOM!  A NET UNFURLS in the air directly in front of them.

           The birds take evasive action.  Barely avoiding the midair 
           snare.  It tangles, falling to the jungle below, where --
           A LARGE CANNON cranes around, tracking the pigeons’ flight.  
           Fuse BURNING.  The RAT ARTILLERY UNIT plugs its ears...

           BOOM!  A CANNONBALL screams into the air, EXPLODES into 
           another NET-BOMB.  Again, it misses by a matter of feet.

                                 ORLANDO
                        They’ll snare us before we can 
                        clear the canopy!

                                 RINALDO
                        We must set down!

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Here, squires!  Take cover here!

           Parcival leads them to the branches of a thick tree, where 
           they alight, finding some momentary cover.

           As harpoons riddle the bark around them, they see something 
           that -- well, that “scrambles their eggs.” 

                                 ORLANDO
                        By the Beacon, no... 

           From the entrance to the caves below, pack-rat guards lead 
           a string of PIGEON PRISONERS away in chains.  The gate 
           guards.  The elders.  Even the squab chick and her parents.    

                                 RINALDO
                        This is no ordinary raid.  They’ve 
                        captured every last bird!

           A fire lights in Parcival’s eyes.  Forming a battle plan.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        We must do something.  We must set 
                        them free.  Rinaldo, Orlando, we--

           He stops, seeing their looks.  For a moment, he’d forgotten 
           the boy still clinging fearfully to his back.

                                 RINALDO
                        Leave the rodents to us, brother.  
                        You have your duty.

                                 ORLANDO
                        Hardly be fair, anyway.  Three of 
                        us verses so few of them.

           It is a suicide mission, and they know it.  But we can see 
           in the brave set of their beaks, they’ve made their choice.
                                 PARCIVAL
                        Squires, wait!  There must be 
                        another way...

           Ignoring his order, the birds raise their wings in salute.    

                                 ORLANDO
                        Huzzah to Parcival, Protector of 
                        the Pigeon Realms!

                                 RINALDO
                        Champion Knight of the Lost Cause!

                                 ORLANDO
                        First Finder of All That Is Missed!

                                 RINALDO
                        Huzzah to the bravest of us all!

           With that, they leap off the branches, dive bombing into 
           the heart of the rat army.  We hear RAT SQUEAKS, pained 
           PIGEON SQUAWKS.  The sounds of battle.  Chaos from below.

           Parcival returns their salute, overcome by their courage.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        May you find your way through this, 
                        you gallant young birds.  May you 
                        find your way through in one piece.

           And with a beat of his massive wings, he takes to the air.  
           The squires’ diversion gives him enough time to weave 
           through the towering trees, soaring up through the canopy.  

           EXT. SKY - NIGHT

           Wind ruffling his hair, Lowell stares, eyes wide as dinner 
           plates, at the indescribable firmament stretching out 
           around him.  Every star is a SHOOTING STAR.

           For a moment, Lowell sees the entire Land of Lost Things at 
           once.  Mountains, marshes, plains, jungles, deserts.  
           Shrinking below as they climb higher and higher and higher.

                                 LOWELL
                        Holey moley, this is the way home?

           As Parcival flaps across the stars, plotting his course, 
           unbeknownst to him... A SET of CROSSHAIRS trains on him.

           Crouched in a clearing below, the RAT we met in the sewer, 
           squinting into the sight of a LONG-BARRELLED HARPOON GUN. 
                                 PARCIVAL
                        Hold onto your sock, Lowell.  Soon, 
                        you’ll home, warm, safe in your ...  

           A FAINT POP, far below, and -- PARCIVAL SUDDENLY PLUMMETS 
           OUT OF THE SKY.  He’s going down.  Losing altitude fast.

           Lowell holds on for dear life, hollering at the top of his 
           lungs.  The jungle rushes past beneath them, giving way to 
           a vast expanse of blue sand.  The DESERT.  As the dunes  
           race toward them, Lowell covers his eyes, and we SMASH TO:

           COMPLETE BLACKNESS

           A groan.  Breathing.  The sound of fingers scooping sand.

           EXT. DESERT - DAY

           Lowell’s head pops out.  He digs his body free, squinting 
           up at the BLAZING HOT SUN.  He’s alive.  And --

                                 LOWELL
                        Parcival?

           Alone.  Behind him, Lowell can just make out the edge of 
           the jungle, a cluster of verdant green on the distant 
           horizon.  Before him, a towering dune blocks his view.  

                                 LOWELL
                        Parciva--!

           --his cry CHOKES OFF, as he HACKS UP a lungful of sand.  
           Digging grit out of his shorts, Lowell climbs the dune.  As 
           he reaches the top, he’s perplexed to find -- 

           A FLAG

           waving lazily in the breeze.  It’s black, emblazoned with a 
           LEERING SKULL & CROSSBONES, and most unusually, it’s 
           affixed to a WOODEN MAST JUTTING UP OUT OF THE SAND. 

                                 LOWELL
                        What the...?

           Then, his eyes -- and ours -- refocus on what lies BEHIND 
           the fluttering flag...

           And they go WIIIIIDE.

           A NAUTICAL GRAVEYARD
           stretches out across the sand in every direction.  Ancient 
           wooden sailing vessels, rotting on the sun-drenched sand 
           beside rusted out speed-boats.  Smashed schooners and 
           crashed cruise ships.  Their wrecked remains strewn across 
           the desert floor like the bottom of some long receded sea.  

                                 LOWELL
                        What is this place?

           At the center, reflecting the white-hot sun like glass... 

           A HUGE OASIS.  IN THE SHAPE OF A PERFECT TRIANGULAR POOL.

           EXT. FAR SIDE OF THE DUNE - DAY

           A FIGURE bursts up from the dune, shaking sand from its 
           feathers.  Parcival flexes his wing -- WINCING in instant 
           agony.  But his concern is not from himself.  It’s for:

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Lowell?  Where are you, lad?

           Turning, he spots something that -- makes him stop dead.   

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Oh, pluck me...  LOOOWELL!!!

           As he hurries off, fast as his bird legs can go, REVEAL --

           A RUSTED-OUT MOTOR BOAT, partially submerged in the sand.  
           Stenciled across its transom in peeling paint, next to a 
           cartoon of a smiling marlin, the words:  “FISH BERMUDA”.

           EXT. NAUTICAL GRAVEYARD - DAY

           Lowell wanders through the valley of wrecked vessels.  He 
           peers into a gaping hole in the half-buried hulk of a 
           Spanish Galleon.  Inside, rotting barrels, a rusty cannon. 

                                 LOWELL
                        How’d all these boats end up in the 
                        middle of a desert?  I thought I 
                        had a bad sense of direction.

           As he moves on... 

           SOMETHING STIRS in the shadowy corner of the ship’s hull.

           OUTSIDE, Lowell discovers a long trench cut through the 
           sand, stretching out behind a wrecked speedboat.  As if it 
           ran aground from somewhere.  He follows the trench to...
           THE EDGE OF THE TRIANGULAR OASIS

           Where, realizing how thirsty he is, he cups a mouthful of 
           water and -- Immediately SPITS it back out.

                                 LOWELL
                        Ick.  Salty?

           Suddenly, a wave carries something onto the beach at 
           Lowell’s feet.  It looks like a PLASTIC HOCKEY PUCK.  He 
           fishes it out.  Studies it, eyes lighting up.

                                 LOWELL
                        A Jr. Explorer's Compass?  I used 
                        to have one of these, till it got 
                        flushed down the...
                            (realizes)
                        Hey!  This is mine!

           Carved in its back: “L-O-W-E-L-L”.  He pockets the compass, 
           excitedly looking around for more.

                                 LOWELL
                        Maybe there’s more of my stuff 
                        around here too...

           He trails off, seeing something that makes his MOUTH SAG.   

           A SHIH TZU 

           sits at the edge of the beach, tail a-wag.  Dangling from 
           its frayed collar, a FILTHY DOG-TAG reads:

                                 LOWELL
                        “Buster”?

           BARK-BARK!  

                                 LOWELL
                        Is IS you!  Come’ere boy, come on!

           Overjoyed, Lowell races across the sand toward his long 
           lost dog.  He reaches to pet the pooch, but --

           JERKS his HAND BACK as the dog SNAPS at him.

                                 LOWELL
                        Hey!  Easy, Buster.  Why’d you...?

           Closer now, Lowell can see the dog’s mangy fur, jutting 
           ribs, the feral glint in his eyes.  From behind Buster, 
           OTHER ANIMALS emerge from hiding spots inside the ships.   
           DOGS.  Dozens of them.  CATS.  Meowing and hissing, 
           hungrily licking their chops.  A TRIBE OF LOST PETS.

                                 LOWELL
                            (worried)
                        Uhh.  Buster...?

           Buster GROWLS.  The others join in.  GRRRRRR...  They back 
           Lowell against the side of a schooner.  From a porthole 
           beside his face, a HAMSTER pokes out its furry little head. 

                                 LOWELL
                            (recognizing it)
                        Yosemite Ham?

           It SNARLS!  LEAPS ONTO HIS FACE!  As Lowell HOWLS IN PAIN--

                                                                 CUT TO:

           PARCIVAL, who turns at the noise, to see...

                                 PARCIVAL
                        ...Lowell?

           The boy sprints out from behind a sailboat, cats clinging 
           to his back, dogs chewing at his pant-legs.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Lad, pease, we don’t have time to 
                        play around.

                                 LOWELL
                        Who’s playing around?  They’re 
                        eating me alive here!  Help!

           Parcival calmly sweeps the animals off of Lowell’s body.  
           They hiss and howl angrily.  Quickly scurrying away.  
           Buster gives one last growl, scampering after the others.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        They’re just Lost Pets.  Strays.  
                        Harmless, I assure you.  Now come.  
                        We’ve a long walk ahead of us.

                                 LOWELL
                        “A walk?”  Aren’t you gonna--

           But, then he sees.  Pales.  Points at...

                                 LOWELL
                        Parcival, you’re -- your wing!
           IT BLEEDS.  The BROKEN BUTT of A HARPOON JUTTING OUT.  The 
           boy gingerly touches it.  The pigeon recoils in pain.

                                 LOWELL
                        You’re hurt?  But, but -- if you’re 
                        hurt, how’re you gonna get me home?  

                                 PARCIVAL
                        I have a plan, lad.  But for now, 
                        we must get moving.

                                 LOWELL
                        I’m not moving another step till--

           Parcival whirls on Lowell, grabbing his arm.  Intense.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Listen to me.  If we stop.  If we 
                        tarry, what’s looking for us -- for 
                        you -- will find us.  And if that 
                        happens, we will be lost.  Just 
                        like every last one of my flock!
                            (his voice softens)
                        I gave you my word, lad.  And I 
                        will get you home.  Trust that.

           He turns to go, but Lowell’s voice stops him.  Timid.

                                 LOWELL
                        Parcival?  It’s not just rats that 
                        are looking for me, is it?  It’s...

           Parcival looks to the horizon, where in a haze of smog in 
           the distance, a SLENDER BLACK SPIRE rises up into the sky.

                                 PARCIVAL
                            (grim)
                        The Finder-Keeper.

                                 LOWELL
                        That’s the second time I heard that 
                        name.  Who is he?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Lowell, I will do everything in my 
                        power to ensure you never find out.  

           He leads the boy off into across the sand, but we hold on 
           the spire, as it seems to pulse with malevolent energy...
           INT. THE KEEP - DAY? / NIGHT? / NOONISH?

           A SHADOWY FIGURE sits in the dark recess of an enormous 
           throne fashioned out of countless glimmering lost keys.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER (O.S.)
                        An army at your disposal, yet you 
                        still can’t bring me what I ask?  
                        Have you anything to say, Milton?

           A fingernail, a long yellowed spiral, reaches out of the 
           darkness, tracing the jugular of the RAT from the sewers.

                                 MILTON
                        I-I have n-no excuse, K-Keeper.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER (O.S.)
                        Course you don’t, you lack-wit.  
                        Even your excuses belong to me!

           He waves the rodent away, crooking his fingernail toward 
           the shadows, where a HULKING RAT melts out, flanked by TWO 
           OTHER scarred, saliva dripping BEHEMOTHS.  We’ll call the 
           leader RATSPUTIN.  The others, ONE-EAR and SNAGGLE-TOOTH.      

                                 RATSPUTIN
                        You sssummoned usss, my Keeper?

                                 FINDER-KEEPER (O.S.)
                        Yes, I do so hate losing things.  
                        Especially my temper.
                            (hisses)

           EXT. DESERT - SUNSET

           Lowell and Parcival trek across the sand, the sun sinking 
           low behind them.  Lowell wears his sweater like a turban.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Sewer grates, sink drains.  Several 
                        mailboxes lead directly here as 
                        well.  There are many paths to this 
                        land.  But they are all one-way.  

                                 LOWELL
                        So, the only way home is to fly?
                                 PARCIVAL
                        Well...  There is one other.  But, 
                        it is unreachable.  The only viable 
                        way home is via Homing Pigeon.

                                 LOWELL
                        But if all the other pigeons are 
                        prisoners, and you can’t...  you 
                        know.  What are we gonna do?

           Parcival points toward the horizon, beyond a towering range 
           of mountains.  A forest in the far distance.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        They are not all prisoners.  There 
                        is a place where pigeons still fly 
                        free.  Ready, willing, and able to 
                        see you home.
                            (turns to Lowell, serious)
                        But the way is far and fraught with 
                        danger.  If we’re to make it, you 
                        must stay close, touch nothing, and 
                        do as I say.  No questions asked.

                                 LOWELL
                        Got it.  No problem.  One question.

           Parcival sighs, marching on.  Lowell switches his single 
           galosh to his other foot, hopping to catch up.

                                 LOWELL
                        Ow, ow!  Hot sand.  Okay.  So, I 
                        been thinking.  All the stuff I 
                        ever lost -- my sock, my book, my 
                        Dad’s car keys.  It ends up here.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Other, less tangible things as 
                        well.  Lost hours, dreams, loves...

                                 LOWELL
                        Right, right.  Cause the pack-rats 
                        bring it all here, and you guys --

                                 PARCIVAL
                        -- The Fraternal Flock of Finding.

                                 LOWELL
                        Right.  You guys try to bring it 
                        all back.  How do you even know 
                        where it’s supposed to go? 
                                 PARCIVAL
                            (nods to Lowell’s compass)
                        The same way your compass knows.  
                        We pigeons are the needle.  And It 
                        points us in the right direction.  

                                 LOWELL
                        It?  You mean like a big magnet?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        The Beacon.  Our Homing Beacon, the  
                        Heart of our land.  Without it, 
                        nothing would ever be found again.

           Lowell bends to switch his one galosh again.

                                 LOWELL
                        Okay.  But -- ow! -- that wasn’t my 
                        question.  My question is:  What 
                        happens when I lose something here?  

           Parcival looks as if he doesn’t understand. 

                                 LOWELL
                        I can lose stuff here, can’t I?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        There is one place, at the furthest 
                        edge of our world, where a thing 
                        might truly be lost forever.  But --

           That’s all Lowell needed to hear.  He races onward, 
           throwing his compass high up into the air and catching it.  

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Lowell, wait.  I said stay close.

                                 LOWELL
                        Why?  I can’t lose!  I can’t lo--

           --THUMP!  He falls onto his face.  Tripped.  By a SUITCASE.

                                 LOWELL
                        Ow.  Somebody lose their luggage?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        You have no idea.

           Lowell looks up to see another suitcase.  And another.  And  
           dozens more, scattered in the sand, stretching across the 
           desert to the black fingers of foothills, rising up, up, up 
           into the MOUNTAIN RANGE we saw before.  But from here, we 
           can see the “mountains” are COLOSSAL HEAPS of LOST LUGGAGE. 
                                 PARCIVAL
                        The Samsonite Mountains.  They are 
                        what stands between us and our 
                        destination.  Come, lad.  

           They appear to stretch up forever.  And ever.  And EVER...

                                 LOWELL
                        You mean we’re gonna climb those? 
                            (swallows)
                        Hope I can’t lose my balance too.

           EXT. SAMSONITE MOUNTAINS - NIGHT

           At the base of the range, Parcival and Lowell stand swathed 
           in a wardrobe’s worth of sweaters, scarves.  They root 
           through the luggage.  Loading up on layers for the ascent.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Wear all you can bear.  Once we 
                        leave, there will be no returns.    

                                 LOWELL
                        But if it gets too cold, can’t we 
                        just find something else up there?  
                        The whole peak’s packed.    

                                 PARCIVAL
                        You dislodge the wrong luggage, 
                        lad, you may cause an avalanche.  
                        Trust me, it’s best to be prepared.

           With a grunt, Lowell squeezes into one more pair of pants.

                                 LOWELL
                        Okay, so, we climb to the other 
                        side of the mountains.  Then what?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        One challenge at a time.

                                 LOWELL
                        You said it’s best to be prepared.  
                        What if we get separated?  

           Parcival holds up a COIL OF ROPE.  He ties one end to 
           himself, looping the other end around Lowell’s waist.  

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Beyond lie the Forgotten Fields.  
                        Home to the world’s lost knowledge.  
                        There is a train that runs there.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 PARCIVAL (CONT'D)
                        We must be on that train.  Now, as 
                        I said, one challenge at a time.

           He starts up the mountain, rope unspooling behind him.  As 
           Lowell waits, he can’t help but glance back at the desert.

                                 LOWELL
                        Parcival?  You really think they’re 
                        still looking for us?  For me?  

                                 PARCIVAL
                        I don’t think it, lad.  I know.

           Lowell shivers.  As the rope pulls him onward, we hold on 
           his footprints, retreating off toward the dark horizon...

           EXT. NAUTICAL GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

           ... Miles away, a SHADOW hunkers over those same prints.  
           Ratsputin breathes in the scent, yellow pupils gleaming.   

                                 RATSPUTIN
                        The boy...

           Huddled over the half-eaten corpse of a CAT, One-Ear and 
           Snaggle-Tooth look up, snouts wet with blood.  

                                 ONE-EAR & SNAGGLE-TOOTH
                        The boy!

           One-Ear slurp-sucks the tail like spaghetti.  They lope 
           toward the mountains, a trio of bloodhounds on the hunt.

           EXT. THE EDGE OF A CLIFF, SAMSONITE MOUNTAINS - NIGHT

           Lowell GRABS a suitcase handle, frosted with snow.  He 
           grabs another.  Another.  Pulling himself up with ease.    

                                 LOWELL
                        This is way easier than I thought!

           PULL BACK to REVEAL -- Parcival, at the top of the cliff, 
           holding the rope, using every ounce of his strength to haul 
           Lowell over the edge.  He collapses in an exhausted heap. 

           Lowell looks back over the side.  A vertigo-inducing sprawl 
           of ant-sized suitcases greets him.  Bottomless canyons 
           built of book-bags.  Peaks of piled purses.  

                                 LOWELL
                        Holey moley, I think I can see my 
                        house from here.  That was a joke.

                        You okay, Parce?  You look tired.

           Still gasping, Parcival surveys their surroundings.  The 
           ledge extends toward a SMALL CAVE set into the mountain. 

                                 PARCIVAL
                        What say we spell ourselves a bit, 
                        hmm?  Have a peck to eat?  

           As Lowell perks up at the mention of food, we MOVE TO...

           THE CAVE

           ... where he immediately perks back down upon seeing the 
           wingful of BIRDSEED that Parcival offers him.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Not hungry?  There’s plenty more.

                                 LOWELL
                        You don’t actually expect me to eat 
                        that, do you?  I need real food.  
                        Like Funyuns.  Or a pudding cup.    

           He studies the cave walls around him, clearing away snow 
           the reveal the bags buried beneath like bricks in a wall.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Lowell, what are you doing?

                                 LOWELL
                        You don’t even know how many 
                        backpacks I’ve lost over the years.   
                        Always with my lunch still inside.  
                        One’s gotta be around here somewh-- 

           -- Parcival grabs Lowell’s hand, stopping him.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        I told you, lad.  It’s not safe.

                                 LOWELL
                        Parcival, come on!  My stomach’s 
                        practically talking to --

                                 A VOICE (V.O.)
                            (echoing)
                        Heeeelllo-o-o...

           A beat.  Lowell looks down, stunned.

                                 LOWELL
                        Was that my...?
                                 PARCIVAL
                        No lad, that was a Lost Voice.  
                        Ever have a sore throat?  Lose your 
                        voice?  This is where it goes.

                                 LOST VOICE (V.O.)
                        Heeeeelllo-o-o-o--

           The Voice breaks into a COUGHING FIT, hacks up some phlegm.

                                 LOST VOICE (V.O.)
                        Uck.  This altitude plays havoc 
                        with my sinuses.  And the cold?  
                        Don’t even get me started.  Say...
                            (brightens)
                        You don’t happen to have a lozenge,

                            (a la the commercial)
                        Riiiiiicolaaaa?

           A beat.  Lowell turns back toward Parcival.

                                 LOWELL
                        You stay here and talk to thin air 
                        if you want to, I’m going this way.

                                 LOWELL
                        I just need to use the little boy’s 
                        cave, okay?  I won’t touch 
                        anything.  I promise.

           He holds up his end of the rope.  Still tied between them.

                                 LOWELL
                        Any problems, I’ll tug.

           After a moment, Parcival relents.

           INT. AROUND A BEND, CAVE - NIGHT

           The second Lowell is out of sight, he resumes his search.  

                                 LOWELL
                        Come on, come on, pudding cup...

           The Voice clears its “throat”.

                                 LOST VOICE (V.O.)
                        Um, excuse me, but I thought--  
                                 LOWELL
                        Mind your own business, Voice.

                                 LOST VOICE (V.O.)
                        I was simply going to ask if--

                                 LOWELL
                        Why don’t you go echo somewhere 
                        else, okay?  I’m busy.

           He spots something, deeper in the darkness of the shadowy 
           cave.  As he disappears after it...

                                 LOST VOICE (V.O.)
                            (sulkily)
                        I was just going to ask if you felt 
                        a draft too.  Juh-eeze.

           DEEP IN THE SHADOWY CAVE

           Wind whistles ominously past as Lowell approaches a swath 
           of GREEN CANVAS midway up the cave wall.  Just like the 
           backpack he lost in the opening.  But as he YANKS it OUT --

           He realizes it’s not a backpack.  It’s a GREEN FANNY-PACK.

                                 LOWELL
                        Wow.  Whoever lost this lucked out.

           Behind him, SOMEONE CLEARS THEIR THROAT.  Lowell almost 
           turns, till he realizes --

                                 LOWELL
                        I know it’s you, Voice.  I thought 
                        I told you to get los--

           A CLAWED FINGER TAPS HIS SHOULDER.  Lowell turns -- WHITE.

                                 LOWELL
                        --oh sh-sh-sh-sh-sh...

           Inches away from his face, Ratsputin’s yellow pupils BURN.   
           Lowell frantically tugs at the rope, only to find...   

           ... it’s CHEWED THROUGH.  Ratsputin shows his TEETH.      

                                 LOWELL
                        Parcival!  Help!  Parcival!!!!

           One-Ear and Snaggle-Tooth melt out of the shadows, blocking  
           the only exit, converging toward him, at the last moment... 
           A SHADOW sweeps over them and -- WHOOMMP!  Parcival BARRELS 
           through, FLATTENING the rodents like rugs.

                                 LOWELL
                        Finally!  What took you so long?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        You’re not the only one who had to 
                        use the wee bird’s cave.  Now go!  

           The sprint through the cave, out of its mouth and into...

           A violent storm HOWLING across the night sky, blotting out 
           the stars.  Parcival and Lowell struggle up the 
           mountainside, groping for baggage handles in the darkness.               

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Quickly, lad.  If we can make it 
                        over the next ridge, we’ll be...

           The scramble up and over, skidding to a sudden halt at --

                                 LOWELL
                        “Rat food?”  That what you were 
                        gonna say, “We’ll be rat food?”

           The EDGE of a DEEP RAVINE.  A briefcase dislodges beneath 
           their feet and plummets down...  down...  into mist below.         

                                 LOWELL
                        Man, I really wish you could fly 
                        right about now.

           They look for salvation either direction.  Nothing.  
           Finally, they look up, and --

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A “ROCK BRIDGE”

           Well, since it’s made of luggage, it should probably be 
           called something different.  But, regardless, the formation 
           arches up and over the ravine, attached on either side.     

           And underneath it, swinging from shoulder-strap to suitcase 
           handle, like rungs on a set of monkey bars, is Lowell.

           He glances down as his feet (and one galosh), dangling  
           over the abyss.  Quickly looks right back up.

                                 LOWELL
                        I really really wish you could fly!
                                 PARCIVAL
                        Keep focused, lad!  You can do it, 
                        just a bit further!  A few feet!

           Parcival dangles from a dufflebag behind him.  Swinging 
           himself back and forth like a pendulum, Lowell stretches 
           out for the next handhold -- a purse strap --  

                                 LOWELL
                        I got it!

           -- and swings himself to safety on the far side of the 
           ravine.  Parcival follows suit shortly after.

                                 LOWELL
                        We did it!  We made it!  Think we 
                        lost ‘em?

           They turn to discover -- the salivating TRIO of RATS on 
           their side of the ravine, snarling and surrounding them.  

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Get behind me, lad!  I have a plan!  

           The rats back them toward the mountainside.  Nowhere to go.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        My plan is to come up with a plan!

           Ratsputin SNAPS at Lowell, who bumps back against the 
           cliff.  As he does, he dislodges snow, exposing -- GREEN 
           CANVAS, scrawled on it: “L-O-W-E-L-L.”  His BACKPACK! 

                                 LOWELL
                        Parcival, look!  I told you one of 
                        them had to be up here!

           He pulls the strap, struggling to free it.  Suitcases shift 
           overhead.  Parcival tries to get his attention without 
           taking his eyes off the steadily advancing rats.  

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Lad?  What are you doing?  Lad!

                                 LOWELL
                        Calm down, Parce, I have a plan.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Wait, you're going to cause a -- 

           Lowell yanks it free.  A RUMBLING shakes the mountains.
                                 LOWELL
                            (proud)
                        Avalanche!  I know!

           Parcival ducks, hugging Lowell flat, just as A DELUGE of 
           SUITCASES tumbles down from above.  The rats have a split 
           second to look up, confusion clouding their eyes, before --

           WHOMMPP!  They’re swept away by the landslide of luggage, 
           carried off the cliff and into the abyss below.  After a 
           moment, the rumbling subsides.  The mountains are silent.

           Parcival looks up, shocked to be alive.  He turns to 
           Lowell, stunned.  The boy beams at him.  

                                 LOWELL
                        See?  I told you I had a plan!

           A SECOND WAVE OF SUITCASES TOPPLES LOOSE.  The bird is 
           swept away by a cascade of carry-ons.  A TRUNK tumbles 
           toward Lowell.  It’s lid SWINGS OPEN.

                                 LOWELL
                        Never said it was a good plan.

           It SWALLOWS him.  SNAPS SHUT.  BOUNCES over the edge...

           INT. TRUNK

           Lowell ricochets off every wall as the trunk pinballs down 
           the mountain.  Eventually, mercifully, it rocks to a stop.

           EXT. TRUNK - DAWN

           The trunk rests in a drift of snow at the base of the 
           mountains, suitcases scattered all around.  

                                 LOWELL (O.S.)
                        Parcival?

           The lid POPS OPEN.  Lowell’s head pops out.  

                                 LOWELL
                        Parcival?  Paaaaaaaaarcivaaaaall!
                            (to himself)
                        Okay.  Don’t panic.  Think.  He 
                        said this is home to the world’s --

           Climbing out, his sock sinks into the “snow”, and he 
           realizes...  it’s a giant pile of ENVELOPES.  TV Guides.  
           Publisher’s Clearinghouse.  Val-Pak Coupons.  JUNK MAIL.  
                                 LOWELL
                        -- lost knowledge?  Okay.  Well 
                        maybe he was right about the train?

           He turns to look, but all he finds are heaps of LOST BOOKS, 
           MISPLACED PAPERS, POST-IT NOTES, as far as the eye can see.   

                                 LOWELL
                        It’s best to be prepared my but--

           --A SHEET OF PAPER, blown by the wind, plasters itself over 
           his mouth.  He peels it off.  Reads the top:   

                                 LOWELL
                        “Lowell A. Leavitt.  Homework 28.”
                            (realizes)
                        Hey!  This is...

           One of his lost homeworks!

                                 LOWELL
                        And another one?

           Homework 27 flutters past.  Homework 26.  25.

                                 LOWELL
                        And another, and a -- holey moley.  
                        My lost homework, it's everywhere!

           Lowell races off across the Forgotten Fields, snatching up 
           his lost homework papers, stuffing them into his backpack.

           Finally, he climbs a hill of Cliffs’ Notes, bursting 
           through a bush covered with lost leaflets to discover --

           Homework # 1.  He bends down to pick it up, but...  it’s 
           stuck.  Pinched under a STEEL RAIL.  As he pulls at it...  

                                 LOWELL
                        Come on.  Leggo.  It's my homew--

           The SHRILL WAIL of a WHISTLE startles him.  Lowell looks 
           up, realizing the steel rail is a TRAIN TRACK, just as --

                                 LOWELL
                        -- Oh crap.

           THE TRAIN blasts around a bend, a 19th century STEAM 
           ENGINE.  Pistons chugging.  Smoke spewing.  Papers 
           scattering before it.  Barreling right toward Lowell.
           At the last moment, SOMETHING HITS Lowell like a 
           linebacker, tackling him to one side.  It’s Parcival.  
           Covered in baggage stickers.  He helps Lowell up.

                                 LOWELL
                        Parcival!  Hey, I found the train!
                            (beat)
                        Actually it looks like a bunch of 
                        different trains.

           It steams past them, its cars an odd hodgepodge of styles.  
           We see a DINING CAR that belongs on the Orient Express.  A 
           SUBWAY CAR.  A string of FREIGHT CARS from different eras.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Well, lucky for us, they’re all 
                        going the same way.  Now hurry!

           Lowell zips the last of his homework into his backpack, 
           running with Parcival beside the train, until, finally...

           THE CABOOSE

           rushes past.  Parcival grabs the rail, pulls himself up.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        My wing, lad.  Take it!

           Hobbling on his one galosh, he makes a desperate dive for 
           Parcival’s wing -- 

                                 LOWELL
                        Got it.

           Hauled aboard at the last moment.  Lowell clings to the 
           back of the train as it steams through the piles of pages, 
           chugging into a PITCH BLACK TUNNEL, its WHISTLE WAILING.

           INT. CABOOSE - DAY (MOVING IN THE TUNNEL)

           Cramped, dusty and dark.  Parcival shuts the door behind 
           them, securing it tight.  Lowell breathes a sigh of relief.     

                                 LOWELL
                        Whew...  That was a close one. 

           He unzips his pack, peeking in at his recovered homework.   

                                 LOWELL
                        But look, I found my -- Hey!

           Suddenly incensed, Parcival has snatched the pack away.
                                 PARCIVAL
                        “Close one?”  Lad, your inability 
                        to obey my few, simple instructions 
                        is going to get us both killed!

           The boy grabs frantically for the bag.  With an exasperated 
           sigh, Parcival returns it, voice softening.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Lowell, listen...     

                                 LOWELL
                        You!  You listen!  You don’t know 
                        what it’s like to be a loser your 
                        whole life.  Some nights I still 
                        get lost between my room and the 
                        bathroom.  I have to pee in Dad's 
                        ficus.  And Mom can't play Scrabble 
                        anymore 'cause I lost all the S's.  
                        She has to call it Crabble.  I'm 
                        ten years old and look.  Just look!  
                        I'm even losing my hair!

           Lowell lowers his voice, earnest.

                                 LOWELL
                        This is the first time ever, I got 
                        a chance to make up for it.  I got 
                        a chance to bring some things back. 

                                 PARCIVAL
                        It’s not your duty to bring things 
                        back, Lowell.  That’s a job for a 
                        bird.  Not for a boy.

           He extends a wing toward Lowell’s backpack.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        At some point, you’re going to have 
                        to learn to let go of this, and 
                        realize what’s really important.  
                            (kindly)
                        Getting you home.

                                 LOWELL
                        No reason we can’t do both.  Right? 
                        Everything worked out fine.  Right?

           SUNLIGHT returns to the windows as...
           EXT. TRAIN TUNNEL - DAY

           The train emerges from the other end, REVEALING a 
           countryside of rolling green hills, stately trees.  And... 

           RATSPUTIN, ONE-EAR AND SNAGGLE-TOOTH CLINGING to the 
           outside of the CABOOSE.

           INT. CABOOSE

           Parcival SUDDENLY YANKS Lowell away from the window, as --

           -- A RAT PAW SMASHES THROUGH THE GLASS!  Snaggle-Tooth 
           tries to squeeze his neck through the tiny open portal.   

                                 SNAGGLE-TOOTH
                        The boy!  Give ussss the boy!

           -- CRASH!  One-Ear SMASHES IN through the opposite window.

                                 ONE-EAR
                        You will never essssscape us!

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Quick, lad.  The door!  Run!

           As they race forward, One-Ear and Snaggle-Tooth wriggle 
           their way inside like snakes.  Parcival throws open the 
           front door, hustling the boy through to --  

                                 LOWELL
                        Holey moley!  These guys are...

           EXT. CABOOSE - DAY

           -- A CLAWED PAW SWIPES DOWN FROM ABOVE.  Almost taking 
           Lowell’s head off.  Ratsputin HISSES on the car’s roof.

                                 LOWELL
                        Everywhere!  How do they do that?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        I don’t think we should stop and 
                        ask.  Keep moving.

           The green hills whizzing past behind them, Parcival drags 
           Lowell through the next door, and into --  
           INT. FREIGHT CAR

           Stacked to the ceiling with crates.  As Lowell and Parcival 
           hurry toward the front, Lowell sees crates stamped with: 
           “LOST WALLETS”, “LOST WATCHES”, “LOST TEETH”, etc., etc.  

                                 LOWELL
                        Look at all this stuff.  Where’s it 
                        all getting taken to?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Forget that for now, lad.  There’s 
                        something I haven’t yet told you 
                        about this train.

           Parcival chances a look back.  The rats burst through the 
           back door, half-a-car behind.  Parcival urges Lowell on.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        It isn’t any ordinary train.  And 
                        the longer we’re on it, the more 
                        we’ll start to... we’ll start to...

           He trails off.  Running, Lowell glances over expectantly.

                                 LOWELL
                        “We’ll start to”... what?

                                 PARCIVAL
                            (no clue)
                        What?

                                 LOWELL
                        You trailed off right in the middle 
                        of...  I mean, you were gonna...  
                            (blanking)
                        Weird.  Now, I can’t remember.

           Parcival sighs, shaking out the cobwebs.  

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Not weird, lad.  Not for where we 
                        are.  It isn’t called “The Lost 
                        Train of Thought” for nothing.

                                 LOWELL
                            (a beat)
                        I’m sorry, what were we talking 
                        about again?

           Parcival ushers Lowell across another gap, racing into...
           INT. FRONT-MOST FREIGHT CAR

           Crates, crates, more crates.  They run to the front door.

                                 LOWELL
                        We can’t just keep running forever.  
                        Eventually, we’ll run out of train.  

                                 PARCIVAL
                        If we can make it to the engine, we 
                        can detach the rest of the cars.

                                 LOWELL
                        And leave the rats in our tracks?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Precisely.  So, no matter what, we 
                        must-must-must keep moving forwa--

           Parcival grabs the front door’s knob, but --  IT’S LOCKED.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Oh for flock’s sake!  What else!?

           -- The back door BURSTS IN and THE RATS surge toward them.  

                                 RATSPUTIN
                        Where are you fleeing to, bird?  
                        There’s no essscape.

           As the rats advance, Parcival looks around frantically...

                                 PARCIVAL
                        There has to be...  Somewhere...
                            (points)
                        There, lad.  A key!

           IT hangs from a hook, on the far wall, BEHIND the TRIO OF 
           RATS.  Lowell gulps uneasily.   

                                 LOWELL
                        Think maybe there’s another one?

           Parcival strides toward the rats, his beak set bravely.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        You open the door.  I’ll open up a 
                        box of rat poison.

           With a flap of his wings, Parcival propels himself into  
           the onrushing rats, tackling them back into the crates.  
                                 PARCIVAL
                        Have at you!  Ha!  Mano-a-mouses!

           Feathers, fur flies.  Seizing the opportunity, Lowell ducks 
           past.  Rushes to the far wall.  Pulls the key off its hook.

                                 LOWELL
                        Parcival, I got it!

           The TRAIN hits a BUMP, and Lowell fumbles it.  The key  
           skitters across the floor, under the grappling animals.

                                 LOWELL
                        Oops, scratch that.

           Parcival fights to hold clawed paws away from his face.  

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Don’t say scratch!  Quickly, lad!

           Lowell crawls on hands and knees, trying to grab the key, 
           as it’s kicked by rodent paws and bird feet.  

                                 LOWELL
                        Almost got it...  Almost got it...

           Just as he’s about to grab it -- Parcival is shoved back 
           into some crates.  One falls, SMASHES OPEN and SCATTERS A 
           SHOWER OF KEYS across the floor, camouflaging the DOOR KEY.  
           Only now do we see the stencil on the crate: “LOST KEYS”.

                                 LOWELL
                        Oh come on!  That is not fair!

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Quickly, Lowell...  Quickly...

                                 LOWELL
                        I’m trying!  But it’s like finding   
                        a needle in a pile of things that 
                        look very similar to needles.  I 
                        can’t remember what they’re called 
                        right now.  But, this isn’t easy!

           Finally, Parcival summons his strength and FLAPS FORWARD 
           into Ratsputin.  The rat stumbles back into his brethren, 
           dislodging a shelf of crates, which COLLAPSES, burying them 
           under a dozen huge boxes, stenciled with “LOST WEIGHTS”. 

           Rats momentarily dispatched, Parcival digs his wing into 
           the keys, shuts his eyes, and... draws out the door key.  
                                 PARCIVAL
                        Never send a boy to do a bird’s 
                        job.  Now let’s go!

           Parcival quickly unlocks the door, hurries Lowell through, 
           just as the heap of crates begins to stir...

           EXT. BETWEEN TRAIN CARS

           Tall trees rushing past, Parcival relocks the door.  THUD!  
           It shudders as the rodents hurl their bodies against it.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        This won’t hold long.  Quickly, to 
                        the next car.  Hurry.

           The SUBWAY CAR.  Lowell stares dubiously.

                                 LOWELL
                        People pee in subways.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Go!  In there!  Now!

           Lowell slides the door open, and dashes through into --

           INT. SUBWAY CAR

           -- skidding to an immediate stop, eyes wide as saucers.  

           The place is packed with RATS, sitting, standing, reading 
           the newspaper, every last one looks in Lowell’s direction.

                                 LOWELL
                        I...

           A beat.  He slowly backs out.  As the commuters return to 
           their newspapers --

           EXT. BETWEEN CARS

           Parcival looks back to see Lowell EASING the subway door 
           closed, emphatically shaking his head.

                                 LOWELL
                        We don’t wanna go in there.

           THUD! THUD! THUD!  A hinge pops off the freight car door.  
                                 PARCIVAL
                        Well, we have to go somewhere!

           At once, they both look UP.  Lowell pales.

                                 LOWELL
                        No.  Not again.  You gotta be --

           EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY

                                 LOWELL
                            (cheeks flapping in the wind)
                        -- kid-did-did-did-ding me-e-e!!

           He clings to the top of the coursing locomotive, the 
           rushing winds buffeting him as he struggles to crawl. 
           Parcival, bent low against the breeze, urges him on.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Hurry, lad!  We must move faster!

                                 LOWELL
                        I’m moving as fast as I --

           With a CRASH, the freight car door busts open behind them, 
           Ratsputin and his cohorts climbing onto the roof, a 
           murderous gleam in their yellow eyes.

                                 LOWELL
                        Coming through!  Look out!

           He sprints past Parcival like the bird is standing still, 
           leaping the gap to the next car without a second thought.

           AS THE TRAIN chugs through the countryside, trees whizzing 
           past, white smoke puffing from its engine, Lowell and 
           Parcival run along the roof.  Leaping from car to car.  

                                 PARCIVAL
                        You remember the plan, right?

                                 LOWELL
                        Yeah, yeah, I remember.  We get to 
                        the engine, then...  A snack?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        That is not part of the plan.

           Suddenly, Snaggle-Tooth surges ahead of the other rats, 
           throwing caution to the wind.  As he leaps toward them -- 
                                 PARCIVAL
                        Lad!  Duck!

           Parcival pulls Lowell down as -- WHUMP! -- a low branch 
           whisks past, taking Snaggle-Tooth with it.  They look back 
           to see him doubled over it, dwindling behind the train.

                                 LOWELL
                        Was that part of the plan?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Yes.  I’m going to say yes.

           One Ear and Ratsputin, having ducked in time, stalk onward 
           again.  Snarling.  Lowell and Parcival scramble up and run.  

           EXT. ENGINE - DAY

           The pair slide down the ladder from the roof.     

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Lad?  Listen, quick.  You do 
                        remember the plan, don’t you?

                                 LOWELL
                        I’m not a moron, okay?  You don’t 
                        gotta remind me every two seconds.  

                                 PARCIVAL
                            (embarrassed)
                        No, I was hoping you’d remind me?

           They reach the coupler between the engine and other cars.   
           Lowell yanks the lever, and it uncouples, detaching them.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        That’s it?

                                 LOWELL
                        Hey, this was your plan, dude.

           As the cars gradually lose their steam, the engine begins 
           drifting away, creating a gap, but not nearly fast enough.   

           RATSPUTIN AND ONE-EAR scrabble toward edge of the roof...

                                 LOWELL
                        We’ve gotta tell the conductor to 
                        speed things up!

           They hurry to the controls -- startling a TINY MOUSE in an 
           engineer’s hat who -- EEEEEEEEEEEE! -- LEAPS OFF the train.
                                 LOWELL
                        Okay.  Plan “B”.

           He randomly pulls a lever.  The train lurches.  BRAKING!  
           As the gap starts to shrink, One-Ear readies to jump --

                                 LOWELL
                        Oops.  “C”?  “D”?  “E”?  “Q”?  “X”?

           LOWELL finally pulls the right lever, SPEEDING THEM UP! 

           -- One-Ear leaps, flailing out for a hand-hold, but...  He 
           misses, tumbling onto the tracks, swallowed under the train 
           as it drifts further away.  No one could jump that gap now.

                                 LOWELL
                        I did it, Parcival!  We lost th--

           No one except Ratsputin.  He easily clears it, landing on 
           the rear of the engine, growling menacingly.

                                 LOWELL
                        Oh come on!  This guy doesn’t quit!

           He lunges at Lowell -- but Parcival puts his body between 
           the boy and the rat -- they grapple.  The rat overpowers 
           him, RIPPING the HARPOON from his wounded wing.  He GASPS.   

           The rat pins Parcival down, jaws snapping closer, closer. 
           Lowell looks desperately for something, anything, a weapon 
           of some sort.  Then realizes, he still wears his backpack.  

                                 LOWELL
                        Hold on, Parcival, I got an idea!
                            (beat)
                        Wait, I lost it...  No, I got it!

           He shrugs off the straps and rushes toward them, unzipping 
           it right in the rat’s snout.

                                 LOWELL
                        Chew on this!

           His HOMEWORK PAPERS flutter out in a FLURRY OF WHITE.  The 
           rat clutches his face, HOWLS.

                                 RATSPUTIN
                        PAPER-CUTSSSSS!!!!

           He reels back, blinded, and -- THUMP-THUMP-THUMP-THUMP-
           THUMP-THUMP-THUMP-thump-thimp... Tumbles off the engine.
           Lowell stands, proud, watching him shrink behind them, the 
           papers fluttering away on the wind.  Then, he remembers --

                                 LOWELL
                        Wait, that was my...  Oh man!  
                        Stupid Lost Train of Thought!

           He goes to leap for the last page, but Parcival, holding 
           his wing to staunch the wound, stops him.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Let it go, Lowell.  Let it go.

           Lowell watches it, whisked higher on the wind, as the train 
           chugs away.  Exhausted.  Disappointed.  But, not surprised.

           INT. THE KEEP - DAY? / NIGHT? / TEA TIME?

           Ratsputin, snout covered with band-aids, cowers fearfully.

                                 RATSPUTIN
                        It wasssn’t our fault, my Keeper.  
                        When we caught up with the train, 
                        they had already disssembarked into 
                        the woodsss.  The bird and the boy--

                                 FINDER-KEEPER (O.S.)
                        Made you look like a fool?  I 
                        agree.  Now get your worthless tail 
                        out of my sight before I lop it off 
                        and beat you to death with it!  
                            (calls out)
                        Milton!

           As Ratsputin backs away, bowing, scraping, Milton appears.

                                 MILTON
                        They’ve escaped, Keeper?  Again?

                                 FINDER-KEEPER (O.S.)
                        Oh, wipe that smug look off your 
                        snout.  It’s of no concern.  I know 
                        where they’re going.  A little 
                        birdie told me.

           His nail points up, to where the Balding Elder huddles in a 
           HANGING BIRDCAGE, totally FEATHERLESS, shivering with fear.  

                                 FINDER-KEEPER (O.S.)
                        And we’ll have quite a surprised 
                        awaiting them, won’t we?
           As his reedy, hoarse CHUCKLE echoes from the shadows...

           EXT. THE LOST REFUGE - DAY

           An ancient REDWOOD FOREST, as old as time.  Parcival and 
           Lowell crunch their way across a thick cover of pine 
           needles.  Lowell cranes his neck back, staring up amazed.

                                 LOWELL
                        Wow.  It’s way nicer here than in 
                        the caves.  And there’s gonna be a 
                        pigeon that’ll actually be able to 
                        fly me home, right? 
                            (beat)
                        I mean, no offense.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Lad, there will be an entire fleet 
                        of my kin ready, willing and -- Ah!  

           His wing.  He prods the wound, still bleeding.  Seeing it, 
           a thought occurs to Lowell.  He digs inside his backpack.  

                                 LOWELL
                        Dad showed me this.  The time I 
                        lost his watch in the disposal.

           He pulls out the sock, using it to tie a BANDAGE around 
           Parcival's wound.  Sweet gesture, but it's no magic fix.

                                 LOWELL
                        That better?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Much better.  Thank you, Lowell.  

                                 LOWELL
                        You gotta get it taken care of, 
                        okay?  Once I’m on my way home?

           Parcival nods.  They walk in silence.  As “home” grows 
           closer, Lowell is feeling a little bit uneasy.  Unready.

                                 LOWELL
                        It’s weird, you know?  I mean, 
                        everything I’ve ever lost is here.  
                        Feels wrong to leave empty-handed.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Yet so you shall.

           Lowell nods, right-right, of course.  More silence again.  
                                 LOWELL
                        Mom and dad are never gonna believe 
                        this, huh?  Hey, you-- you think...
                            (feels exposed)
                        You think they even know I’m gone?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        There’s so much Lost Time here, our 
                        days could pass as mere minutes in 
                        your world.  It’s difficult to say.

                                 LOWELL
                        Probably wouldn’t care anyways.

           Parcival stops him.  Wing on his shoulder.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Lad, in all my time here, the one 
                        thing I have never seen lost is a 
                        parent’s love for their child.  Of 
                        course they would care.     
                            (pause)
                        Are you listening to me?

           He isn’t.  Lowell turns, sniffing.

                                 LOWELL
                        Do you smell something?  Smoke?

           A FEATHER floats down from above.  Burnt to a blackened 
           crisp.  Parcival’s eyes widen with alarm.

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

           FIRE.  IT LICKS UP TOWARD THE SKY.  A VILLAGE of nest-like 
           tree houses burns high in the trees.  Feathers fall like 
           snowflakes, black with soot, red with blood.  Chains and 
           nets litter the ground.  The remains of a terrible battle.

           The last refuge of the homing pigeons has been destroyed.  
           Not a bird remains.  Parcival stares at the sparks floating 
           into the sky.  Feathers fluttering down.

                                 LOWELL
                            (soft, scared)
                        Parcival?  What do we do now? 

           EXT. IN THE REDWOOD FOREST, ELSEWHERE - DAY

           Parcival hustles Lowell through the woods, trying to get as 
           far away as fast away as pigeonly possible.
                                 PARCIVAL
                        The others he’d captured at the 
                        caves.  He must’ve gotten it out of 
                        them.  Tortured them, I’ll wager, 
                        the fiend!  Now, he’s got them all, 
                        every last bloody bird.  Taken!

                                 LOWELL
                        But, if they can’t fly me?  And you 
                        can’t fly me?  How am I gonna--

                                 PARCIVAL
                            (snaps at him)
                        Is that all you ever think of?  
                        Yourself!?  

           Lowell turns away, hurt.  Parcival, softens.  Contrite.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        It’s not your fault, Lowell.  It’s 
                        not your fault.  I swore I’d get 
                        you home, and so I shall.  I just 
                        need some time to figure out how.

                                 LOWELL
                        You said, in the desert, there was 
                        “another way”?  You said it was--

                                 PARCIVAL
                            (instantly dismissive)
                        No.  That way is not open to us. 

                                 LOWELL
                        Why?  Maybe we can--

                                 PARCIVAL
                        We can’t.  We won’t.        

                                 LOWELL
                        But WHY?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Because its entrance lies in the 
                        very heart of the Finder-Keeper’s 
                        domain!  Inside his inmost keep!  
                        To even attempt it would be to 
                        deliver ourselves into his hands!

           Lowell looks up at him, worry in his eyes.

                                 LOWELL
                        Then...  What are we gonna do?
                                 PARCIVAL
                        I don’t know, lad.  I have to 
                        think.  A solution isn’t just going 
                        to fall out of the bleeding blue--

           SOMETHING COMES SCREAMING out of the treetops.  Whizzes 
           overhead and CRASH-LANDS in the brush twenty yards away.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        -- Heavens?

           Parcival and Lowell push aside some ferns to REVEAL...

           A CRUMPLED FIGURE lying where she landed, A FEMALE PIGEON.  
           An iron SHACKLE clasped around her thin leg, chain broken.    

           Parcival rises to rush to her, when --

                                 LOWELL
                        Wait, Parcival!  Listen...

           Through the trees, LAUGHTER.  The guttural gayety of RATS.

                                 RAT VOICE #1 (O.S.)
                        Oy, where’d she get to then?

                                 RAT VOICE #2 (O.S.)
                        Here, birdie-birdie-birdie...

           TWO PACK-RAT LIEUTENANTS amble out of the brush.  Armed. 

                                 RAT LIEUTENANT #1
                        Ah, there she is.  Where do you 
                        think you’re flappin’, luv?

           She tries to fly, flapping futilely.  It’s obvious she’s 
           wounded.  The bigger rat cocks his harpoon back to strike.

                                 RAT LIEUTENANT #2
                        Like swatting a big ugly...

           The harpoon is SUDDENLY SNATCHED from his paws.  He turns, 
           finding himself snout to beak with --

                                 RAT LIEUTENANT #2
                        ... fly?

           Parcival.  He SNAPS the harpoon in half.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        I think that can be arranged.

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:
           THE RAT LIEUTENANT, hurling through the air, until -- THUD! 
           He SMASHES into a TREE TRUNK.  Slides down in a furry heap.

                                 RAT LIEUTENANT #2
                        Here, birdie-birdie-birdeeeeee...

           Behind him, a second HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAK, as Parcival 
           swings the other around by the tail, letting him go --

           EEEEEEEEEEE!  SMACK into the other rat.  Scrambling up, the 
           rodents run.  Weaving, wobbling, fleeing for their lives.

                                 RAT LIEUTENANT #1
                        This isn’t over.  We’ll -- OW!

           A PINE CONE BOUNCES OFF his head.  Lowell wings some more.

                                 RAT LIEUTENANT #1
                        Fine, fine, it’s -- ow! -- it’s 
                        over.  It’s over.  Quit it!

                                 LOWELL
                        That’s right, you better run!

           As the rats bold into the trees, Lowell hurries back toward 
           where Parcival leans over the pigeon.

                                 LOWELL
                        Is it -- is it gonna be...?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        “Her” wing is broken, lad, but 
                        she’s going to be fine.  Can you 
                        hear me, miss?  You’re safe now.  I 
                        am Parcival.  And this is --  

           Before he can finish, the female pigeon, GERTRUDE, sits up.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        “Sir Parcival Featherbumm?”  The 
                        “Sir Parcival Featherbumm?”

           Lowell looks at Parcival.  Parcival looks at Lowell.  Beat.

                                 LOWELL
                            (Ha!)
                        “Feather-Bumm?”

           INT. A TREE’S HOLLOW - DUSK

           Parcival covers the opening with branches, camouflaging it.  
                                 PARCIVAL
                        That ought to keep us hidden until 
                        morning.  They likely won’t mount 
                        much of a search till then anyway.  
                        Rats do require their beauty sleep.

           In the flickering light of a small fire, Gertrude inhales a 
           wingful of seed, pecking like a woodpecker.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Easy, m’lady.  Peck what you can.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I swear, it’s like a dream.  First, 
                        I manage to escape from His keep.  
                        Then, I’m rescued by the brave, 
                        handsome, tall Sir Parcival!  

                                 PARCIVAL
                            (bashful)
                        Well, I don’t know how tall...

           But Lowell, sitting with his backpack, suddenly perks up.

                                 LOWELL
                        Wait, “His”?  “His Keep?”  You 
                        mean, you were just--?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Lad.  Gertrude needs quiet rest 
                        now.  Not questions.

                                 LOWELL
                        But, if she was there, she could 
                        tell us, or show us...

                                 PARCIVAL
                        No.  We cannot ask her to do that. 
                        Not in her condition.  Not on any 
                        condition.  And that’s fina--

           -- Gertude cuts him off with her wing.  

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I’ll do it.

                                 PARCIVAL & LOWELL
                        You’ll what?

           She shrugs, embarrassed.
                                 GERTRUDE
                        I don’t know.  But, you helped me, 
                        and I will help you.  Whatever it 
                        is.  I mean, how bad could it be?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           LATER, Gertrude sits slack-beaked with shock.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        You’re out of your flocking minds.
                        You want to go into His Keep?  Of 
                        your own volition?  It’s crazy.  
                        It’s insane.   
                            (a beat)
                        I’ll do it.

                                 PARCIVAL & LOWELL
                        You’ll what?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I’ll do it.  I found my way out, I 
                        can find my way back in again.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        No, this is my promise.  Not yours.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        We’re Homing Pigeons, aren’t we?  
                        We’re supposed to see that lost 
                        things are found.  And what could 
                        be more important than a lost boy?

           He stares at her, touched by her bravery.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Good.  It's settled.  We leave 
                        tonight.  How’s that sound, Lowell?
                            (no reply)
                        Lowell?

           He sits with his head buried in his hands.  Snores softly.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        I think he can wait til morning. 

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Oh, how I wish my wing weren’t 
                        broken.  I’d fly him home now.

                                 PARCIVAL
                            (shows his own lame wing)
                        Birds of a feather walk together?
           INT. HOLLOW - DAWN

           Lowell awakens with a start.  The fire is ash.  He’s alone.  
           He shakes his head, trying to clear out the cobwebs, when --

                                 MISSING LINK (O.S.)
                        Do you know you snore?  Like a wild 
                        beast.  It’s not cute.

           Lowell spins around to find -- The MISSING LINK lounging on 
           a root.  Waving “hi” with his tail.

                                 LOWELL
                        You!

                                 MISSING LINK
                        In the flesh.  And fur.

                                 LOWELL
                        What are you doing here?

                                 MISSING LINK
                        I see your manners haven’t 
                        improved.  I just happened to be in 
                        the neighbor-wood.  Thought I’d 
                        stop in and tell you how much I was 
                        enjoying your “present”.    

           He puts up his feet.  Still sporting Lowell’s lost GALOSH.

                                 LOWELL
                        Present?  You stole it!

                                 MISSING LINK
                        I say potato, you say...  well, you 
                        probably just point at it and 
                        grunt.  But, irrregardless...       

           He slips off the galosh.  Tosses it to Lowell.

                                 LOWELL
                        You’re giving it back to me?  Why?

                                 MISSING LINK
                        One, it’s not a gift, it’s a loan.  
                        And two, the way you’re going, 
                        you’re gonna need it.

                                 LOWELL
                        What do you mean, “the way I’m--”
           But, before he can finish, the monkey-man darts through the 
           opening.  Lowell pulls on his galosh, hurries after and --

           EXT. HOLLOW - DAY

           -- Runs right into Parcival and Gertrude, returning with 
           their wings loaded with berries and nuts.

                                 LOWELL
                        Where is he?  Where’d he go?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Where’d “who” go?

                                 LOWELL
                        The -- the half-man, half...
                            (pantomimes a monkey)
                        Whatever, he was right here!

           Parcival and Gertrude exchange confused looks.  No clue.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        We don’t have time for charades.  
                        Soon, these woods will be infested 
                        with rats.  Now, we’ve found 
                        breakfast.  Eat.  The way we’re 
                        going, you’ll need your strength.

           Lowell looks up from his galoshes, recalling those words.

                                 LOWELL
                        What way are we going?

           EXT. THE EDGE OF THE WOODS - DAY

           Here, the majestic redwoods of the deep forest give way to 
           stunted cypress and weeping willows.  The air is damp with 
           fog, and the ground is soggy, dotted with stagnant puddles.  

                                 GERTRUDE
                        The roads to His Keep will be 
                        heavily guarded.  Impossible to 
                        travel.  But, there is one way, a 
                        back way even the rats are 
                        reluctant to patrol.    

           Coming into view...  A forbidding MARSHLAND of shadowy 
           vegetation and waist-deep water, choked in sulfurous fog.      

                                 LOWELL
                        We’re going in that?
                                 PARCIVAL
                        The Neverglades.  For never has a 
                        soul ventured within, and returned 
                        with his mind intact.
                            (beat)
                        Until now, presumably.

                                 LOWELL
                        Very reassuring.

           EXT. THE NEVERGLADES - DAY

           A bloodcurdling WAIL sends SWAMP BATS winging into the sky.  

                                 GERTRUDE (O.S.)
                        Lowell!  Can you hear me?  Lowell!

           A second WAIL.  Even more spine-melting than the first.

                                 PARCIVAL (O.S.)
                        Where are you, lad?  We're coming!  

           Reeds part, Parcival and Gertrude wading through.  They 
           stop, looks of abject horror on their faces.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        By the Beacon, no...

                                 LOWELL (O.S.)
                        Look, look!  No wait, listen!

           REVEAL Lowell.  He holds a RUSTY BRASS PRETZEL up to his 
           lips -- BLOWS.  That HIDEOUS WAIL again.

                                 LOWELL
                        My French Horn!  I lost this!

                                 PARCIVAL
                        After how many lessons?

           Lowell stuffs it in his backpack, it’s overloaded with 
           things.  He digs inside and pulls out a SOGGY BASEBALL.

                                 LOWELL
                        And look!  My Willie Mays Minor 
                        League T-Ball.  And there's gotta 
                        be more, 'cause I lost like fifteen 
                        my first practice.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Fifteen?  That must be a record.
                                 LOWELL
                        Coach said I should try another 
                        sport.  Like tether ball.  Oh --

           He pulls something GREEN and PLASTIC out of his pocket. 

                                 LOWELL
                        And my Army Guy!  M.I.A. 4 years!

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Now listen, Lowell.  You mustn't 
                        splash off willy-nilly after 
                        everything you see.  It's --

                                 LOWELL
                        Oh look!  This swamp rules!

           He splashes off willy-nilly.  Parcival sighs, irritated. 

                                 GERTRUDE
                        If they’re his things, why should 
                        we begrudge him them?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        It’s the boy I swore to bring home, 
                        not his bloody things.  Besides, in 
                        this place, the more he finds, the 
                        more it feels like...

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Bait?

           Parcival nods.  In agreement, the two birds pursue him  
           through the FOG, abruptly coming beak to “bow” with --

                                 LOWELL
                        Look!  From my eighth birthday!

           A tattered, moldy BIRTHDAY PRESENT.  Lowell holds it up.

                                 LOWELL
                        That was the year my dad gave me 
                        some of his ledger books.  So I 
                        could learn to keep track of all my 
                        stuff.  So I wouldn’t lose all my 
                        birthday presents again, before I 
                        even got a chance to open one.
                            (he shakes it)
                        I think it’s more socks.
                                 GERTRUDE
                        Lowell.  Lowell, look at me a 
                        second.  We’re aren’t so sure these 
                        things are safe.  Are we, Parcival?

           She turns to see a circle of RIPPLES spreading across the 
           water.  He is GONE.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Parcival?  That’s weird, where’d h--

           TWO SLIMY SERPENTINE TENTACLES snake out from the reeds 
           behind them, SNAPPING around their bodies like reticulated 
           pythons.  They’re spirited through the swamp weeds to...

           A SWAMP MONSTER’S GAPING MAW

           It looks like a cross between a Venus Flytrap and a 
           flatworm.  Its mouth a nightmare of wriggly tongues.  

           Parcival is here.  Struggling with his own tentacle.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Next time, when I say don’t splash 
                        off willy-nilly, lad, don’t splash 
                        off willy-nilly!  

                                 LOWELL
                        Wh-what is that?!  What’s it want?!

           From the creature, a HIDEOUS HOWL blows back Lowell’s hair.

                                 SWAMP THING
                        BRRAAAAAAAAINS!!!!

                                 LOWELL
                            (beat)
                        Did it just say--?

           --One of its tongues squiggles at Lowell’s face.  A HOLLOW 
           SUCKER on the end.  It tries to squirm its way UP HIS NOSE. 

                                 LOWELL
                        Ahh!  It -- oh my god!  It’s trying 
                        to suck out my--

                                 SWAMP THING
                        --BRRAAAAAINS!!!!

           As Lowell struggles, Gertrude listens, realizes something.
                                 GERTRUDE
                        Lowell!  Parcival!  The sound it 
                        makes, doesn’t it sound just like--

                                 SWAMP THING
                        BRRR-AAAAAAAINS!!!

                                 PARCIVAL
                        -- Lowell’s horn!  Yes!  It does!

           And it does, actually.  A very poorly played French Horn.

                                 LOWELL
                        Okay.  I get it.  You don’t like my 
                        playing.  Is now really the best --

                                 GERTRUDE
                        No!  No, no, we want you to play!

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Play, lad!  Sooth the savage beast!

           Lowell brightens, getting it.  He fends off the tongues, 
           digs out his horn, and...  BLOWS.  Hearing it, the swamp 
           thing stops writhing, all its eyestalks turning to look.

                                 LOWELL
                        Am I soothing it yet?

           He BLOWS again, louder this time.  The monster BELLOWS in 
           agony, plugging its “ears” with a pair of its tentacles. 

           The swamp thing HAULS BACK -- FLINGING Lowell, Parcival and 
           Gertrude as far as it possibly can.  The trio cartwheels 
           through the air, landing in water with a MASSIVE SPLASH!

           After a moment, they burst out, spitting swamp water.  Mud 
           dribbles out of Lowell’s horn.  He blows to clear it.

                                 LOWELL
                        Everybody’s a critic.  Doesn’t 
                        sound that bad to me.

           Parcival and Gertrude exchange looks.

                                 LOWELL
                        You guys got any requests?

           But, Parcival, head cocked to the side, is listening to 
           something else.  He QUICKLY YANKS the horn out of Lowell’s 
           mouth.  Forcing him and Gertrude down flat into the mud.
                                 LOWELL
                        I said “requests”--

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Be quiet and be still!  Look...

           IN THE FOG AHEAD, A detachment of RATS appears, making its 
           way along a muddy road at the edge of the swamp.  One 
           pauses, beady little eyes squinting into the marshes.

                                 RAT GUARD
                        I swear, it sounded like a dying 
                        baboon or something?

           Lowell makes a sour face.  Parcival holds a wing to his 
           beak.  After a moment, the rats give up and march away.

                                 LOWELL
                        Like I said.  Everybody’s a critic.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        We made it, lad.  Minds intact, 
                        thanks to your “musical talents.”  
                        But...  let’s not press things.

           Standing at the edge of the road, Gertude waves them 
           onward, pointing to a weathered ROAD SIGN.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Come.  We’ll take this road in.

                                 LOWELL
                        The sign’s blank.  How do we even 
                        know this road leads to the Keep?  

                                 PARCIVAL
                        In this place, lad, all roads do.

           As they set out along the muddy pathway, we DISSOLVE TO:

           THE MASSIVE BLACK SPIRE

           towering over us, casting the world below in shadow.   
           Thick pipes coil around its perimeter.  Sewer pipes, 
           spiraling downward into...

           A SQUALID, CROWDED SLUM

           clustered around its base, a city of multistory lean-tos 
           and makeshift apartment complexes, spreading out into the 
           surrounding barren waste.  Every inch of it teeming, 
           crawling, POSITIVELY PACKED with PACK-RATS.  
           PULL BACK to REVEAL Lowell and Parcival, hunkered in a 
           ditch at the edge of the city, observing it from afar.

                                 LOWELL
                        Holey moley!  How are we gonna make 
                        it through?  The place is rat city.

           Gertrude plops down next to them, returning from topside.  
           She carries a BUNDLE of RAGS and an old canvas FIRE HOSE.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Well, you know what they say.  When 
                        in rat city, do as the rodents do.

           As Lowell and Parcival exchange confused looks, we CUT TO:

           THREE RAT TAILS

           dragging through the mud.  Actually, on closer inspection, 
           they’re lengths of a canvas hose.  Cut to look like tails.

           Trail up to REVEAL THREE FIGURES, two tall and one short, 
           swathed in rags and wearing hoods, making their way through 
           the crowded trash-strewn streets of rat city.  

                                 LOWELL
                        I don’t know how much longer I can 
                        hold my breath.  This place reeks.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        They’re rats, lad.  They’re not big 
                        on public sanitation.

           The buildings are a patchwork of wood, cardboard, plastic, 
           standing simply because they have no space to fall.  Even 
           the sky is crowded, crisscrossed with sagging clotheslines.         

                                 GERTRUDE
                        It’s just ahead.  In this alley.

           Gertrude leads, Parcival and Lowell follow, weaving through 
           a labyrinth of narrow, crowded passageways.  

           Lowell’s overloaded backpack causes him to lag behind.  He 
           struggles to keep up, but as Parcival and Gertrude round a 
           corner ahead, he has to stop for a breather.     

                                 LOWELL
                        Hey...  guys, wait up a...  whew.

           Hitching up his pack to press onward -- he suddenly catches 
           SOMETHING out of the corner of his eye, whirls around as -- 
           A PAW withdraws from his pack, swipes one of his BASEBALLS.

                                 LOWELL
                        Hey, that’s--

           He GRABS the pick-pocket, A BOY RAT, who HISSES:

                                 BOY RAT
                        -- Mine!

           Hugging the ball greedily as he wriggles free, scurrying 
           off.  Lowell watches him go, transfixed, until --

                                 PARCIVAL (O.S.)
                        -- Lowell?  Is something amiss?

           Parcival pokes his hooded beak around the corner.  Lowell 
           snaps out of it, hitching up his backpack.

                                 LOWELL
                        No.  It’s nothing.  I’m coming.

           EXT. SEWER TUNNEL - DAY

           A grated outlet at the end of an alley, nestled under the 
           shadow of the spire.  Gertrude pulls off an access grate. 

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Still unguarded?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        And still open.  They must’ve not 
                        discovered it yet.  Quick, inside.

                                 LOWELL
                        We’re going up there?  In that?

           He squints at the tangled sewer pipes, spiraling up around 
           the spire, disappearing into the clouds.

                                 LOWELL
                        There’s not a giant toiled at    
                        the top, is there? 

           EXT. DARK CORNER - DAY

           TWO RAT SENTRIES squat, engrossed in their game of marbles.  

                                 RAT SENTRY #1
                        Miss it...  Miss it...  Miss it!
           Rat Sentry #2 shoots.  Misses it.

                                 RAT SENTRY #2
                        Rats!

           The marble skitters away.  As they scurry after it -- A 
           GRATE POPS up and SLIDES open.  Gertrude’s head appears.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Quick.  It’s clear.

           Parcival climbs out after her.  Lowell's overloaded 
           backpack can barely squeeze through.  As he emerges...

                                 LOWELL
                        Holey...  Moley.

           He gets his first look at what they’ve climbed up into.  A 
           FINESPUN CITADEL in the sky, set atop the spire like a 
           tremendous GOTHIC BIRDHOUSE.  It overlooks the entirety of 
           The Land of Lost Things, towering even over the clouds.         

           Once, it was a magnificent place.  Now, its white marble 
           has been stained with paw prints.  Strewn with droppings.

                                 LOWELL
                        You guys should live someplace like 
                        this, instead of those caves.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Once upon a time, lad, we did.

           They steal quietly across the courtyard.  Utterly empty.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        I don't like it.  It's too easy.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        It's meant to be.

                                 LOWELL
                        What do you mean?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        The Keep isn't meant to keep things 
                        out.  It's meant to keep things in.

           She nods to the parapets above, where PIGEON SKULLS leer 
           down at them.  Speared atop barbarous spikes.
           INT. THE KEEP, HALL OF LOST TREASURES - DAY

           A great set of doors CREAKS OPEN.  Gertrude leads Lowell 
           and Parcival into the deserted corridor, their footfalls 
           deadened by a carpet stitched from lost socks. 

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Remember.  Don’t stray.  Don’t make 
                        a sound.  And don’t touch anything.

           Lining the walls, in alcoves lit by sourceless light, they 
           see a shark-skin MAP labeled “ATLANTIS”.  A chest of 
           Blackbeard’s DOUBLOONS.  Amelia Earhart’s PLANE, the 
           “Electra”.  The ARK of the COVENANT.  Venus De Milo’s ARMS.      

                                 LOWELL
                        What happened to that lady’s body?
                            (off Parcival’s glare)
                        Right.  No sounds.  Starting now.  

           They pass a STUFFED DODO BIRD, its empty eyes seeming to 
           follow them, and creep into... 

           THE INMOST CHAMBER

           Dripping with shadows.  A ceiling so tall it disappears 
           into darkness.  On one wall, we see an ornate ARCHWAY, 
           carved with pigeon pictograms.  It’s pitch black inside.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        This is it.  The entrance.  Now, 
                        lad, I haven’t yet told you what 
                        lies inside, but before we enter--
                            (looks)
                        Lad!  What are you doing?!

           He’s hurrying resolutely in the opposite direction, where 
           the Finder-Keeper’s throne of lost keys sits empty.  On its 
           armrest, old and moldy as ever, lies...  HIS MISSING BOOK.

                                 LOWELL
                        Look.  It’s here!  The book I lost.  
                        I know you said don’t touch, but my 
                        parents are gonna be P.O.’ed if I 
                        can’t bring something back.  This 
                        is the last thing, I swear.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Wait!  Lowell, you don’t know what 
                        you’re doing--
           But, he doesn’t listen.  He reaches up for the book.  The 
           birds run.  Lowell reaches.  Run.  Reach.  Run.  Reach...

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Lad!  Don’t!

           Lowell takes The Book, and as he does...  Nothing happens.  

                                 LOWELL
                        See?  I told you it was totally--

           Parcival YANKS Lowell back, as a HUGE IRON CAGE falls from 
           above, landing to encircle the THRONE with a massive CLANG!

                                 LOWELL
                        Safe?

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Run!

           From the shadows overhead, a deluge of CAGES RAINS DOWN all 
           around, spiderwebbing the marble floor with cracks.  

           Parcival grabs Lowell, and he and Gertrude race across the 
           chamber, bobbing and weaving and running.  A cage falls...  

           CAPTURING Gertrude.

                                 LOWELL
                        Gertrude!

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Go, lad!  I'll get her!  Go!

           Just then, the chamber shakes with the MARCH OF CLAWED 
           PAWS.  Rats surge from every opening, swarming at them.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Hold tight.  Don't lose your grip.

           Lowell grabs Parcival's neck.  Parcival leaps into the air.  
           He flaps his wounded wing for everything he's worth, but --  

           The rats form a RODENT-PYRAMID.  Pull them out of the air. 
           They CRASH-LAND back to earth beside the open sewer grate.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Go.  Be quick.  Through the arch!

           Parcival turns to confront the rat horde.

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Go.
           He swats rats with both wings.  

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Go!

           Lowell takes a last look, then sprints for the archway and 
           freedom.  Halfway in -- he's JERKED to a halt.   CLICK!  
           Something clamps around his waist.  It's a HARNESS.  A 
           KIDDIE LEASH attached to it WHIZZES -- REELS him back out.  

           The last thing he sees before he's overwhelmed by the rats 
           are feathers floating down from above.  Tinged with blood.

                                 LOWELL
                        Parcival!

           INT. INMOST CHAMBER, THE KEEP - NIGHT

           Rats strip Lowell of his backpack, wrest The Book from his 
           hands, and leave him heaped in a puddle of light.  Alone. 

                                 FINDER-KEEPER (O.S.)
                        You look lost, my boy...

           A FIGURE melts out of the shadows.  His long yellow 
           fingernails grip The Book in one hand, Lowell’s leash in 
           the other.  A tug, and he draws Lowell to his feet.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER (O.S.)
                        But, you’ve felt that way your 
                        entire life, haven’t you?
                            (relishing it)
                        Lowell Armstrong Leavitt?  The 
                        Lowell Armstrong Leavitt?

           He emerges.  The OLD MAN from the bookstore.

                                 LOWELL
                        You?  You’re The Finder-Keeper!

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        I’ve been called worse.  Right 
                        about now, you must be wondering, 
                        “Why?”  Why give you this book?  
                        Why bring you here?  It’s quite 
                        simple really.  I had to test you.   

                                 LOWELL
                        T-test me?  For w-what?

           The Old Man smiles.  Twists a nail in the lock of Lowell’s 
           leash.  The harness CLICKS OPEN and clatters to the floor.
                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        I’ve much to show you, Lowell.  But 
                        first, you’ve had quite an 
                        adventure, hmm?  Are you hungry?

           Lowell doesn’t answer.  Doesn’t even move. 

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Yes, you are.  But that’s good.  
                        Smart.  Give nothing away, my boy.

           He clicks his nails at the shadows.  Milton slinks out.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Ah, Milton.  We’ve decided to 
                        postpone the meal.  Move straight 
                        to the tour.  Apprise our other 
                        guests, please?

                                 LOWELL
                        Other guests?  You mean Gertrude? 
                        Parcival?  What’d you do to them?  

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Oh don’t worry, they’re perfectly 
                        well.  In fact, they’ll be joining 
                        us later.  For dinner.  But now...

           He starts to shuffle off.  Crooks a finger back at Lowell. 

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Trust me, my boy.  This, you will 
                        not want to miss.  

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The Old Man's long toenails scuff the stones as he strides.  
           Lowell follows him, fearful.

                                 LOWELL
                        M-mister?  Mister, uh... Finder?

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Please, my friends call me by my 
                        given name.  Waldemar.

                                 LOWELL
                        Can I ask where you’re taking me? 
                        Mister Wuh-- Waldah-- Waldahmu--

           At the top of the stairs, a TEAM OF RATS waits, hitched to 
           a train-like PULL-CART.  The Finder-Keeper helps Lowell in.
                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Hold all questions until the end of 
                        the tour.  Keep your fingers and 
                        toes inside the tram at all times.
                            (a thin smile)
                        And please, call me Walt.

           The rats hop to, pulling the cart through a door, into...

           PACK-RAT MISSION CONTROL.  Rodents in lab coats monitor a 
           fiber-optic map of the seven continents.  Computers hum.  

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        First stop, the Dispatch Room.  For 
                        every corner of the globe, every 
                        country and county, this is the 
                        nexus of all neglected things.  

           A LAB RAT scurries past the cart, jotting on a clipboard.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        If it’s larger than an eyelash, 
                        smaller than an ocean liner, we 
                        know the moment it’s misplaced.  
                        Rat retrievers can be dispatched in 
                        less than twelve-point-two seconds.

           The clipboard passes to a waiting rat, who straps on a 
           dented crash-helmet.  Artillery rats turn cranks as a   
           “RAT-A-PULT” cranes about to aim at a hole in the roof.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Target acquisition, a minute flat.  

           SPROING!  The rat dwindles into the stratosphere.

           INT. RETRIEVAL ROOM - NIGHT

           The cart emerges from another door, arriving amid a tangle 
           of sewer pipes, spewing water and waterlogged rats, 
           returning loaded with lost things.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Once the item has been acquired, it 
                        is brought here, to Retrieval, for 
                        classification.  And disinfection.      
                            (aside)
                        Rats aren’t the cleanest creatures.

                                 LOWELL
                        Why are you showing me all this?
                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        The suspense is delicious, isn’t 
                        it?  Don’t worry.  Almost there.

           INT. SORTING - NIGHT

           The tram-cart stops at the hub of a labyrinth of corridors, 
           lined with doors, branching off in every conceivable 
           direction.  The Old Man climbs out, Lowell following after.

           They pass rats with ledger books, directing others where to 
           haul their various lost payloads, keeping careful records.

                                 LOWELL
                        Like the ledgers I got at home?

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Slightly larger scale, I'd say.

           He nods to a door -- limitless shelves of ledgers inside.  
           They weave through the crowd of overloaded rats, the old 
           man cheerfully ruffling fur, nodding hello.  All smiles.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Now, this is my favorite.  Sorting.  
                        Here everything is catalogued, 
                        shelved, stored.  Everything with a 
                        place.  Everything in its place.  
                        It warms my heart just to think--  

           A passing RAT fumbles a sack, spilling pennies at their 
           feet.  The Old Man’s sunny disposition shifts on a dime.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Careful with my change, you plague-
                        ridden piece of vermin trash!

           He twists the rat’s ear painfully.  It scurries off after 
           the coins.  In an instant, The Old Man is all smiles again.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Good help, etcetera.  What can you 
                        do?  Come, come.  This way.

           But, he sees Lowell is not following.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Oh, don’t tell me you’ve lost your 
                        nerve?  Not when we’re this close?
                                 LOWELL
                        I’m not going one step further till 
                        you tell me what you want from me.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Want from you?  My dear, dear boy, 
                        I already have more from you than 
                        anyone could ever want.   

           A rat totters by, bent under Lowell's stuffed backpack.  It 
           approaches a huge vault door, which HISSES OPEN to REVEAL--

           INT. THE LOWELL A. LEAVITT COMMEMORATIVE VAULT - NIGHT

           Crammed to the ceiling, this room contains the lion's share 
           of everything Lowell's ever lost.  He gawks.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        A metric ton of mismatched socks.  
                        Enough Legos to build a bridge to 
                        the moon.  Enough mittens to keep 
                        you warm there.  Remote controls.  
                        In-line skates.  All here, Lowell.  
                        Every last thing you’ve ever lost.

           The rat dumps his backpack onto the world’s biggest pile.

                                 LOWELL
                        My backpacks!  Hey, and my shoes!

           Trees and trees of lost left shoes, not a right in sight.

                                 LOWELL
                        It's always the lefts.

           The Old Man nods sympathetically.

                                 LOWELL
                        Are those... Oh no way!

           PUDDING-CUPS stacked in a towering pyramid.  Lowell opens 
           one, licks the top.  Starts stuffing them in his pockets, 
           but -- he spots something.  An aisle of picture frames.  
           One LOPSIDED FRAME in particular.  He pulls it down.

                                 LOWELL
                        I made this.  I tried so hard not 
                        to lose it.  Even locked it in its 
                        own special box.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        What happened?
                                 LOWELL
                        Lost the box.

           A photo of him, Charles and Angela.  An exceedingly happy 
           family.  Lowell stares at the picture, lost in nostalgia.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                            (sing-song)
                        Lowell?  Oh, Lowell?   Lowell!

           The Old Man suddenly snatches the frame out of Lowell’s 
           hands, eyes aflame.  He reshelves it.  Composes himself.   

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Now, do I have your undivided 
                        attention?  You’re a very special 
                        boy, Lowell.  That’s quite lost on 
                        you, isn’t it?

                                 LOWELL
                        Most stuff is.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        In your ten short years, you've 
                        misplaced more than anybody.  Ever.  
                        Anywhere.  Almost as if you're...   

                                 LOWELL
                        Cursed.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Back there, perhaps.  But not here.
                        I had to bring you here, Lowell.   
                        I had to test you, because I had to 
                        make sure.  I had to be certain.

                                 LOWELL
                        Of what?

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Of you.  Now, you’re quite right, 
                        there is something I want from you.  
                        A teeny, tiny, insignificant favor.  
                        But, once that’s taken care of...

           He takes in the massive vault with a sweep of his nails.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        This can all be yours.  Everything 
                        you’ve ever lost is here.  And here 
                        it can never be lost again.  Isn’t 
                        that what you’ve always wanted?   
           Lowell steals a glance at the photograph of him and his 
           parents, knows exactly what he wants more than anything.  

                                 LOWELL
                        I...  I think I kinda just wanna go 
                        home.  I mean, if that’s okay?

           For a moment, the Old Man simply stares.  Then, a smile.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Of course.  I won’t say I’m not 
                        disappointed, but it’s your 
                        decision.  I’ll even tell you what.  
                        Curse my giving heart, but you may 
                        have one item, from the length and 
                        breadth of my realm, to take with 
                        you.  Only one.  Choose carefu--   

           He stops noticing Lowell’s eyes on The Book in his hand.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        -- You’re sure?  You want this?

                                 LOWELL
                        I promised I wouldn't lose it.  I 
                        swore.  And I never even got a 
                        chance to read it yet.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Neither have I, truth be told.  
                        You’ll have to tell me how it ends. 

           He hands Lowell The Book.  Claps his hands, finishing up.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        The rest of your things I shall 
                        have to keep for you, I suppose.  
                        And, of course, your parents too.  
                        What they've lost along the way.  
                            (all smiles)
                        Wonderful to have finally met you, 
                        Lowell.  Pleasure's been all mine.

           He turns, Lowell, remembering those words, grabs his robe.

                                 LOWELL
                        Wait.  What my Mom and Dad “lost 
                        along the way”?  What do you mean?

           The Man grins his ugly grin.  Crooks his crooked finger.  
           INT. TROPHY ROOM - NIGHT

           Trophy cases, cluttered with 'LOVING CUPS' -- two-handled 
           cups of crystal.  All shapes.  All sizes.  All shimmering.  

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        You know, Lowell, socks and books 
                        and books on socks -- they’re not 
                        the only things a person can lose. 

                                 LOWELL
                        Parcival told me.  You can lose 
                        hours, and balance, and... hair?

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        I don’t usually give hints.  But, 
                        “it” makes the world go round.

                                 LOWELL
                        Gravity?

           The Old Man reaches up onto a shelf, where a small gold 
           plaque reads:  “Charles and Angela Leavitt.”  He takes down 
           the CRYSTAL CUP.  Removes the lid.  Inside, a fine DUST.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        What do they say?  Tis better to 
                        have loved and lost, than never to 
                        have...  Oh, all I care for is the 
                        first part.  This is it, Lowell.  
                        This is what your parents lost 
                        along the way.  Their love.

                                 LOWELL
                        Love?  Like love-love?  Come on.

           But, he looks closer, unable to resist.  His breath, or a 
           breeze, stirs the surface of the dust, causing it to 
           sparkle and swirl in a rainbow of coruscating colors, and 
           for a moment, the briefest flash, he can see his parents.          

           A TINKLING BELL shocks Lowell out of his reverie, and the 
           vision vanishes.  Milton stands at the door.  Bell in paw.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Ah, Milton.  Is dinner ready 
                        already?  They say all you need is 
                        love, but every now and again, a 
                        good meal doesn’t hurt.

           He replaces the cup’s lid, returning it back to its shelf.
                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Come.  Can’t send you back home 
                        with an empty belly, now can we?

           Lowell blinks at him.  Unable to even speak, he just nods.

           INT. DINING ROOM, THE KEEP - NIGHT

           A table, cobbled from wood scraps, lit with candle nubs.  
           Lowell sits, the Book held like a life-preserver.

                                 LOWELL
                        You said Parcival and Gertrude, 
                        were gonna come, didn’t you?  And 
                        there's birdseed for them, right?  
                        I don't think they eat, uh...  
                        What're we having?  

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Oh, don't worry over them, Lowell.  
                        I'll bet they're already stuffed.

           Milton arrives with a team of rats, carrying a huge covered 
           SERVING DISH like a sedan chair.  It CLANGS onto the table.  

                                 LOWELL
                        I forgot how hungry I was.  Is it 
                        chicken?  Smells like chicken.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Oh, I assure you, it’s fowl.

                                 LOWELL
                        Pizza's the best.  Chicken's okay.    

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Ah, but have you ever tried squab?
                        No?  I could've sworn you were 
                        already well acquainted with it.
                            (motions to Milton)
                        Which reminds me.  Is this yours?

           A SOCK, slightly singed, is placed on his plate.  Written 
           on it in marker: “Lowell”.  As he picks it up...

           A FEATHER flutters out.  Lowell looks from it to the huge 
           serving dish, mind racing.  The Old Man ties on a napkin.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        There's nothing more enjoyable, I 
                        always say, then having a friend 
                        for dinner.  Unless, of course...
                                 (MORE)
                                 FINDER-KEEPER (CONT'D)
                            (pure evil)
                        It's having someone else's friend.

           INT. THE DUNGEON - NIGHT

           Cages hang, HOMING PIGEONS imprisoned within them.  At the 
           sound of an indescribable CRY OF SORROW, every head turns.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

                                 LOWELL
                        Parcival...  No, please Parcival...

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Why, my dear, dear boy.  You look 
                        as if you've lost your appetite.

           Lowell hugs the Book and the sock to his heaving chest.  
           Rats haul him from the table.  He struggles.  The last 
           thing he sees as he's hauled outside and the doors close...  

           ... The lid of the dish is lifted off in a puff of steam.  

                                 LOWELL
                        PARCIVAL!

           INT. THE DUNGEON - NIGHT

           Milton drags a sobbing Lowell by his leash underneath the 
           hanging birdcages of the pigeon prisoners.

                                 ORLANDO (O.S.)
                        Lowell Armstrong Leavitt?

                                 RINALDO (O.S.)
                        The Lowell Armstrong Leavitt?

                                 LOWELL
                        Orlando!  Rinaldo!  That you?

           The birds poke their beaks between the bars.

                                 ORLANDO
                        Why aren't you on your way home?

                                 LOWELL
                        Listen!  Please.  Have you seen 
                        Gertrude?  Where is she!

                                 RINALDO
                        Do we know a Gertrude?  
           Lowell's leash tugs, and he's pulled toward a dark tunnel.

                                 LOWELL
                        Wait, please, I don't wanna go!

                                 RINALDO
                        Don't give in, lad.  Don't give up.

                                 ORLANDO
                        Don't give them the satisfaction.

           INT. THE CELL OF LOST HOURS - NIGHT

           Milton shuts the door on Lowell, leaves him in DARKNESS. 

           CLICK.  A TV SCREEN glows on the wall.  Home Shopping.  
           CLICK.  Another on the ceiling.  Fast-food commercial.   
           CLICK, CLICK, CLICK.  They pop up on every surface, like 
           scintillating tiles.  He curls up in the flickering glow.

           INT. THE CELL OF LOST HOURS - NIGHT

           TVs blare snow.  Lowell jolts awake.  A SHADOW LOOMS over 
           him, hairy paws fumble at his galosh.  The Missing Link.

                                 LOWELL
                        Hey!  That's mine, let go!

                                 MISSING LINK
                        I told you, it was a loan.

           The Missing Link steals Lowell's left galosh, trailing its 
           prehensile tail out the cell door.  Lowell scrambles up --

                                 LOWELL
                        Wait.  Don't go.  I didn't mean it!

           SLAM.  The TVs FLIP back to their regularly scheduled 
           commercials.  Lowell loses it, FLINGS The Book.  Its 
           binding EXPLODES.  Pages flutter like snowflakes.  One page 
           plasters itself to a TV screen.  The TEXT GLOWS:

                                 LOWELL
                        “The Cell of Lost Hours?”

           And below, an ILLUSTRATION of the CELL that imprisons him.

                                 LOWELL
                        Holey moley...  That's here.
                        This whole place is in these!
           The mountain, desert, jungle.  Lowell settles down to read.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           The Finder-Keeper dabs his mouth with a napkin.  Milton 
           watches from the shadows, silent.  Finally:

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Don't you have somewhere to be?  
                        The plan?  That ring any bells?

           Milton bows, withdraws.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        I swear.  Sometimes, I'm at a loss.

           INT. THE CELL OF LOST HOURS - NIGHT

           The door CREAKS open.  The SHADOW OF A HEAD pokes inside.

                                 LOWELL
                        What, you come back for the other 
                        one?  Go ahead.  Take it!

           He FLINGS his galosh at the shadow -- THUMP! -- It SQUAWKS 
           in pain, rubbing its feathery head.

                                 LOWELL
                        Gertrude?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Ow.  Lowell?

           It IS her.  He leaps into her wings, overjoyed to see her.

                                 LOWELL
                        Gertrude!  I knew you’d find me, I 
                        knew you’d come!  Oh, Gertrude!

                                 GERTRUDE
                        What do these bird-brained rats 
                        expect?  No cage can contain me.

           Lowell slips past her, peeking excited out into the hall.

                                 LOWELL
                        So, where is he?  He’s waiting for 
                        us, right?  Where?

           She freezes.  Quiet.  She knows exactly who the boy means.
                                 LOWELL
                        Come on, Parcival!  He's kicking 
                        some rat-butt, right?  Or, or...

                                 GERTRUDE
                            (”No.”)
                        ... Lowell.

           He turns away, hiding his tears.  He pulls on his galosh. 

                                 LOWELL
                        This is my fault.  All my fault.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Lowell, listen to me.  You know 
                        Parcival would want you to be 
                        strong.  To carry on.  Not to ever 
                        give up.  Not ever, Lowell.

                                 LOWELL
                            (swallows, eyes raw)
                        Gertrude?  I wanna go home now.

           She eases the cell door open, ushering the boy outside.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I know you do, Lowell.  I know.  
                        And together, we’ll find a way.

           INT. KEEP, DUNGEON - NIGHT

           Gertrude sneaks, silent as a ... pigeon.  Lowell follows.  

                                 LOWELL
                        Gertrude?  What about the Orlando 
                        and Rinaldo?  The other pigeons?  
                        Can’t we try and break them ou--

           -- AWOOGAA!!  AWOOGAA!!  The ALARM KLAXONS start BLARING.  
           She yanks him into an doorway, as a phalanx of RATS GUARDS 
           RACE PAST, shouting excitedly.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I'll come back for them, Lowell.  
                        But first we've got to get you 
                        where you need to be.
                            (she peers out, it’s clear)
                        Alright.  Are you ready to go?

           She prepares to move, but he won’t budge.  Not yet.

           Lowell hurries through the aisles of everything he’s ever 
           lost, Gertrude following anxiously behind.  He grabs a 
           pudding cup off the pyramid.  Stuffs it into his pocket.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        That’s what you came back for?  
                        Lowell, pudding’s not worth--

                                 LOWELL
                        It’s just a snack, Gertrude.  He 
                        took everything from me.  And I’m 
                        gonna need my strength for what I’m 
                        taking back...

           INT. TROPHY ROOM - NIGHT

           Lowell’s parents' lost crystal loving cup sits sparkling in 
           sourceless light.  He reaches up for it, shaking nervously. 

                                 LOWELL
                        What if I drop it?  What if I-- I--

                                 GERTRUDE
                        We don’t have much time before they 
                        find us.  If you’re going to do it, 
                        you must take it now, Lowell.  Now!

           He lifts it off its pedestal, holds it like the Holy Grail.

                                 LOWELL
                        I took it.  I got it.
                            (beat)
                        It’s heavier than I--

           Oops.  The cup squeaks out of his hands.  Tumbles to the 
           floor and -- SHATTERS -- spilling out its sparkling dust.

                                 LOWELL
                        Oh crap, oh man, oh no no no no...  
                        I told you!  I told you I’d lose my 
                        grip!  You gotta help scrape it up!

           From the door, the MARCH OF CLAWED PAWS.  Gertrude spins.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        They've found us!  We have to go!
           Desperate to help, Gertrude yanks Lowell’s sock, Parcival’s 
           old bandage, out of the boy’s back pocket.  She scoops the 
           powder into it.  Lowell joins in.  Helping fill it, until --  

           The DOOR BURSTS OPEN.  RAT GUARDS FLOOD IN.  

           Gertrude yanks Lowell to his feet.  Hauls him out the back.

                                 LOWELL
                        No!  Wait!  I didn't get it all--!

           INT. INMOST CHAMBER - NIGHT

           The cages still lie where they fell.  Lowell and Gertrude 
           sprint their way through.  A swarm of rats on their heels.  
           The arch lies dead ahead.  As they run, Lowell pants out:  

                                 LOWELL
                        Gertrude?  Parcival, he never...   
                        I mean, I know this is the way 
                        home, but...  What’s down there? 

                                 GERTRUDE
                        The Labyrinth of Lost Ways.  
                        There’s no time to explain.  You 
                        have to trust me, can you do that?

                                 LOWELL
                        You're the only friend I got left.

           A look comes over Gertrude, she opens her beak to speak -- 
           but before she can, the massive arch swallows them into...

           TOTAL BLACKNESS

           In the dark, we hear the deafening sound of RUSHING WATER   
           -- labored BREATHING -- our heart POUNDS -- then LIGHT --  

           And we realize we’re inside the wildest stone WATER SLIDE 
           ever conceived.  The tunnel curves and drops like a   
           roller-coaster, a torrent of current rocketing Lowell down.  

                                 LOWELL
                        This is awesome!  Amazing!  Oh I’m 
                        really gonna throw up this time...

           The slide reaches a roaring crescendo, he shoots out the --

           END OF THE PIPE

           SPLASH!  Landing in a stone chamber filled with waist-deep 
           water and peasoup fog.  He struggles to stand, sopping wet.
                                 LOWELL
                        Hey, can I go again?  Gertrude?

           SPLASH!  She lands beside him.  Ruffling her feathers, 
           shaking off the water.  She grabs Lowell.  Hustles him on.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Come on!  They’re right behind!

           SPLASH!  SPLASH!  SPLASH!  Rodents spurting out rapid-fire.  

           INT. THE LABYRINTH OF LOST WAYS - NIGHT

           Lowell and Gertrude race through a doorway, arriving at the 
           end of a looong stone corridor.  Lowell stops.  Bewildered.

                                 LOWELL
                        This is the “lab-y-rinth”?  Doesn’t 
                        that mean maze?

           Countless corridors branch off to either side, but there’s 
           no discernible need to take any turns.  For straight ahead 
           lies their destination, a GOLDEN DOOR.

                                 LOWELL
                        Even I could find my way through 
                        this.  It’s the lamest maze ever.  

           As he looks, Gertrude pinches the bottom of his sock.  Her 
           touch leaves a TINY TEAR in the fabric.  He doesn't notice.  

                                 LOWELL
                        Well, what're we waiting for?  Come 
                        on, Gertrude, I know the way!

           SAND SIFTS from the sock as he hurries on, leaving a TRAIL.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I’ll follow your lead.

           LATER

           Lowell and Gertrude jog.  The door looks as far as before.

                                 LOWELL
                        Won't be long now, huh?

           LATER

           The door actually looks to be receding.  It’s further away.  
                                 LOWELL
                        You tired yet?  I'm not.

           LATER

           Door?  What door?

                                 LOWELL
                        Gertrude, what the heck?  We keep 
                        going, but we don’t get anywhere?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        You have to lead us through the 
                        labyrinth, Lowell.  It’s as simple 
                        as that.  You, and you alone, are 
                        the only one capable of doing it.  

                                 LOWELL
                        I'm doing it.  And it isn't doing 
                        any good.

           Steamed, he hauls back to throw the broken Book in some 
           direction, then stops.  Blinks at the pages.  

                                 LOWELL
                        Woah, wait a sec.  It's all in 
                        here.  I forgot to tell you.  This 
                        whole place.  And pictures!  This 
                        maze has gotta be in here too.

           He fans the pages, finding the right one, starts to read 
           when -- WHOOSH! --  A GUST OF WIND rips it out of his 
           hands.  It flits off into a side corridor.

                                 LOWELL
                        Hey!  Come back!  That’s not fair!

           Lowell pursues it through a series of random turns.  Left.  
           Right.  Right.  Right.  Losing the other pages as he goes.

                                 LOWELL
                        There isn’t even any wind in here!

           INT. MAIN CORRIDOR - VARIOUS

           The paper and Lowell sprint across.  Gertrude jogs behind.

           Then, the paper, the boy, and the pigeon reappear from a 
           different corridor, further down.  They race across, 
           emerging from and entering various corridors.  First near, 
           then far, then the left side, then the right.  Until the 
           trail of sparkling sand crisscrosses the whole labyrinth.
           INT. MAIN CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Lowell makes a flying leap, and snatches the fleeing page.

                                 LOWELL
                        Gotcha!

           As Gertrude catches up, he begins to read:

                                 LOWELL
                        The... Lab-y-rinth of Lost Ways.  
                        Not a ordinary lab-y-rinth, blah 
                        blah.  But, “a backwards maze.”
                        Backwards maze, what's that mean?   

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Um.  Lowell?

                                 LOWELL
                        Wait, listen.  The only way to find 
                        your way through it, is to...

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Lowell.

                                 LOWELL
                        I'm reading.  Is to tho-rough-ly...

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Lowell, look up.

           He does.  The GIANT GOLDEN DOOR hangs inches from his face. 

                                 LOWELL
                        “Is to thoroughly lose your way.”
                            (pause)
                        I did that?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        You did it, Lowell.  I've never 
                        seen anyone lose his way as 
                        thoroughly as you.

           She touches the great golden door and it creaks wide open.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Does your book say anything else?

                                 LOWELL
                        Uhm.  Yeah, here.  Beware of the...
                        Og-re?  Og-re of Lost Appetites?
                                 (MORE)
                                 LOWELL (CONT'D)
                            (looks up)
                        What's a Og-re?

           ROOOAAAARRRRGH!  

           A HUGE OGRE lumbers out of the shadows -- MAW GAPING WIDE.  

           Lowell stands frozen.  Gertrude yanks him to safety as the 
           monster chugs past them like a famished freight train.  
           They hide behind one of the pillars that flanks the portal. 

                                 LOWELL
                        Let me guess!  That's a Og-re?!

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Ogre.  You know how sometimes when 
                        you're hungry, something disgusting 
                        can make you lose your appetite?

                                 LOWELL
                        Like that thing's breath!  So?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        So take one guess where it goes.

           The OGRE OF LOST APPETITES peeks around the pillar.  
           ROOARGH!  Gertrude pulls Lowell back as its MAW SNAPS DOWN, 
           BITING off his poncho.  Swallowing it with a SLURP.   

                                 LOWELL
                        It just ate Gortex!

           It chases after them as they flee from pillar to pillar.   

                                 LOWELL
                        This is -- just -- helping him -- 
                        work up even more of a appetite!

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Don't worry.  You're small.  He'll 
                        probably save you for dessert.

                                 LOWELL
                        That's it!  Dessert!  I got a plan!

           As the Ogre lumbers closer, snorting like a mad bull, he 
           digs into his pocket, proudly pulls out the PUDDING-CUP.    

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Pudding?  Pudding's your plan?!

                                 LOWELL
                        Look at all the teeth he's got.  
                        One of them's gotta be a sweet one.
           Lowell turns to face the Ogre.  Peels the lid.  The beast 
           instantly stops, sniffing the sweet aroma, saliva pouring.

                                 LOWELL
                        Hey you!  You want this?  Go fetch!

           He heaves the cup.  The Ogre backpedals.  Stumbles backward 
           through the doorway and -- ROOOAAAAAAAAARRrrrrrrrrrrghhh... 

           Its howl peters out, as if it just plummeted into an abyss. 
           Lowell and Gertrude wait and listen.  It never hits bottom.

           INT. CHAMBER OF THE BOTTOMLESS PIT - NIGHT

           Beyond the golden door, Lowell and Gertrude discover a deep 
           chasm.  It seems to go down, down, down forever.  And ever.

                                 LOWELL
                        This is the way home?  This?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        No.  This is the one place where 
                        something might truly be lost 
                        forever.  That is the way home.  
                        Over “The Bridge of Lost Balance.”

           A STONE BRIDGE stretches out from the cliff into the void.  
           No railings, no visible means of support, three feet wide.

                                 LOWELL
                        Holey moley.

           His words echo.  They turn into something that sounds 
           ominously like: 'Lowell'...  'Lowell'...  'Lowell'...

           Lowell squeezes the sock.  It feels strangely light.

           Puzzled, he stretches it open, seeing the last grain of 
           sparkling sand about to sift through a hole in the toe.

                                 LOWELL
                        Oh no...  Gertrude!  Look!

           He sees the trail leading out the door.  Scrambles on all 
           fours.  Desperate to scrape it back up.  

                                 LOWELL
                        Why're you just standing there?  
                        Mom and Dad’s dust probably spilled 
                        out over the whole lab-y-rinth!
                                 FINDER-KEEPER (O.S.)
                        Merely the way through it, my boy.

           The Finder-Keeper stands in the golden doorway, looming 
           over him, flanked by Ratsputin, One-Ear, Snaggle-Tooth.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        The better to follow your lead.

           Lowell scurries back -- OOMPH! -- right into Gertrude.

                                 LOWELL
                        Gertrude, go!  You’ve gotta fly!

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I can't, Lowell.  I never could.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Can't even give you his apologies.  
                        For sadly those aren’t his to give. 

                                 LOWELL
                        “He”?  Why do you keep calling her 
                        “he”?  Gertrude's not a “he”!

           CLICK!  A HARNESS SNAPS around his body.  He looks back, 
           shocked to see that Gertrude holds the end of his leash.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        I think you'll find Gertrude’s not 
                        a lot of things you took for 
                        granted.

           Gertrude’s feathered shoulders writhe as something BULGES 
           out of them.  Her skin sloughs off like a suit of clothes.     
           SHE'S MILTON THE RAT.  Gertrude has been Milton all along.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        What’s a pigeon after all, Milton? 

                                 MILTON
                            (ashamed)
                        A rat with wings.

           Lowell looks at the rat, utterly betrayed.  He understands.

                                 LOWELL
                        You were using me?  And you're 
                        never gonna let me go, are you?
                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        My dear, dear boy.  If I let you 
                        go, I'd have to let everything else 
                        go too.  That's for the birds. 

           The Old Man points a nail.  The rats overwhelm the boy. 

           INT. CHAMBER OF THE BOTTOMLESS PIT - NIGHT

           Lowell sits hugging himself, nursing his scratches.  The 
           Finder-Keeper holds his leash, and runs a HAND-VAC.  
           Vacuums up Lowell's parents' lost love dust.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        You know, there was a time I was a 
                        lot like you.  I lost everything.  
                        Lost my way here.  But then I made 
                        a promise to myself.  I swore I’d 
                        never lose anything.  Ever again.
                        So, you can imagine, it was quite 
                        vexing to learn the only way to 
                        claim my prize was to do just that.  
                            (calls out)
                        Move your tails, you twits, I don’t 
                        have all day!

           Out on the Bridge of Lost Balance, Ratsputin and his two 
           cohorts nervously traverse the pit.   A few awkward shoves, 
           the three rats move out of eyeshot. 

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Unfortunately, I'd forgotten how.  
                        That’s why I needed you.  A boy I 
                        could trick into leading me through 
                        that blasted backwards labyrinth.

           He sucks up the last of Lowell's parents' dust, and pulls 
           the crystal loving cup from the folds of his robes.  It's 
           been glued back in one piece.  He empties the Vac into it.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        A loser.  It’s nothing personal.

           Milton sighs.  The Old Man looks at Milton.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        You have something to contribute?  

                                 MILTON
                        No, Keeper.
                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Then, keep your sighs to yourself.
                            (calls out to the void)
                        If you three are lollygagging out 
                        there, so help me, I’ll --

           Suddenly, a SQUEAK ECHOES.  Then... Silence.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Chucky?  Jerry?  Mickey?

           No reply.  Finally, The Finder-Keeper turns toward Milton.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        You.  Shimmy your tail across that 
                        bridge and bring back what's mine!

           A beat.  Milton turns tail and BOLTS out the golden door.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Come back here!  Oh, you craven, 
                        cowardly -- I should've got you a 
                        chicken costume instead!  Blast!

           He's alone.  Desperate.  And he isn't about to go himself.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                            (sing-song)
                        Oh, Looow-well?

           As Lowell looks up, fear in his eyes, we...  SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. THE BRIDGE OF LOST BALANCE - LATER

           Lowell inches slowly out onto the bridge.  Behind him, the 
           Old Man lets out the leash, WHIRRING as it un-spools.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Now, I’m going to give you some 
                        slack, but I want every bit of it 
                        back.  When it’s safe, tug the 
                        leash.  Do that and I’ll -- Give 
                        you some hard candy.  Off you go.  

           Lowell strides further out over the pit, until the cliff 
           vanishes behind.  Bridge growing thinner with every step.

                                 LOWELL
                        Stupid bridge.  Stupid pit.  
                        Stupid...  Gravity.  Stupid Lowell.

           It goes thinner.  Thinner.  Tight-rope thick.
                                 LOWELL
                        Stupid.  Stupid.  Stupid.  Stupid.

           From the shadows ahead, he sees Ratsputin clinging to the 
           bridge by his claws.  Snaggle-Tooth clings to his legs, and 
           One-Ear’s clings to his.  As Lowell inches closer, they 
           lose their grips, tumbling into the abyss below.  
           EEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeiiii...

                                 LOWELL
                        Okay, new rule.  No looking down.  
                        Who needs to look down?  I don't.

           As the bridge shrinks, something keeps throwing off his 
           equilibrium.  He teeters.  Takes a step.  Teeters.  SLIPS --

                                 LOWELL
                        Aw nuts!

           LANDS HUGGING the bridge.  He tries to get back up, but... 

                                 LOWELL
                        Okay.  It’s...  NOT OKAY!

           He SLIPS AGAIN.  Looks at his feet.  One bare.  One galosh.

                                 LOWELL
                        I think I see what the problem is.    

           With a tinge of regret, Lowell kicks off the galosh.  It 
           drops out of sight.  Now, he stands -- balance improved.

                                 LOWELL
                        Hey, that’s better.  Maybe if I...

           He digs his Jr. Explorer's compass out of his pocket.  
           Tosses it.  Takes a step.  Drops his pencil.  Another step.  
           A Tee-Ball ball.  An army-man.  Birdseed.  Bye-bye.  As he 
           sheds everything he can, every step becomes easier.  

                                 LOWELL
                        It’s working.  It’s working!  I may 
                        be buck-naked by the time I make 
                        it, but...  it’s really working!

           But sooner than he realizes, he runs out of bridge, and 
           steps safely onto...  

           THE PIGEON PANTHEON

           A spectacular facade carved into the sheer rock wall.  
           Enormous statues of pigeon heroes, their stone eyes stern, 
           but compassionate.  At the far end of the platform -- 
           An ARCHWAY carved to resemble a PIGEON'S GAPING BEAK.

           It’s forboding.  Frightening.  Yet he is drawn to it.  He 
           strides closer.  At its threshold, he takes one last look 
           up at the pigeon statues, standing silent vigil, and...

                                 LOWELL
                        Guess I got nothing left to lose.

           He steps inside...

           INT. SANCTUM - NIGHT

           Lowell finds himself in a clean well-lit room with a dome 
           ceiling.  Steps lead toward a pedestal of polished marble.

           There, in this most hallowed of places, rests a nest.  And 
           nestled in the nest, big as a melon...  An EGG.

                                 MISSING LINK (O.S.)
                        Eggceptionally big for an egg, hmm?

           Lowell looks up, startled to find the half-man, half-ape.

                                 LOWELL
                        You?  What are you doing here?  You 
                        stole my galosh!  Twice!

                                 MISSING LINK
                        No, you lost your galosh.  Twice.

           It wiggles a foot around the pedestal, models the galosh. 

                                 LOWELL
                        Give it back, that's mi--!

           Lowell was about to say 'mine'.  But something makes him 
           stop mid-word.  He looks at his feet -- both galosh-less.

                                 LOWELL
                        You know what?  Keep it.  I already 
                        lost the other one anyway.

           The Missing Link's Cheshire grin softens.  His voice warm. 

                                 MISSING LINK
                        No, Lowell.  I saw what you did.  
                        You didn't lose it.  You let it go.  
                            (nods toward the egg)
                        Do you know what this is?  

           Lowell shakes his head, uncertain.  Link waves him closer.
                                 MISSING LINK
                        Come.  Come.  Don’t be afraid.

           Lowell tries to move toward it, but his leash keeps him at 
           a distance.  The Missing Link simply snaps his fingers, and 
           the lock CLICKS OPEN, the harness clattering to the floor.

                                 MISSING LINK
                        Now, tell me.  What do you see?

           Lowell approaches, seeing SHADOWS FLICKERING inside its 
           translucent shell.  At first, a silhouette, but then --

           IT BECOMES REAL.  A HOMING PIGEON soars majestically amid 
           puffy white clouds.  In its talons, a PINK ROLLER-SKATE.

                                 LOWELL (V.O.)
                        I see... A pigeon?  It’s carrying 
                        something?  Where?

           EXT. A SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY (IN THE VISION)

           A 9 YEAR-OLD GIRL stumbles teary-eyed down the steps, a 
           pink roller-skate on one foot, a pink sock on the other.   

           A WHOOSH OF AIR stirs her pigtails --  A SHADOW flashes 
           overhead --  the PINK ROLLER-SKATE tumbles off the roof and 
           lands on the lawn in front of her.  Her face lights up.

                                 GIRL
                        Mommy!  Daddy!  Look, I found it!

           As Lowell and the Missing Link watch, a brief series of 
           vignettes plays out in the egg-shell -- sullen kids made 
           grateful by the unexpected return of treasured possessions.   
           A yo-yo.  A border collie missing his tags.  A retainer. 

                                 LOWELL
                        This is “It”, isn't it?  What 
                        Parcival told me about.  How the 
                        pigeons know where all the lost 
                        stuff's supposed to go?
                            (realizes)
                        This is what the Finder-Keeper 
                        wants?  The...  Homing Beacon?   

                                 MISSING LINK 
                        He wants the world.  And should  
                        this fall into his hands, he will 
                        have it.  All will be lost.  
                        Nothing will ever be found again.  
                        Finders keepers.  Losers weepers.
           Now the surface of the eggshell blossoms with tiny 
           fissures.  The visions inside turn sinister, frightening.  
           The roller-skate, the retainer, the border collie --             
           -- YELLOW FINGERNAILS snatch them all away.  Children cry.

                                 MISSING LINK
                        Everyday.  Everywhere.  Everyone 
                        loses things.  They slip between 
                        our fingers.  Fly away on the wind.  
                        But there has always been the hope 
                        that these things might be found.  
                        Now that hope lies in your hands.

           The Missing Link hands the nest, egg inside, to Lowell.

                                 LOWELL
                        What am I supposed to do with it?

           He looks up...  But the Missing Link’s gone.

                                 LOWELL
                        Hey!  What am I supposed to do?

                                 FINDER-KEEPER (O.S.)
                        You’ll do as you're told, my boy.

           The old man stands in the doorway, looping up the slack in 
           the unattached leash.  He bares his yellow crooked smile.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        You’ll do as you're told, and all 
                        you've ever dreamed comes true.  
                        Give me my prize and I promise it.

                                 LOWELL
                        But...  You wanna destroy it.  You 
                        wanna make it so nothing will ever 
                        be found again.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Oh who told you that rubbish?  That 
                        filthy man-ape?  Give it here!  

           Lowell shields the egg, backing away from him.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Oh fine.  Drive a hard bargain.

           He produces the CRYSTAL LOVING CUP from a fold of his robe.
                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Forget about that silly old beacon.  
                        This is what really makes your 
                        world go round.    

                                 LOWELL
                            (wavering)
                        But...  How do I know you’re gonna 
                        let me keep it?  How do I know 
                        you’re even gonna let me go home?

           The Old Man sighs, annoyed.  Motions toward the Beacon.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        My boy, you already have the power 
                        to go home in your hands.  Merely 
                        think of it, and you shall find it.

           Confused, Lowell looks down at the egg.  He concentrates -- 
           it seems to GLOW -- and when he looks up...

           He SEES Angela and Charles, standing five feet away from 
           him.  A PORTAL, bordered by scintillating light, has formed 
           on the wall.  He can see RIGHT INTO his KITCHEN at home.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        There now.  We have a deal.  Take 
                        the blasted dust!  Take it and go!

           He thrusts the cup into Lowell's hands.  Seizes the egg.  

           Lowell stares at the cup.  Gently removes the lid.  The 
           sand inside sparkles like only love can.  No doubting it.  
           But for some reason, he can't keep his eyes off the egg.

                                 LOWELL
                        But, what're you gonna do with it?

           But The Old Man’s too busy admiring his prize to answer.  
           Cackling maniacally, he hobbles out the chamber archway.

           Lowell watches him go, then turns back to the shimmering 
           portal.  To his parents.  He’s so close.  He could go back.  
           He could fix everything.  Yet for some reason, he can’t.

           EXT. BOTTOMLESS PIT - NIGHT

           Lowell emerges from the sanctum to find The Finder-Keeper 
           poised at the edge of the precipice, the leash dropped in a 
           coil beside him.  The egg held over the bottomless abyss.
                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Somehow, I had assumed omnipotence 
                        would be harder to attain?
                            (he shrugs)
                        Ah well.  Beacon, be gone.

           Lowell looks from the cup.  To the beacon.  And chooses.  

                                 LOWELL
                        No!

           He SWINGS the crystal cup like a blunt instrument, right 
           into the Old Man's back.  The egg FALLS from his fingers.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        What the devil do you think you're 
                        doing?  My boy, we had a deal!

                                 LOWELL
                        I’m not your boy.  And I never gave 
                        you my promise.  That's something 
                        you can't take!

           They grapple, high above the bottomless pit.  Razor-sharp 
           nails rake Lowell's cheeks.  He swings his cup.  THUMP!

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                            (spits)
                        Ack!  Was that a tooth?

           WHAM!  That was.  The old man stumbles over the leash 
           coiled at his feet, and falls toward the edge.  At the last 
           second, he grabs out --

           -- SEIZES the other handle of Lowell's crystal cup.  He 
           pulls Lowell toward the edge.  Lowell digs in his heels.  

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        You won't let go of that!  You 
                        can't.  And I never let go.  Ever!

           The boy's weight, and the cup between them, are the only 
           things keeping the old man from an endless bottomless fall.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        I go, and your parents' love goes 
                        with me!  What do you say to that?

           Lowell struggles to keep from falling, every muscle 
           bulging.  He sees the Homing Beacon teetering on the brink, 
           about to fall.  He must make a decision.  An impossible 
           choice.  He looks the Old Man in his malignant face.
                                 LOWELL
                        Somebody once told me, sometimes 
                        you just gotta let go.  

           And he does.  

           The Finder-Keeper falls backward, scrawny arms pinwheeling.  
           He makes a last desperate grab at Lowell's ankle... 

           Then tumbles into the abyss, SHRIEKING.  

           He never lets go of the cup.

           Lowell dives for the beacon, saves it just before it falls. 

                                 LOWELL
                        Gotcha!

           He carefully cradles it.  Makes a nest out of his sweater.

                                 LOWELL
                        Now, no one’s ever gonna have to 
                        think they're cursed, like...

           He hears a strange noise, turns.

                                 LOWELL
                        ... me.

           The LEASH.  Its coil quickly uncoiling OVER THE EDGE.  
           Lowell has just enough time to trace it back to where the 
           Finder-Keeper looped it around his ankle before it YANKS 
           him off his feet...  Over the brink...  And into...

           THE BOTTOMLESS PIT

           Lowell falls in space, cheeks flapping in the wind.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        Ha-ha!  I told you I never let go!

           The old man falls below him, the leash clutched in his 
           withered hand.  His other hand squeezes the crystal cup so 
           tightly that it SHATTERS -- love dust explodes everywhere.  
           He reels in the leash, pulling Lowell toward his clutches.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        If I’m going to lose...
                            (closer)
                        Then first, you lose...
                            (closer)
                        Your pathetic little life!
           At the last second --

                                 A VOICE FROM ABOVE (O.S.)
                        Lowell!

           WINGS.  From above -- the SILHOUETTE of a SOARING PIGEON.

                                 LOWELL
                        Parcival?

           It IS HIM!  And not just him, but Rinaldo!  And Orlando!

                                 PARCIVAL
                        I have you, lad!  Hold tight to me!

           Parcival snatches Lowell in his clawed feet.

                                 LOWELL
                        But -- how -- how is it possible?

           Then, he notices a FIGURE carried between Orlando and 
           Rinaldo.  A fat, furry rat.  It’s... Milton?

                                 LOWELL
                        You!  What are you doing here!?

                                 MILTON
                        What I should’ve done long ago.

           Orlando and Rinaldo hover lower, allowing Milton to grab 
           the leash in his teeth.  He chews furiously.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        What're you -- Milton, stop that!

           The leash frays.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        After all I've given you!?

           It breaks.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        No!  I can't lose!  I won't lose!

           With a beat of their wings, the pigeons lift Lowell and 
           Milton.  The Finder-Keeper falls.  Far, far, far below.

                                 FINDER-KEEPER
                        I never looooooooooooooooooooose!
           INT. CHAMBER OF THE BOTTOMLESS PIT - NIGHT

           Lowell’s feet touch solid ground.  The birds and the rat 
           alight beside.  He throws himself into Parcival’s wings.

                                 LOWELL
                        How-- I -- I thought you were...

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Eaten?  It was all for show.  So 
                        that he could trick you into doing 
                        what he needed.  I was imprisoned.  
                        And just moments ago, freed.

           Lowell looks to Milton, who stares at his paws bashfully.

                                 MILTON
                        “He” would rather have his cake 
                        than eat it.  Besides, he’s vegan.
                        A couple pounds was the only thing 
                        he ever actually wanted to lose.
                            (looks up, eyes moist)
                        Can you ever forgive me, Lowel--

           Lowell cuts the rat off by leaping into his arms.  After a 
           moment of surprise, Milton happily hugs him back.

                                 RINALDO
                        We hate to interrupt, lad, but...

                                 ORLANDO
                        ... There’s still another matter.

           INT. KEEP, INMOST CHAMBER

           Assembled on one side, HUNDREDS OF FRESHLY FREED PIGEONS 
           square off with an ARMY OF RATS mustered on the other.  The 
           place is about three seconds away from an all-out war. 

                                 GRIZZLED ELDER
                        Give ‘em the beak!  The beak, I 
                        say!  Only good rat’s a dead rat!

                                 EQUALLY GRIZZLED RAT
                        What’re you, chickens?  Come on!

           The situation is about to explode, when --

                                 LOWELL (O.S.)
                        Enough!  That’s enough!  Stop it!
           Lowell emerges from the archway, followed by his friends.

                                 LOWELL
                        There’s not gonna be anymore 
                        fighting.  Or name calling.  Or 
                        anything.  Starting now, you guys 
                        are calling a truce.

                                 EGGHEAD ELDER
                        But that’s just not feasible.  Not 
                        as long as they want what we want 
                        to return!

                                 BRAINY RAT
                        He’s right.  It’s inconceivable!  

                                 LOWELL
                            (confident)
                        I’ve got a plan.  

           EXT. THE RAINFOREST - DAWN

           The sun bathes the edge of the jungle in a soft pink hue.  
           For a moment, all is serenity, and silence.  Then...

           A RAT tramps through the foliage marching toward us.  And 
           ANOTHER behind him.  And behind him, THOUSANDS MORE.  The 
           first rat carries SOMETHING INSIDIOUS and GLEAMING in its 
           paws, it's a...  a...  A FRENCH HORN?

           Carrying it, he heads into the caves.  The others follow 
           the first rat's lead.  Each carries SOMETHING (a ball, a 
           shoe, an armoire) back down below.  And the NAME that was 
           on each item has been crossed-out:  “Lowell A. Leavitt”.

           EXT. TOWER WINDOW, THE KEEP - DAWN

           Lowell looks out over a long line of rats stretching from 
           the courtyard beneath him, carrying away his lost things.

                                 ORLANDO
                        You're certain this is a good idea?  
                        Divvying your things among rodents? 

                                 LOWELL
                        It's just stuff, Lando.  Junk.  
                        Besides, nobody’s ever given them 
                        anything before.  Maybe now they 
                        wouldn’t need to take so much.
           INSIDE THE RETRIEVAL ROOM, it’s chaos.  A line of pigeons, 
           loaded with lost things, wait for their turn to take off.  
           Everything that the Finder-Keeper kept is being returned.

           Lowell crosses the room, looking at all the good he's done.  
           But, it doesn't make what he sacrificed any easier to bear. 
           Orlando and Rinaldo follow, aware of his melancholy state.

                                 RINALDO
                        You know, you could stay.  Here.  
                        With us.  Pack-rats and pigeons all 
                        respect you.  They'd follow you.

                                 LOWELL
                        Thanks, guys, but the only place I 
                        wanna go is home.

           They know the feeling.  Lowell crosses to where Parcival 
           stands beside Milton, waiting to say goodbye.  

                                 LOWELL
                        You like the gift I gave you, Milt?  

           Milton smiles, showing his teeth.  Pudding stained.

                                 MILTON
                        I'd never had such a tasty treat. 

                                 PARCIVAL
                        You're certain I can't fly you, 
                        lad?  I’m ready, willing and --

                                 LOWELL
                        That’s okay, Parcival.  I’ve had 
                        enough adventure for...  Ever?

           Lowell buries himself into the bird’s wings.  Finally...  

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Ready to go home now, Lowell?

           Lowell nods, steeling himself.  Parcival and Milton step 
           aside, revealing The Beacon, sitting serenely in its nest.  
           Lowell touches it, concentrating.  Again, the egg GLOWS --

           In a flash of light, the portal reappears.  His BEDROOM.

                                 LOWELL
                        Alright.  I guess this is it.

                        Lowell?  There’s just one um...
           He has something for the boy.  It's brown.  And beaten up.  
           Leather stitched together.  The empty binding of The Book.

                                 MILTON
                        I know you promised you'd bring it 
                        back.  I just wish I could've found 
                        the pages for you.

                                 LOWELL
                            (touched)
                        Thanks, Milton.

                                 MILTON
                        It’s from all of us.

           He turns to regard to others.  Pigeons and rats, everyone.  
           Wings raise in salute.  And not just wings.  Rat paws too.

                        Huzzah to Lowell Armstrong Leavitt!

                                 EVERYONE
                        Huzzah to the bravest boy of all!

           And with that, he steps through the portal, vanishing...

                                 PARCIVAL
                        Goodbye, Lowell.  We owe you one.

           INT. LOWELL'S BEDROOM - DAY

           FOOSH!  In a CRACK OF LIGHTNING, Lowell lands on his bed.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Lowell bursts in, Angela and Charles set down coffee cups.

                                 ANGELA
                        Lowell, what're you doing up there?

                                 CHARLES
                        We heard a --

           They notice how he's dressed.  His poncho is in ribbons.  
           His sweater's half there.  His feet are bare and blistered.

                                 LOWELL
                        Mom!  Dad!  I had it, but I...  I 
                        had to let it go.  It’s all my 
                        fault.  I lost it.  I lost it.
                                 ANGELA
                        Hon, slow down.  What’d you lose?  

                                 LOWELL
                        Your love!  I lost your love!

           Angela and Charles exchange looks.  Dumbfounded.  He shows 
           the battered, page-less binding.  What’s left of The Book.    

                                 LOWELL
                        I lost The Book.  And I lost your 
                        love.  And I tried, I did, but I 
                        couldn't bring either of them back.

                                 CHARLES
                        Pal, you had a bad dream...

                                 LOWELL
                            (tears welling)
                        It wasn’t a dream!  I...  I heard 
                        you.  I heard you say you're 
                        getting a divorce.  I heard you 
                        say...  You don’t love me anymore.

           Silence.  Charles and Angela regard one another, rocked.

                                 ANGELA
                        Lowell, of course we love you.

                                 CHARLES
                        We've loved you every second since 
                        the moment you were born.

                                 ANGELA
                        No matter what problems we have, or 
                        what happens, that will never 
                        change.  We will always love you, 
                        Lowell.  No matter what.

                                 CHARLES
                        There's one thing even someone as 
                        good at losing stuff as you could 
                        never, ever lose.  Us.

           Lowell stares at them, eyes raw.  Trying to understand.

                                 LOWELL
                        You promise?

                                 CHARLES & ANGELA
                        We swear.
           As they hug their son, holding him as tight as they can,   
           we notice something hanging out of Lowell's back pocket.  A 
           dirty sock with a hole in the toe.

           And there...  a TINY GRAIN of SPARKLING, TWINKLING DUST.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           BRRRRRRIIIIIIIINNNNG!  

           Fourth-graders flee for the exits, piling their homeworks  
           on the desk of Ms. Mott.  After they've gone, she sees one 
           boy still standing at the door.  She sighs.

                                 MS. MOTT
                        Lowell?  Empty-handed again, are 
                        we?  And what’s the excuse today?

                                 LOWELL
                        No excuse, Ms. Mott.

                                 MS. MOTT
                        And no report?  And no hope of 
                        passing the fourth grade?  Lowell, 
                        why?  And don't tell me it's that 
                        curse again, I...

           Something FLAPS at the window.  Ms. Mott spins, alarmed.

                                 MS. MOTT
                        ... What was that?

           Something SCUTTLES in the heating duct.  She spins again.  

                                 MS. MOTT
                        What's going on here?  Lowell?

           She turns back toward him.  But he's gone.

                                 MS. MOTT
                        This is totally, utterly un--

           Suddenly, a SHEET OF PAPER floats in the open window and 
           settles onto her desk.  “Lowell A. Leavitt, Homework 28.”

                                 MS. MOTT
                        -- acceptable?

           WHOOSH!  From the window, the door, the heating duct, from 
           every crevice of the room, HOMEWORK PAPERS flood out, EVERY 
           LAST LOST HOMEWORK, covering her in paper from head to toe.
                                 MS. MOTT
                            (muffled)
                        Holey.  Moley.

           EXT. AMELIA EARHART ELEMENTARY - DAY

           Lowell races down the steps, eyes on the sky.  He kicks off 
           his galoshes and shimmies up a stop sign, as...

           PIGEONS soar through the skies above.  Homing Pigeons, to 
           be precise.  As they pass, tiny bundles drop from their 
           talons, parachutes popping open as the bundles descend.  

           Floating down into view, we see a ROLLER-SKATE.  A SET of 
           KEYS.  A SUITCASE.  A very frightened looking TABBY CAT.  

           On the streets below, PEOPLE emerge from their homes, from 
           their business, staring up with wonder as all the world’s 
           lost things are returned by a squadron of soaring pigeons.

           As as the purses and retainers and winning lottery tickets 
           find their way back to their rightful owners, a VOICE 
           whispers to us, warm and lyrical.  The same voice we heard 
           at the beginning.  And we realize it’s --

                                 MISSING LINK (V.O.)
                        And so it was, that a boy who was 
                        born to lose found happiness in the 
                        knowledge that certain things -- 
                        the important things -- could never 
                        truly be lost...

           Lowell smiles, waving up at the passing birds.

                                 MISSING LINK (V.O.)
                        And no matter where life took him, 
                        someone would always be watching 
                        over him.  From above.

           It’s hard to be sure, but maybe, just maybe, we can make 
           out Parcival.  Waving back as he flaps past.

                                 MISSING LINK (V.O.)
                        The...
                            (He trails off.  The sound   
                             of pages flipping)
                        I’m sorry, I seem to have lost my 
                        pla--  Ah.  Here we go.
                            (clears his throat)
                        ... End.

           FADE OUT.
