           EXT. A SMALL LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE- NEW ENGLAND

           CHYRON:  “1998”

           A banner reads “Welcome Frosh!” It is orientation.  The 
           beautiful campus is filled with students and their parents, 
           dragging around luggage.  KATE, 18, walks across the campus, 
           dragging her duffle bags.  She is pretty, cheerful and 
           enthusiastic in only the way a former Girl Scout can be.  She 
           is covered in J. Crew clothes and has a beret placed jauntily 
           atop her head.

           As Kate walks, she greets other students.  

                                 KATE
                        Hi, how are you?  I’m Kate. 
                             (then, to a depressed 
                              student)
                        I’m so excited to be at college, 
                        aren’t you?

                                 DEPRESSED STUDENT
                        I’m going to hang myself in the 
                        middle of the quad.

                                 KATE
                        “The quad!?” I love saying “the 
                        quad.”  It’s so college!  

           She rushes away towards her dorm.

           A LEGEND CARD APPEARS: “THE MEET CUTE.”

           INT. DORM- HALLWAY

           AMY, 18, walks down the hallway. She is pretty underneath her 
           post-Courtney Love girl band outfit, and walks down the 
           hallway like she’s lived here for years. She’s trying to 
           carry too much and dropping things along the way, not caring. 
           Oh, and her luggage is garbage bags. Peaking out from her bag 
           is a three-foot glass bong and a horse head.  

                                 AMY
                        No parents in sight! Third floor!  
                        Who’s ready to party?!  Whoooo!

                                 COLLEGE STUDENTS
                        Whoo hoo!/  I am so ready!/ Roll in 
                        the keg, bitches./ You sound fun.

           AMY AND KATE PASS EACH OTHER in the hall.
                                 AMY 
                        Nice beret, Lewinski.

                                 KATE
                        Oh, uh, thanks a lot.  

           Kate touches her beret then continues down the hall and opens 
           her dorm room. A BLUR dressed like a late 90’s Britney Spears 
           RUSHES TOWARDS Kate and hugs her.  This is KIM GOLD.  AN 
           OLDER MAN is putting together a futon bed frame.

                                 KIM GOLD
                        Roomie roomie roomie roomie! 
                        I always dreamed I would be roomies 
                        with a girl like you.  Did you 
                        climb out of my ear and into real 
                        life, dream roomie?

                                 KATE
                        Uh, hi, I’m Kate.

                                 KIM GOLD
                        I totally memorized all your stats: 
                        Kate Reid, 18 years young from 
                        Illinois, enjoys Britney Spears and 
                        kayaking? Am I right? Oh, and your 
                        birthday is December 19th so that 
                        makes you a Sag. I’m sorry, Dr. 
                        Sag, Miss Pre-Med.

           Kim Gold jumps up and down, clapping.

                                 KIM GOLD (CONT'D)
                        Roomies! Yay!

                                 KATE 
                        Were you by any chance a 
                        cheerleader in high school?

                                 KIM GOLD
                        Uh, were you by any chance a 
                        psychic in high school? 

           The Older Man shuts his tool box.  

                                 OLDER MAN
                        I should get going, sweetie.  I 
                        love you beyond moonlight.

                                 KIM GOLD
                        I love you beyond rainbows. 
           Kate watches as Kim Gold and the Older Man START TO MAKE OUT. 
           They pull away.

                                 KIM GOLD (CONT'D)
                        Bye baby.  

           He leaves.  Kim Gold turns to Kate.

                                 KIM GOLD (CONT'D)
                        Isn’t my boyfriend dope?

           Kate is both stunned and grossed out.

           INT. DORM COMMON ROOM- LATER

           The room is filled with new freshman. Kate sits with her 
           roommate Kim Gold.  A GUY and GIRL RESIDENT ADVISORS perform 
           a scene from a typical college party. 

                                 GUY R.A. 
                        Hey you are sure cute.  I am a frat 
                        guy from Sigma Kappa Mu, also known 
                        as SKuM!  Would you like some of 
                        this mysterious, cloudy punch?

           He holds out a blue plastic cup to her.

                                 GIRL R.A.
                        No thanks.  I’m enjoying my diet 
                        beverage right now.

                                 GUY R.A.
                        But if you drink this punch you 
                        will finally feel the comfort and 
                        ease you crave being so far from 
                        home.  It is like a sip of Mom and 
                        Dad. Here.  Drink it.

           She knocks his cup to the ground.

                                 GIRL R.A. 
                        I said no, SKuM!

           The R.A.’s turn to the group, breaking character.

                                 GIRL R.A. (CONT'D)
                        Watch out for sexual predators.  
                        They are everywhere.
                                 GUY R.A. 
                        And it happens literally every 
                        single day at this institution.  
                        It’s a fact.

           A cute freshman guy, NICK (a Seth Rogen type), sits near AMY. 
           He raises his hand.

                                 NICK
                        It’s a fact? Every single day 
                        someone at this small liberal arts 
                        college gets a drink spiked? 
                        Because that seems like a lot.

                                 GUY R.A.
                        It is a fact that I know...and 
                        other R.A.’s know. 
                             (to the Girl R.A.)
                        You know that fact, right?

                                 GIRL R.A.
                        Actually, that does seem like a 
                        lot.

                                 NICK
                        Because you said “literally” and I 
                        just want to make sure you meant 
                        it.

           Amy laughs.  Nick smiles at her.  The Guy R.A. looks mad. The 
           Girl R.A. changes the subject.

                                 GIRL R.A.
                        Now let’s pair you guys up with 
                        people you don’t already know for 
                        another Ice Breaker exercise... 
                        trust falls!

           INT. DORM COMMON ROOM- MINUTES LATER

           Kate stands on a table, poised for a trust fall.  Amy half-
           heartedly holds her arms out while she talks to Nick, who is 
           paired up with another guy next to her.

                                 NICK
                        Hey, the guys on the 3rd floor  
                        just bought an electric razor.  
                        We’re gonna ‘hawk a dude at 
                        midnight.  Wanna watch?
                                 AMY
                        Of course I do.  I’m not made of 
                        wood.

                                 NICK 
                        Can you throw in for the keg?

           KATE, SEEING AMY’S ARMS OPEN, TIPS BACK TOWARDS HER.

                                 KATE

                        Faller falling.

           Amy looks through her pockets for cash, NOT NOTICING THAT 
           KATE IS TRUST-FALLING TOWARDS HER.  Kate FALLS to the floor.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Aaaaa!

                                 NICK
                        Oh shit.  That’s bad.

           Amy looks down at Kate on the floor, clutching her neck.

                                 AMY
                        Are you okay?

                                 KATE 
                        What’s wrong with you?  It was a 
                        trust fall!  You were supposed to 
                        catch me!

                                 AMY
                        But I am a total stranger.  There’s 
                        no reason you should trust me. I 
                        just saved you from a lifetime of 
                        muggings and rapes. You’re welcome.
                             (to Nick)
                        There’s no trust between me and 
                        her. Right?  It’s not logical.

           EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS- THE QUAD- LATER

           Kate and Kim Gold walk across campus together.  Kate is 
           wearing an enormous NECK BRACE.  

                                 KATE
                        I look like a freak.  I should just 
                        transfer. I’m going to be known 
                        here as “Neck Brace” forever. 
                                 KIM GOLD
                        No you won’t.

           A girl walks by and nods “hello” to Kate.

                                 EAVESDROPPING GIRL
                        What’s up, Neck Brace?

                                 KATE 
                        Shut up, Teddy Bear Girl.

           Teddy Bear Girl glares and walks away.

                                 KIM GOLD 
                        No matter what people call you, if 
                        they call you Neck Brace, if they 
                        call you Boring Kate or Flat Ass, I 
                        am here for you.  I mean I am the 
                        one you should feel sorry for.  I 
                        am the one who has to be known as 
                        Neck Brace’s roommate.  That’s a 
                        real stigma.

           Kate shakes off her bad mood.

                                 KATE
                        You know what?  I have you as a 
                        friend.  I don’t need this whole 
                        school to embrace me.  I am just 
                        going to do what I came here to do-- 
                        throw myself into my studies.

                                 KIM GOLD
                        Uh, would you mind doing that 
                        somewhere else tonight?  Arthur’s 
                        coming to visit.  His daughter just 
                        had a baby so he’s in town for the 
                        night.
                             (whispers)
                        We might have anal sex.

           INT. DORM HALLWAY- LATER THAT NIGHT

           CLOSE UP ON A DOORKNOB.  There is A PLAID HAIR SCRUNCHIE ON 
           IT.  Sounds of sex and giggling come from behind the door. We 
           PULL BACK AND SEE that Kate is sitting on the floor, 
           studying.  She has been SEXILED.

                                 KIM GOLD (O.S.) 
                        Arthur!... No I won’t call you 
                        Grandpa!  
           More giggling and gross sex sounds come from the room.  Kate 
           goes back to studying WHEN SHE SEES AMY EMERGE FROM HER DORM 
           ROOM, EYES RED. Kate strains to see her room-- piles of 
           clothes and books and food thrown everywhere, bags still 
           unpacked, Indian tapestries. 

           As Amy gets closer, Kate ducks her head behind a book, 
           clearly avoiding her.  Amy heads towards the FOOD MACHINES.  

                                 AMY 
                             (to the food machine)
                        Come here, my little Snickers. You 
                        are my little baby and I am going 
                        to love you by putting you in my 
                        belly.
                             (searches her pocket)
                        Shit.  Hey you, you got change over 
                        there?

           Kate continues to study, ignoring her.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Fine.

           Amy sticks her arm into the bottom of the snack machine where 
           the candy comes out.  She grabs a Snickers.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        You’re my precious chocolate angel. 
                        I’m going to get you.

           As she pulls her arm out, it gets stuck.  She pulls harder.  
           Nothing.  Again.  Nothing.  She lies down and pushes her feet 
           against the food machine.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Shit.  I’m stuck!  
                             (then, to Kate)
                        Hey, you.  Help me.
                             (no answer)
                        I know you hear me.

           Kate buries her head deeper in her book.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Come on, Neck Brace, be a pal. I’m 
                        stuck over here.

                                 KATE
                        Do you really think I’m going to 
                        respond to that?
                                 AMY
                             (sarcastic)
                        I would appreciate it ever so and 
                        will bring you afternoon tea if you 
                        would be so kind as to help a 
                        brother out.

                                 KATE
                        Everyone at this school calls me 
                        Neck Brace.

                                 AMY
                        I know. That sucks.

                                 KATE
                        Because of you.

                                 AMY
                        I’m really sorry. Can you help?

                                 KATE
                        What’s my name?

                                 AMY
                        What?

                                 KATE
                        What’s my name? My real name. If 
                        you can tell me that, I will help 
                        you.

                                 AMY
                        Oh, okay, easy. Your name is Lisa.

                                 KATE
                        No, it’s not.

                                 AMY
                        Well, how the fuck am I supposed to 
                        know what your real name is, you’re 
                        Neck Brace. It’s your name.

                        I’m going to the library.

           Kate starts to get up and walk away.  Amy calls out.

                                 AMY
                        Wait, I’m sorry. But look at it 
                        this way. If it weren’t for me, you 
                        would just be some anonymous nerd. 
                        But now, you’re famous, you’re...

           Kate sighs and begins to help her.

                                 KATE
                        I am too nice.

           INT. DORM HALLWAY- LATER

           Kate hangs up the dorm’s hall phone and turns to Amy.

                                 KATE 
                        Security’s not coming until 
                        morning.  So, um, good luck. I 
                        would leave you some food, but, 
                        well, the vending machine...

                                 AMY
                        Okay, well, I’ll probably just hang 
                        out here for a while.

           Kate starts to walk away. Amy watches her, then looks at her 
           arm. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)

           Kate sits next to Amy. They are mid-conversation.

                                 KATE 
                        ... the thing is, my parents are 
                        pretty angry at me right now and 
                        they keep saying I’m just doing it 
                        to be rebellious but I’m telling 
                        you, it’s not that. I just really 
                        prefer Brain Surgery to Oncology,

                                 AMY
                        What do you major in to be Oprah?

                                 KATE

                                 AMY

           Kate and Amy look a little more tired but they are laughing. 
           Amy passes Kate the joint they are halfway through.

                                 AMY
                        I am so glad I kept my emerge-e-
                        joint in my wallet.

           Kate takes a hit.

                                 KATE
                        Me too! You know what I could 
                        really go for? A Snickers.

           They look at the vending machine. Obviously it is out of 
           commission because of Amy’s arm and her hand, dangling near 
           the candy bar section.  She is stoned so she puts a dollar in 
           and buys a Snickers.  It lies near Amy’s hand next to the 
           other Snickers.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Your hand is so lucky!

           Kate is still trying to figure out how to get Amy out.  She 
           finishes rubbing moisturizer all over Amy’s arm, then pulls.

                                 AMY
                        They’re going to have to amputate 
                        it.  Then I’ll be the One Arm freak 
                        and then everyone will just call me  
                        me “uni-limb”..
                             (a beat)
                        Sorry about the whole “neck brace” 
                        thing.
                                 KATE
                        It’s okay. I’m sorry I call you 
                        “Druggy Whore.”

                        I didn’t know you did.

                                 KATE
                        I never said it to anyone.  I just 
                        wrote it in my journal.

           Amy thinks for a beat.

                                 AMY
                        I don’t hate it.

           Kate smiles.

           It’s much later and they look really, really tired. And 
           emotional.

                                 AMY
                        And sometimes, I really really miss 
                        my grandpa.

           Kate comforts her by trying to wrap her arms around Amy which 
           is hard considering she has one arm stuck in a vending 
           machine.

                                 KATE 
                        Me too. Me too.

           INT. DORM HALLWAY- EARLY THE NEXT MORNING

           Kate and Amy wake to see the SECURITY GUARD approach them.  
           He removes the bottom of the food machine and Amy’s arm is 
           free.  She shakes it out, getting the blood flowing. Kate and 
           Amy hug.

                                 KATE 
                        You’re free!

                                 AMY
                        I know that now!  I’ve never valued 
                        life so much.  There’s so much I 
                        can do that doesn’t involve this 
                        food machine.  I feel reborn!
           Amy looks at the grimy Snickers in her hand which is stuck in 
           a claw position.  She unwraps it, breaks it in half and hands 
           it to Kate.  Kate takes it.  THEY EAT IT TOGETHER.

                                 KATE 
                        Thanks.

           They start to go their own ways and then...

                                 AMY
                        I know we just spent like, 12 hours 
                        together, but you want to get 
                        breakfast?

                        Yeah, totally. I’m starving. Let me 
                        just change.

                        Okay, I’m going to take a fifteen 
                        minute disco nap. Can you wake me 
                        up when you’re ready?  I don’t have 
                        an alarm clock.

           Kate watches Amy go, then she HAPPILY BUSTS INTO HER DORM 
           ROOM.  There’s a scream.

                                 KIM GOLD (O.S.)
                        Kate!  Does a scrunchie on a

           Note:  As the years go by we see Kate and Amy go through many 
           many bad HAIR STYLES AND worse FASHION PHASES.

           - Kate and Amy trying on each other’s clothes and each 
           telling the other how much better her butt looks in these 
           jeans.  They trade a NIRVANA T-SHIRT for a WORN PAIR OF 
           JEANS.

           - College campus.  A hunger strike is going on in the quad.  
           Amy and Kate walk by, carrying a whole pizza and eating 
           dripping greasy pieces.  

           - Kim Gold walks up to the outside of her dorm room. There is 
           a SCRUNCHIE ON THE DOOR. Annoyed, she walks away. Inside the 
           dorm room, Kate and Amy laugh and smoke pot.

           - Kate and Amy sit at the college cafeteria, SPLITTING ALL 
           THEIR FOOD.
           - A diner.  Kate and Amy are on a double date with two guys.  
           They won’t stop talking to each other.  The guys look bored.  
           Kate and Amy are having a great time.

           - New apartments.  Kate and Amy put together Ikea furniture.  
           Kate completes her dresser quickly.  Amy’s bed looks like a 
           dying animal.

           - Kate’s Apartment.  A Christmas Tree is up decorated with 
           chop sticks and take out menus and soy sauce packages.  Kate 
           and Amy sit under the tree together.

           A Pre War walk-up in the West Village.

           INT. KATE’S APARTMENT- SAME

           A stark contemporary apartment with almost no furniture or 
           personal items.  It is perfectly clean and organized.

           Kate, now 28, wearing hospital scrubs, is making coffee. She 
           fills up a cup and walks out of her apartment and across the 
           hall to--

           INT. AMY’S APARTMENT- CONTINUOUS

           Kate lets herself into Amy’s apartment.  It is the exact same 
           lay out as Kate’s apartment, but looks completely different, 
           more like a dorm room. In fact, it looks exactly like Amy’s 
           old dorm room-- clothes and books and food piled everywhere 
           and some Indian tapestries hung up.  Also a CASSETTE RECORDER 
           AND CASSETTE TAPES strewn all over, as well as many copies of 
           BATTERED CLASSIC NOVELS.

           Amy, also now 28, is fast asleep on a futon on the floor. The 
           Ikea Krumpf bed bought many years earlier is lying in pieces 
           in a corner.  Kate takes a sandwich out of Amy’s hand and 
           throws it out. Amy wakes slowly.

                        organize your closet for you.

                                 AMY
                        No. You’d make it look like a 
                        store. Then I’d always feel like I 
                        was shoplifting. 

                                 KATE
                        I feel like you might like that.

                                 AMY
                        That’s a good point. Okay. Maybe 
                        for your birthday.
           Amy throws on sweats and heads out her front door. Kate 
           follows. They go ACROSS THE HALL to Kate’s apartment.

           INT. KATE’S APARTMENT- CONTINUOUS

           Amy opens Kate’s door and walks in, while Kate follows. Amy 
           pours herself a cup of coffee, takes a sip and makes a face.

                                 AMY
                        I’m not going to lie to you, it’s a 
                        little on the weak side.

                                 KATE
                             (excited)
                        I know. It’s decaf. I can’t be 
                        jittery. I’m touching my first 
                        brain today. 

                                 AMY
                        Gross, but have fun!  Or whatever.

                                 KATE
                        Thanks, I will.  Where’s today’s 
                        temp job?  

                                 AMY
                        I don’t know.  Boring office with 
                        nameless faceless people working 
                        for who cares, inc.  Nothing as 
                        awesome as brain groping.  

                                 KATE
                             (giddy)
                        I told you it was a live brain, 
                        right?  Sayonara cadavers!

                                 AMY
                        Yay!

           Kate grabs her stuff, checking a list of things to do.

                                 KATE
                        Okay, don’t forget your dentist at 
                        4:30. Remember, it’s a cavity 
                        filling so don’t drink anything 
                        cold after. I paid your bills 
                        online so that’s done.  And Tom’s 
                        dinner starts at 730.

           While she is doing this. Amy is fluffing Kate’s hair and 
           making her look much less buttoned-up. 
                                 AMY
                        I finally get to meet Mystery Tom. 
                        I don’t know why you’ve been hiding 
                        him from me. 

                                 KATE
                        I haven’t been hiding him from you. 
                        He’s a Brain Surgeon.  He’s busy.

           Kate looks in the mirror and checks her hair.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                             (re:hair)
                        Better.

                                 AMY
                        Duh. 
                             (then)
                        I’m just saying, you’ve been dating 
                        him for three months. I’m meeting 
                        him in the second trimester. Now I 
                        have no choice but to like him.
                        I hope he thinks I’m hot. He won’t 
                        set me up with his friends if he 
                        thinks I’m a dog.

           Amy looks at Kate’s white Chihuahua, LADY GIRL, who is eating 
           from her dog bowl.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        No offense, Lady Girl.

                                 KATE
                        I’m the one who should be nervous. 
                        I’ve never thrown a dinner party 
                        before. Unless you count that time 
                        we made weed food sophomore year.

                                 AMY
                        That was the best party ever. It’s 
                        really all down hill from there.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY- LATER THAT MORNING

           Amy and Kate walk towards the subway together.  Both are now 
           dressed for work.

                                 KATE
                        So I’ll see you at Tom’s tonight. 
                        Don’t pull an Amy and be late.
                                 AMY
                        “Pull an Amy.” That’s funny.

                                 KATE
                        It’s supposed to shame you into 
                        being on time.

                                 AMY
                        It’s not working. I like it. 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        What a co-ink!

           Kate and Amy see Kim Gold, Kate’s old roommate.  She is 
           dressed for work, overly fashionable like someone from “The 
           Hills’” threw up on her.

                                 KIM GOLD
                        You owe me a call, Dr. Roomie.

                                 KATE
                        I know.  I’m so sorry.

                                 KIM GOLD
                        We should get together for a 
                        coffee.  I have the funniest story 
                        to tell you:  I got promoted to 
                        assistant to the editor at Elle 
                        Magazine.

           Pause.  Kim is finished talking.

                                 AMY
                        That’s not a story.  

           Kim glares at Amy.

                                 KIM GOLD
                        You never change.  Still sucking on 
                        that 3 foot bong, waste-oid?

                                 AMY
                        Uh... 
                             (searches for a comeback, 
                              then)
                        Yes.

                                 KIM GOLD
                        People I know who go to church will 
                        pray for you, Amy. Katie, I’ll see 
                        you later.  Call me or I will 
                        murder you in your sleep.
           Kim bounces away down the street.  

                                 AMY
                        Thank God we don’t have to see her 
                        everyday anymore. Can you believe 
                        she said that about Lt. Bongster? 

                                 KATE
                        I gotta go.  Here’s your lunch. 
                        PB&J.

           Kate hands her a paper bag.

                                 AMY
                         Yummy. See you tonight.  

           Kate disappears down the subway.

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT- THAT NIGHT

           Amy walks into a very huge and bare looking loft.  The dinner 
           party is in progress.  It is very adult looking. Music plays, 
           probably “The Pixies.” TOM walks up to her. He is a good 
           looking guy, mid-30’s, with an impressive head of hair.

                                 TOM
                        Hey, you must be Amy.

                                 AMY
                        Yeah, and you are Dr. Tom.

                                 TOM 
                        Or just Tom.

           Tom holds his hand out for Amy to shake. 

                                 AMY 
                        Put that old thing away, mister.

           Amy hugs Tom.  It is awkward.

                                 TOM
                        I’m not much of a hugger.

           Amy uncomfortably removes her arms from around Tom.

                                 AMY
                        Kate has told me so many great 
                        things about you.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah. Same here.  
                                 AMY
                        Really?  Like what?
                             (he thinks)
                        Just one thing she said.

                                 TOM
                        Uh... that she wakes you up every 
                        day.  

                                 AMY 
                             (disappointed)
                        That’s not a great thing.  That’s 
                        just a thing.

                                 TOM
                        Uh, well... Hey!  Let’s introduce 
                        you to the gang.  Come on in. 

           They walk inside. There are several people sitting at a long 
           dining room table in Tom’s loft, including ROXANNA, 30’S, an 
           energetic, type A personality who talks very fast. Kate is 
           laughing and talking with the guests, then jumps up when she 
           sees Amy.

                                 KATE 
                        Hey, you’re here!  She’s here.  
                        Finally.

           Tom introduces Amy to the room.

                                 TOM 
                        Hey, everyone, this is Amy. Amy, 
                        this is Rudy and Ellen. Jesse and 
                        Roxanna, Cheryl and Wendy.

           All couples except for Amy.  She waves hello.

                                 DINNER GUESTS
                        Hey!/ Welcome./ We saved pie for 
                        you.

           The chairs are all mismatched so when Amy sits, she is on a 
           very low chair. It sort of looks like she is a child.  
           Roxanna turns to her.

                                 ROXANNA
                        Amy, you look so little down there. 
                        Hello, tiny girl.

           She pats Amy on the head.

                                 ROXANNA (CONT'D)
                        So you and Tom have never met?  
                                 AMY
                        No.  Never.

                                 ROXANNA
                        After 3 months.  That’s so weird.  
                        Isn’t that weird?  Strange.  Weird.  
                        Odd.  It’s weird, isn’t it?

                                 AMY
                        It is now.

           Ellen turns to Amy.

                                 ELLEN
                        Should we pull up a chair for your 
                        partner?

                                 AMY
                        Oh, uh, no.  I’m not seeing anyone 
                        right now.  I just keep meeting a 
                        lot of jerks.  You know how that 
                        happens?  I’m just going through 
                        kind of a slutty phase right now--

                                 ROXANNA
                             (interrupts)
                        -- you should be careful, the rates 
                        of sexually transmitted diseases 
                        amongst young people are really 
                        increasing. 

                                 ELLEN 
                        People think it’s all about HIV, 
                        but the stories I could tell.  I 
                        mean, I could tell stories.  I will 
                        tell stories.

                                 JESSE
                        I know.  I saw the most insane case 
                        of advanced chlamydia last week.

                                 ROXANNA
                        You did? Why didn’t you call me. I 
                        would give my left nut to see that.

                                 TOM
                        And syphilis ain’t over, people.

           Amy looks around the room.

                                 AMY
                        Are you ALL doctors?
           They all nod.

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The plates are cleared and people are finishing desert. Kate, 
           Tom and their work friends are all talking and laughing, 
           except for Amy.

                                 ROXANNA
                        ... and then I said “If you don’t 
                        lose the toes, you’re losing the 
                        leg. Your call hot shot.”  Ask me 
                        what he said.  Go ahead.  Ask me.  
                        Ask me.  Ask me.  Ask--

                                 AMY
                             (snaps)
                        -- would somebody just ask her?

           Everyone gives Amy a look, especially Kate.

                                 TOM
                        Okay, what did he say?

                                 ROXANNE
                        He started to cry like a baby. It 
                        was kind of sad.

                                 ELLEN
                        But you were able to save three of 
                        them, right?

                                 AMY
                        You saved ‘em? Gross, throw that 
                        shit out.

                                 TOM
                        It’s actually a pretty advanced 
                        kind of surgery.

                                 AMY
                        Well, yeah. Duh.

                                 ROXANNA
                        So what does you do?

           Kate jumps in.

                                 KATE
                        Amy is working on a bunch of 
                        opportunities.
                                 ROXANNA
                        Oh, cool, like what?

                                 AMY
                        Oh, you know, I’m starting this 
                        business where I’m making my own 
                        books on tape.  I’m midway through 
                        Anna Karenina. That motherfucker is 
                        long.

           There is an awkward pause.  Kate explains.

                                 KATE
                        It’s really cool, actually, because 
                        she’s recording the classics but in 
                        a really informal way. I think it’s 
                        going to really appeal to college 
                        kids.

                                 AMY
                        Yeah, like I improvise lines so 
                        students can relate to it better.  
                        Like in this one at the end I’ll 
                        add:  “Don’t jump under that train, 
                        you sad bitch!”  And then I’ll do 
                        this amazing splat sound effect.

                                 TOM
                        Oh. Neat.

                                 AMY
                             (annoyed)
                        Yeah, it’s my life’s work.  It’s 
                        pretty neat.

           Awkward silence.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        So, anyone watching Idol?

           More silence.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        American Idol? Anyone?

                                 KATE
                        Amy, we’re just all so busy at the 
                        hospital there’s not a lot of time.

                                 TOM
                        I don’t watch TV.
                                 AMY
                        What?

                                 TOM
                        I watch sports, sure, when I can. 
                        But who has time for mindless crap?

                                 AMY
                        Are you kidding? Is he kidding? TV 
                        is great.

           They all laugh.

                                 ELLEN
                        We just all have lives, you know, 
                        saving lives, so we just don’t have 
                        the time.

                                 AMY
                        TV saves lives. I swear to god, my 
                        grandpa stayed alive an extra two 
                        months to see the finale of The 
                        Sopranos. He was really 
                        disappointed.

                                 KATE
                        Okay, you guys, let’s change the 
                        subject. I think we’re boring Amy
                        with all the medical stuff.

                                 TOM
                        Okay, let’s talk about how you’re 
                        going to be chief resident. Does 
                        that count?

           Amy is confused when everyone starts to laugh.

                                 KATE
                        Come on, no hospital talk.

                                 ELLEN
                        You are totally going to get it, 
                        though, Kate.

                                 TOM
                             (pointing to his shoe)
                        See this? It’s a shoe and you are 
                        in it. Shoe-in.

           Again, they all laugh, except for Amy.
                                 KATE
                        Enough, okay. Roxanna, what were 
                        you saying earlier about your beach 
                        house?

                                 ROXANNA
                        It’s in Montauk and it is gorgeous. 
                        And everyone needs to come or I 
                        will kill you. 

                                 KATE 
                        I would love to squeeze in Montauk.  
                        We’re actually planning on 
                        travelling to India this summer.

           Amy looks really surprised.

                                 AMY
                             (confused)
                        We are?

           Tom is amused.

                                 TOM
                             (to Amy)
                        She meant me.  We.  Tom and Kate.

           Amy looks around, embarrassed. 

                                 AMY
                        Oh.
                             (the, to Kate)
                        But, anyway, you’ll hate India. 
                        It’s hot and humid and instead of 
                        toilet paper you have to use your 
                        hand to wipe.  You could never deal 
                        with that.

                                 KATE
                             (annoyed)
                        Yes I could.

                                 TOM
                        Amy, I’ve been to India a few 
                        times. It’s completely safe if you 
                        get the shots ahead of time. It’s 
                        so amazing there.  A whole family 
                        will be your man slaves for fifty 
                        cents a day.
                             (off Amy’s weirded-out 
                              look)
                        Amy.  I’m just kidding. I’m a 
                        liberal.  I drive a hybrid.
           Amy watches as everyone once again laughs really hard.  Tom 
           and Jesse even high-five.

                                 KATE
                        Tom’s really funny.  

                                 AMY
                        When?

                                 KATE
                             (wipes her tears)
                        I’ve never met anyone so funny.

                                 ROXANNA
                        He is hilarious! I cannot stand it.  
                        I can’t!

                                 ELLEN
                        He’s like the Chris Rock of New 
                        York hospital.

                                 ROXANNA
                        And he does a great Chris Rock! Do 
                        it! Come on, do your Chris Rock. Do 
                        it. 
                             (to Amy)
                        The patients love it.

                                 TOM
                        That’s how I I keep ‘em in 
                        stitches!

           Everyone starts to roar again.  Amy groans.

           INT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL - SPLIT SCREEN

           Kate’s on a phone in the middle of the ER. It’s pretty 
           chaotic.

                                 KATE
                             (into her phone)
                        Hey, Amy, want to get a drink 
                        tonight?  I haven’t seen you in 
                        days.  I need to talk to you.

           A bleeding man bursts through the door and collapses in front 
           of Kate.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        I should go. 
           INT. AMY’S TEMP JOB - SAME

           Amy sits at a cubicle.

                                 Amy
                             (into the phone)
                        Oh yeah.  Me too.  I am super duper 
                        busy over here.

           She hangs up and picks up a tape recorder and opens up a copy 
           of ANNA KARENINA, then talks into the tape recorder.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        “All unhappy families are alike; 
                        each unhappy family is unhappy in 
                        its own way.”
                             (then, in Russian Accent)
                        So all the families hung out and 
                        did vodka shots and waited for anti-
                        depressants to be invented.

           She nods, pleased, then pushes her work aside and calls out 
           to the office at large. 

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Hey, is it anyone’s birthday today?  
                        I’m in a cake mood.

           INT. NYC BAR- THAT NIGHT

           Amy is sitting at the bar having a drink when Kate meets her. 
           She slides a beer over to Kate who sits down.

                                 KATE
                        Thanks.

                                 AMY
                        Such a shitty day.  They actually 
                        made me fax things. Why are you 
                        smiling?

                                 KATE
                        I feel happy, actually.

                                 AMY
                        Oh good.  That is such a relief. I 
                        thought I’d meet you and you’d be 
                        all crying and freaking out.

                                 KATE
                        Wait, why?  I told you I had news.
                                 AMY
                        Yeah. You broke up with that awful 
                        Dr. Tom, right?

           Kate’s whole demeanor shifts.

                                 KATE
                        You really think he’s awful?

                                 AMY
                        Of course.  I am a human being who 
                        sees and hears.  

                                 KATE
                        You don’t think he’s kind of a 
                        little... adorable and great?

                                 AMY
                        What?  No.  Come on.   Of course 
                        not.  You know better than that. 
                        Please, he is like worse than that 
                        guy you dated who pooped on your 
                        floor.  When are you dumping him?

           Kate sits for a moment and then--

                                 KATE
                        We’re engaged.

                                 AMY
                        What?

                                 KATE
                        I said we’re engaged.

                                 AMY
                        I know, I said “what?” like “are 
                        you kidding?” not “what?” like I 
                        didn’t hear you. I can’t believe 
                        you’re marrying that guy.  That is 
                        the stupidest idea you’ve ever had.

                                 KATE
                        Well, what do you know about 
                        relationships? The longest you’ve 
                        ever been with anyone was six 
                        months.

                                 AMY
                        Who did I date for six months?
                                 KATE
                        The guy in that band with that 
                        hair.

                                 AMY
                        Because he was on tour for five 
                        months. Anyway, I’m not talking 
                        about a relationship, I’m talking 
                        about a guy who isn’t right for 
                        you.

                                 KATE
                        Of course he is, I’m in love with 
                        him.

                                 AMY
                        No way.

                                 KATE
                        Yes, I am. And you better start 
                        accepting it.

                                 AMY 
                        He is in a totally different place 
                        in life than you.  He has a whole 
                        career. And he’s got to be what 
                        like 48?

                                 KATE
                        He’s 31, and I have a whole career, 
                        too. Remember when I went to med 
                        school for five years? 

                                 AMY
                        He thinks he’s like this hilarious 
                        person.  Re-enacting a hilarious 
                        Dave Chapelle routine doesn’t count 
                        as him being funny. And I can’t pin 
                        down why, but I think it’s racist.

                                 KATE
                        I think he’s funny.  

                                 AMY
                        You’re wrong.

                                 KATE
                        I am wrong?
                                 AMY
                        Yes, it’s not subjective.  It’s 
                        like if I say “Hitler is evil” that 
                        is objectively true.  This is the 
                        same thing.

                                 KATE
                        Why am I defending my relationship 
                        to you?

                                 AMY 
                        Because this is what we do.
                             (then)
                        You were so awful around him and 
                        his friends.  Like a totally 
                        different person.  You said 
                        “ginormous.”  That’s not a word.

                                 KATE
                        God forbid anyone is in the least 
                        bit different from you.

                                 AMY
                        What is happening to you?  I mean 
                        when we first met you had more to 
                        talk about than marriage and 
                        tracheotomies.

                                 KATE
                        We were in college.  I grew up. I 
                        got a life. And I feel like you 
                        hate me for it.

                                 AMY 
                        I don’t hate you. I hate your 
                        boyfriend and all of his friends. 
                        And their boring jobs and the 
                        things they talk about.
                             (thinks)
                        But the girl at the end of the 
                        table with the horse laugh and the 
                        horse face I actually did just 
                        hate.  I hated her.

                                 KATE
                        Well, maybe if you were willing to 
                        change at all from the eighteen-
                        year-old you were.

                                 AMY
                        I’ve changed. I have a career too, 
                        you know.
                                 KATE
                        Yeah, recording your own books on 
                        tapes with funny voices. Good luck 
                        on that one.

                                 AMY
                        Oh, sorry I didn’t do exactly what 
                        my mommy and daddy told me to do 
                        without ever wondering how I felt. 
                        At least I don’t live my life like 
                        I’m ninety-five.

                                 KATE
                        You live your life like you’re five 
                        and I’m your mommy. I do everything 
                        for you.  It’s like I’m breast 
                        feeding a giant adult baby who 
                        sucks only life out of me and not 
                        nutrients and anti-bodies. 

                                 AMY
                        Who asked you to do it anyway? Why 
                        don’t you stop trying to take care 
                        of me all the time.  Stop trying to 
                        control everyone and everything all 
                        the time.  Relax, Grandma.

                                 KATE
                        Maybe I will stop.

                                 AMY
                        Maybe you should if you’re going to 
                        resent it so much.

                                 KATE
                        Okay, then.

                                 AMY
                        And good luck trying to have fun 
                        with those assholes at the 
                        hospital.  Live it up with the 
                        horse laugher.

           A Guy at the Bar sidles up to them.

                                 GUY AT BAR
                        Ladies.  You like to party? You 
                        want to come to my house and 
                        wrestle until my wife gets home?
                                 AMY
                        We are in the middle of a fight.  
                        Stop hitting on us.  No one likes 
                        to party and no one likes you.  

                                 GUY AT BAR
                             (sulky, walks away)
                        Everyone likes to party...  I like 
                        to party...

           Amy turns seriously to Kate.

                                 AMY 
                        You know, I just think this guy is 
                        a mistake. Who you choose to hang 
                        out with says a lot about a person. 

           Kate looks at Amy for a moment, then...

                                 KATE
                             (pointedly, re: Amy)
                        Yeah. Exactly. 

           Amy is surprised and can’t hide it.  They stare at each 
           other.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        I don’t want a best friend who  
                        can’t accept the person I’m in love 
                        with.

                                 AMY
                        So what? This is it? Are we 
                        breaking up?

                                 KATE 
                        We can’t break up, we’re not a 
                        couple. But I guess we shouldn’t 
                        talk for a while or see each other.

                                 AMY
                        That is breaking up!

                                 KATE
                        Okay, yeah, then we’re breaking up.

           Amy watches Kate walk out the bar.  The Guy at the Bar sidles 
           up to her again. 

                                 GUY AT BAR
                        Our three way just became a 2 way.  
                        That’s cool. You’re the hot one.
           Amy grabs her purse and sadly leaves the bar too.

           Kate tells Tom the whole story over breakfast.

                                 TOM 
                        Now we can be each other’s best 
                        friend.

           Kate laughs really really hard.  

                                 KATE
                        Yeah, right.

                                 TOM
                        Why not? My parents are best 
                        friends.

                                 KATE
                        Tom, your parents are really dull.  
                        Who else would have them?
                             (off his look)
                        What?  You say it yourself.  I am 
                        just quoting you to you.

           Tom picks up the phone.

                                 TOM 
                        Let’s call the gang from work.  

                                 KATE
                        That’s a good idea.  

                                 TOM
                        Roxanna is always telling me how 
                        much she loves you.

                                 KATE
                             (perks up)
                        I love her too.  And she’s new 
                        blood.

           Kate listens to this.  He’s right.  She gets up from the 
           couch.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Okay.  Yes. Thanks, sweetie.  You 
                        made me feel better about this Amy 
                        disaster.  Much better.

                        Like a best friend would do.

           INT. AMY’S APARTMENT- DAYS LATER

           A  HUGE PYRAMID of Chinese Food boxes is in the middle of the 
           room.  The room is dark, except for “Beaches” playing on the 
           TV.  The door bursts open.  It is Amy and Kate’s good 
           friends, another best friend duo, SARAH AND LARA.

                                 SARAH
                        What’s that smell?

                                 LARA
                        What if she’s dead?

                                 SARAH
                        Kate said she was freaking out.  
                        But this is worse than I pictured.

           Amy tries to hide under a plaid comforter. Lara pulls the 
           comforter off of Amy.  Amy shrieks as if she is an animal.

                                 LARA
                        Amy, stop it.  You have to get out 
                        of the house.  Just because you and 
                        Kate aren’t talking, you have a 
                        full life.
                             (re: books on tape)
                        You have a great family, a career--

           Sarah looks at the jumpled pile of classic novels and

                        I actually forgot what it felt like 
                        to not be watching “Beaches.”

                                 SARAH
                        Don’t worry about this fight.  You 
                        and Kate will totally make up.

           Amy shakes her head.

                                 AMY
                        Really. We won’t. We’ve had fights 
                        before, this is different.  This is 
                        it.

                                 LARA
                        Wow, she sounds serious. No more 
                        Amy and Kate.    

                                 SARAH
                        It’s so sad.  Friendship is 
                        supposed to be forever.

           Amy starts to sink into despair.

                                 LARA
                        Don’t worry, Ames, we are both 
                        totally here for you except for the 
                        times when we’re having plans with 
                        Kate.

                                 AMY
                        Thanks.  I just really feel like 
                        this whole thing is getting in the 
                        way of my work.

           A WAITER brings waters to the table.

                                 WAITER
                        Here you go, guys.  Sarah and Lara 
                        with ice.  Amy, room temp. Where’s 
                        Kate today?

                                 SARAH
                        Amy and Kate aren’t friends 
                        anymore.
                                 WAITER
                             (to Amy)
                        I thought you and Kate were 
                        lesbians. 

                                 AMY
                        No.  We were best friends.

                                 WAITER
                        Really?  I never questioned it.  
                        Weird.  
                             (he starts to walk away 
                              and then turns back)
                        But sometimes?

           Amy gives him the finger as he leaves. Sarah hands Amy a 
           menu.

                                 LARA
                        Go ahead and order.  Anything you 
                        want.  It’s on us.
                             (off Sarah’s look)
                        Except the tip.

           Amy glumly looks at the menu.

                                 AMY
                        What are you getting?

                                 SARAH 
                        Me and Lara are splitting the egg 
                        white scramble and the waffles, 
                        right?

                                 AMY
                        I’ll get in on that.

                                 LARA 
                        It wouldn’t work to split it three 
                        ways.  That’s not enough food.

                                 AMY
                        We could get three things and split 
                        them three ways.

                                 SARAH
                        We already got the starch thing and 
                        the egg thing.  We don’t need 
                        anything else.

                                 LARA
                        I’ve never heard of 3 way 
                        splitsies.
                                 AMY
                        So what? It would be a new 
                        adventure. 
                             (reads menu)
                        Hey, what about a frittata? 

                                 SARAH 
                        I don’t like frittatas.

                                 LARA
                        Is it a quiche?  Is it a pot pie?  
                        Who knows?

                                 SARAH
                        Who cares? 

           Amy can’t deal with it anymore.  She yells out.  

                                 AMY
                        What am I supposed to do!  Why did 
                        you drag me out here?!   I’m not 
                        ready!

           The restaurant stares at her.

                                 SARAH
                        That was really loud.  You are 
                        really losing it!

                                 LARA
                             (to Amy)
                        We come here all the time.  There 
                        aren’t a lot of breakfast places in 
                        Park Slope so don’t ruin our status 
                        here.

                                 SARAH
                        If you do that again, you’re going 
                        to have to leave.

           Amy gets herself together.

                                 AMY 
                        I’m sorry Lara and Sarah.  You know 
                        what?  I’ve been going splitsies 
                        with Kate since college.  I am not 
                        half a person.  I am free.  I am 
                        going to have 2 whole entrees 
                        myself.  And what if I don’t finish 
                        it?  So what? This is great. I 
                        don’t need a best friend to define 
                        who I am or split pancakes.

                        It’s time to get some work done and 
                        get to know the most important 
                        person in my life.

                        Me.  I mean me.

                        Oh I get it. 
                             (to Sarah)
                        Did you have any idea who she 
                        meant?

           Sarah shakes her head.

           INT. CENTRAL PARK- DAY

           A running club jogs through Central Park.  Kate jogs with 
           Roxanna.  Tom and Jesse are not far behind.

                                 KATE
                        I can’t believe you guys have the 
                        energy for a running club after 
                        working all week.

                                 ROXANNA 
                        I just feel like I have no right to 
                        heal bodies and not take care of my 
                        own, even though I eat McDonald’s 
                        like 3 times a week. Don’t tell!

                                 KATE
                        I won’t if you don’t tell anyone at 
                        work about my horrible crystal meth 
                        habit.

           Roxanna and Kate laugh.

                                 ROXANNA
                        I also think you should join my dog 
                        club and the judo class I belong 
                        to.  You in?

                                 KATE 
                        Yes.  It’s great to have friends 
                        who actually get up and do things.  
                        Amy always thought it was stupid to 
                        join clubs. She said it was just 
                        exercise for people who can’t get 
                        laid.

                                 ROXANNA 
                        That’s crazy. I fill every single 
                        minute of my life with activity.

                        Every single minute. Right now I am 
                        accomplishing a closeness with you. 
                        That is fulfilling to me. Every 
                        minute I am growing.  If I am not 
                        then life is a waste.

                                 KATE
                        That’s a great philosophy.  I’m 
                        just always too tired after work to 
                        do anything.

                                 ROXANNA
                        Listen to me.  A great man once 
                        said: “All we have is time and it 
                        is up to us to figure out what to 
                        do with it.”

                                 KATE
                        I love that.  Who said that?

                                 ROXANNA
                        Actually it was me!

                                 KATE
                        Really?  You made that up?  It 
                        sounds familiar.  Are you sure it 
                        wasn’t Benjamin Franklin?

                                 ROXANNA
                        I don’t know.  I have so much 
                        happening I don’t really have time 
                        to look it up and be sure, I just 
                        know I live it and that’s all I 
                        need to know, you know?

           Kate nods.

                                 ROXANNA (CONT’D)
                        Also, an old lady was fondled in my 
                        building so I’m organizing a self-
                        defense club. You have to come.

                                 KATE
                        My social calendar is clear.  I’m 
                        up for anything.

           Tom and Jesse catch up to the women.  Tom jogs up to Kate.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        She’s great. It’s like all these 
                        years with Amy kept me from knowing 
                        all the great people there were out 
                        there. 
           INT. AMY’S APARTMENT

           The clock reads 5:00 PM.  

           Amy sits on the floor with a copy of David Copperfield and 
           speaks into a tape recorder.

                                 AMY
                        David Copperfield which is by 
                        Charles Dickens.  I know a lot of 
                        you are probably laughing at the 
                        word “dick” right now, but actually 
                        in this time period “penises” were 
                        probably not even known as dicks 
                        yet so no one at this time thought 
                        his name was as hilarious as they 
                        probably would if they lived now...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AMY’S APARTMENT

           The clock reads 5:11 PM.  Amy is now looking through the 
           newspaper for movie times.

           INT. NYC MOVIE THEATER- NIGHT

           Amy sits in a movie theater with a giant soda and popcorn 
           waiting for the movie to start.  She is on her cell phone.

                                 AMY
                        Yeah, Sarah, I’m at the movies 
                        alone.  I love it. I love being 
                        alone, it turns out. Every time  I 
                        reach for the popcorn there’s not 
                        already a hand in the bag. Okay, 
                        I’ll call you from dinner. I’m 
                        taking myself to sushi.

           She hangs up the phone.   She turns to A COUPLE next to her.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Just so you know I’m not the sad 
                        girl going to the movies alone.  I 
                        am choosing to be alone as a way to 
                        remember that my best friend is me. 
                        Okay?  
           The couple gets up and moves seats.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Good, now I can spread out.

           INT. SUSHI BAR- LATER THAT NIGHT

           Amy sits in a sushi bar by herself, looking bored, drawing 
           pictures of sushi on her napkin. She tries to engage the 
           sushi chef, but he makes gestures like he does not speak 
           English even though he is not Japanese.

           INT. KATE AND AMY’S APARTMENT- HALLWAY- ANOTHER DAY

           As Kate leaves her apartment, in a judo outfit, she sees Amy 
           fumbling for the key to her apartment.  They look at each 
           other.

                                 KATE 
                             (curtly)
                        Amy.

                                 AMY
                             (looks at her outfit, 
                              laughs hard)
                        What a spaz.

                                 KATE
                             (ignores this)
                        I’d like my Nirvana t-shirt back.

                                 AMY
                        Our shirt?  Fine if you give me the 
                        party jeans.

                                 KATE
                        Fine.

           An OLD GUY who lives in the building waves to Amy.

                                 OLD GUY
                        How are you?

                                 AMY
                        Okay.

                                 OLD GUY
                        Good.  And how are you Kate?
                                 KATE
                        Actually, unbelievable.  I’m just 
                        on my way to judo class with my new 
                        unselfish amazing work friends.

                                 OLD GUY
                        How nice.

           Amy pipes in. 

                                 AMY
                        I know I said I’m just okay, Ruben.  
                        But I actually wasn’t finished with 
                        my answer.  What I meant was:  
                        “Okay, are you ready?  Because I am 
                        high on life and hopped up on 
                        possibilities.”

                                 KATE
                        Ruben.
                             (grabs the old man’s face)
                        Look at me! Did I tell you about 
                        how open-minded and independent my 
                        work and now life friends are?  

                                 AMY
                        Ruben, did you know that these 
                        groceries I am carrying are for a 
                        dinner I am making for a person who 
                        isn’t an uptight controlling bitch:  
                        me.

                                 KATE
                        Ruben, what I’ve been thinking 
                        about lately in life is how someone 
                        so completely co-dependent on 
                        someone for 10 years and who has no 
                        idea how to cook, can make dinner 
                        for themselves.  Let’s ponder that, 
                        shall we?

           Kate walks away, annoyed with the whole thing. Amy, 
           desperate, turns to the Old Guy.

                                 AMY 
                        So what are you doing for dinner?

           He walks away, she stands there, alone.
           INT. NICKS’S APARTMENT - ANOTHER NIGHT

           Amy and Nick, the guy from the college trust fall, stand in 
           her living room facing the TV. They hold tennis rackets and 
           mime hitting the ball while playing Wii tennis. Amy does a 
           fancy move while drinking a beer and holding the remote.

                                 AMY
                        Yes! Backhand shot, drinking a 
                        beer, turning up the volume! Suck 
                        it!

           Nick goes behind the couch, climbs over it while swinging and 
           singing “Like a Virgin.”

                                 NICK
                        Over the couch, reverse backhand, 
                        singing Madonna. Game, set, match, 
                        suck that!

                                 AMY
                        Damn you.

                                 NICK
                        I’m sorry. I’m just that good.

           Nick goes over to his computer. Amy lights a joint.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Yes! I just sold my belt buckle for 
                        25 bucks. Hello, sweet lady rent.

                                 AMY
                        Selling your old crap on Ebay might 
                        be an even cooler job than temping. 
                        I should get into it.

                                 NICK
                        It’s more challenging than you 
                        might think.

                                 AMY
                        Really?

           Nick joins her on the couch and takes a hit of the joint.

                                 NICK
                        No.

           She laughs.
                                 AMY 
                        See? This is awesome.  I knew it 
                        was a good idea to call you.
                        I just mean, hanging with dudes. 
                        Who needs Kate, right? Women are 
                        crazy. I mean, I don’t need to 
                        spend all day talking about 
                        emotions. 

                                 NICK
                        Isn’t that kind of what you are 
                        doing right now?

           Amy’s not even really listening to him.

                                 AMY
                        Exactly! And that’s why I am 
                        writing off girls. No more girls as 
                        friends. 
                             (she gestures to herself, 
                              then Nick)
                        This is good. This is simple. You 
                        don’t judge me if I forget to pay 
                        some bills that result in the loss 
                        of power and or telephone service, 
                        or drop a piece of pizza behind the 
                        TV until maggots develop.

                                 NICK
                        No, I do not. I forgot my brother’s 
                        wedding.

                                 AMY
                        And I don’t judge you for that. 
                        God, this is so refreshing. This is 
                        how friendship should be.

           They toast. 

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        You want another beer, pal?

                                 NICK
                        I don’t not want another one, chum.

           We FOLLOW Amy into the kitchen.   She gets a couple of beers 
           from the fridge, then goes back into the living room. NICK IS 
           COMPLETELY NAKED.

                                 AMY
                        Oh god, what are you doing?
                                 NICK
                        What?

                                 AMY
                        Why are you naked?  What is 
                        happening?

                                 NICK
                        I just assumed we were going to 
                        have sex.

                                 AMY
                        Why? Why? Why would you assume 
                        that? We were just talking about 
                        how we were such good friends. Put 
                        on some pants.

           She throws him his pants. He starts to put them on.

                                 NICK
                        Yeah, exactly. Then one of us 
                        offers the other one a massage and 
                        the rest is history.

                                 AMY
                        No. No. No. I need a friend. That’s 
                        the whole point!  

           INT. OFFICE - A FEW DAYS LATER

           Amy is in the break room, talking to a CO-WORKER who is 
           pouring coffee into her mug. Amy is going through the fridge.

                                 AMY
                        Can you believe that? I mean, I 
                        don’t even get how he got his pants 
                        off so fast.  

                                 CO-WORKER
                        So how long did it take you to get 
                        him out of your house?

                                 AMY
                        Oh, I kicked him out right after we 
                        had sex.

                                 CO-WORKER
                        You had sex with him?

           Amy pulls out a pudding marked “DAVE” and starts to eat it, 
           moving away from the fridge. 
                                 AMY
                             (matter-of-fact)
                        Yeah, it was pretty good, actually.  
                        But I don’t think a guy is good 
                        best friend material.  Unless he’s 
                        disgusting or you’re disgusting, 
                        sex will always get in the way.

           In the background, Dave is searching through the fridge for 
           his pudding.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Want to go to lunch?

                                 CO-WORKER
                        You seem nice, but I have a 
                        personal rule about not hanging out 
                        with temps.  Sorry.  One of them 
                        stole my identity last year.  

                                 AMY
                             (sad)
                        Oh.  Okay.

           Amy sadly finishes her pudding as the Co-worker leaves.

           INT. AMY’S PARENT’S APARTMENT - DAY 

           Amy opens the door to her parent’s apartment and finds her 
           mother, CAROL, putting on lipstick and ready to go out.

                                 CAROL
                             (startled)
                        What are you doing here?

           Amy comes in and immediately starts talking.  

                                 AMY
                             (depressed)
                        Hey, Mom, I’ve been thinking about 
                        this me and Kate stuff, you know.  
                        I know this is the best thing. For 
                        both of us. I wish her well.

                                 CAROL
                        That’s great. And generous. And 
                        it’s okay not to feel great and 
                        generous, you know. You can be 
                        pissed.  
                             (then)
                        Now go take a walk and digest that.
           She shuttles Amy towards the door.

                                 AMY
                        Mom, I know I can be pissed. I’m 
                        not one of your patients. Please 
                        don’t tell me to feel my feelings.

                                 CAROL
                        I don’t “tell” people to do 
                        anything, Ames. I help “lead” 
                        people to the answers they already 
                        have.
                             (beat)
                        Now go home and think about this 
                        stuff.  Maybe go visit Nana.  No 
                        one’s checked in on her this week.  
                        That would be nice.  Okay?

           Amy gives Carol a weirded out look.  Carol starts to push Amy 
           towards the door.

                                 CAROL (CONT'D)
                        We’ll talk about it later.  Now, 
                        please, I’m trying to get ready to 
                        go out.  

                                 AMY
                        Oh, okay, where are you going?

                                 CAROL
                        Out.

                                 AMY
                        Yeah, I figured. Where?

                                 CAROL
                        Does it matter? I’m old. Who cares?

                                 AMY
                        Why are you being weird?

                                 CAROL
                        Why are YOU being weird?

                                 Amy
                        Wow, they teach you that in shrink 
                        school?

           Carol looks at her watch, then shuttles Amy towards the door 
           again.
                                 CAROL
                        You better leave now.  Your father 
                        and I may want to make love.

                                 AMY
                        Uch.  

           The buzzer rings.  Carol answers it.

                                 CAROL
                        Hello?

                                 DOORMAN (O.S.)
                        Kate Reid is coming up, Mrs. 
                        Grossman.

                                 AMY
                        Kate’s here?

           Carol comes clean.

                                 CAROL
                        Oh, fine, yes.  I’m having coffee 
                        with Kate.

                                 AMY
                        WHAT?

                                 CAROL
                        Don’t have an overreaction. Kate 
                        has been in my life for years. Now 
                        we’re both in the medical field. I 
                        can’t abandon her just because you 
                        have. 

                                 AMY
                        She abandoned me!

                                 CAROL
                        Kate actually said she thought this 
                        was a good thing for both of you.  
                        I didn’t know she was waking you up 
                        and picking out your clothes for 
                        you in the morning.  That’s not 
                        emotionally healthy.

                                 AMY
                        I can’t believe this.

                                 CAROL
                        You just said you wanted her to be 
                        happy.
                                 AMY
                        Well, that was a lie. Obviously. 
                        Jesus, you’re a shrink. You should 
                        pick up on that.

           The doorbell rings and Carol opens it.  Kate hugs her.

                                 KATE
                        So good to see you!

           She stops hugging Carol when she sees Amy glaring at her.

                                 CAROL
                        Amy stopped by unannounced.

                                 AMY
                        Nice mother!  I am going to see 
                        someone who actually cares about 
                        me.

                                 CAROL
                        It would be great if that person 
                        was your Nana.

                                 AMY
                        Well too bad.  It isn’t!

           Amy storms out.

           INT. YONKERS- NANA’S NURSING HOME- DINING ROOM - DAY

           Amy helps a very old lady, NANA, push her walker into the 
           dining room of a nursing home.

                                 AMY 
                        Remember the talks we used to have 
                        when I was little, Nana?

                                 NANA
                        No.  I remember you were messy and 
                        watched a lot of TV.

                                 AMY
                        You’re so funny.
                             (leans her head on Nana)
                        I’ve been kind of lonely lately 
                        without Kate.  

                                 NANA
                        You need to find someone new.
                                 AMY
                        No no.  It’s too soon.  I’m not 
                        ready.  I’m--

                                 NANA 
                             (interrupts)
                        Oh my!  Look at who is also eating 
                        their lunch.

           Amy looks and sees another very old lady and a woman Amy’s 
           age, RACHEL (Rachel Dratch) are sitting at a table eating 
           lunch.  

                                 NANA (CONT'D)
                             (feigning surprise)
                        What a surprise.  It’s Ada and her 
                        granddaughter, Rachel.  Ada tells 
                        me Rachel has been in graduate 
                        school for so long and doesn’t have 
                        any girl friends.

                                 RACHEL’S GRANDMA
                        It’s true.

                                 RACHEL
                        Grandma!

                                 NANA
                        This is my granddaughter, Amy.  Her 
                        best friend didn’t want to be 
                        friends with her anymore.  Said she 
                        was too needy.
                             (to Amy)
                        She said needy, right?  Oh no.  It 
                        was co-dependent.  That’s right.

                                 AMY
                        Nana!  Please.  
                             (explains to the women)
                        It was more of a mutual break.

                                 RACHEL’S GRANDMA
                        Please sit with us.  We happen to 
                        have two open seats which is a 
                        complete coincidence.  Sit.

                                 NANA
                        I think we will.

           Nana and Amy sit.  They whisper to each other.
                                 NANA (CONT'D)
                        You said you were lonely.  And I 
                        never liked Kate.  Rachel will be 
                        good for you.

                                 AMY
                        I can’t believe you’re setting me 
                        up.

           Amy looks over at Rachel.  They smile at each other 
           awkwardly. 

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        This is embarrassing.

                                 RACHEL
                        I know.  Hey, I like your bracelet.

           Amy smiles.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NANA’S NURSING HOME DINING ROOM- LATER

           CLOSE ON Amy and Rachel having a great time talking.

                                 AMY 
                        ... I cannot believe I actually 
                        like you. When I saw you sitting 
                        there I was like, she looks like 
                        the biggest loser I’ve ever seen.  

                                 RACHEL
                        And I was like, she’s wearing a 
                        vest.  Okay, who in their right 
                        mind wears a vest?  How do I talk 
                        to this person who is wearing a 
                        vest?  Am I like: What up, Vest 
                        Person?

                                 AMY
                        It was because my Nana made it for 
                        me.  Oooh, sorry, Nana.

           She looks over at her Nana.  PULL BACK and see... The dining 
           room is cleared out. Rachel and Amy have been talking for the 
           whole lunch service.  The two grandmothers are almost asleep.

                                 NANA
                        I need a nap.
                                 RACHEL’S GRANDMA
                        I as well.

                                 AMY
                        Yes.  Totally.  Grandmothers.  Go 
                        take naps.  

           The grandmas walk off.

                                 RACHEL
                        You want to come over some time.  
                        Rent DVDs.  Order take out.

                                 AMY
                        Sure.  Yes.  When?

                                 RACHEL
                             (looks at her watch)
                        Uh... how about a quarter to... 
                        now?  

                                 AMY
                        Let’s go.

           INT. RACHEL’S APARTMENT- NIGHT

           Rachel and Amy hang out and drink beers and talk.  They are 
           both getting pretty drunk and having fun talking.

                                 AMY
                        ... and I thought I didn’t need a 
                        best friend, but it turns out being 
                        a lone wolf is actually lonely not 
                        just wolf-like.  

                                 RACHEL
                        I know.  In 9th grade my best 
                        friend frenched our science teacher 
                        and I told everyone and she hated 
                        me forever, but it was true so why 
                        am I the one who suffers?
                             (then)
                        So basically Kate left you for a 
                        guy? 

                                 AMY
                        I mean it was a bunch of stuff, but 
                        when Tom and her got serious that’s 
                        when it all fell apart.  
                                 RACHEL 
                        Ditching you for a dude?  That is 
                        so like anti-woman.  

                                 AMY 
                        I know, right? 

                                 RACHEL
                        Yes.  She might as well stomp on 
                        everything our forewomen ever tried 
                        to do for us.  She might as well 
                        kick Gloria Steinem in the ovaries.

                                 AMY
                        Exactly.  

                                 RACHEL
                        She might as well take a bunch of 
                        bras and un-burn them.  

                                 AMY
                        Yeah!
                             (thinks)
                        I can’t really visualize that.  But 
                        I get it.

           Amy takes another beer, opens it and starts to drink.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        You’re so great, Rachel.  I mean 
                        the odds of my Nana setting me up 
                        with a friend and me actually 
                        getting along with her are so 
                        astronomical. Nana can be really 
                        pushy sometimes. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I know.  Sometimes my grandma can 
                        be a total fucking cunt.

           Amy stops, weirded out.  She tries to roll with it.

                                 AMY
                        Oh... uh, yeah, uh, so can mine.

           Rachel finishes another beer.

                                 RACHEL
                        I wish a nurse would shove a turd 
                        down her throat while she was 
                        sleeping. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RACHEL (CONT'D)
                        Then I’d never have to hear her 
                        miserable whiny voice again.  You 
                        know?  

                                 AMY
                        Uh... yeah. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Oooh, I have an idea.  Let’s go to 
                        a liquor store and get stuff to 
                        make blue Hawaiis!  Fun!

           Rachel grabs her purse.  Amy follows her out the door.

           EXT. YONKERS 7-11- LATER THAT NIGHT

           Rachel and Amy exit the store carrying bags. There are some 
           NINTH GRADE GUYS hanging out in the front with their skate 
           boards. 

                                 AMY
                        You are acting way different than 
                        you did at lunch.

                                 RACHEL 
                        I am greater than ever.  I took 
                        five of my grandma’s pain killers. 
                        That beer really jump started those 
                        little bitches.

           Rachel makes the sound of an engine revving. The teens, JOEL 
           AND LEW, check out Rachel and Amy as they walk by.

                                 TEENS
                        Hot old chicks.

                                 RACHEL
                        You shorties talking about us?

                                 AMY
                        Oh god.  No.

                                 LEW
                        Who wants to know?

                                 RACHEL
                        Just a hot old chick with a pocket 
                        full of some drugs.

                                 JOEL
                        No shit?  Really?
                                 RACHEL
                        You want in?

                                 LEW
                        Yeah, the money’s back at my house.  

                                 RACHEL
                        Right on right on.  Hop in, men.

           As Lew and Joel go strap their bikes to the back of Rachel’s 
           car, Amy talks to Rachel privately.

                                 AMY
                        Listen, I’ve had a really good time 
                        with you, but I probably should get 
                        going.

                                 RACHEL
                        No!  I have never had so much fun 
                        with a friend.
                             (starts to get choked up)
                        I took a bunch of Grandma’s pain 
                        killers so why am I still in pain?  
                        Is it because emotional pain cannot 
                        be killed?

                                 AMY
                        I really should probably get going.

                                 RACHEL
                        Are you a mean person?  Because a 
                        mean person would leave a sad 
                        person.  That is what a mean person 
                        would do.

           Amy feels guilty.

                                 AMY
                        Okay, I guess I’ll stick around for 
                        a little while.  

           Rachel unlocks the doors to her car.  

                                 RACHEL
                        Who wants shot gun?

           As Amy gets into the back seat, Rachel whispers to her.

                                 RACHEL (CONT'D)
                        I’m gonna sell them my grandma’s 
                        anti-seizure medication. I would 
                        never give them the good stuff. 
                        Suckers.
           INT. JOEL’S ROOM-  LATER THAT NIGHT

           A teenage boy’s room with pictures from Maxim plastered to 
           the wall and video game stuff everywhere.  Rachel and Lew 
           make out on an unmade twin bed.  Amy sits with Joel at his 
           computer, critiquing his MySpace page. 

                                 AMY
                        Why is this the picture you have 
                        up?  No offense, but you look 
                        crazy.  It’s not flattering at all.

                                 JOEL
                        But I look pimp.

                                 AMY
                        Using slang makes you sound dumb.  
                        Just so you know.

           Rachel pushes Lew away and calls out to Amy.

                                 RACHEL
                        Amy!  I just found out I graduated 
                        from junior high on Lew’s birthday.  
                        I mean the actual day he was born.  
                        Isn’t that cool?
                             (to Lew)
                        You have condoms right?

                                 AMY
                        Rachel!  

                                 RACHEL
                             (snaps)
                        Be cool.

                                 LEW
                        My dad gave me some.  My parents 
                        broke up.  Now he says he’s a 
                        player.  So embarrassing.  

           Lew reaches into his back pocket and pulls out his wallet, 
           then a condom.  Amy is horrified.

                                 AMY
                        Rachel, I’m going to the bathroom.

                                 RACHEL
                        Leave your shoes so I know you 
                        won’t ditch me.  
           EXT. JOEL’S HOUSE- NIGHT

           Amy, barefoot, runs for her life down the darkened streets of 
           Yonkers.

           INT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL- THAT NIGHT

           Kate walks with Roxanna.

                                 KATE
                        ... so you really think I have 
                        chief resident locked?  

                                 ROXANNA 
                        Kate.  Calm down.  You are wasting 
                        energy. 

                                 KATE
                        So that means you really think I 
                        could get this?  Like really?  Or 
                        like really really?

                                 ROXANNA
                        Haven’t you checked the betting 
                        pool Jesse’s running? Your odds are 
                        even right now.  How much could 
                        change in 2 weeks?

                                 KATE
                        I’m sorry.  Tom is so wrapped up 
                        with talking about honeymoon places 
                        and wedding stuff, he won’t indulge 
                        me.  Am I being annoying and 
                        obsessive about this chief resident 
                        thing?  Do I talk about it too 
                        much?

                                 ROXANNA
                             (yes)
                        No, not at all but just know if I 
                        looked spaced out when you talk 
                        about it, it’s just the way I 
                        process information and it does not 
                        mean you are boring me.  It’s just 
                        the way my face falls sometimes.

                                 KATE
                        Oh, okay.  Good.
           Kate and Roxanna look down at the end of the hallway.  Kate 
           is surprised when she SEES AMY.  Amy looks horrible, haggard, 
           dirty and still barefoot from her night in Yonkers. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                             (to Roxanna)
                        See you later.

           Roxanna walks away.  Kate approaches Amy.

                                 AMY
                             (awkward)
                        Hey, sorry to bother you.  I knew 
                        you were working the night shift.

                                 KATE
                        Yeah?  So what’s up?

                                 AMY
                        Want to have coffee?  Or like sushi 
                        or something?

                                 KATE
                        What?  No. I’m working.

                                 AMY
                        Forever?

                                 KATE 
                        Of course not.  But I just don’t 
                        think it’s a good idea.  We’ve 
                        talked about this.  I have to go 
                        back to work.

           Kate is halfway down the hall.  Amy really doesn’t want her 
           to leave.  She calls out to Kate.

                                 AMY
                        I have an illness.

           Kate turns around.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        I’m really really sick.  And it’s 
                        bad...  I’m talking about the Big 
                        C.

                                 KATE
                        Chlamydia?

                                 AMY
                        No. Cancer.
           Kate, shocked, stares at her, then leads her into a storage 
           room.

           INT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL- STORAGE ROOM- CONTINUOUS

           Kate leads Amy inside the storage room.  The shelves are 
           filled with hospital supplies. It is empty.

                                 KATE
                        When did you get the diagnosis?  

                                 AMY 
                        That’s not important.  I was 
                        getting bad sore throats and then 
                        all of a sudden: ka-boom!  So I 
                        wanted you to be with me all the 
                        time because we laugh together and 
                        people say that laughter is the 
                        best medicine and if they are alive 
                        to say it then it’s got to be true, 
                        right?

                                 KATE
                        Okay, just calm down.  Now what  
                        kind of cancer did the doctor say 
                        it is?

                                 AMY
                        Oh, you know, just like an all over 
                        cancer. Like a general cancer-y 
                        kind of Barbara Hershey “Beaches” 
                        kind of cancer.

           Now Kate realizes she is lying.  She starts rummaging around 
           the storage room as they talk.  

                                 KATE 
                        You know, there was this visiting 
                        physician here who recently told me 
                        the most touching story about these 
                        kids in Wisconsin or India or 
                        something and one of the kids in 
                        their class got cancer and to show 
                        support for him, they...

           Kate TAKES A PAIR OF ELECTRIC CLIPPERS OUT OF A STORAGE BIN.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        ...all shaved their heads.  You’re 
                        going to lose your hair anyway.  
                        Let’s get it over with.
           Amy is surprised.  Kate plugs in the clippers and they start 
           to buzz.

                                 AMY
                        That’s such a nice offer, but I 
                        don’t want you to have to shave 
                        your head. I’ll be brave.

           Kate is really challenging her now.

                                 KATE
                        Don’t be brave on my account.

           Amy has no choice but move closer to Kate and the clippers.

                                 AMY 
                        Just a little off the top, ha ha.

           Kate turns on the buzzers and starts to shave off a piece 
           from the back of Amy’s hair.

                                 KATE
                        Wow, this is going to take years to 
                        grow back.

           Kate holds up the big chunk of hair in front of Amy’s face.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Now let’s do the front.

           Amy leaps away from her.

                                 AMY 
                        Okay! I don’t have cancer!  I lied!

                                 KATE
                        I know! I’m a doctor, dumb-ass.

                                 AMY
                        I was desperate!  I miss you.  

           Kate pauses for a moment.  

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        And to be fair, I actually do have 
                        a sinus thing that isn’t especially 
                        comfortable.  If I had health 
                        insurance I would probably go to a 
                        hospital so that counts, right?

           Kate walks away.  Amy yells after her.
                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Fine.  Go save lives or whatever 
                        you and your new friends do.

                                 KATE 
                        Okay.  You know why my new friends 
                        are so great?  Because they don’t 
                        pretend they have cancer!

           Kate, angry, leaves Amy alone in the storage closet.

           INT. KATE’S APARTMENT- DAYS LATER

           Tom watches as Kate puts a pink satin ballerina looking 
           outfit on Lady Girl and rants about Amy.

                                 KATE
                        ... I mean it was the lamest lie 
                        I’ve ever heard.

                                 TOM
                             (re: Lady Girl’s outfit)
                        What is she wearing? She looks like 
                        a Romanian gymnast.

                                 KATE
                        It’s for Roxanna’s dog’s birthday 
                        party. 

                                 TOM
                        Right, of course.  
                             (then)
                        Hey sweetie, my mom called.  She 
                        said you never called her back 
                        about the rehearsal dinner color 
                        scheme and--

           Kate, not listening, interrupts.

                                 KATE
                        Now I am free to be friends with 
                        Roxanna and the work gang without 
                        feeling guilty all the time.  
                        People who are like me.  It’s math.  
                        It just makes sense.

                                 TOM 
                        But babe, maybe Amy--

                                 KATE
                        She pretended to have a fatal 
                        illness, Tom. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        She didn’t even do any research.  
                        How hard is it to look up “cancer” 
                        on Wikipedia and have her facts 
                        ready? I can’t deal with her 
                        anymore.  I’m not in college where 
                        that stuff is funny.

                                 TOM
                        I don’t think it’s funny and you 
                        know I know funny.
                             (changes the subject)
                        So when you call my Mom about the 
                        rehearsal dinner--

                                 KATE
                        -- at least I have Roxanna now.  It 
                        feels good to have a woman I can 
                        talk to again.

           Tom is clearly getting annoyed at Kate.

                                 TOM
                             (dryly)
                        You can cross “find a new best 
                        friend” off your “things to do” 
                        list.

                                 KATE
                             (laughs)
                        That’s not on my list.
                             (beat)
                        I can’t lie.  It is.

           Kate kisses Tom goodbye, then leaves.

           INT. KATE AND AMY’S APARTMENT- HALLWAY- CONTINUOUS

           Kate and Lady Girl walk by Amy’s apartment.  Amy, HER HAIR 
           COVERED IN A WOOL SKI CAP that is pulled menacingly low over 
           her forehead, glares at them as they walk by her door. (Note: 
           After the hair shaving Amy is seen in different hats, hair 
           extensions, anything to try and cover up the shaved patch.)

           INT. AMY’S APARTMENT- NIGHT

           Amy and Nick are in bed together, post sex.  She is still 
           wearing the wool ski cap.

                                 NICK
                        Take off the hat.
                                 AMY
                        No way.

                                 NICK
                        You look pretty like a sexy bald 
                        lady.

           Amy takes the hat off. She has a tiny bald patch. Nick says 
           nothing.  He is trying hard not to laugh.

                                 AMY 
                        Shut up.

           Nick kisses her and then hops out of bed.

                                 NICK
                        I’ve got to get up.

                                 AMY 
                        Checking your auctions, Ebay Titan?

                                 NICK
                        No, I um, have a date. Is that 
                        weird?

           It is kind of weird.

                                 AMY
                        What? No. Why would it be weird? 
                        It’s not at all strange or unusual 
                        or unexpected.

                                 NICK
                        Because you said you didn’t want 
                        anything more. But if you don’t 
                        want me to go I won’t.

                                 AMY
                        Go. Date it up. Go forth and 
                        fornicate.

                                 NICK
                        Cool. Okay, I’ll see you later.

           He puts on his pants and leaves.  The door closes.  Amy takes 
           out Tales Of Two Cities, ready to work, then immediately 
           falls asleep as soon as the book is opened.

           INT. ROXANNA’S APARTMENT- DAY

           A nice looking loft. OTHER DOG OWNERS and their fancily-clad 
           Chihuahuas wander around. 
           There is a big cake with a photograph of the birthday boy 
           sniffing his own balls that says:  “Have a ball on your 
           birthday, Waffles!” As Kate and Lady Girl arrive, Roxanna 
           runs up to greet them.

                                 ROXANNA
                        Hey!  You’re here.  And she’s 
                        wearing the outfit.  That’s great.  
                        Everyone.  Kate’s here. And this is 
                        that divine LadyGirl.

           The other dog party guests call out greetings and ooh an ah 
           over LadyGirl.

                                 DOG BIRTHDAY PARTY GUESTS
                        Hi, Kate!/ Good to see you!/ Try 
                        the mojitos./ Love the outfit!

           Kate puts her dog on the ground and Lady Girl trots off to 
           play with the other dogs.  Kate follows Roxanna to the 
           kitchen. 

                                 ROXANNA 
                        So, how’s it going?

                                 KATE
                        You mean in the 18 minutes since I 
                        spoke to you on the phone?

           Roxanna and Kate laugh. 

                                 ROXANNA
                        I’m so glad you’re here.  It was 
                        getting so boring without you.  I 
                        love Ellen, but all she talks about 
                        is work.  I’m sick of it.

                                 KATE
                        All you and I talk about is work.

                                 ROXANNA
                        That’s so true!  But she talks to 
                        me like I’m her patient and I’m 
                        like hello, I went to med school 
                        too, Show Off slash Know It All.  
                        Everything’s more fun with you.  
                        Everyone loves you.  Everyone’s 
                        like, Tom I would totally nail your 
                        fiancee if you weren’t our 
                        supervisor.
                                 KATE
                             (excited)
                        Really?  I’m the fun one?  I’m 
                        never the fun one.  

                                 ROXANNA
                        Why would we call someone Fun Kate 
                        who isn’t fun?

                                 KATE
                        You call me Fun Kate? You don’t 
                        think I’m controlling?

                                 ROXANNA
                        You totally are. That’s what makes 
                        you fun. It’s like how people call 
                        me “Slutty Roxanna.”

                                 KATE
                        I didn’t know you knew about that.

                                 ROXANNA
                        Yeah, I made it up.  

           A DOG OWNER holding a Chihuahua dressed in a tiny tuxedo 
           walks by. Roxanna grabs her.

                                 ROXANNA (CONT’D)
                        Kate, this is Alice. I’ve totally 
                        been wanting you guys to meet.

           Kate sticks out her hand to meet the owner. The Dog Owner 
           grabs her dog’s paw and sticks it out for Kate to shake.

                                 DOG OWNER
                             (in fake doggie voice)
                        I’m Alice. This is my owner, 
                        Jessica.

                                 KATE
                        Oh, sorry. Nice tux.

                                 ROXANNA
                        Alice is always overdressed. It’s 
                        her thing.

                                 DOG OWNER
                        She picked this out by herself, I 
                        was like “okay, but it’s just a 
                        birthday party.”

           The Dog Owner walks away. Kate looks a little weirded out, 
           but shakes it off. 
           Roxanna drags Kate up to BRETT, a gay man with a Chihuahua 
           strapped to him in a Baby Bjorn with the tail cut out.  Brett 
           also holds a piece of cake.

                                 BRETT
                             (to the dog)
                        Yes, I know you want cake but 
                        you’re lactose intolerant and we’ve 
                        been over this.

                                 ROXANNA
                        Kate. This is Brett.

                                 BRETT
                        Nice to meet you.
                             (Re: his dog)
                        This is Colin. He’s adopted. 

           Roxanna drags her away again. Then past a WOMAN WITH A BABY.

                                 ROXANNA
                        That’s Alana. Don’t even bother. 
                        She just had a baby and I swear it 
                        is ALL SHE TALKS ABOUT. I’m like, 
                        if I have to hear the word Bugaboo 
                        again I’m going to kill myself!
                             (then, to a dog, using a 
                              baby voice)
                        Hello, Muffintop, don’t you look 
                        handsome today.

                                 KATE
                        I can’t believe you have all of 
                        these friends who have Chihuahuas.

                                 ROXANNA
                        I can’t believe you don’t. Half the 
                        fun of having a Chi is the 
                        community. Or, as I like to call 
                        it, “Chi-munity.”

                                 KATE
                        This is really nice. I just mean, 
                        adults finding things they have in 
                        common and meeting to share those 
                        things.

           Their conversation is interrupted by shouts and barking.

                                 DOG BIRTHDAY PARTY GUESTS
                        Oooh it’s disgusting!/ I feel 
                        nauseous!/  Roxanna!
           Kate and Roxanna race into the living room.  A crowd of 
           guests stand aghast as all the MALE DOGS IN THE PARTY RUN A 
           TRAIN ON LADY GIRL.

                                 KATE
                        No!  Bad dogs!

           Kate PUSHES the birthday boy, ROXANNA’S DOG Waffles off of 
           Lady Girl and grabs her wounded little chihuahua.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Oh my god! Lady Girl!

                                 ROXANNA
                        Kate!  Don’t fucking slap my dog!

           The room silences a bit at this abrupt outburst.

                                 KATE
                        Whoa, whoa, okay. Just calm down. 

           Roxanna is really mad now.

                                 ROXANNA
                        I’m calm.  Just keep your fucking 
                        hands off Waffles.

                                 KATE
                        Okay, listen, could you stop saying 
                        fucking to me? I was just trying to 
                        save my dog from being raped by 
                        your dog.

                                 JESSICA
                        Don’t joke about rape. It’s really 
                        dangerous to throw that word 
                        around, Kate.  Some girl did that 
                        to my brother at college.  It can 
                        be really destructive. 

                                 KATE
                        Well, I’m sorry, but I don’t think 
                        Lady Girl consented to a gang bang 
                        party train style.

                                 ROXANNA
                        I don’t know.  In that outfit.

                                 KATE
                        Well, you would know, “Slutty 
                        Roxanna”.
                                 ROXANNA
                        Take your fucking dog and get out 
                        of my house, Un Fun. And for the 
                        rec, everyone IS sick of you 
                        talking about being Chief Resident. 
                        Other things are interesting in 
                        this world, like, for example, 
                        Darfur, now get your slut dog out 
                        of here so our Chi’s can party!

           Kate is startled. She looks around for support but everyone 
           is clearly on Roxanna’s side.

                                 KATE
                        Really?

                                 WORK FRIENDS
                        It’s true./ She’s right./ If I hear 
                        about Chief again I will rip my 
                        ears off my head.

           Sadly, Kate and Lady Girl leave the party.

                                                                CUT TO:

           “NO BEST FRIEND” MONTAGE:

           MUSIC UP: “YOU’VE GOT A FRIEND” by James Taylor.

           Kate and Amy separately walk through the streets of New York.  
           Everywhere they go they are reminded on the friend they lost:

           -  Amy sees 12 year old girl best friends sneaking their 
           first cigarette.

           - Kate notices 28 year old young woman best friends tell each 
           other how great their butts look in their jeans and assure 
           each other they are not fat.

           - Amy walks by old lady best friends feeding croissants to 
           the birds.

           - Kate envies the tiny baby best friends on the swings in the 
           park while their Mommy best friends push them.

           Amy can’t take it anymore.  They are everywhere.  She walks 
           faster and faster down the streets until finally she reaches 
           her apartment building and darts inside.

           A few moments later we see Kate, stressed out, entering the 
           apartment building too.
           INT. AMY’S APARTMENT- CONTINUOUS

           Amy, now a little more calm, relaxes on her couch.  She turns 
           on the TV.  Oprah.  

                                 AMY
                             (relieved)
                        Oprah.  You always cheer me up.

           ON T.V.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Two best friends take a trip unlike 
                        you’ve ever seen.... Welcome to 
                        Oprah and Gayle’s Road Trip!

           We see Oprah and her best friend Gayle driving together and 
           having a good natured argument.

           ON AMY

           As Oprah and Gayle have fun, she looks completely miserable.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           Kate is also miserably watching Oprah and Gayle’s road trip.

           INT. TOM’S LOFT/ INT. NICK’S APARTMENT- NIGHT

           A SEQUENCE INTERCUT between the two apartments as Kate and 
           Amy both get their AN EVITE IN THEIR E-MAIL INBOXES: There is 
           a picture of her friend Sarah’s head on Angelina Jolie’s body 
           with her arm around Brad Pitt.  It reads:  “YOU ARE INVITED 
           TO SARAH’S ANNUAL BIRTHDAY BASH!”

                                 KATE
                        Shit!

                        What?

                                 KATE 
                        It’s the first friend get together 
                        since Amy and I stopped being 
                        friends.

                        We always go to this thing together 
                        no matter who we’re dating.  It’s a 
                        friend tradition. I have to bring 
                        someone impressive.  I’ve got to 
                        show her I’ve moved on.

           Amy lies in bed next to Nick, on her laptop, talking to him.

                                 AMY
                        Did you ever notice that E-vite is 
                        only two letters away from E-vil?

                                 NICK
                        I don’t understand why you are so 
                        upset. I’ll go with you to the 
                        party.

                                 AMY
                        I can’t take you to the party, 
                        you’re already invited. You won’t 
                        bug Kate. She expects to see you 
                        there. You don’t count. I need to 
                        bring someone who will drive her 
                        insane. So she realizes just how 
                        much I don’t need her.

                        Someone who will really make her 
                        crazy. So she realizes what a jerk 
                        she is. Someone who will really 
                        kill her.

           She paces around her apartment.

           Amy has moved on. She is calm and now EATING A SANDWICH.  

           END SEQUENCE.

           EXT. SARAH’S HOUSE - A FEW NIGHTS LATER

           A fancy building on the Upper West Side. Amy gets out of a 
           cab followed by RACHEL, HER NANA’S SET UP.  YES, SHE IS THAT 
           DESPERATE.  Rachel chatters away to Amy.
                                 RACHEL
                        ... and I told my grandma, “Bitch, 
                        Amy is my friend. She would never 
                        ditch me.”  and she was all like, 
                        “I don’t care.  Did you forge my 
                        signature and cash my social 
                        security checks?” and I was like--

                                 AMY 
                        That’s great, Rachel.  Thanks for 
                        helping me out. 

                                 RACHEL
                        That’s what friends do.  And 
                        friends also share their dad’s back 
                        medication with friends, right 
                        Ames?

                                 AMY
                             (annoyed)
                        Here.  I know the deal.

           Amy gives Rachel a couple of pills from a prescription 
           bottle.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        But please don’t take too many at 
                        the party.  And don’t feel pressure 
                        to talk much.  I’m just going to 
                        tell everyone we are really good 
                        friends.

                                 RACHEL
                        Which is the truth with God as my 
                        witness even though He has done 
                        nothing for me in this life.

           Amy turns to enter the party.

           INT. SARAH’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Amy circulates, Rachel right behind her.

                                 RACHEL
                        Where am I?  Every guy here looks 
                        like a narc.

                             (snaps)
                        No one’s a narc.
           Nick runs up to Amy and Rachel.

                                 NICK
                        Hey, listen, I have to talk to you--

                                 AMY
                        Dude, I’m fine. I’ve got my old pal 
                        Rachel here. I’m mature. It’s cool. 
                        Meet Rachel.

           Nick puts out his hand to shake Rachel’s.

                                 NICK
                        I’m Nick.

                        What?  

                                 AMY
                        Rachel. I told you not to talk.

                             (to Nick)
                        If you are a cop and you don’t fess 
                        up then it is entrapment and none 
                        of this can be submitted as 
                        evidence.

                        Shut up or no pills.

           Nick grabs Amy’s arm and pulls her away, calling back to 
           Rachel.

                                 NICK 
                        I really have to show Amy 
                        something.  We’ll be back.
                             (to Amy)
                        Get mentally prepped.  There’s 
                        something I have to show you and 
                        you may freak out.

           Nick points out Kate. She is laughing with someone we can 
           only see from the back. The person turns and we see IT IS KIM 
           GOLD, KATE’S CLINGY ROOMMATE FROM COLLEGE.
                                 AMY 
                        Holy fuck! She didn’t.

           Sarah and Lara walk up.  They look from Kim and Kate and Amy

                                 SARAH
                        This is bad.

                        Amy, you’re getting all red.  Your 
                        face looks like a raw side of beef.  
                        Look at her, you guys.

                        Ames, please don’t flip out.

                        I’m not going to flip out. I’m a 
                        grown-up.

           Amy walks up to Kim, smiling at Kate. Kate smiles coldly.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Hello, Kate, Kim, how nice it is to 
                        see you. How have you been? I can’t 
                        wait to catch up. Have you met my 
                        great friend Rachel.

           Amy puts her arm around Rachel.  Kim turns around and WE SEE 
           SHE IS WEARING THE OLD AND PERFECTLY WORN-IN NIRVANA T-SHIRT 
           THAT AMY TRADED WITH KATE EARLIER.

                        Why the hell is Kim Gold wearing 
                        our shirt?

                                 KATE
                        It’s my shirt. You’re wearing the 
                        party jeans!

           Amy turns to Kim Gold.

                                 AMY
                        The shirt, give it.

                                 KATE
                        Okay, can you calm down? It’s not 
                        even your shirt.

                                 KIM GOLD
                        Are you guys talking about this old 
                        ratty thing? Would it even fit you, 
                        no offense?

                                 AMY
                        Give it!

                                 KATE
                        Calm down, okay. People are 
                        staring.

           Amy looks around.  Everyone is staring at them.

                                 AMY
                        Just give me my shirt.

                                 KATE
                        You can’t have the shirt. It’s mine 
                        and I’m letting Kim wear it. So 
                        deal with it.

           Amy grabs the sleeve of the shirt.

                                 AMY
                        It’s my shirt.
           Kate grabs the other sleeve.

                                 KATE
                        No, it’s not. It’s my shirt. 

           Amy tugs on Kim Gold’s sleeve harder.

                                 AMY
                        Mine.

           Kate tugs even harder. Kim Gold is starting to get shoved 
           around a bit. They keep pulling.

                                 KATE
                        You wish. You said I could have 
                        your half six years ago. You have 
                        the good luck jeans.  You had a 
                        three way in those jeans, now let 
                        the t-shirt go!

                                 AMY
                        These jeans suck. They look awful 
                        on me now. I want the shirt.

                                 KATE
                        Too bad. It’s mine.

           Kim Gold is really getting shoved around.

                                 KIM GOLD
                        Okay, starting to hurt.

                                 AMY
                        Take it off!

                                 KATE
                        She’s not taking it off. She’s at a 
                        party.

                                 NICK
                        Alright, maybe we all chill out.

                                 AMY
                        Take it off!

           They pull and pull until the shirt RIPS IN TWO, leaving Kim 
           Gold TOPLESS. She shrieks and tries to cover herself.  Amy 
           and Kate both look pretty shocked.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Who doesn’t wear a bra? What are 
                        you, Lindsey Lohan?
           Kim Gold runs out.  Kate turns to Amy.

                                 KATE
                        I can’t believe you did that.

                                 AMY
                        Me? Are you kidding? You are the 
                        one who brought Kim Gold. You are 
                        the one who--

           Sarah, the birthday girl, walks up to them.  Amy and Kate 
           both smile at her, trying to be upbeat.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                             (weakly)
                        Happy birthday.

                                 KATE
                        Nice tiara.  I like how it says 
                        “Happy Birthday”...

                                 SARAH
                        Can you guys go?  You totally 
                        ruined my birthday.

                                 KATE
                        I’m really sorry. 

                                 AMY
                             (guilty)
                        It’s going to be a great anecdote 
                        one day.

                                 SARAH
                        Just go.  And Amy, I threw some 
                        girl out for going through my 
                        medicine chest.  She said she was 
                        your friend.

                                 AMY
                        Really?  That’s weird.  I came here 
                        alone.

           Kate grabs her bag and leaves.  Amy picks up the other half 
           of the t-shirt and leaves, too. 

           INT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL - CAFETERIA - LATER

           Tom and Kate have lunch together.  
                                 KATE
                        I’ve never been asked to leave a 
                        party before. I mean, Amy has like 
                        a million times, but I never have.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah, well, you act badly enough 
                        and they will eventually ask you.

                                 KATE
                        You think I acted badly? Amy’s the 
                        one who acted badly. She nuded Kim 
                        Gold. Or stripped her. Or whatever 
                        it’s called. 

                                 TOM
                        Okay.

                                 KATE
                        What do you mean, “okay?”

                                 TOM
                        Don’t pick a fight with me because 
                        you’re mad at Amy.

                                 KATE
                        I’m not. I just wasn’t behaving 
                        badly. I was the victim of the bad 
                        behavior. I was caught in the bad 
                        behavior crossfire.

                                 TOM
                        Okay.

                                 KATE
                        Stop saying that! You don’t mean 
                        that “okay.” That’s a false “okay.”

                                 TOM
                        You know what? Fine. You win. 
                        Here’s your fight. I think you were 
                        acting childish, maybe even worse 
                        than Amy and you have been ever 
                        since you stopped being friends. 

                                 KATE
                        What? Childish? Me?
                                 TOM
                        Honestly, yes. We have a wedding to 
                        plan we have a lot of stuff to do 
                        and you spend two days trying to 
                        figure out the person who will hurt 
                        Amy the most to bring to a party. 
                        That is childish.

                                 KATE
                        You’re childish!

                                 TOM
                        Yes, that’s an excellent point, 
                        score one for miss maturity.

           Roxanna and another INTERN walk up behind their table with 
           their lunch trays. They take a sit very near Kate and Tom and 
           whisper the entire time. 

                                 KATE 
                        I need some support here.

                                 TOM
                        Are you kidding? All I do is 
                        support you. I have been there 
                        every step of the way in your 
                        application for Chief Resident, I 
                        yelled at your mom when she said 
                        your father wasn’t allowed to come 
                        to the wedding, and I scraped you 
                        off the floor when you got into 
                        your fight with Amy. I seriously 
                        don’t know what more I can do. Oh, 
                        and I let you scrub in for that 
                        Brain Pallidotomy even though Rex 
                        was all, “oh, you’re letting your 
                        girlfriend scrub in”
                             (he makes the sound effect 
                              for “pussy whipped)
                        And I was like--

                                 KATE
                        Well, I’m sorry I’m such a drag and 
                        I’m sorry my “little” fight with 
                        Amy has been such an inconvenience 
                        for you. And I’m sorry I’m so 
                        childish.

                                 TOM
                        It’s okay, I just think--
                                 KATE
                        --I’m not really sorry! I was being 
                        sarcastic. Jesus, you don’t get 
                        anything. Amy’s right. You’re not 
                        funny.

           As the fight goes on we see Roxanna’s and their friends 
           watching the fighting.  It seems like bets are being taken, 
           money is being exchanged.

                                 TOM
                        What? I am too. Everyone says so.

                                 KATE
                        Yeah, unfunny people say so. And 
                        you know what? You’re not such a 
                        picnic yourself. You’re controlling 
                        and an egomaniac and...other 
                        annoying things.

                                 TOM
                        Did Amy tell you that too?

                                 KATE
                        This has nothing to do with her!

                                 TOM
                        Oh, really. Because I don’t think 
                        one thing that happens with you 
                        isn’t informed by Amy. Even when 
                        you’re not talking to each other 
                        she is this huge presence in your 
                        life. In our lives. And it’s 
                        annoying.

                                 KATE
                        Our life is annoying?

                                 TOM
                        Sometimes. Yeah. Really annoying. 
                        Like now.

                                 KATE
                        If it’s so annoying, maybe you 
                        shouldn’t have to deal with it.

                                 TOM
                        What? Are you being sarcastic 
                        again?
                                 KATE
                        No. I’m not. Maybe this is more 
                        trouble than it’s worth. Maybe we 
                        rushed into this whole thing.  

           Tom stares at her, shocked and hurt.

                                 TOM
                        Maybe we did.

           He gets up and walks away from her. 

                                 KATE
                             (annoyed)
                        I wanted to walk away first.

           INT. KIM GOLD’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Kate sits with Kim who listens intently. Kate has been 
           crying.

                                 KATE
                        Can you believe he said that?

                                 KIM GOLD
                        That’s harsh. Screw him. Who needs 
                        men?

           A NAKED MAN IN HIS SIXTIES walks from room to room behind Kim 
           while she talks.

                                  OLD NAKED MAN
                        Honey, come back to bed.

           Kim Gold shrugs at Kate.

                                 KIM GOLD
                        Sorry, Katie.  Bros before Hoes.

           Kim Gold gets up.

                                 KIM GOLD (CONT’D)
                        Call me in the morning, okay?

           Kate grabs her purse and leaves, sadly.

           INT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL - LOCKER ROOM LATER

           Kate walks in the locker room while Roxanna is getting 
           dressed.
                                 KATE
                        Can I talk to you for a second? I 
                        could really use a friend right 
                        now.

                                 ROXANNA
                        Look Kate, even if I still liked 
                        you which I definitely do not, I’ve 
                        been friends with Tom since med 
                        school. I’m going to side with him. 
                             (then, brightly)
                        But if you make up, and you never 
                        bring your dog to my home, we can 
                        hang again. 

                                 KATE
                        I understand.

           Kate, sad, walks out of the locker room.

           INT. AMY’S APARTMENT- THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Amy is fast asleep when she hears a BANGING on her door.  She 
           gets up and shuffles over to the door, looks through the peep 
           hole, then opens it.

           It is a crying KATE.

                                 KATE
                        I need you.

           Amy takes a beat and then opens the door letting in Kate.  
           They hug.

           LEGEND CARD READS: “GETTING BACK TOGETHER.”

           INT. AMY’S APARTMENT- DAYS LATER - MORNING

           Amy is in bed, asleep.  Nick lies next to her.  Amy opens one 
           eye and looks at her BRAND NEW ALARM CLOCK.

                                 AMY
                        What?

           She picks it up.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        It needs batteries?

           Nick wakes up.
                                 NICK
                        Good morning.

           He tries to kiss her, but Amy gets up and throws on some 
           clothes.

                                 AMY
                        I’m going to make Kate some coffee 
                        and breakfast. I’m so relieved 
                        everything is back to normal.

                                 NICK
                        That’s awesome. But don’t forget 
                        we’re going to see Arcade Fire 
                        tonight.

                                 AMY
                        Oh, right, but, you know, Kate and 
                        I just have so much catching up to 
                        do. 

           She kisses him.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Thanks for understanding.

                                 NICK
                        I traded my dresser for those 
                        tickets.

           INT. KATE’S APARTMENT- MINUTES LATER

           Amy enters with her key, holding a cup of coffee and a plate 
           of eggs and bacon arranged into a smiley face.  Lady Girl 
           greets her, looking hungry and ratty.  The once immaculate 
           apartment is a mess.  Old wedding invitations are strewn all 
           over the floor. Obscene party favors meant for a bachelorette 
           party lie all over the floor.  This is not Kate’s usual 
           sterile apartment.

           Amy steps over the mess into Kate’s bedroom. 

                                 AMY
                        Kate?  Wakey wakey.  I made you 
                        eggs and bake-y.

           Amy sees Kate lying asleep on the floor, wearing pajamas and 
           her wedding veil. 

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Are you okay?  Did Tom call?
                                 KATE
                        It’s just like you said last night, 
                        why talk to him?  If we could have 
                        a fight like that then our 
                        relationship is just too fragile.  

                                 AMY
                        Did I say that? It sounds very Dr. 
                        Phil and I mean that in a good way.

                                 KATE
                             (Re: Amy’s outfit)
                        That’s nice. And you picked it out 
                        all by yourself.

                                 AMY
                        Yeah, sometimes I luck out. Hey, 
                        are you going to work today?  

                                 KATE
                        I have the day off. Thank god I 
                        don’t have to see Tom’s adorable, 
                        disgusting face. I should probably 
                        just go in anyway. So many people 
                        are sick. So many people in pain.

                                 AMY
                        Yay! Fun day with Amy and Kate.

           INT. NYC BRUNCH SPOT- DAY

           Sunday brunch.  Kate and Amy sit in a booth across from each 
           other. There is awkward silence.

                                 AMY
                        So...this is really great. Hanging 
                        out again.

                                 KATE
                        Yeah. It’s good to see you.

           More awkward silence. 

                                 AMY
                        Should we look at the menu?

                                 KATE
                        Good idea.

           They start thumbing through it.
                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Should we get the--

           It just hangs there. Amy isn’t finishing her sentence.

                                 AMY
                        What?

                                 KATE
                        The uh...

                                 AMY
                        Pancakes?

                                 KATE
                        I was going to say Benedict.

                                 AMY
                        Oh. I’m not really in a Hollandaise 
                        mood. Botulism and all.

                                 KATE
                        Oh. Okay.

                                 AMY
                        Want to split the waffles?

                                 KATE
                        I feel like eggs.

                                 AMY
                        Okay, well, let’s just get our own 
                        things.

                                 KATE
                        Yeah, okay.

           Amy goes back to the menu.  The Waiter approaches.

                                 WAITER
                        Ready?

                                 AMY
                        I’ll have the Eggs Benedict.

                                 KATE 
                        I’ll have the fruit plate. 

                                 WAITER
                        And an extra plate for splitsies.

           Kate and Amy look at each other.  They shake their heads.
                                 WAITER (CONT'D)
                        If you are lying to me and I see 
                        you share from each other’s plates 
                        I am charging you the split fee.

           The waiter walks away.  Amy and Kate awkwardly look away from 
           each and start reading the Sunday Times.

           INT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL- OPERATING ROOM- DAY

           Kate assists her SUPERVISING PHYSICIAN on a heart operation.  
           Tom is in the viewing room above.  Kate looks up and MAKES 
           EYE CONTACT with him, then quickly LOOKS AWAY.  He is 
           rattling her.

                                 SUPERVISING PHYSICIAN
                             (to Kate)
                        Good work.  Now sew him up.

           The Supervising Physician walks away from the operating 
           table.  

           Kate, still freaked out by Tom watching her, STITCHES UP THE 
           PATIENT.  We see the SCALPEL IS STILL IN HIM as she then 
           finishes the job.

                                 NURSE
                        Where’s the scalpel?

           Kate looks down at the patient on the table, horrified.

           INT. AMY’S APARTMENT- NIGHT

           Amy, Kate and Nick are sitting around Amy’s kitchen table 
           while Amy cleans up from dinner.

                                 AMY
                        And then Professor Morton took off 
                        his sweater and got caught in it 
                        and Kate said--

           Amy pauses and turns to Kate, waiting for her, as usual, to 
           finish her thought. 

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        And then, what did you say?

                                 KATE
                        Um, I honestly don’t remember.
                                 AMY
                        I think it was something really 
                        funny.

                                 KATE
                             (shakes her head)
                        Sorry, I don’t know.

           They are not connecting.  There is an awkward silence.  Nick 
           gets up and starts washing dishes.

                                 NICK
                        I can do these. You guys can go 
                        talk and catch up. Spend some alone 
                        time.

           Kate and Amy panic at the thought of having to spend more 
           alone time together.

                           KATE
                                                           AMY
           No!
                                              No!

                                 KATE
                        That’s okay. I’ll help you.

                                 AMY
                        I can help too.

           More awkward silence.

                                 KATE
                        So, Nick, how’s work?

                                 NICK
                        I just sold my couch for like three 
                        hundred dollars more than I bought 
                        it for. It’s awesome except now I 
                        don’t have a couch.

                                 KATE
                        That’s cool. Anyway, maybe I’ll 
                        just go to sleep.

                                 AMY
                        Good idea!
                             (Then)
                        We don’t want to talk all night and 
                        then be super tired.

                                 KATE
                        Totally. There’s obviously a lot to 
                        say but I have an early surgery.
                                 AMY
                        Yeah, I have an early random office 
                        worker birthday party.

           They both rush off, eager to avoid each other.

           INT. AMY’S APARTMENT- MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Amy and Nick lie in bed together. 

                                 AMY 
                        I think if I wake up early enough I 
                        can probably sneak out without her 
                        noticing. 

                                 NICK
                        Why are you trying to avoid her?

                                 AMY
                        I’m not. I didn’t mean sneak. That 
                        was a bad word choice.

                                 NICK
                        You guys used to have so much to 
                        say to each other. I couldn’t even 
                        stand being around you because it 
                        was so boring and now you’re 
                        sneaking out of your own house to 
                        avoid her. Seriously, I have 
                        Lesbian moms and I can’t understand 
                        for the life of me what is going on 
                        with you and Kate.

                                 AMY
                        I thought when she dumped that 
                        loser she’d be happy and we’d go 
                        back to the way it was. But it’s 
                        just different. We’re both just 
                        kind of different. 

                                 NICK
                        Maybe this is too obvious for you, 
                        but maybe she loves him. Maybe they 
                        shouldn’t have broken up.

                                 AMY
                        Okay, crazytown. I was talking 
                        about me and Kate.
                                 NICK
                        What? She’s upset and depressed 
                        without him. That means nothing to 
                        you? Maybe she needs him. 

           Amy turns to him.

                                 AMY
                        Okay, what’s happening here?

                                 NICK
                        Nothing, we’re talking.

                                 AMY
                        You’re lecturing me.

                                 NICK
                        I just think you should consider 
                        Kate’s feelings instead of just 
                        being so gleeful to have her back. 
                        It’s a little selfish.

                                 AMY
                        I’m selfish? Oh, really, is that 
                        why I’m sitting in the wet spot 
                        right now?

                                 NICK
                        You’re mad?

                                 AMY
                        No. I’m just wondering why you’re 
                        still here?

                                 NICK
                        What?

                                 AMY
                        It’s just that we had sex already. 
                        So I’m not sure why your clothes 
                        are still off? It’s not like we’re 
                        boyfriend and girlfriend.

                                 NICK
                             (cool)
                        That’s a good point. 

           Nick gets out of bed.

                                 AMY
                        Okay.  That was too mean.  I’m 
                        sorry.  I’m stressed out. You don’t 
                        have to leave.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Take off your pants.
                             (he ignores her)
                        I said take off your pants!!!

           He pulls on his pants and leaves.  

           INT. AMY’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - SAME

           Kate, trying to sleep on the couch, hears Amy screaming for 
           Nick to take off his pants and starts to cry.

           INT. NYC OFFICE- DAY

           Amy is at another temp job.  

                                 OFFICE GIRL
                        Your friend is on the phone.  Kate.

                                 AMY
                        How did she track me down?

                                 OFFICE GIRL
                        Through the temp agency.  She says 
                        it’s an emergency.

                                 AMY
                        Uh... tell her I went to get 
                        coffee.

                                 OFFICE GIRL
                        That is so harsh.  You’re mean.

                                 AMY
                        You’re mean.  This is a complicated 
                        situation. I want to help her but 
                        she won’t let me. You don’t 
                        understand. Just please tell her 
                        I’ll call her back.

           The Office Girl walks away, bitching about Amy to another 
           office worker.

                                 OFFICE GIRL
                        The new temp’s a bitch.  Don’t 
                        invite her to drinks...

           Amy picks up the extension phone.

                                 AMY 
                        Kate? What’s wrong? 
           INT. AMY’S APARTMENT- LATER THAT NIGHT

           Amy tries to comfort Kate.

                                 AMY
                        So, who cares? Why did you want to 
                        be Chief Resident anyway? Who needs 
                        it?

                                 KATE
                        It was all because of that stupid 
                        scalpel I sewed up in that guy.  It 
                        was too big of a mistake.  I mean 
                        he was fine.

                                 AMY
                        I thought that stuff happened all 
                        the time.

                                 KATE 
                        I thought so, too.  But apparently 
                        not with an object that sharp.  
                        Never.  In the history of Manhattan 
                        hospitals. It was all because of 
                        Tom being there.  I can’t believe I 
                        did that. Maybe I did it 
                        subconciously because I don’t 
                        really want to be a doctor. Maybe I 
                        should quit and take that sculpture 
                        class I always said I would take.

                                 AMY
                        Or, maybe you did it because you 
                        are a human.  I didn’t send a fax 
                        for this guy today because I had a 
                        headache and the fax machine makes 
                        a high pitched squeal.  It happens.

           Kate starts to cry.

                                 KATE
                        It’s not the same, Amy. This is a 
                        life, not some dumb temp job.

                                 AMY
                        Yeah, okay, I know that. 

                                 KATE
                        And a relationship, not a hook up 
                        with some guy from college.
                                 AMY
                        I know that too.

                                 KATE
                        So just stop trying to make me feel 
                        better by telling me it doesn’t 
                        matter. Because it does matter. Or 
                        maybe it doesn’t matter to you.

                                 AMY
                        I just want you to be happy.

                                 KATE
                        Really? Because you didn’t before. 
                        Sometimes I think you like me like 
                        this. All miserable and vulnerable.

                                 AMY
                        Trust me. I don’t. I now have tears 
                        and snot on like every surface of 
                        my apartment.

                                 KATE
                        Well, I know you hate me with Tom. 
                        And you hate me succeeding at work.

                                 AMY
                        Is that really what you think? You 
                        think I want you to be unhappy. I 
                        have done nothing but take care of 
                        you for weeks. 

                                 KATE
                        Well, now you know how it feels. 
                        Except I did for it for you ten 
                        years.

                                 AMY
                        Yeah, and you liked it. I think you 
                        like me broken and you can’t handle 
                        it that I have my shit together. 
                        Kate’s the one with the boyfriend, 
                        Kate’s the one with the job. Kate’s 
                        the one with a dentist.

                                 KATE
                        It seems to me like you can’t 
                        handle me having needs. All I asked 
                        for is some support and you can’t 
                        even give me that.
                                 AMY
                        I tried, but you’re like the 
                        bottomless pit of need. Maybe I’m 
                        not the right person to help you. 
                        Go back to Tom. Maybe you need him. 
                        Maybe you need Anti-depressants.  I 
                        don’t know, but I know this isn’t 
                        working. Maybe we’re just too 
                        different.

                                 KATE
                        Maybe we are.

           Kate gets up and walks out of the apartment.

           INT. AMY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           She sits on her couch, reading the newspaper.

           CLOSE ON THE NEWSPAPER

           The APARTMENTS FOR RENT section.   She circles a bunch of 
           listings.

           INT. AMY’S APARTMENT- MORNING

           Amy’s new apartment is unpacked and fairly organized. She 
           opens a box and takes out the same Indian tapestry she has 
           had since college. She is about to hang it on the wall, then, 
           thinking again, she throws it out. 

           INT. HOSPITAL

           Kate performs a surgery. She stitches up the patient and 
           then, looks around, panicked.

                                 KATE
                        Has anyone seen the scalpel?

           The NURSES and OTHER DOCTORS begin to wildly search and then, 
           smiling, Kate holds one up.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Kidding.
           They all laugh.

           EXT. AMY’S STREET - DAY

           Amy stands at a trash can, throwing away all of her books on 
           tape and copies of the classics. It’s an emotional moment for 
           her. Until, a WOMAN WALKS UP and starts to take a copy of 
           MANSFIELD PARK out of the trash.

           Amy grabs it back.

                                 AMY
                        Excuse me, but I’m purging that.

                                 WOMAN
                        But it’s perfectly good.

                                 AMY
                        It’s part of my process! It’s a 
                        metaphor.

           The woman hands her the book and walks away.

                                 WOMAN
                        Bitch.

           Amy keeps purging.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           KAte is working intently on a sculpture. Her teacher comes 
           over to check it out.

                                 TEACHER
                        That’s very good detail, Kate.

                                 KATE
                        Thanks. I really love this class. I 
                        feel like it really helps me just 
                        get away from the hospital and 
                        focus on other things, you know.

           The teacher just smiles politely and walks away and we REVEAL 
           that Kate has been working on a sculpture of a VERY DETAILED 
           BRAIN.

           INT. A TEMP AGENCY

           Amy enters the temp agency and waves to the EMPLOYEES working 
           there.
                                 AMY
                        Hey, guys.

           Everyone there waves and smiles. It is her “Cheers.” 

                                 TEMP AGENCY
                        Amy! We’ve missed you./  What’s 
                        going on with Kate?/ How’s that 
                        tomato allergy?

           She walks up to the SUPERVISOR.  

                                 AMY
                        Listen, Gene, I’ve thought about 
                        this a lot.  It’s been a long time 
                        and I need to finally stop being a 
                        Temp and started being, I don’t 
                        know, a Permanent, somewhere.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        This may sound crazy, but we 
                        actually have a job opening up 
                        here.  A few of our temps had 
                        breakdowns this year.  We’re hiring 
                        a peer counselor.  

                                 AMY
                        No one knows more about being a 
                        temp than me.  I’ve actually 
                        started a screenplay and a novel 
                        both about being a temp that I 
                        never finished.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        Are you interested?

                                 AMY 
                        I’m more than interested. I’ll do 
                        it, Gene!  

           Amy heartily shakes the Supervisor’s hand.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                             (uncomfortable)
                        I can’t actually just give you the 
                        job. There’s a whole application 
                        process.  Other people might apply 
                        too.
           EXT. AMY AND KATE’S APARTMENT- DAY

           Kate watches out her window as Amy and some moving men pack 
           up her furniture and belongings into a van. 

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. KATE’S APARTMENT- HALLWAY- DAY

           Amy has grabbed the last of her things and she exits her 
           apartment carrying a box of her stuff. Her three foot bong 
           peaks out from the top. She looks at it and the decides to 
           leave at the apartment.

                                 AMY
                        We’ve had a good run, Lt. Bongster, 
                        but I think we both need to move 
                        on.

           She puts it down. As she stand she sees Kim Gold leaving 
           Kate’s apartment.

                                 KIM GOLD
                        Hey, Amers, how are you? Nice 
                        purse. I like the way it covers up 
                        your ass.

                                 AMY
                        Thanks, Kim. Oh, I totally wanted 
                        to tell you--

           Amy just walks back into her apartment and slams the door. 
           Kim knocks on the door. Amy opens it.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        What, Kim? What could you possibly 
                        want from me? I moved out. Kate and 
                        I aren’t even friends anymore, 
                        okay. You win. She can be your 
                        B.F.F. You can get one of those 
                        heart necklaces that says best 
                        friends and each wear a half. You 
                        can stay up all night sharing 
                        secrets. You can be her Maid Of 
                        Honor for all I care. Live it up.

           Amy starts to close the door. Kim sticks her foot in the 
           door.
                                 KIM
                        You really think she would want me 
                        to be maid of honor if the wedding 
                        was going to happen?

                                 AMY
                        What do you mean “if the wedding 
                        was going to happen?”

                                 KIM
                        The weddings off. Duh. But for real 
                        you think she would pick me? 
                        Because, honestly, I’ve never been 
                        an M.O.H. And it just seems like a   
                        lot of fun. I feel like I could be 
                        super good at it. Oh my god, this 
                        is kind of really exciting!

                                 AMY
                        What are you talking about? She 
                        went back to him. I told her to go 
                        back to him. She went back to him, 
                        right? They’re not getting married?

                                 KIM
                        No. Sad. But these things happen 
                        and even though they are sad they 
                        are sometimes totally necessary 
                        like when I had a cyst on my ovary 
                        that was growing teeth and hair and 
                        had to be removed.

                                 AMY
                        What the hell are you saying?

                                 KIM
                        They didn’t get back together. She 
                        wanted to, but Tom said she didn’t 
                        know what she wanted.  He wouldn’t 
                        take her back.  So... no wedding. 
                        Try to keep up.
                             (then)
                        So let me ask you this, if say, I 
                        was Maid of Honor, do you think I 
                        could pick my own dress? Because I 
                        just know my own body better than 
                        anyone, you know.

           But Amy isn’t really listening.
           INT. TOM’S LOFT - NIGHT

           Tom take two microwaved Lean Cuisine’s out of the fridge and 
           dumps them into one plate. Then looking at the depressing 
           mess, pours salad dressing all over it. The doorbell rings. 
           He goes to the door and opens it and sees Amy.

                                 AMY
                        I need you.

           INT. TOM’S LOFT - LATER

           Tom and Amy are talking.

                                 AMY
                        I knew you wouldn’t buzz me in.  I 
                        pretended to be the pizza guy and 
                        one of your neighbors let me in.  I 
                        didn’t even have to show him a 
                        pizza.  You should have a safety 
                        meeting in this building.  This is 
                        basic stuff.

                                 TOM
                        Why are you here?

                                 AMY 
                        I know I am the last person on 
                        earth you want to see.

                                 TOM
                        That’s true.

                                 AMY
                        Okay, maybe not the last. Like, 
                        would you not want to see Osama bin 
                        Laden.  Except actually maybe you 
                        would because that would be a coup 
                        to catch him, right?

                                 TOM
                        I’m closing the door.

                                 AMY
                        You should take Kate back. I know 
                        I’m not really the most 
                        relationshipy person, but this one 
                        I know.
                                 TOM
                        Kate doesn’t know what she wants.  
                        I’m pretty sure it involves 
                        fighting with you and I’m pretty 
                        sure it doesn’t involve wanting to 
                        spend her life with me.

           Amy starts picking at his food.

                                 AMY
                        How do you do surgery on people 
                        when you don’t even know something 
                        as simple as this? It’s chilling 
                        really.

                                 TOM
                        I’m right.

                                 AMY 
                        You’re wrong.  Kate loves you. I 
                        thought I could help her get over 
                        you, but I can’t. She is miserable 
                        without you. You need to forgive 
                        her. The end.  By Amy.

                                 TOM
                        Why are you telling me this?  I 
                        thought you thought we were all 
                        wrong.  

                                 AMY
                        Yeah, I did. But now I am starting 
                        to realize that she and I are all 
                        wrong. We aren’t what we were in 
                        college. We’ve changed. We need to 
                        move on. I’m just trying to do 
                        something unselfish here. Jeez, you 
                        really make it tough on a girl.

                                 TOM
                        Okay, so what should I do?

                                 AMY
                        Call her.  Get a big boom box.  Buy 
                        flowers.  Scream her name, um...
                             (then, distracted by Tom’s 
                              giant TV)
                        Oh my god. Is that thing fifty 
                        inches?

                                 TOM
                        Ha! You wish.  Sixty.
                                 AMY
                        Wow, why have I been wasting all 
                        this time hating a man with a TV 
                        this big?  Such a waste...

           Amy grabs an armful of Tom’s food and settles herself in 
           front of the TV.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Oh, and don’t tell Kate I came 
                        here.  I’m sure she’ll think it was 
                        another way I was trying to destroy 
                        her life.

           INT. AMY’S APARTMENT- NIGHT

           Amy hears laughter coming from the hallway. She opens her 
           door to see.

           KATE AND TOM laughing. They seem a little tipsy, just back 
           from dinner, and they are really enjoying each other. 

                                 KATE 
                        I’m so glad you called.

                                 TOM
                        Technically you could say I called 
                        back. And I’m glad you left 67 
                        messages on my voice mail.

                                 KATE
                        Oh, you know what we should 
                        practice doing?

           She points to the threshold.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Threshhold carrying. It’s key.

                                 TOM
                        Okay, you’re the boss.

           Tom lifts himself on to her and she struggles to carry him 
           across the threshold.

                                 KATE
                        You know what else we could do?

           Amy smiles and closes the door of her apartment, happy that 
           they are happy.
           INT. NICK’S APARTMENT- NIGHT

           Nick opens his door and sees Amy.  She looks uncomfortable.

                                 AMY
                        Hey.  Can I come in?  I brought a 
                        peace offering.

           She holds up a 6 pack in her hand.

                                 NICK
                        Come in.

           Amy sits down far away from Nick on the couch.

                                 AMY
                        I know I acted like a jerk to you 
                        and I just want you to know, I’m 
                        sorry, and I’m really trying to 
                        change and --

                                 NICK
                        -- what?

                                 AMY 
                        I am apologizing for the huge 
                        fight. 

                                 NICK
                        When?

                                 AMY
                        The last time I saw you. You 
                        stormed out my apartment furious 
                        with me.  

                                 NICK
                        I did?

                                 AMY
                        Yes, and we said mean things to 
                        each other.  Really mean things.

                                 NICK
                        So what?  

                                 AMY 
                        And we haven’t spoken for three 
                        weeks.  
                                 NICK 
                        I thought you were just doing your 
                        own thing.

                                 AMY
                        Yes, and part of my “thing” was 
                        that we were in a huge fight and 
                        not speaking.

                                 NICK
                        We’re not girls.  Every fight isn’t 
                        such a big deal. 
                             (beat)
                        I missed you too, though.  

           Nick sits down next to Amy and puts his arm around her.  She 
           leans her head on his shoulder.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Is this just because you want a 
                        date to Kate’s wedding?

                                 AMY
                        No. I’m not going. It’s because I’m 
                        using you for sex. Obviously.

           LEGEND CARD: “THE WEDDING.”

           INT. KATE’S APARTMENT- A FEW WEEKS LATER- MORNING

           Kate, dressed in a robe, opens her apartment door and sees 
           Kim Gold holding a tray of breakfast. 

                                 KIM GOLD
                        Yay!  It’s your wedding day!  That 
                        rhymes!

                                 KATE
                             (re: the food)
                        What’s all this?

                                 KIM GOLD
                        A bride cannot get married on an 
                        empty stomach.  My cousin did and 
                        she dry heaved through the 
                        ceremony.  It sounded like an 
                        animal with a hairball.

                                 KATE
                        Well, thanks.  That’s really nice.

           Kim Gold holds out the tray of breakfast for Kate.
                                 KIM GOLD 
                        Just being the best best
                        friend ever.  Isn’t this day 
                        perfect?

           Kate is distracted by a GUY COMING OUT OF AMY’S OLD 
           APARTMENT.  He barely glances Kate’s way as he exits the 
           hallway.

                                 KIM GOLD (CONT'D)
                        Hello little asshole, I am trying 
                        to have a moment with you.

                                 KATE
                             (snaps out of it)
                        Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  It’s great.

           INT. AMY’S MOTHER’S APARTMENT- DAY

           CLOSE ON...THE PRETTY INVITATION TO TOM AND KATE’S WEDDING.

           Amy lies on her mother’s bed, looking at the invitation and 
           watching as her mother gets dressed up for the wedding.  Bob, 
           her father, walks in and out of the bedroom, putting the 
           finishing touches on his tuxedo. 

                                 AMY
                        ... and I actually had a dinner 
                        party for some people from Nick’s 
                        work, and it wasn’t the most boring 
                        night of my life.  I kicked their 
                        asses in Boggle.  But I didn’t brag 
                        about it which is big for me.  

           Bob holds out an undone bow-tie to Carol.

                                 BOB
                        Honey, can you do this?

           Carol ties Bob’s tie for him.  She does it, then he moves 
           back into the bathroom.

                                 AMY
                        Nick and I have the best time 
                        together.  Maybe he could be my 
                        best friend and boyfriend in one.  
                        That could happen, right?

                                 CAROL
                        No no. That’s ridiculous. You need 
                        a best friend.
                                 AMY
                        Why?

                                 CAROL
                        Men die.  Your father is wonderful, 
                        though he can also be annoying.  
                        But it’s Judith who really gets me.  

           Bob comes out of the bathroom.

                                 CAROL (CONT'D)
                        Honey, when I get upset what makes 
                        me feel better?

                                 BOB
                        Oh god, why? I don’t know.  

                                 CAROL
                             (to Amy)
                        I buy an obscenely expensive purse.  
                        I wear it all week with the tags 
                        on.  Then I return it. Judith knows 
                        that as well as she knows her own 
                        phone number.  

                                 BOB
                             (to Amy)
                        If I knew Judith came along with 
                        the deal I would have picked a wife 
                        with a better looking best friend.

                                 AMY
                        That’s funny, Dad.  You should book 
                        a gig in the Catskills.

                                 CAROL
                        Yes, shut up, Bob. That’s so mean. 
                        Judith’s is a rare beauty.  She’s 
                        really going to come into her own 
                        in her 70’s.
                             (looks at Amy)
                        Friendships with women carry you 
                        through your whole life. We all 
                        change, but good friends learn to 
                        adapt to each other.

           Carol picks up her purse and wrap, then gives Amy a kiss and 
           leaves.  Once her parents are gone, Amy sits down on the bed 
           and sees some pictures on Carol’s dressing table.  

           CLOSE ON THE PICTURES.  One of Amy.  One of Carol and Amy’s 
           Dad smiling and holding hands.  Then another... 
           It is CAROL AND HER BEST FRIEND, JUDITH, on a river rafting 
           trip.  They are laughing their asses off.

           EXT. STREETS OF NEW YORK- MOMENTS LATER

           Amy races out of her parent’s apartment building.  She tries 
           to hail a cab.  Nothing. MUSIC UP: “Wind Beneath My Wings.”  
           She runs for a block and then finally spots a cab.

                                 AMY
                        Over here!

           The cab pulls over.  As Amy rushes over to it.  A MAN rushes 
           over, too.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Go away.  It’s mine.

                                 MAN
                        My girlfriend and I got in a huge 
                        fight.  She’s at the airport, about 
                        to fly to Darfur for six months.  I 
                        need to stop her. I need this cab.

                                 AMY 
                        Big deal.  My best friend is about 
                        to get married without me.  We’ve 
                        been talking about this since we 
                        were freshman in college.

           She shoves him away from the cab.

           EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE SYNAGOGUE- LATER

           The CAB screeches to the CURB.  Amy jumps out and waves to 
           the MAN racing to the airport who wound up sharing the cab 
           with her.

                                 AMY
                        Good luck with Simone, Curtis.  And 
                        listen, if you’re willing to raise 
                        your kids Catholic, I don’t see 
                        what the problem is.

                                 MAN
                        Thanks, Amy.
                             (to the cab driver)
                        Move!

           The cab screeches away.  Amy darts into the synagogue.
           INT. UPPER WEST SIDE SYNAGOGUE - CONTINUOUS

           Tom and Kate stand at the front of the crowd and the CANTOR 
           (Phil Rosenthal.)

                                 CANTOR
                        I’ve known Kate since she starred 
                        in our temple’s version of Joseph 
                        and the Amazing Technicolor Dream 
                        Coat.  It’s a good thing she became 
                        a doctor, because she’s no actor.  
                        Seriously, I have never seen people 
                        walk out of a kid’s show before..

           The audience laughs. Tom looks at Kate, surprised. He 
           whispers.

                                 TOM
                        I didn’t know that.

                                 KATE
                        I usually don’t like to talk about 
                        things I’m bad at. But it’s 
                        actually cute, right?

           Tom nods.  The Cantor continues.

                                 CANTOR
                        ... so obviously I know Kate and 
                        her family well and love them. But 
                        I’ve had the opportunity to get to 
                        know Tom in these past few months. 
                        And I’ve come to love him too. This 
                        couple that stands before all of 
                        you, I believe they are really 
                        committed to one another. They love 
                        each other deeply and I believe 
                        nothing will stop them from 
                        pursuing a future together.

           At this moment, AMY BURSTS THROUGH THE DOOR.

                                 AMY
                        Stop!

           Everyone turns to look at Amy.  Kate shakes her head in 
           disbelief.

                                 KATE
                        Oh god.
                                 TOM
                        You’ve got to be kidding me.

           Kim Gold, standing next to Kate as her Maid of Honor.

                                 KIM GOLD
                        This is not a perfect day when 
                        someone does something like this.  
                        I would never do this.

                                 CAROL
                        Sssh.

           Amy doesn’t know what to say next, so she shouts out again.

                                 AMY
                        Stop this wedding!

                                 CANTOR
                        You said that.  It’s stopped.  
                        Mission accomplished.

           Amy starts heading down the aisle.

                                 TOM
                             (to Kate)
                        What is she doing?

                                 AMY
                        This can’t happen like this.

                                 CANTOR
                             (to Amy)
                        Are you sure you are in love with 
                        Tom?

                                 AMY
                        What? No, are you kidding? Tom?   
                        No.  Please.  Him? Have you met me?

                                 CANTOR
                        No.

                                 AMY
                             (to Tom)
                        No offense. I actually like you 
                        now.

                                 KATE
                        What is happening? What do you 
                        want?  Why are you stopping the 
                        wedding?  I thought you wanted us 
                        back together.
                                 AMY
                        Wait, you think I’m stopping the 
                        wedding? 

                                 CANTOR
                        Maybe because you screamed “Stop” 
                        at the top of your lungs.

                                 AMY
                        I want you guys to get married.

                                 WEDDING GUESTS
                        What does she want?/ Is it stop or 
                        is it go?/ Why did I have to come 
                        to this?

                                 AMY
                        I just meant stop because you can’t 
                        get married without me.

                                 TOM
                        Ah.

                                 KATE
                        This is a weird time to tell me 
                        that.

                                 AMY
                        Look, I tried finding other best 
                        friends, but I can’t. I know we are 
                        really different, but we’re good 
                        for each other. We are stuck 
                        together like...

           She looks around and sees Kim Gold glaring at her.

                                 AMY.
                        A cyst, with teeth and hair.

           Kim Gold smiles.  The wedding audience is grossed out.  Amy 
           continues.

                                 AMY 
                        I’m sorry it took me so stupidly 
                        long to figure it out.

           Kate is moved. So is the crowd who make some aww sounds.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Am I too late?

           Kate shakes her head.
                                 KATE
                        No.

                                 AMY
                        Good.  
                             (to Kim Gold)
                        I think I should be standing here.

           Amy pushes Kim Gold out of the Maid Of Honor spot, grabbing 
           the bouquet of flowers out of her hand.  Kim won’t let go.

                                 KIM GOLD
                        No!  I’m doing it.  Kate said I 
                        could do it. 

                                 KATE
                        I actually didn’t.  You just bought 
                        this big satin dress that matched 
                        mine and kind of guilted me into 
                        it.

                                 AMY
                        You can be the number one 
                        bridesmaid.

                                 KIM GOLD
                        Really? Because in a way that’s 
                        kind of better, right? Not so “sad 
                        single-girl”, right?

           Kate grabs a bouquet out of a flower girl’s hands. Amy smiles 
           and holds out her hands to accept the bouquet but the flower 
           girl won’t let go. Amy rips the bouquet from her hands. They 
           fight over the flowers. The flower girl starts to cry. Amy 
           gets the flowers.

           Kate and Amy hug. Then pull apart. They immediately fall into 
           their old rhythms.

                                 AMY 
                        You look so good in that dress. I 
                        can’t believe you found it without 
                        me.  I was so convinced you’d do 
                        that whole gross Renaissance Fair 
                        wedding dress thing.

                                 KATE
                        That was my second choice!

           They laugh.
                                 TOM
                        Sorry to bust up this tearful 
                        reunion, but could we get married 
                        now?

                                 KATE
                        Oh, yes, honey.  Sorry.

                                 AMY
                             (to the cantor)
                        Go.  Do it.

           The Cantor continues with the ceremony. Amy nudges the flower 
           girl and points to Kate.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        That’s my best friend.

           WE PULL UP and away from the wedding to the sounds of QUEEN’S 
           “YOU’RE MY BEST FRIEND.” The song continues into...

           Different shots of the wedding:

           WE are CLOSE ON Kate and Tom smiling happily as they are 
           raised high on chairs for a rousing Horah.  PULL BACK TO 
           REVEAL, Amy, also in a chair, screaming and waving around a 
           napkin.

           Kate and Tom sit at a Sweet Hearts table. Amy pulls up a 
           chair.

           Rachel, who has inexplicably crashed, is singing with the 
           band.

           Nick and Tom watch as Kate and Amy drunkenly tango around the 
           room.

           Sarah and Lara split the meat choice and the fish choice.

           Amy feeding Tom and Kate wedding cake. She rubs it into their 
           faces.
