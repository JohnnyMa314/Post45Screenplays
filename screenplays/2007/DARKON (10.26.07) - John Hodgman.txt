           EXT. ATOP A HIGH COUNTRY HILL - TWILIGHT

           We look out over a range of rolling green hills. The time
           and place are ambiguous. As twilight falls, we see a
           figure at the crest of a high hill.

           This is SKIP MCINTYRE, 29. But right now, he wears the
           gleaming armor of PRINCE BANNOR, the character he plays
           in the medieval role-playing wargame called DARKON.

           Skip is scruffy, soulful, a little overweight, but his
           look somehow works with his quasi-D&D garb--in a way it
           might not in the real world. 
                                                                      #
                                                                      #

           He leans on his orange broadsword (it’s PVC pipe wrapped
           in foam, but we can’t see that yet) and watches the late
           summer sunset. 

                                  SKIP AS BANNOR
                             (full of awe)
                        Man. 

           As the Prince surveys his lands, he is joined by an
           anxious figure wearing a green, flowing cloak. 

           This is Andrew Kreel, 28, but both in and out of the game *****
           he is known simply as KARNAGE. A jumpy, unnaturally
           skinny geek, “Karnage” is blissfully unaware of the irony *****
           of his name. 

                                  SKIP AS BANNOR (CONT’D)
                        Strange, isn’t it, old friend? The sun
                        sets over all the lands of Darkon... But
                        for our realm, Realm Laconia, it is truly
                        the dawn of a new and glorious age.

           Skip looks to his palm, where he holds a small,
           intricately carved wooden box. His eyes are lit with
           triumph. 

                                  KARNAGE
                        We must make haste, milord. The scouts
                        have returned. 

                                  SKIP
                        What news, Karnage?

                                  KARNAGE
                        Marius reports all clear to the east, but
                        our other scout... has not come back.

                                  SKIP
                        Darius? What happened?
                                  KARNAGE
                        All that we found was this.

           Karnage holds up a cloak, torn to shreds.

                                  SKIP
                        What could have done such damage? A wolf?

                                  KARNAGE
                        Worse. I suspect a warg, milord.

                                  SKIP
                        A warg?! Poor Darius. Has Marius been
                        told?

                                  KARNAGE
                        No need. A twin brother feels such
                        tidings in the blood.

                                  SKIP
                        Very true.

                                  KARNAGE
                        I feel we must rid ourselves...

                        ...of the item

                                  SKIP
                        But we fought so hard to get it! It’s our
                        destiny!

                                  KARNAGE
                        But milord, a warg smells magic. The item
                        will lead the beast directly to us, and
                        all our foes will follow.

                                  SKIP
                        You worry, warmaster. The honor of
                        Laconia will always protect us.

                                  KARNAGE
                        You act as though you desire pointless
                        conflict, milord.

                                  SKIP
                        Glory in battle, Karnage, that’s why
                        we’re here. 

           They walk into the woods. Almost as soon as they leave, a
           helicopter buzzes noisily across the sky.
           EXT. LACONIA CAMPSITE - EVENING

           Later, Skip, Karnage, and their nine teammates sit around
           a campfire, all clad in the heraldic green and gold of
           their team/”realm” Laconia.

           They are deep in the dark, wild woods. This will be the
           site of the BATTLE OF THE BROOCH.

           Skip raises a pewter tankard. 
                                                                      #

                        Raise your mead, and let us remember our
                        fallen friend, Darius. See how his
                        brother mourns.

           Close up on the somber face of MARIUS, 36, an overweight
           African-American man, staring somberly into the fire.

                        Let us hail them both!

           There is some confusion over whom to hail first.

                             (watchfully)
                        I think it would be wise to stop yelling
                        now.

                        And raise mead to our realm Laconia,

                        HAIL LACONIA! HAIL DARKON!

           Suddenly, a cloaked figure enters the circle of
           firelight. All stand and grab their swords.

                                  SKIP AS BANNOR
                        Hold, stranger! Who do I see?

           The figure throws back his hood to reveal a beefy, pouch-
           cheeked white man, 38. This is DARIUS... but he is acting
           strangely.

                             (leaping to his feet in joy)

                        Wait, Marius, no!

           Despite Karnage’s warning, Marius rushes to embrace his
           twin. Darius shambles forward, zombie-like.

                                  DARIUS
                        Brains!

           He grabs Marius and pretends to bite his neck.

                                  MARIUS
                        Aaaah! I have been mortally wounded!

                                  KARNAGE
                        Darius is undead, raised by black magic.
                             (beat)
                        We are under attack.

           Karnage reaches into his pouch and dons a full-head
           rubber skeleton mask--his regular battle regalia.

           One of the warriors of Laconia pulls Darius off Marius.
           He “binds” him symbolically by making him hold some rope.
                                                                      #

                        You are bound, death-walker.

           The rest form a circle with their backs to the campfire.

           In the dark, they hear the rhythmic BEATING OF SWORDS ON
           SHIELDS. Of course, they are plywood shields and foam
           swords, but it’s still unnerving.

           Then, from the darkness spring six warriors of the
           team/”realm” ARKOPOLIS, clad in purple and white. With
           them is a white-clad ELDER, one of Darkon’s referees.

                                  DUKE MANIFRED OF ARKOPOLIS
                        Men of Arkopolis! Attack!
           As the Elder observes, the two teams engage in hand to
           hand combat. As Carnage fights with his foam staff, Skip
           hits an Arkopolitan with his orange sword.

                        Aaaahh! I am mortally wounded!

           Cut to a Laconian warrior limping on a stiffened leg.

                                  LACONIAN WARRIOR
                        Help! I have been wounded! Mage!

           Karnage spins, pulling a small plastic bottle from a
           leather pouch on his belt.

                                  KARNAGE
                             (throws the potion)
                        Potion of healing!

           The Laconian warrior catches the potion and drinks it,
           but Karnage is caught off guard.

                        No!

           Skip rushes to Karnage’s side, but it’s too late.
           Angrily, and with surprising skill, Skip quickly takes
           out Manifred with a series of fierce blows.

           The remaining Laconians vanquish their enemies. The
           battle seems to be over. Skip kneels next to his fallen
           friend, Karnage.

                        It is spent.

           Karnage is role-playing his slow, painful death with
           great conviction, and it’s surprisingly convincing.

           The Elder clicks his stopwatch.

                        He has 30 seconds left before he has to
                        go to the underworld.

           Suddenly, from the forest, a terrifying HOWL is heard. It
           should be legitimately spooky.

           We cut to Zombie-Darius, crazy, wild-eyed, calling in
           response.

                                  DARIUS

                        Warg.

           We cut to the remaining Laconian warriors as they peer 
           out into the night, afraid.

                        Actually, it is a were-warg.

           The HOWL rings through the night again. Duke Manifred
           laughs cruelly as he “dies.”

                                  DUKE MANIFRED OF ARKOPOLIS
                        And it will slay you all--unless you are
                        packing some heavy magic.

                        The item! We must use it.
           Skip takes the carved box from his pocket and opens it,
           revealing a tacky woman’s brooch--costume jewelry.

                             (in awe)
                        The Brooch of Disruption....

                                  KARNAGE
                        It’s useless now, milord. I am nearly
                        dead, and you cannot recite the spell. 

           O/C, we hear the HORRIBLE SOUNDS of the growling warg as
           it attacks the Laconian warriors, fighting its way to
           Skip.

                                  KARNAGE (CONT’D)
                        Throw it into the woods! It will draw the
                        Warg and save our men.

                        Let it go, milord... let it go...

                                  ELDER
                             (checking his watch, blase)
                        That’s it. He’s dead.

                                  SKIP AS BANNOR
                             (mournful and frustrated)
                        Fuck!

                                  ELDER
                             (school-marmishly)
                        That language is out-of-game, Bannor.

                                  SKIP AS BANNOR
                             (he stands)
                        Jesus Fuck!

           Now truly, pissed, Skip turns to face the were-warg.

           The “were-warg” is actually a man in a wolf suit--like
           the mascot of a sports team. But in the dark it looks
           fearful, its glass “eyes” catching the firelight.

           Skip sees the beast finish off the last two Laconians.
           Because we catch the very end of the action, it actually
           looks pretty scary.
                                  ELDER
                             (as they “die”)
                        Instant death, instant death. Go to the
                        underworld.

           The were-warg now turns its eyes on Skip and growls
           menacingly. 

                                  SKIP AS BANNOR
                             (mustering his courage)
                        Come get some.

           Skip and the were-warg fight furiously. This must look
           halfway cool--not merely ridiculous. Skip is a good
           fighter, but he’s still clutching the Brooch, and it’s a
           handicap.

           Then, as Skip deflects a strong blow from the warg’s
           “claws”, Skip loses his footing, and begins to fall down
           a surprisingly steep, wooded slope.

                                  SKIP AS BANNOR (CONT’D)
                        Aaaaah!

           We cut to a close up on the face of the man wearing the
           warg-suit. He watches Skip fall.

                                  WERE-WARG
                        Oh, shit.

           Skip skids, stumbles, then finally trips and rolls
           violently downhill.

           EXT. A SHALLOW RIVER AT THE BASE OF THE HILL - CONTINUOUS

           Finally, Skip crashes into a shallow, swift little river
           in the woods. It’s still a little light out, the last
           touch of dusk still blueing the evening sky. 

                                                                      #
           Skip lies face up in the shallow pool, arms outstretched,
           his eyes blinking slowly, disoriented. There is an
           enormous dent in his breastplate.

           Cut to Skip’s hand, still loosely clutching the Brooch of
           Destruction. And then it slips from his palm.

           Cut to Skip’s POV, we see a house and deck overhanging
           the river on the other side. 

           TWO SMALL CHILDREN are staring over the railing in
           surprise. The little boy is holding a hot dog.
           Then THEIR FATHER appears, also staring. He’s wearing an
           apron and holding tongs. It’s a family barbecue.

           The hot dog slips from the little boy’s bun. He keeps
           staring.

           We cut to Skip, in pain, struggling to lift his head.

                                  SKIP
                        Hey there.

           The children and dad stare.

                                  LITTLE BOY
                        Spaceman?

           Skip shakes his head “no.”

                                  SKIP
                        ...knight in shining armor.

           His head falls back with a groan. We begin to hear Skip’s ****
           opening narration now, in voice-over. 

                                  SKIP (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Everybody wants to be a hero.

           Skip’s turns his head wearily to look down-river.

                                  SKIP (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But in real life, that doesn’t actually,
                        you know, happen...

           From Skip’s POV, we see the Brooch slipping over the
           stones, out of reach and down the river, followed by the
           hot dog.

           We cut to an aerial shot that moves over the
           Massachusetts countryside.

                                  SKIP (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        My name is Skip, and I live in Western
                        Massachusetts...three counties of failing
                        mill towns, dairy farms, and hippie
                        colleges along the Connecticut river. 

           As we continue we gradually dissolve to a lovingly hand
           drawn map of the mythical land called “Darkon.”

                                  SKIP (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But two weekends a month, my name is
                        Prince Bannor, and I live in Darkon.  
           As we continue to fly over the map it dissolves to a
           clearing where two large masses of Darkonites in full
           costume are rushing each other on a local soccer field. 

                                  SKIP (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Darkon is a game. A full contact medieval
                        fantasy sport.

           We cut to ground level to watch the fight. 

                                  SKIP (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Where warriors and wizards, thieves and
                        elves, all battle for glory in local
                        parks or overnight campouts.

           As he runs through the various players, we zoom in on a
           massive WARRIOR, a robed WIZARD, a pair of THIEVES in
           quasi-ninja garb, and finally a pack of “Dark Elves”
           shooting foam-tipped arrows from the sidelines. 

           The Elves are exceedingly weird and spooky, heavily
           pierced, with coal black make-up covering every inch of
           their faces.

           INT. A DEPRESSING CORPORATE OFFICE - EVENING

           We see KENYON STRUNK, 32, is sandy-haired, handsome, but
           paunchy. He’s hunched over his desk after hours, working
           on the “Big Map”--the official map of Darkon,
           painstakingly drawn on hexagonal graph paper. 
                                                                      #

                        We organize ourselves into Realms, like
                        teams--each controlling a certain number
                        of hexes on the Big Map.

           We look over Kenyon’s shoulder and see that he is
           coloring in MANY black hexes representing “Realm Mordom.”
           They surrounded the few green hexes of “Realm Laconia”
           like a great cancerous mass. Kenyon smiles grimly. 
                                                                      #

           EXT. A MEADOW FULL OF FLOWERS- A HOT SUMMER DAY

           We see Skip, in costume now as “Bannor,” leading the men
                                                                      #
           of Laconia in a huffing, sweaty, furious charge across a *****
           field of bright yellow flowers.

                                  SKIP (V.O.)
                        My realm is Laconia--a band of 12 noble
                        adventurers.
           We pull back to see that Skip is running alongside Kenyon
           Strunk. Except now Kenyon is in costume--cruel red and
           black armor. And he leads a huge group of black-clad
           warriors: the host of MORDOM.
                                                                      #

                        Realm in the whole game...  

           Though they are charging together, Kenyon soon overtakes *****
           Skip with a cocky grin. His warriors swarm around and
           finally pass Realm Laconia, leaving them in the dust.

           EXT. A WOODED GLADE - A FALL AFTERNOON

           We see Skip in costume standing in a wooded glade, autumn
                                                                      #
           leaves falling around him. He’s staring down a figure in *****
           a ridiculous “monster” suit made of huge hunks of raw
           foam rubber, twine, tape, and plastic googly eyes. 

                                  SKIP (V.O.)
                        People talk all the time about conquering
                        their demons.

           Now we see Skip ready to engage in a fight to the death.  ****

                                  SKIP  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I actually get to conquer demons.

           Skip, with brutal passion, “kills” the monster. 

           The monster falls to its foam rubber knees.

                                  SKIP (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I can’t tell you how awesome that feels. 

           EXT. A SNOWY PLAIN - A GRIM WINTER’S EVENING

           We cut now to Kenyon, in his cruel red and black costume. *****
           He towers over a TRIVIUS, a fat hapless guy, 20, on his
           knees, blubbering in the soggy snow. He wears a
           ridiculous helmet made out of a plastic 5 gallon syrup
           jug.

                                  TRIVIUS
                        Mercy!

           Kenyon slashes down. We do not see the hit. We just hear
           the SCREAM and see the empty plastic jug/helmet rolling
           across the field.

                                  SKIP (V.O.)
                        Another good thing about Darkon is, you
                        never die, you just get killed.

           Now we come back to the hapless guy, kneeling in the
           grass, rubbing his neck, whining.

                                  TRIVIUS
                        Ow....

           INT. A NEARLY EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY

           As Skip speaks, we see a brief montage of Darkonites
           disrobing.
                                                                      #

           -We see the guy who had been playing the “warg” in his
           bedroom, brushing the brambles out of the costume’s
           synthetic fur.
                                                                      #

           -We see the foam rubber “monster” struggling to get its
           foam rubber head off. Perhaps to our surprise, we see the
           “monster” is a woman in her thirties.
                                                                      #

           -We see Skip in the carport of his crummy, 80’s era
           house, patiently banging out the dent on his breastplate
           with a hammer.

                        Sometimes I feel like I was born in the
                        wrong time. 

           We see Skip inside his house, full of junky, cast-off
           furniture. He’s got a huge pile of laundry in his hands,
           and he’s trying desperately to pick a stray sock up off
           the floor without letting the whole pile fall.

           Meanwhile, his older brother CHAZ, 35, an off-duty
           Marine, sits on the couch, staring off into space, doing
           absolutely nothing to help Skip. 
                                                                      #

           I/E. CITY BUS - DAY

           We cut to Skip riding the city bus. He’s in full costume. *****
           He’s got his sword with him, and now we can clearly see
           the foam and duct tape. People are staring at him.

                                  SKIP (V.O.)
                        I know I am capable of great things. I
                        just need a chance to show it.

           We cut to Skip’s POV of the passing street--a typical
           abandoned American main street in a once-thriving town: a *****
           struggling hardware store, an empty Subway sandwich shop, *****
           and lines of empty storefronts.

                        But in Darkon, at least, I will finally
                        be recognized.

           We come back to Skip on the bus. A senior citizen sits
           down and eyes him, dubiously.
                                                                      #

                        They will say, here was a leader. Here
                        was a man who went to war, who triumphed
                        in great battles, who won the day.
           Skip struggles to exit the narrow doors of the bus with
           all his gear.  

                                  SKIP (CONT’D)
                        In Darkon, I will triumph. It is my
                        destiny.

           The doors close behind him as the VO ends.

           EXT. SKIP’S CARPORT - DAY

           Skip is still hammering at his armor, we can also see
           Chaz sitting nearby, silently buffing his old dress
           uniform shoes.

           Just back from Afghanistan, Chaz is depressed and sort of
           drifting through life--a huge lug who is smarter than he
           seems (though to be fair, he often seems very, very
           dumb.) He’s wearing a USMC T-Shirt. 
                                                                      #

           We linger on the two brothers for a moment, working on
           their respective uniforms.  

           They have an old TV propped up on a milk crate: it’s CNN,
           and we hear a newscaster discussing the Presidents’
           “surge” strategy in Iraq. 

                                  CHAZ
                        Fucking idiots.

           Skip is unsure of how to respond.

                                  CHAZ (CONT’D)
                        They spelled Afghanistan wrong on the
                        crawl.

           Skip nods: uh huh.

                                  CHAZ (CONT’D)
                             (deep sigh)
                        Again.

           It should be very hard to tell how much Chaz cares about
           anything. He’s completely lost.

           JILLIA, 26, buxom and pretty and heavily tattooed, comes
           out into the carport, her hair still wet from the shower.

           She gives skip a long, deep, soul kiss. It’s gross.

                                  JILLIA
                        Milord.

                        Can you catch a ride with your brother?
                                                                      #

           Wordlessly, Chaz puts down his shoes and grabs his keys.

                                  SKIP
                        Yeah, sure.

           I/E. SKIP’S SHITTY SUBARU - DAY

           Chaz is driving Skip to work.

                                  CHAZ
                        You have to learn how to drive, bro.

                                  SKIP
                        I know how to drive. I just don’t have a
                        license.

                                  CHAZ
                        Don’t get me wrong. I love driving this
                        sweet, sweet Subaru. But you can’t be the
                        baby brother forever.

                                  SKIP
                        I’m not a baby.

                                  CHAZ
                        Your big brother gives you his old car.
                        Then you get your bigger brother to drive
                        you around in it. That makes you a baby.

                                  SKIP
                        No it doesn’t.

                                  CHAZ
                        A big baby.

                                  SKIP
                        I always catch a ride from someone. It’s
                        good for the environment. Car pooling.

                                  CHAZ
                             (deadpan)
                        You car pool with babies. Babies who wear
                        diapers.

                                  SKIP
                        That doesn’t make any sense.
                                  CHAZ
                        And diapers are shit for the environment.
                        So there goes your whole argument.

                                  SKIP
                        You’re insane.

           Chaz gives him a long, angry look: has Skip crossed a
           line?

                                  CHAZ
                             (laughs)
                        I’m just fucking with you.
                             (Then, cheerfully)
                        Oh, hey, I wanted to tell you: I heard
                        you doing it with your lady last night.

                                  CHAZ
                        Just thought you should know. Thin walls.

                                  SKIP
                        Oh, god. I’m sorry.

                                  CHAZ
                        I’m not complaining. I love it.
                                                                      #

                        What? That’s disgusting.

                                  CHAZ
                        I think it’s awesome that my baby brother
                        is having loud sex with a saucy young
                        wench.

                                  CHAZ
                        But you better watch out.

                        Jillia. You met her through your game
                        right? Darkon?
                                  SKIP
                        Sort of. At the Renaissance Faire. It’s

                                  CHAZ
                        Whatever... You had the armor on when you
                        met her?

                        Just answer, Galahad. Armor: yea or nay?

                        Well, there you go: chicks dig the
                        uniform.

                                  SKIP
                        If you want to make fun of me, just do
                        it. Don’t drag Jillia into it.

                                  CHAZ
                        No, bro, I see it all the time in the
                        Marines. Some girls, they just like being
                        with warriors. Drives them NUTS.
                        And those kinds of girls: they make a lot
                        of noise.

                                  SKIP
                        OK. Fine.

                        When they have sex, I mean.

                                  SKIP
                        Got it.

                                  CHAZ
                        But the thing is: it’s not you. It’s the
                        uniform. If they see another one they
                        like better, say goodbye.

                                  SKIP
                        I don’t think that’s going to happen.

                        Good. I hope it doesn’t. Believe me, I
                        WANT to hear you having sex. It’s really
                        one of my few pleasures.
           EXT. EMPIRES MINIATURES - DAY

           The shitty Subaru pulls up an old 19th century grist mill
           on the terraced banks of a loud river. This is the
           McIntyre family business, Empires Miniatures. 

           Once the premiere maker of lead figurines for Dungeons
           and Dragons and the like, Empires now caters to an ever-
           dwindling market of tabletop gamers and collectors.

           A weathered sign bearing the company logo--a silhouette
           of a castle tower--hangs above the door.

           Skip gets out of the car.

                                  SKIP
                        You want to come in and do some work?

                                  CHAZ
                        Nah. 

                                  SKIP
                        What are you going to do?

                                  CHAZ
                             (shrugs)
                        I’m just gonna keep it breezy.

                                  SKIP
                             (resigned)
                        Ok.

           Skip closes the door. The second he closes the door he
           jumps as Chaz turns on the RADIO VERY LOUDLY. Weirdly,
           it’s “This American Life.” Chaz screams out of the lot.
                                                                      #

           INT. EMPIRES MINIATURES - LATER

           Skip is hunched over his worktable, sculpting a halfling
           out of a green epoxy putty.

           Over his shoulder, we see an old, framed article from
           “Dragon” Magazine. It’s a profile of Skip’s father,
           Malcolm “Mal” McIntyre, with a photo of his three sons,
           Chaz, Malcolm, Jr., and Skip--still just a child.
                                                                      #

           The headline reads: “A Miniature Dynasty: Will McIntyre
           and Sons Dominate Fantasy Miniatures Forever?”

           We pull closer in to read the pull-quote from Mal, Sr.:
           “’As long as kids are still playing with toys that are
           made out of lead, I don’t see how we can fail,’ says the
           proud father of three avid gamers...”

           We pull even closer in to read the article date: 1982

           As we pull back out to see Skip working, MALCOLM, SR. and
           MALCOM, JR. walk by, talking business.

           Mal, Sr., 67, is spindly, affable, with a wispy mustache.
           He’s a businessman who made his money in the 70s and
           still dresses that way. He is completely un-glamorous.

           Mal, Jr., 34, wears business casual and looks more like
           he collects Successories posters than fantasy miniatures.

                                  MAL, JR.
                        Dad, the detail you’re able to get with
                        this plastic is better than anything
                        we’ve ever seen. And it’s cheaper.

           Half listening, Mal, Sr. pats Skip’s shoulder.

                                  MAL, SR.
                        Morning, Skip.

                                  SKIP
                        Hey, dad.

                                  MAL, SR.
                             (to Mal, Jr.)
                        OK, OK, Mal, I’ll think it over. 

           Mal, Sr. walks on to his office, leaving Mal, Jr. behind.

                                  MAL, JR.
                        Terrific, dad.
                                                                      #

           Mal, Jr., hangs around, looking over Skip’s shoulder.

                                  MAL, JR. (CONT’D)
                        So how’s that hobbit coming along, Skip?

                                  SKIP
                             (not bothering to look up)
                        Actually, it’s a halfling, Mal.

                                  MAL, JR.
                        Right. Of course. “Halfling.” Because if
                        we called it a “hobbit,” we might
                        actually, you know, sell some of them. I
                        mean, even I know what a hobbit is.
                                  SKIP
                        No you don’t.

                                  MAL, JR.
                        Sure I do. Little hairy guys. The guy
                        from “Rudy” was one.

                                  SKIP
                             (losing control a little)
                        OK, Mal. According to Tolkien, there are
                        three kinds of hobbits. I’ll give you two
                        of them: Fallohides and Harfoots. What’s
                        the third?

                                  MAL, JR.
                        Yeah. I guess you got me there, Skip. Are
                        they “Rudies”?

                                  SKIP
                        STOORS! Stoors are the third kind of
                        hobbit. Our customers know that. Even dad
                        knows that. You should know that, Mal.

                                  MAL, JR.
                             (unfazed)
                        Okey doke. Let me know when you get back
                        from middle earth, little brother. 

           Skip turns back to his work and seethes. 

           EXT. A RENAISSANCE FAIRE - DAY 

           We cut to Skip as Bannor, his sword aloft, screaming...

                                  SKIP AS BANNOR
                        TO WAR!!!!

           The realms of Darkon are fighting on a large open field
           abutting a bustling Renaissance Faire. 

           Among those playing are halpess “Trivius,” plus Skip and
                                                                      #
           Laconia. But here we will mainly see THE POWER OF MORDOM. *****

           Standing beside Skip is Mordom’s leader, Kenyon, in full
           costume as “Lord Derleth.” He raises his black sword and
           echoes Skip’s cry...
                                                                      #

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH
                        TO WAR!!!!!
           As they rush to battle, we cut to a group of spectators--
           some in contemporary clothes, some in Ren Faire costume--
           watching with a mix of awe and scorn. A banner ID’s the
           locale as the New York State Renaissance Faire, held
           annually in Tuxedo Park.

           We cut back to Skip’s POV in mid-charge. We see the
           opposing army getting closer and closer--it should be a
           little scary. Finally the armies meet and the foam swords
           clash.

                                                                      #
           Skip and Kenyon fight side by side, directing their
           armies.

                                  SKIP AS BANNOR
                        Laconia, now is your time!

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH
                        Mordomite archers! First volley!

           On his precise word, a volley of foam-tipped arrows fly
           over Skip and Kenyon and into the opposing armies.

                                  SKIP AS BANNOR
                             (awed by Mordom’s precision)
                              Wow.

           We follow the Mordom arrows as they connect with their
           targets: the feeble men Realm Trembelaine, led by
           Trivius. He no longer has his plastic jug helmet, instead
           sporting a huge cylindrical ice-cream container with a
           hole cut out for his face.
                                                                      #
                                                                      #
                                                                      #

           An arrow hits a Trembelanian warrior in the chest.

                                  TREMBELANIAN WARRIOR
                        Ooff! Mortal wound!

           An arrow strikes Trivius’s left arm. He whines...

                                  TRIVIUS
                        Ow!
                             (Then, happily...)
                        Light wound! Light wound to my left arm!

           We cut back to Kenyon.

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH
                        Javelins, now!

                                  SKIP AS BANNOR
                             (to himself)
                        Javelins? Really?
           A volley of foam tipped javelins fly through the air.

           We cut to Trivius as a javelin hits him squarely in the
           ice-cream drum. 

                                  TRIVIUS
                        AAAHHH!

           He immediately topples over, and Kenyon can’t help but
           laugh.

           Suddenly, the line of enemy soldiers parts to reveal five
           EVIL WIZARDS in tall, peaked caps. They swagger cockily
           into the fray.

           We cut to Karnage as he catches sight of them.

                                  KARNAGE
                        Oh, no.... 
                             (freaking out)
                        EVIL WIZARDS! 

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH
                             (keeping his cool)
                        Magic on the field! Prepare for
                        spellballs!

                                  ALL MORDOMITES
                        MORDOM HO!

           In unison, the Mordomite warriors huddle and raise their
           shields in precise formation, like the Spartans in “300.”  ***

           Dozens of “spellballs” (actually multi-colored hacky-
           sacks) rain down on their shield.

           Barely dodging a spellball himself, Skip is impressed.

                                  SKIP AS BANNOR
                        Jesus Christ....

           We cut to the Evil Wizards, throwing their spellballs.
           Before they throw each ball, they have to invoke the
           particular spell they are casting.

                                  EVIL WIZARD
                        Dark Magic undo his brain!

           He throws a red spell ball. We then cut back to the
           forces of Laconia to watch as it hits Darius
                                  DARIUS
                        I am struck by a red spellball! The spell
                        of feeble-mindedness!

           He begins to grunt and stumble around, acting
           “feebleminded.” He is a terrible actor.

           CUT TO:

           ...a snobby Ren Faire participant watching Darius from
           the sidelines. He is dressed like Captain Jack Sparrow.
           He rolls his eyes.

                                  SNOBBY JACK SPARROW
                        Now, that’s just ridiculous.

           BACK TO:

           ...Darius, acting feeble-minded, right in Skip’s face

                                  SKIP AS BANNOR
                        Jesus, Marius, get your brother away from
                        me! 
                             (to Kenyon)
                        We have to take those Wizards out. Prince
                        Derleth, do you join me in arms?

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH
                        You’re a bold one, Prince Bannor. Fight
                        on!

           The two press forward together into the enemy lines,
           fighting their way to the Evil Wizards.

           They easily “kill” the Evil Wizards, as a white-garbed
           Elder looks on.

                                  ELDER
                        All you Wizards go to the Underworld.

           EXT. UNDERWORLD - DAY

           We take a break from the action to go to the
           “Underworld”... a sort of penalty box on the sidelines
           where players go when they are “killed.”

                                  UNDERWORLD ELDER
                             (to a spindly Darkonite)
                        That’s 30 minutes, Doonadeen. You are
                        returned to life.

           The spindly Darkonite returns to the battle.
           One of the Evil Wizards arrives and sits next to a
           scowling player who’s smoking a cigarette.

                                  EVIL WIZARD
                             Can I bum one?

           EXT. REN FAIRE BATTLEFIELD - DAY

           Back in the thick of battle, Skip and Kenyon have
           cornered Trivius. All his men are dead. His is
           defenseless.
                                                                      #

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH
                        This stripling’s mine.

                                  SKIP AS BANNOR
                             (shrugging)
                        Okey doke.

           Trivius turns and runs wildly, and Kenyon pursues him,
           leaving Skip behind to blithely turn to the next foe.
                                                                      #
                                                                      #

           We follow Trivius as he weaves through the fighting
           Darkonites. He then flees the battle entirely, reaching a
           wooded area at the edge of the meadow. 

           He looks behind him and smiles. He seems to have escaped.
           When he turns around again, though, he is suddenly
           surrounded by a group of 12 DARK ELVES, including one we
           have not seen before.

           This is REBECCA DILLON, 28, in character as “Elvenmaid.”
           She is beautiful, with long, curly red-brown hair. We
           would call her voluptuous, though others might call her
           overweight. We don’t listen to them. 

           Of all the Elves, only Rebecca does not wear the creepy
           black make up. But she joins her comrades in an evil
           grin: Trivius has been caught.
                                                                      #

           The King of the Elves is DELVER, 35: tall, willowy,
           heavily pierced, with spooky red contact lenses. He
           speaks in a strange, made-up language called Elftongue

                                  DELVER, ELF-KING
                        Ni, hychydig bryf?

                                  TRIVIUS
                        I don’t understand!
                                  DELVER, ELF-KING
                             (almost hissing)
                        Little bug, web-caught, struggling.
                        Mordom gets its juicy bug. Elveses get
                        their gold. What gets the little man-bug?

                                  TRIVIUS
                        I... I don’t know.

           Now Kenyon has come up behind Trivius and turns him
           around by the shoulder.

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH
                        The sword!

           He raises his sword high and slashes down.

           EXT. REN FAIRE BATTLEFIELD SIDELINES - LATER

           We cut immediately to Skip, raising a pewter tankard of
           beer above his head.

                                  SKIP
                        Hail Laconia!

                                  ALL LACONIANS
                        Hail!

           Skip chugs the beer down and laughs merrily. The battle
           is over, and all the players have gathered by the
           sidelines to relax and drink beer from tankards they have
           brought from home. Skip is not technically in character
           any more, though he is still in costume. And he is drunk.

                                  SKIP
                        Now, where’s Jillia?

           Skip walks, and we follow him. As he goes, we see other
           players packing up their swords, taking off their monster
           costumes, etc.

           Then Skip catches sight of something that makes him
           pause. Kenyon and his Mordomites have Trivius surrounded
           by the side of the field. Apparently they’re not quite
           done playing the game yet. 

                                  TRIVIUS
                             (kneeling)
                        Goddess protect me!
                                  KENYON AS DERLETH
                             (circling him)
                        No goddess will protect you, apostate.

                                  ALL MORDOMITES
                        MORDOM HO!

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH
                        Our god, the ONE true god, is the Red
                        Griffin known as Mordom. And his talons
                        shall tear your flesh.

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH
                             (leans in, quietly)
                        I have already killed you four times. You
                        know what comes next.

                                  TRIVIUS
                             (confused)
                        What? What comes next?

                        Pathetic. Before you meet me in battle
                        again, read the fucking rules.

           Kenyon pats Trivius on the cheek condescendingly. 

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH (CONT’D)
                        Mordom departs.

           He turns and walks away, and the Mordomites follow him
           with fascist precision.

                                  ALL MORDOMITES
                        MORDOM HO! MORDOM HO! MORDOM HO!

           Skip witnesses this whole display, unsure of what to make
           of it--maybe even a little admiring...

                                  SKIP
                        Wow. That’s hardcore. 

           Before he can consider it further, Jillia grabs Skip. She
           is wearing an absurdly suggestive corset.

                                  JILLIA
                        Kiss me, my prince.
           They kiss. Skip thinks they’re done. But then Jillia
           pulls him back in for an almost unbearably graphic tongue
           kiss. Skip is embarrassed.

                                  JILLIA (CONT’D)
                        I have to go back to the crystal shop to
                        get my paycheck, and then I want to meet
                        you in the corn maze.

                        I know corners of that corn maze that no
                        one has ever seen. Corners that will blow
                        your mind.

           She kisses him again.

                        And bring a turkey leg. I’m starving.

           He watches her flounce off and continues his happy
           stroll.

           He grabs another beer and spies Karnage, now unmasked,
           who is having an argument with Snobby Jack Sparrow.

                        some magical fantasy world.

                        us to come...

           Then Skip sees something by the treeline of the meadow.

           We cut to his POV to see the Dark Elves gathered among
           the trees. One by one, they disappear into the woods.
           It’s theatrical and silly and spooky all at once.

           We cut back to Skip’s reaction as he watches.

                        Verily, the Dark Elves are mysterious.
                        They choose no company but their own, no
                        allegiance but to the gold they horde in
                        their dark caverns... to which, I
                        suppose, they return now.

           Skip shoots him a look.

                                                                      #
           While Skip will often lapse into modern slang while
           playing Darkon, Karnage keeps strictly to the pseudo-
           medieval, flowery “gamespeak” preferred during in-game
           conversations. In fact he's rather good at it, often
           verging on accidental geek poetry.

                                  SKIP
                        But who is that with them? The one
                        without the make up?

           We cut to Rebecca, among the trees. Just before she
           disappears, she catches Skip’s eye and almost seems to
           smile.
                                                                      #

                        speak elf. And yet, her face... her face
                        is silent.
           Long beat as Skip stares at his friend. This is pouring
           on the gamespeak a bit too thick for him.

           EXT. INSIDE THE CORN MAZE- A LITTLE LATER

           Skip is standing in a maze carved out of a tall corn
           field. He’s holding two turkey legs and his tankard. He
           tries to take a drink, but it’s hard with the turkey
           legs. He has clearly been waiting a long time.

           Giving up, he navigates out of the maze, turkey legs in
           hand, and begins searching for Jillia. 

           He wanders drunkenly through the Ren Faire “town square”-- ***
           a semi-permanent assembly of shops and tents selling
           costumes, medieval knick knacks, and, incongruously,
           patio furniture and garden sheds.

           Close up on a leering dragon’s head made of crystal,
           mounted atop a carved wooden staff. It shudders
           rhythmically. It doesn’t take much to figure out what is
           causing the motion: if this tent is rocking, you should
           not bother knocking.

           blue robes and a starry cap, are half naked, doing it.
           Skip drops his turkey legs. 
                                                                      #

           Skip backs out of the tent quickly. He takes a breath,
           and goes back in.

           Jillia and the Ren Faire Wizard are composing themselves.

                                  JILLIA (CONT’D)

           Skip storms out.

           There is an awkward moment as Julia and Jeff watch the
           flapping tent door.
           After a moment, Jeff leans in to kiss her again. She
           gently rebuffs him.

           But then, after very brief consideration, she turns and
           throws herself at him.

           Skip sweeps up the small driveway by the river, very
           hungover. The old grist mill is actually pretty
           beautiful: a kind of 19th century Yankee Rivendell.
                                                                      #

           Skip sweeps for a bit. Then he calmly puts the broom down
           and walks to a railing overlooking the river. He vomits.

           When he turns around, his sees his father standing there,
           very concerned.

                        Is that what’s bothering you?
                                  SKIP
                        Well, yeah. Of course.

                        Oh. I figured Mal, Jr. must have said
                        something to you.

                                  SKIP
                        About Jeff the Wizard?

                        No, Skip. About the company.

                                  SKIP
                        What about the company?

                                  MAL, SR.
                        I’m retiring, Skip.

           Skip’s ears immediately prick up. He’s been waiting to
           hear this news for a long time. Still, he has to act
           shocked.

                                  SKIP
                        Wow. That’s... I mean, the end of an era.

                                  MAL, SR.
                        OK. OK. You don’t have to act sad, Skip.
                        This isn’t bad news. We all did a good
                        job, and I’m happy to retire.

                                  SKIP
                        But, Dad, it’s not like it’s all over.
                        Because, you know. I want to keep it
                        going.

                                  MAL, SR.
                             (sadly)
                        I know you want to, Skip. But I can’t let
                        you.

                                  SKIP
                        Yes you can! Of course you can!

           Mal, Sr. looks at his son for a long beat, sadly.

                                  SKIP (CONT’D)
                        You’re giving the business to Mal.

           Mal, Sr. nods sympathetically. 
           I/E. EMPIRES CUPOLA - CONTINUOUS

           As they continue to talk, we cut to a shot of Mal, Jr...
           He’s high up in the building’s old cupola, looking out
           over the river, grinning triumphantly.

                        No, Skip. You don’t realize it, but he’s
                        saved Empires, several times.

           As Mal continues to grin, we cut to a close up of his
           hands... he’s cradling a prototype of a figurine of the
           one of the torturers from “Hostel.”

           Then we see his face as he admires it...

                                  MAL, SR.
                        I love you, son. But that world is dying.

                        I can tell you for sure that’s not true.

                                  MAL, SR.
                        Of course it is, Skip. It was dying the
                        year you were born.
                             (beat. Then, reminiscing...)
                        In the seventies this was a nice
                        business. But with the computers, forget
                        it. There probably aren’t 30,000 tabletop
                        gamers in the whole country now.

           Skip broods for a moment.

                        No, Dad! You can’t take the company you
                        built out of nothing and just hand it all
                        over to that happystick MBA shitbag!

                        That’s not how the story is supposed to
                        end, Dad!

           Mal, Sr. shrugs sadly. He seems to know that this is
           precisely Skip’s problem.

                                  MAL, SR.
                        It’s not a story, Skip.

           Skip stands up and goes back to sweeping. Angrily

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - THAT AFTERNOON

           Skip is walking along the two lane road, dejected.

           Skip walks past The Wagon Wheel, a local burger and soft
           serve ice cream place.

           He sees Chaz sitting at a picnic table eating an enormous
           soft serve cone dipped in chocolate magic shell (AKA
           Foster’s Freeze). Skip walks over.

           Skip shakes his head, befuddled. He sits down.

                        I have a question for you.

           Skip is speechless--are you kidding me?!

                        Yeah. He came over when you were on your
                        big campout in the woods. He picked her
                        up. In his car.
                             (pointedly)
                        Yup. He’s a driver.

                        I don’t know. He’s a wizard. You’re a
                        Prince Bannor or whatever. I thought
                        maybe you were into it.

           EXT. STATE FOREST PARKING LOT - DAY

           It’s the following weekend, and another overnight Darkon
           campout, this time at a Connecticut State Forest. 

           Skip and Karnage are in the parking lot, waiting in line
           to have their equipment checked by an Elder.

                                  KARNAGE
                        Milord seems distracted. Are thee ready

                        Can it, Karnage. We’re not in game yet.

           Karnage, hurt, puts on his mask.

           They hand their weapons and other paraphernalia to the
           Elder, who is seated at a folding card table. 

                                  ELDER
                        Your weaponry is appropriate, Prince
                        Bannor and Karnage. You may enter the
                        realm of Darkon.

                        Let’s bust some heads, Laconia!

           EXT. A PEACEFUL GLADE - DAY

           Skip and Laconia are in the midst of a skirmish with
           Arkopolis, while Mordom is engaged elsewhere in the
           forest. 

           Skip is fighting lazily. Angrily. Badly. An Arkopolitan
           clubs him in the side.

                                  ARKOPOLITIAN
                        Green club! blessed hit! Double damage!

           Skip ignores him and slashes at him with his sword.

                                  ARKOPOLITIAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Don’t you shake off my hit! You’re
                        dead, man!

                                  SKIP
                        It was a glancing blow, and I’m wearing

                                  ARKOPOLITIAN
                        It was a BLESSED HIT!

           An elder steps in.
                                  ELDER
                        Ungomiel is right, Bannor. Go to the
                        Underworld.

                                  SKIP
                        Fine. Whatever.

           He stalks off, leaving Karnage behind.

           EXT. APPROACHING THE UNDERWORLD - DA

           Skip walks towards the Underworld in a forest clearing.

           He spies someone in the treeline off to the left. It’s
           Rebecca, in Elven costume. She catches his eye and
           gestures for him to follow her.

                                                                      #
           Skip looks to the Elder waiting for him at the
           Underworld, and then to Rebecca. Something in his eyes
           says “Fuck it.” He walks past the Underworld and heads
           for the trees.

           EXT. DEEP IN THE STATE FOREST - DAY

           Skip follows Rebecca through the woods. She is fast, and
           he barely keeps up with her as she laughs and taunts him.
           They are headed uphill.

           EXT. ABOVE THE RAVINE - DAY

           She stops at the top of a small hillock. Suddenly, her
           mood shifts from flirtatious to serious, urgent.

                                  REBECCA AS ELVENMAID
                        Ach yn cwffio'r brwydra, Bendefig Bannor.

           Skip doesn’t understand.

                                  REBECCA
                             Agor'ch chreuau a canfod...

           She crouches and points through the brush. Skip joins her
           and looks down into the shallow ravine below them, where
           another Darkon battle has just concluded. 

           Skip sees Trivius once again kneeling before Kenyon and
           Mordom. Many more from other realms are watching. There
           is an air of ceremony and dread to what’s happening.
           EXT. IN THE RAVINE - CONTINUOUS

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH
                        Well, Trivius, this is the end. 

                                  TRIVIUS
                        Please don’t kill me!
                                                                      #

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH
                        Now you understand, don’t you? What it
                        means if I kill you now? No underworld.
                        No regeneration. Just: death.

                                  TRIVIUS
                        Yes! I read the rules! I’m sorry!

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH
                             (almost kindly)
                        I am a warrior, not an executioner. So it
                        gives me no pleasure to do what I must.

           Kenyon draws his sword and “cuts off” Trivius’s head.

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH (CONT’D)
                             (without emotion)
                        Black damage to the mortally wounded.
                        Instant death.

                                  ELDER
                        Final-Kill! No regeneration! Sorry, kid.

           The host of Mordom cheers.

                                  ALL MORDOMITES
                        MORDOM HO! MORDOM HO! MORDOM HO!

                                                                      #

           Trivius openly weeps. He is not role playing. According
           to the rules, after 5 consecutive deaths in battle, the
           character is considered to be so weak that the player
           must retire it forever.

           In a cheerless ceremony, TRIVIUS'S armor is stripped from
           his body by the Mordomites.
                                                                      #

           It's pretty shitty armor, actually: a lot of corrugated
           cardboard and plastic. When KENYON takes apart Trivius’s
           newest helmet and sees that it's made from a colander,
           even he breaks character for a moment.

                                  KENYON.
                        Oh, come on.
           EXT. ABOVE THE RAVINE - CONTINUOUS

           From their hiding spot, Rebecca watches this humiliation
           angrily. Skip watches as though he’s really seeing what a
           jerk Kenyon is for the first time. Rebecca now speaks
           firmly.

                                  REBECCA AS ELVENMAID
                        Dyma'r anturia argeisi. Dyma'r brwydra'ch
                        baffio.

           Skip doesn’t understand. But he gets the message. This is
           wrong. He looks down to the ravine again.

           EXT. IN THE RAVINE - CONTINUOUS

           Back in the Ravine, “Trivius” is gone. He is now merely
           some FAT KID NAMED PETE, blotchy patches of red shame
           spreading across his face, blubbering alone in his black
           sweatpants and an oversized t-shirt that’s soaked with
           sweat and the misty rain that’s begun to fall.

           EXT. ABOVE THE RAVINE - CONTINUOUS

           Skip turns back to where Rebecca had been crouched beside
           him

           She is gone, replaced by a different Dark Elf in full
           make up who cackles a horrible laugh right in his face,
           sending Skip over onto his back in shock.

           The LAUGHING ELF howls hysterically and begins singing a
           loud, bawdy-sounding song in Elftongue. The Elf dances
           through the forest, leaving Skip on his back in the ferns
           and the muck.

                                  SKIP
                        Fucking elves.

           EXT. STATE FOREST PARKING LOT - LATER

           Skip rejoins Laconia near the parking area, The day is
           done, and everyone is partying around a small bonfire,
           which sputters in the misty drizzle. 

                                  KARNAGE
                        The men were wondering where you went.

                        The men were concerned that you had
                        abandoned them. 

           Skip is a little dazed--his world has just been rocked.

                                  SKIP
                        Tell them.... I followed an elf into the

                        Twice. 

           At the bonfire, Kenyon stands with his foot cocked on a
           battered aluminum beer keg.

                        not drink with me, old friend?

           Skip closes his eyes, decides, and opens them again. 

                                  SKIP AS BANNOR
                        Because I am not your friend anymore.

                        You shouldn’t have final-killed Trivius.

                        Milwaukee. If you are killed in five
                        consecutive battles, that is the end of
                        your character. Trivius can create a new
                        character, hopefully a stronger
                        character. Certainly a wiser one. It is
                        how we have all grown in Darkon.

           INT. EMPIRES MINIATURES - SOME DAYS LATER

           Skip is at his workbench. A half-completed plastic
           statuette of a torture scene from the movie “Saw” is on a
           stand beside him, but he is studying the “Big Map” of

                        Really? Jesus, how old are you?

                        Huh. Anyway. I come as an envoy from the
                        Moon Mountains. This thing you have with
                        Mordom. We’ll back you up.

                                  SKIP
                        Really?

                                  DAMON
                        Yeah. Kenyon’s a shit and a half. Plus,
                        he’s taken a lot of hexes from us. Buncha
                        of iron mines, silver mines, some
                        castles. We’d love some payback.

                                  SKIP
                        Wow. OK. Great!

                                  DAMON
                        But listen: we don’t want to be on the
                        losing side of this.

                                  SKIP
                        Uh, huh.

           There’s a long, long pause.

                                  DAMON
                        So what we want to know is, are you going
                        to pull it off?

                                                                      #
           Skip realizes he is going to have to really sell this
           one.

                                  SKIP
                        Yes. With the warriors of the Moon
                        Mountains... and others will join us
                        too... we WILL defeat Mordom. You have my
                        word as a member of the noble council.

           Damon studies him for a moment. Then shakes his hand.

                                  DAMON
                        We swear allegiance.

           Skip is happy and amazed.

           That afternoon, Karnage is driving as Skip talks.
                                  SKIP
                        It was incredible. And four other realms
                        e-mailed their allegiance today, too.
                        This thing is really going to happen!

                                  KARNAGE
                        Mordom is still a strong foe.

                        They are remaining neutral for now. Like
                        many, they fear a vengeful Mordom should
                        we not prevail.

                                  SKIP
                        We’ll prevail. You ought to have seen
                        this guy. He’ll prevail all over their
                        asses. You’re coming tonight, right?

                        Yes. I am bringing beef jerky.

           INT. SKIP’S DOORWAY - THAT NIGHT

           Skip has called a big meeting at his house for all the
           realms that have joined him. As they arrive, Chaz greets
           them affably at the door.

           A GUY WITH AN ENORMOUS BEARD arrives.

                                  CHAZ
                        Awesome to see you. Entrez.

           A TALL GUY carrying a snake’s head staff arrives.

                                  CHAZ (CONT’D)
                        What is that, a snake’s head? NICE!

           Marius and Darius arrive together.

                                  CHAZ (CONT’D)
                        Hey! It’s the twins! Which is which?

           Hey, Chaz.
                                         Hey.

           Karnage arrives with beef jerky.

                        My man with the jerky!

                        Well, I’m allergic to products containing
                        gluten.

           INT. SKIP’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           20 Darkonites crowd around Skip and Karnage at the
           kitchen table, while Chaz watches golf in the living room

                                  MARIUS
                        So you’re saying they’re actually
                        building a castle?!

                        Actually, it is a plywood structure that
                        is merely fashioned to look like a
                        castle. But yes: Mordom gained permission
                        from the farm’s owner. They’ve been
                        building it now for a couple of days.

                                  DARIUS
                        And it’s two stories high?

                                  SKIP
                        Relax. It’s a psychological ploy. It’ll
                        be no different than storming an
                        imaginary structure. We’ve done it lots
                        of times before.

                                  KARNAGE
                        That isn’t the primary complication.

           Karnage pulls out a piece of hex paper where he’s
           sketched a map.

                        The Mordomite castle is at the top of
                        this hill. Its back is to the adjoining
                        property, so we can only approach it
                        through this narrow gully. It will be
                        hard to get our siege weapons up there.

                                  CHAZ
                             (shouting from the couch)
                        And an approaching column is like a
                        shooting gallery to a fortified position.
                        You’ll be massacred.
                             (watching TV again)

                        Come on. We won’t be massacred.

           Everyone seems doubtful.

                        massacred.

           Damon comes into the kitchen.

                                  DAMON
                        Skip. You’re getting an IM on your
                        computer. It’s the Elder of Elders.

           Everyone is shocked into silence.

                                  SKIP
                        Ok. Ok. Cool.

           They all crowd around Skip’s Ikea desk. It’s crammed with
           various books and papers and a huge old PC monitor.

           The screen reads... “THE ELDER OF ELDERS REQUESTS A VIDEO
           CHAT WITH YOU. DO YOU ACCEPT?”

           Skip adjusts his computer camera and clicks “Accept.”

           On screen, the face of a middle aged man comes into view:
           THE ELDER OF ELDERS, 51, is the founder of Darkon... a
           mysterious, eccentric burnout who first wrote the rules
           of the game in the 1980s. 

           The following conversation stutters along awkwardly as
           the video chat software attempts to keep up with the
           dialogue.

                                  ELDER OF ELDERS
                        Hello? Are you there?

                        Yes. I’m here.

                                  ELDER OF ELDERS
                        So. You’re “Bannor?”

                                  SKIP
                        Yes. Skip McIntyre. What should I call
                        you? “Elder of Elders?”

                        player? This “Lord Derleth?”

                        condition that I get your approval.

                                  ELDER OF ELDERS
                        Got it. But who is this guy? What’s the
                        big beef?

                                  SKIP
                        Well. Basically, sir, he’s choked off all
                        the hexes on the map. No one can grow
                        their territory, and if they try, he
                        bullies them out of it.

                        Bannor, this is a WAR game. The whole
                        point of this thing is to work out your
                        differences by FIGHTING.

                                  SKIP
                        OK. Well. I’ve thought a lot about this,
                        sir. And what I think is that Darkon is
                        something more than a war game.
                             (beat)
                        Look, in life, we all want to do great
                        things. To stand up for something. But
                        let’s face it. In real life, what do we
                        do? Our laundry. We go to work, take shit
                        from our bosses, go home, jack off before
                        we go to sleep, and then wake up and do
                        it all over again.

                        Sorry. I live in a really shitty town.
                             (clearly he’s rehearsed this)
                        But Darkon, in Darkon we have a chance to
                        be the hero. It’s not just land hexes and
                        gold pieces. That’s all Kenyon cares
                        about.

                        But most of us in Darkon, we’re fighting
                        for something bigger. We’re fighting for
                        a life that has meaning.

           The Elder of Elder takes it all in.

                                                                      #

                        from an old warrior, OK?

           The video chat ends, and the window goes black. Laconia
           and her allies cheer.

           INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

           The next day, Skip is standing in line for coffee. He has
           a big bag from the art supply store full of foam and
           other material for making weapons and armor and such.

                                                                      #
           As he waits, he sees the player once known as Trivius
           working behind the counter, fumbling hopelessly with the
           cash register.
           The Former Trivius catches sight of Skip, and beams-a
           friend!

           But Skip freaks out and leaves without speaking to him.
           Even though he's championing this kid’s cause, Skip still
           considers him something of a loser.

           EXT. BUS STOP - DAY

           Exiting Starbucks, Skip finds the bus stop and waits

           As he does, he notices Rebecca walking down Main Street
           toward him. He’s totally surprised and happy.

           As she approaches...

                        what we’re doing...

           But Rebecca refuses to speak as she walks right by him.

                        Out here, though, I’m Rebecca Dillon. And
                        the reason I didn’t talk to you is
                        because we’ve never met. Out here.

           She turns and walks to the end of the street. A
           convertible drives up, full of Dark Elves--out of make-
           up, but still very weird. She gets in back.

           He stares after her as they drive away. He is in love.

           EXT. THE CHRISTMAS TREE FARM - EVENING

           It is the weekend of THE SIEGE OF MORDOM. All the realms
           of Darkon have gathered at a farm they occasionally rent
           for campouts--30 hilly acres of mixed woods, meadows,
           dairy pasture, and a sprawling Christmas Tree farm. 
                                                                      #

           From above, we watch as some 120 Darkonites walk through
           the Christmas Trees and gather around an Elder, who
           stands upon a stump.

                                  ELDER
                        This will be an adventure of three nights
                        and two days. As always, Stone Trolls are
                        afoot, so be wary.
                                                                      #

                        All of the ancient relics of Darkon are
                        in use, including the Javelin of
                        Lightning, which Lady Mithandra of
                        Belkianland did us the favor of mending
                        last week.

           General applause. LADY MITHANDRA holds a yellow foam-
           covered PVC pipe above her head proudly.

                        But as you know, the Brooch of Disruption
                        remains lost.

           We cut to Skip looking sheepish.

                        Now normally the Circle of Elders would
                        devise a plot to guide you through this
                        weekend. But fate has already written a
                        fine story. Prince Bannor of Laconia and
                        his allies seek to lay siege upon Castle
                        Mordom and capture Lord Derleth.

           Many Mordomites laugh, but there are many new faces among
           his troops who just seem confused.

           Karnage, masked, whispers to Bannor.

                                  KARNAGE
                        Mordom has grown stronger than I feared.

                        of your realm and make merry, for the
                        battle is joined at dawn. Hail Darkon.

           EXT. LACONIA CAMPSITE - DUSK

           On a clearing in a hillside, the Laconians have created a
           small city of camp tents that have been kitted out with
           green and gold banners. A small fire burns.

           INT. SKIP’S TENT - DUSK

           Skip sits alone by the light of several oil-lamps,
           waiting. He’s wearing a kind of toga--Darkon leisurewear.

           A LACONIAN HERALD enters.

                                  LACONIAN HERALD

           The Laconian Herald reluctantly holds open the tent flap
           for Rebecca and a Dark Elf, who acts as her translator.

                        awaits outside.

           Rebecca nods. With a word of Elftongue, she sends the
           translator out of the tent. He leaves.

           Now alone in the tent, Skip and Rebecca stare at each
           other. Wordlessly, awkwardly, they figure out what's
           going to happen next. They kiss, and end up going crazy
           on one another.

           EXT. THE SIEGE BATTLEFIELD - MORNING

           Skip, full of hope, leads the armies of the Allied Free
           Realms against Castle Mordom.

           They enter the narrow, uphill gully between huge fir
           trees that Karnage described, pushing with them three
           cumbersome catapults.

           It’s a hard slog uphill. Finally, they see CASTLE MORDOM
           looming before them. 

           True to Karnage’s description, it’s a plywood facade made
           to look like a castle. It only has three sides concealing
           a narrow catwalk stalked by Kenyon and his Mordomites.

           But it is still more elaborate than anything anyone in
           Darkon has ever seen, and it has an undeniable
           psychological effect upon the attackers.

           EXT. THE SIEGE BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Karnage approaches skip.

                                  KARNAGE
                        We’ve lost the wheels on one of the
                        catapults, milord.

           Skip winces, then composes himself.

                                  SKIP AS BANNOR
                        It will have to do.
                             (aloud, turning)
                        Free Realms of Darkon! For too long,
                        Mordom has towered over us, and we have
                        fought in its shadow. But I say to you,
                        this is the LAST morning they will stand
                        so tall!

                        place something better...

           But, in mid-sentence, the charge has already begun,
           swirling around Skip madly.

                             (he lowers his fist)
                        Kill them all.

           A volley of arrows flies over the walls. The battle is
           engaged. 

           On the Laconian side, the two catapults are moved into
           position. One manages to lob a bevy of green catapult
           balls over the walls of Mordom, taking out a few of their
           archers, but the other catapult fails and cannot be
           repaired. 
           A Laconian ally reaches the castle door and touches the
           handle. An Elder immediately steps in.

                                  ELDER
                        That door is boobytrapped. Instant death!

                        Scaling the wall! Scaling the wall!

           But from atop the wall, a Mordomite dumps a bucket of
           water on him. 

                                  MORDOMITE
                        This is boiling oil!

                        Ahhhhhh! Ahhhhhh!

                                                                      #
           As each wave of Laconia and its allies approach, they are
           quickly dispatched by Mordom’s own arrows, javelins, and
           spell balls.

           Stationed at the rear of the fight, calling out orders,
           Skip realizes that Chaz was right. It’s going to be a
           massacre. His face shows it: he will let them all down.

           Then: a strange SOUND. From the woods to the rear of the
           battlefield a haunting KEENING is heard: ELFSONG.

                                  SKIP AS BANNOR
                             (brightening)
                        Elfsong!

           All pause to listen to the frightening, haunting noise.
           Even the “dead” hitch themselves up to listen.
                                                                      #

           Then, suddenly, screeching, 20 Dark Elves, including
           Rebecca, rush in from the treeline behind them.

                                  SKIP AS BANNOR (CONT’D)
                        The elves join our fight! Attack!

           Then Skip notices the strange Laughing Elf from before.
           He seems to be running directly at Skip. Cackling with
           mad glee, the Laughing Elf tackles him, knocking him to
           the ground. Skip briefly blacks out.

           When he comes to, he sees the Dark Elves attacking his
           own men. He realizes he has been betrayed.
           Getting to his feet, Skip sees Karnage cornered by a Dark
           Elf. Before the Dark Elf can land the killing blow, Skip
           mortally wounds him, saving his old friend.

           Karnage gets to his feet, but he holds his arm out
           stiffly.
                                                                      #

                        As the saying goes, an elf that’s been
                        paid once is an elf that knows he can be
                        paid twice.

                        Thank you, milord.

           They hear a terrible CREAKING.

           We cut to see the doors of the castle opening. The host
           of Mordor pours forth from the gate.

           Skip rushes toward the castle. Karnage pulls him back.

                                  KARNAGE (CONT’D)
                        No, milord. We cannot take the castle--we
                        must break the elves’ line if we have any
                        hope of retreat to the woods.

                                  SKIP AS BANNOR
                             (out of control)
                        No. NO RETREAT.

           He turns, furious. He can’t help but throw himself
           angrily, almost suicidally, upon the nearest enemy.

           Meanwhile, Kenyon, swaggers triumphantly through Castle
           Mordom’s gate. He is joined by DELVER, King of the Elves.
           Skip fights on. His sheer anger carries him for a while,
           but he is actually punching and kicking the other
           players: a gross violation of the rules. And what remains
           of the armies he led into battle are slowly vanquished.

           Eventually, Skip runs out of steam and finds himself
           wheezing, in the midst of a full-on asthma attack. He
           falls to his knees, alone, facing Kenyon and Delver. Skip
           is finished.

           There really isn't any joy on KENYON'S face as he pulls
           out his black foam sword. Fade to black. 

           EXT. THE SIEGE BATTLEFIELD - LATER

           Fade up. Skip kneels, silent in the grass, surrounded by
           all of Darkon. He is friendless, countryless, and he is
           being slowly stripped of the armor he had been working so
           hard on in the opening scenes.

           As this goes on, Skip watches Kenyon pay Delver for the
           Dark Elves’ services. Skip also spots Rebecca among the
           Elves, who is clearly sad, but she shrugs: what are you
           going to do?

           Then, one by one, the Elves do their disappearing act
           into the forest. As the last piece of armor is taken from
           Skip, Bannor is banished from Darkon forever. 

           I/E. COLLEGE BUS - MORNING

           Skip is riding the bus. He’s sitting in the exact same
           spot as he was in the opening voice over, except now he
           is not in costume, and no one bothers to stare.

           INT. MAL, JR.’S OFFICE AT EMPIRES - DAY

           Mal, Jr. sits at his desk, clicking his ballpoint, sizing
           up his brother who sits across from him.

                                  MAL, JR.
                        So. You’re in the real world for good
                        now, huh?

                                  SKIP
                        What’s that supposed to mean?
                                  MAL, JR.
                        Look, Skip. Don’t get me wrong. You’re
                        our best sculptor. But I won’t lie and
                        say that the game wasn’t a distraction.

           Reflexively, Skip opens his mouth to fight back, but then
           stops himself. He has no fight left. He sighs

                                  MAL, JR. (CONT’D)
                        The truth, Skip? I’m glad you’re here
                        now. 100%. I mean it.

           Skip is taken off guard by his sincerity.

                                  SKIP
                        OK, Mal.

                                  MAL, JR.
                             (suddenly cheerful)
                        Well! That completes your first quarterly
                        review.

           He scribbles on a piece of carbon paper, signs it, and
           hands it to Skip, keeping a copy for himself.

                        You see, I told you it would be painless!

                                  SKIP
                        Great, Mal.

           Skip just gets up and goes back to work. He notices that
           everyone on the small staff is now wearing ties.

           INT. SKIP’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The place is a mess. Cheetos on the floor. Dishes in the
           sink. Lamps without shades: pure bachelor indolence. Skip
           and Chaz are watching the new Battlestar Galactica.

                        cellular level.

           We cut to the TV screen. It’s the first season BSG
           episode where Starbuck is torturing a Cylon. Chaz can’t
           believe what he’s seeing.

                                  CHAZ
                        Is she.... waterboarding that replicant?

           He’s troubled by the scene, but appreciative of its
           accuracy to what he may have seen or heard about.

                                  CHAZ (CONT’D)

           We cut to a view through Skip’s window of Karnage, in
           street clothes, waiting for Skip outside. He’s walking
           back and forth between two trees, touching one then
           quickly spinning and fast-walking to touch the other,
           like some kind of OCD ritual. Admittedly, it’s pretty
           weird.

           We come back to Mal and Skip.

                        offense, but that right there is the past
                        of this company, Skip. And thank god.

           Skip turns and looks Mal, Jr. in the eyes. Mal, Jr. is
           oblivious to how he might have just hurt his brother’s
           feelings.

           Skip spits in Mal’s face. The gob hits Mal, Jr. awkwardly
           in the cheek. It’s not a triumphant moment, but a stupid,
           pointless gesture. Then he storms out. 

                                  SKIP
                        Carve your own torture porn. I quit.

                        OK. Sorry. I’ll be right back with your
                        sizzlers.

           She leaves.

                                  SKIP
                        This makes no sense.

                                  KARNAGE
                        On the contrary. We both know I lack
                        certain social skills needed to lead my
                        own realm. Do you deny it? 

           Skip is amazed at Karnage’s self-awareness.

                                  SKIP
                        No.

                                  KARNAGE
                        Since you are no longer playing Darkon
                        anymore, logic dictates that I must join
                        the strongest realm that will have me.

           Karnage takes out a sheet of hex paper.

                                  KARNAGE (CONT’D)
                        I’ve drawn a flowchart that might help...

           Karnage pushes the hex paper across the table. Skip
           pushes it aside brusquely.

                                  SKIP
                        I don’t want to look at any fucking hex
                        paper.

                                  KARNAGE
                        At the risk of sounding impertinent,
                        perhaps that is why Laconia no longer
                        exists.

           Skip glowers at him. He tears the hex paper up.

                                  KARNAGE (CONT’D)
                        Skip. Darkon is a game...

                                  SKIP
                        No. Andrew. Darkon is not just a game.
                        Big world, little world: it’s the same...
                        the same shitty world. The assholes still
                        win. The nice guys still finish last. And
                        everyone you think loves you betrays you.
                                  KARNAGE
                        May I presume this conversation is over?

           Karnage is now crying. 

           Skip feels guilty and angry at the same time. He doesn’t
           know what to say. After a long moment, the waitress
           brings their steak sizzlers.

                                  WAITRESS
                        Sizzlers!

           EXT. SKIP’S CARPORT - DAY

           Skip is standing in his carport, looking at his Subaru.
           He has a piece of paper in his hand. It’s clear he’s come
           to some sort of decision.

           He takes a breath and opens the car door. He sits down.
           Because Chaz always drives, Skip realizes he’s a mile
           from the steering wheel. He fumbles around for a long,
           long time trying to figure out how to adjust the seat.

           Through the car window, we see the bottom half of Chaz as
           he strolls by.

                                  CHAZ
                        Underneath and to the right.

           Skip reaches under the seat, finds the lever, and scoots
           forward. Then he starts the car.

           I/E. SKIP’S SHITTY SUBRAU - DAY

           Skip is driving, nervously. We do not know where’s he’s
           heading or what his intention is. He’s looking at a
           Google maps print out as he drives, which makes it a
           little dangerous.

           EXT. A SUBURBAN RANCH HOUSE - DAY

           The Subaru pulls up in front of a suburban ranch home,
           which is about as awful as you’d expect.

           Skip rings the bell. A SUBURBAN WOMAN, late 50s, perhaps
           a little drunk, opens the door. Taking one look at Skip,
           she figures him for a Darkon player. She dismisses him...

                                  SUBURBAN WOMAN
                        Down the lawn, around the back.
           ... and closes the door in his face.

           Skip, puzzled, follows her directions. He walks around
           the house, down a sloping lawn, until he finds the door
           to the finished basement. Down below the grass-line, it
           sort of resembles the entrance to a Hobbit hole.

           Skip knocks. Rebecca opens the door. This is who Skip was
           looking for. She doesn’t know what to say.

                                  SKIP
                        I. Um. Well. Look. I don’t know why you
                        did what you did. But I figure: OK. It
                        was the game. It was just the game.

           Rebecca nods, still speechless.

                                  SKIP (CONT’D)
                        OK. And it got me to thinking. If it was
                        in the game, I mean... now that we don’t
                        have a relationship in the game anymore,
                        does that... I mean, does that mean...?

           And she kisses him. And they go inside.

           INT. REBECCA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They have sex. It is very honest: they are not incredibly
           good looking people, and they are not great at sex. But
           they are sincerely excited, scared, and hot for each
           other, and that should carry through on screen.

           Afterward, they lie looking at each other. Rebecca
           smiles. Then she covers her face with her hands.

                                  SKIP
                        What?

                                  REBECCA.

                                  REBECCA.
                        I should have told you right away. It’s
                        just... we didn’t really speak much
                        English before.

                                  REBECCA.
                        No. No. He’s 11.

                                  SKIP
                        11? Well that...

                        ...makes me a former teenage mother, yes.

                        Hilarious.

           She starts getting dressed.

                        My son’s name is Ralph.

           She pronounces it “Rayfe”

                             (decisively)
                        No.

           She checks the clock radio as she puts on her underwear.

                                  REBECCA. (CONT’D)
                        He’s a very good person, and also a very
                        loud person. And he will be home from
                        school in about five minutes.

                                  RALPH (O.C.)

                             (calm)
                        Or right now.

           Rebecca swiftly moves to the bedroom door and locks it.
           She points at Skip and whispers firmly.
                                  REBECCA. (CONT’D)
                        Do. Not. Speak.

           Skip pulls up the covers.

           INT. REBECCA’S BASEMENT APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Ralph, 11, husky and towheaded and lumbering, plows
           through the living room, dropping his army-navy backpack.

                                  RALPH
                        Mom?!!!

           We follow Ralph into the small kitchen.

           INT. REBECCA’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Ralph opens the breadbox, takes a whole loaf of unsliced
           bread and gnaws off an enormous hunk.

                                  RALPH
                             (with mouth full)
                        Mom??!!!

           Ralph goes through the kitchen and upstairs.

                                  RALPH (CONT’D)
                        Grandmom?

           We hold on the kitchen for a spell while we hear him
           pounding around upstairs like giant: BOOM BOOM BOOM.

           He comes back down.

                                  RALPH (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ, where is everyone?

           He walks into the living room where we find...

           INT. REBECCA’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ...Skip, dressed, sitting too-casually on the sofa.
           Rebecca is standing in the middle of the room.

                                  RALPH
                        Mom. You tell me to be home by 3 o’clock.
                        And you’re not even home. That’s
                        unfucking fair, don’t you think?
                                  REBECCA.
                             (calmly)
                        You could make that argument. Ralph, this
                        is... 
                             (she realizes she doesn’t
                              know his real name)
                        ...Bannor.

                        Skip? Oh. 

           Skip nods.

                                  RALPH
                        Oh god. Are you one of mom’s fantasy
                        friends?

                        Skip gave me a ride home from the store.

                                  SKIP
                        Yes. I did. I did give her a ride. In my
                        car, I mean. It’s parked outside. 
                                                                      #

           Ralph knows what is going on. He doesn’t like it, but
           he’s still too young and squeamish around this topic to
           say anything about it. He’s happier accepting the lie.

                                  RALPH
                                                                      #
                        Fine. I’m going up to Grandmom’s to watch
                        cable.

                                  REBECCA.
                        OK.

           The two face off for a moment, sizing up who is control.

                                  REBECCA. (CONT’D)
                        Give me the loaf of bread, Ralph.

           Ralph sighs dramatically and hands it over.

                                  RALPH
                        See ya, Bilbo.
           Then he turns and pounds through the kitchen and up the
           stairs. Rebecca watches as he goes. Skip realizes his t-
           shirt is on inside out.

                                  REBECCA.
                             (letting Skip off the hook)

           Rebecca is making dinner. Every motion she makes is
           confident, unapologetic. There’s eerie cool to her
           manner, honed by so many years of defending the decisions
           she’s made. But now it’s just who she is.

                        Ralph’s father did the best he could. But
                        he was a Lacrosse player. When that was
                        done, all that was left was the
                        assholism. To his credit, he knew it.
                        He’s in Vermont now, selling marijuana
                        and kitchen cabinets and having sex with
                        college girls.

                        really, really good mother.

                        I went to Smith College. We did a lot of
                        howling at the moon. Eventually I fell in

                        Fucking elves.

           INT. REBECCA’S MOTHER’S DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Skip, Ralph, and Rebecca’s mother, eat dinner. Rebecca’s
           absence as this strange family’s center is palpable.
                                  SKIP
                        Thanks for the pizza rolls, Mrs. Dillon.

                                  REBECCA’S MOTHER
                             (takes a long swig of rose)
                        They really do taste like pizza, don’t
                        they?

           Ralph is studying a bunch of miniatures arrayed before
           him. He holds one up. It’s just a plain metallic cube.

                                  RALPH
                        What is this one again?

                                  SKIP
                        A gelatinous cube. It’s like jello, but
                        it’s toxic, and it fills up the whole
                        dungeon corridor.

                                  RALPH
                             (scoffing)
                        Stupid.

                                  SKIP
                        What? That’s a cool monster! It strips
                        flesh from bone! 

                                  RALPH
                        I’m a kid. I’m supposed to like this
                        shit. But you’re like, 40? Why don’t you
                        live in the real world?

                                  REBECCA’S MOTHER
                        Ralph...

                                  SKIP
                        No. That’s a fair question.
                             (turns to Ralph)
                        In fact. I’ve been asked that question my
                        whole life. And you know what, Ralph? It
                        is stupid. But the problem isn’t that I
                        was living in a fantasy world. The
                        problem was: I wasn’t really living at
                        all. Does that make any sense?

                                  RALPH
                             (beat)
                        Jesus, Bilbo. Was that supposed to be
                        deep?

           But we get the sense Skip may have gotten to him.
                                  MRS. DILLON
                        Who wants ice cream?

                                  SKIP
                        I’d love...

           Ralph grabs Skip’s arm. He shakes his head firmly: NO.

                                  SKIP (CONT’D)
                        No thank you, actually.

                                  MRS. DILLON
                             (shrugging)
                        I have nice ice cream.

           INT. REBECCA’S LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT NIGHT

           Rebecca is back from Darkon, unpacking. She has a huge
           bruise on her arm. She’s happy.

                                  SKIP
                        See, I think he was talking about you!

                                  REBECCA.
                        Skip...

                                  SKIP
                        I think he thinks that you think that
                        real life isn’t good enough. And you
                        know, real life, that’s him.

                                  REBECCA.
                        Skip, stop.

                                  SKIP
                        It wasn’t even about me! It just hit me a
                        in a flash. It was about you!

                                  REBECCA.
                        Skip. Stop it. I just spent a weekend
                        kicking ass, and I had a great time. I
                        come back, and you tell me I’m a bad
                        mother, and you also seem to expect to
                        spend the night here. Again.
                             (beat)
                        I have to say, I don’t think this is a
                        winning strategy for you.

                                  SKIP
                        I’m sorry, I don’t mean it that way.
                                  REBECCA.
                        If you think I haven’t thought about what
                        you’re saying....

                                  SKIP
                        No, I know you have...

                                  REBECCA.
                        Skip, I’m 60,000 dollars in debt. I live
                        in my mother’s basement. I spend every
                        day rasing and feeding a human being who
                        outweighs my by forty pounds. I have
                        exactly one hour a day to myself after he
                        collapses from sugar shock and before I
                        fall asleep. And then I have Darkon. And
                        that’s OK.

                                  SKIP
                        Of course it is. I just thought, maybe
                        you should take him with you some time.

                                  REBECCA.
                        To Darkon? Why would I want that? I live
                        with him.

                                  SKIP
                        Just so that he can see what you’re
                        doing. What you like about it...

           Skip isn’t sure if he should go on.

                                  REBECCA.
                        Don’t say it.

                                  SKIP
                        ...so that he knows you don’t like it
                        more than you like him.

           Rebecca seethes.

                                  REBECCA.
                        It hurts me. It hurts me so fucking much
                        that you’re right.

           She gives up and sits on the bed, near tears. 

                                  SKIP
                        I’m sorry. I promise it won’t happen
                        again. 
                             (He puts her arm around her;
                              she accepts it.)
                        What’s wrong with your mother’s ice
                        cream?
           Rebecca, crying, laughs

                                  REBECCA.
                        Oh, god. It’s about two years old.

           EXT. OUTSIDE REBECCA’S BASEMENT APARTMENT - MORNING

           Skip opens the door to go leave the next morning and
           finds Chaz waiting for him.

                                  SKIP
                        Jeez--you scared me, Chaz.

                                  CHAZ
                        I tried to call your cell.

                                  SKIP
                        Yeah, I don’t get very good reception
                        down here. You need the car or something?

                                  CHAZ
                        Dad had a stroke, Skip. He’s dying.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK

           It’s twilight. Strong yellow sunlight is pushing through
           the blinds.

           Mal, Sr. lies in his hospital bed. He’s very weak.

           Skip, Chaz, Mal, Jr., and Mal, Jr.’s wife are all in the
           room. A doctor is speaking to them.

                                  DOCTOR
                        So normally I wouldn’t want to tire him,
                        but he says he has a gift for each of the
                        brothers, starting with Malcolm, Jr.

                                  MAL, JR.
                        That’s me.

           Mal, Jr. goes to Mal, Sr.’s bedside. This sequence should
           have the sort of ritual pacing of a fairy tale.  

                                  MAL, SR.
                             (barely able to speak)
                        Hello, Junior.

                                  MAL, JR.
                        Hi, Dad. I just want you to know that you
                        had a great life. An amazing, full life.
                                  MAL, SR.
                             (offended)
                        What’s the matter with you?

                                  MAL, JR.
                        I just....

                                  MAL, SR.
                        You think I’m ready to die? I don’t want
                        to die.
                                                                      #

                                  MAL, JR.
                        I know, dad, I was just...

                                  MAL, SR.
                        Never mind. I’m leaving you Empires, son.
                        But first, you have to forgive Skip.
                                                                      #

                                  MAL, JR.
                        I... OK. I will.
                             (pause)
                        What. Now?

           Mal, Sr. nods.

                                  MAL, JR. (CONT’D)
                        Fine.
                             (over his shoulder)
                        I forgive you, Skip. 

           Mal, Sr. gives him a look of supreme disapproval.

           Mal, Jr. straightens up and turns around. He looks Skip
           in the eye. He immediately bursts into tears.

                                  MAL, JR. (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, Skip. I’m sorry.

           They hug.

                                  MAL, SR.
                        Chaz.

           Chaz walks over to the bed.

                                  CHAZ
                        Yeah, dad?

                                  MAL, SR.
                        I’m leaving you the speedboat on Lake
                        Winnepesauke.
                                  CHAZ
                        Fucking A.

                                  MAL, SR.
                        But you have to forgive yourself. You
                        understand? You have to forgive yourself.

                                  CHAZ
                             (he does understand)
                        OK, Dad.

                                  MAL, SR.
                        I love you son.

                                  CHAZ
                        I love you, too, dad.

           Chaz stands and moves back to the group.

                                  MAL, SR.
                        Skip.

           Skip walks over to the bed.

                                  SKIP
                        Dad.

                                  MAL, SR.
                        I need you to forgive me, Skip.

                                  SKIP
                        Of course I do, Dad. I don’t care about
                        the business anymore.

                                  MAL, SR.
                        You might think I’m giving your brothers
                        what they want. But I’m giving them what
                        they need. What they need to live. And
                        that’s what I’m giving you, Skip.

                                  SKIP
                        Oh. OK.

           Mal, Sr. whispers something weakly.

                                  SKIP (CONT’D)
                        What? What, dad?

                                  MAL, SR.
                             (whispering)
                        Defeat Mordom.
           Skip is flabbergasted--what the fuck? His life has
           suddenly become the plot of a fantasy novel.

                                  SKIP
                        You don’t even know what Mordom is, dad.

                                  MAL, SR.
                        Everyone knows what Mordom is, Skip.

           And then Mal, Sr. grows too weak to talk.

           The room now is flooded with dying sunlight, red as fire.

           Kenyon and Skip walk down a long aisle of cubicles in
           Kenyon’s office, the corporate headquarters of the Big Y
           supermarket chain in Springfield, MA

           Skip is wearing his regular clothes. Kenyon is wearing
           dockers and a decent business shirt and tie.

                                  KENYON
                             (cheerfully, as he walks)
                        By six o’clock, most everyone has gone
                        home. But I’m usually here til 8 or 9, so
                        it’s no problem.

                                  SKIP
                             (without enthusiasm)
                        Great, thanks.

                                  KENYON
                             (waving at the cubicle farm)
                        Yeah, this is where I slogged it out for
                        the first few years. Before I got the big
                        office.

                                  SKIP
                        Uh, huh.

                                  KENYON
                        But I’m no genius, you know? I just
                        survived. Business is like war, Skip.
                        Whoever hangs in there long enough, gets
                        to be king.

           They reach his office.
           INT. KENYON’S OFFICE - “THE BIG OFFICE” - DAY

           We see Kenyon’s office again--how cramped and
           unimpressive it is. Kenyon sees this, too.

                                  KENYON
                        Yeah, I know. It’s really not much. But
                        we don’t make rap albums, you know? We
                        just feed your family. Heh heh. You shop
                        at the Big Y, Skip?

                                  SKIP
                        Well, Rebecca and I go to the Greenfield
                        Organic Co-op.
                                                                      #

                                  KENYON
                        We’re getting a lot of organic stuff at
                        the Big Y, too, Skip. Carrots and so on.
                        Washed lettuces. You should check it out.
                             (beat)
                        Sit. Sit down.

           Skip sits and pulls out a scroll of parchment.

                        So here’s my petition to begin a new
                        realm. You’re the Land Marshall, so
                        you’ll need to sign off on it.

                                  KENYON
                        I’m sure it’s all in order, Skip. You’ve
                        always done everything by the book. 

           Skip doesn’t know quite how to take this “compliment.”

                             (looks at the parchment)
                        Let’s see. Darius and Marius, naturally.

           CUT TO DARIUS AND MARIUS FACING THE CAMERA

           They are sitting on matching riding lawnmowers, facing
           the camera. There’s a pickup truck behind them with the
           logo: TWIN BROTHERS LANDSCAPING.
           Darius and Marius rev their engines.

                        That’s decent of you, Skip. But one
                        leader to another? I hope you’re not
                        taking him on as a pet cause. A realm
                        needs warriors, not mascots.
                                  SKIP
                        I think he has potential.

                        Your call, but he’ll need a new name.

                                  SKIP
                        He’s working on it.

                        I always wanted to use?

                        “Scarlac.” “Scarlac.” Yeah. You should
                        suggest it to him.

           We hold on him for a moment as he puts his enormous plume

           EXT. SKIP’S YARD - DAY

           Chaz is drilling Marius, Darius, the former Trivius (now
           known as CONANICON) and Damon in some Marine moves.
                                                                      #

                        OK. Listen up. We’re going to be learning
                        some basic hand to hand combat
                        techniques, some submission moves, and
                        some defensive work. If you learn this
                        correctly, you won’t even need to use
                        your foam sword. Or, in Conanicon’s case,
                        your magic PVC pipe of kickass.

           We see Conanicon holding a very bad looking foam sword.

           EXT. SKIP’S CARPORT - CONTINUOUS

           Meanwhile, Skip is carefully making a new shield,
           beginning with plywood, and wrapping foam around it.

           EXT. SKIP’S YARD - DAY

           Chaz leads the players through a regimen of calisthenics.

           Ralph and a couple of his school friends watch from the
           distance, leaning on their bikes, mocking, but curious.

           EXT. SKIP’S CARPORT - DAY

           Skip carefully duct-tapes the foam to the plywood, giving
           it heft and shape. Behind him we can see his new sword,
           and a new, more modest suit of armor--a leather tunic.

           EXT. SKIP’S YARD - DAY

           Chaz is sparring with Damon. Chaz is a pretty big guy,
           but Damon easily towers over him. Nonetheless, with a
           surprisingly graceful leg sweep, he topples Damon over.

                        Hot damn!

           Conanicon is sparring with Ralph, who has somehow gotten
           in on the action. With the same leg sweep, Conanicon also
           brings Ralph down.

                                  RALPH
                        Hot damn!

           They are both thrilled.

                                  CHAZ
                        Good. Let’s move on to knife work.

           We cut Darius, Marius, Conanicon, and Ralph sparring with
           knives and shields.

           Meanwhile, Chaz and Damon are sitting together in the
           grass, observing, passing a 2 liter of soda between them.
           They’ve bonded.

                        So we were dug in, and there was a nest
                        of shooters downhill, trying to come up.
                        But that was our hill, you see. It was a
                        rocky, jaggged piece of shitty, sharp
                        Afghan fuck-mountain, but that was our
                        fucking hill. If anyone made it up,
                        you’re dead, I’m dead, we’re all dead. So
                        we’re lobbing it at them, and they’re
                        lobbing it at us.  Must have been 45
                        minutes of that. We lose two guys.
                                                                      #
                             (beat)
                        Then it just settled down. It happens
                        like that. You’re a pubic hair from
                        death, and then nothing. Silence. We
                        figure we must have picked them off, but
                        to be safe, we wait 45 before sending
                        someone down to check it out. You know
                        what happens next, don’t you?

                                  DAMON
                        They were your own guys.

                                  CHAZ
                        Our own fucking guys. That’s what it is:
                        50 minutes of shooting at each other
                        because your radios are fucked, or
                        someone just gets spooked. And suddenly
                        you’re bleeding out, dying.

                        Help is only 60 meters away, but no one’s
                        coming down to help you because they
                        think you’re the fucking enemy.

                                  DAMON
                        Jesus. Who went down to find them?

                                  CHAZ
                        That would be me.

                        Whoa, whoa, whoa, Ralph! Illegal move
                        there buddy!

           We cut to Ralph, sitting on Marius’s chest, repeatedly
           “stabbing” Marius in the face with a foam knife.

                                  RALPH
                        Die! Die!

           He’s not really hurting him, but any sort of hit to the
           face in Darkon is illegal.  

           Chaz laughs and gets to his feet.

                                  CHAZ
                        I’ll get the taser and pull him off.

           Suddenly, Skip comes out bearing his new shield. It has
           the old castle logo of Empires Miniatures emblazoned on
           it. He sees his army. They see him, and they see a
           leader.

           Skip holds his shield aloft on a school soccer field.
           This is a small battle, only a few dozen players, but
           it’s where Empirica will prove itself KING OF THE HILL.

                        To me, Empirica!

           His very small army gathers around him.

                        News, milord. Mordom does not take the
                        field today. I hear they are in Maine,
                        fighting a cross-league event with the
                        New England Role Playing Organization.
                             (off of Skip’s surprise)
                        Could they be afraid?
                                  SKIP
                        Probably they think they’re giving us a

                        Warriors of Empirica. We have one task
                        today: to hold our one hex of land. Our
                        warmaster, Ahmad Shah Massoud, the Lion
                        of Panjshir, will go over our strategy.

                        OK, jokers, this is simple king of the
                        hill. When the shit hits, make for those
                        bleachers and get up high. I’ve talked to
                        the Elder, and they’re in play. Oxholt,
                        Marius, you get underneath and protect
                        our legs. The rest of you get up top and
                        wait for them to come to us.

                        to get enchanted, Darius, so just brush
                        ‘em off. We need you.

                        If we can hold this ground for 20 minutes
                        with no mortal wounds, we’ve done good
                        enough. So take it easy. Fight with your
                        brains and shields.

                        OK. That wasn’t meant to be a chant, but
                        fine. Let’s go.

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD BATTLE - MOMENTS LATER

           Game on. A sweeping aerial shot as the Darkonites rush to
           surround the bleachers, which EMPIRICA holds like a small
           hill.

                                                                      #

           We see Darius, Chaz, Conanicon, and Skip atop the
           bleachers. Marius and Damon/Oxholt below, fighting off
           side attacks. Empirica holds off the attacking armies.
           Their skill is surprising, though the effort is clearly
           testing their reserves of strength.

           When the opposing armies lull, flustered, Skip stares
           them down.

                                  SKIP
                        Mop’em up.

           Chaz and Damon stride out onto the field before the
           clearly shocked enemy armies and begin kicking ass.

           And Skip holds the hill. A small victory.

           INT. APPLEBEE’S - THAT EVENING

           Empirica toasts their victory with a technicolor array of
           Tyler Florence-designed shitty cocktails.

                                  BRAINS AND SHIELDS!

           They celebrate. Rebecca and Ralph are there, and even
           Ralph is having a good time. But Skip seems preoccupied.

                                  CONANICON
                        ...and I can’t wait to see Kenyon’s face
                        when I stab him in his smiling face!

                                  SKIP
                        Now hang on. Yes, we did well today. But
                        I don’t want anyone to get their hopes
                        up.
                                                                      #

                                  REBECCA.
                        Nice pep talk.
                                  CONANICON
                        But we have to beat them. I mean: we’re
                        the underdogs. That’s how it works!

                                  SKIP
                        No. We simply don’t have enough players.
                        Or gold. Or skill for that matter.

           Suddenly standing at the table: KARNAGE!, still in
           costume, though unmasked, and carrying an overnight bag.
                                                                      #

                        He is right, of course. Mordom is
                        stronger than ever.

           Skip is speechless, happy, confused. Karnage sits down.

                                  KARNAGE (CONT’D)
                        I was just driving back from Maine, and I
                        thought I would get a steak sizzler.
                             (beat)
                        Have you ever heard of a roadside stand
                        in Maine called Perry’s Nut House? I was
                        surprised to learn it doesn’t only sell
                        nuts, but also salt water taffy.

                                  KARNAGE
                        I am also disappointed. Had I known you
                        were forming your own realm, I would
                        never have joined Mordom.

                                  SKIP
                        I... I didn’t think I would play again.

                                  KARNAGE
                        No matter. It seems that I can be of some
                        service to this new country. Shall we
                        discuss it over salt water taffy?

           He reaches in his bag and brings out a box of salt water
           taffy.

           INT. REBECCA’S MOTHER’S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           It’s some days later. As Rebecca’s mother serves a
           variety of frozen prepared foods, Team Empirica lay their
           plans for the upcoming campout.
           Chaz and Karnage study a hex map. Karnage is eating a
           bowl of disgustingly freezer-burned ice cream.

                                  KARNAGE
                        The only way to draw Mordom into direct
                        combat is to invade one of their hexes.

                                  CHAZ
                        That’s insane. We can’t beat them on open
                        ground.

                                  KARNAGE
                        Nor do we have time or money to build a
                        fortification. That is why we will make
                        our stand here.

           He circles a wooded area on the map.

                                  CHAZ
                        Guerilla warfare....

                                  KARNAGE
                        Kenyon thinks only in terms of direct
                        combat. So long as they believe we are
                        desperate and crazy, Mordom will not
                        expect our retreat to be a plan.

                                  CHAZ
                        Yeah, but we’re also desperate and crazy.

                                  KARNAGE
                        That is true.

           Skip watches this conversation from the doorway to the
           kitchen. He pensively eats a pizza roll, then turns and
           leaves.

           EXT. REBECCA’S MOTHER’S DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Skip is zipping up his jacket as he walks to his car.

           Rebecca comes to the door.

                        Skip. Are you sure you want to do this? 

                                  SKIP
                        It’s the only way, Rebecca.
                                  REBECCA.
                        But remember. Whatever happens, once
                        we’re in-game, I won’t be able to help
                        you.

                                  SKIP
                        I know.

                                  REBECCA.
                        I won’t even be able to speak to you.

                             (taken off guard)
                        Your accent is pretty good.

                                  SKIP
                        Thanks.

           He gets in his car and drives away. As he goes...

                                  REBECCA.
                        I love you, too.

           I/E. SKIP’S SHITTY SUBRAU - NIGHT

           Skip drives along an increasingly remote country road.
           Finally he pulls up in front of...

           EXT. THE LAST HOMELY HOUSE - NIGHT

           ...a strange old Victorian house by the old railway line.
           It’s painted garishly in purples and yellows, the yard
           filled with crystal balls, garden gargoyles, and other
           bizarre fantasy geek bric-a-brac. It is creepy and
           depressing. A sign marks it as “The Last Homely House,”
           the communal crash pad where DELVER, and several of his
           fellow DARK ELVES live.

           INT. THE LAST HOMELY HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Skip sits in the largely empty, candlelit parlor on a
           busted-out love seat. Across from him, Delver, Elf-King,
           sits in a ratty old Gropius chair. The Laughing Elf
           stands beside him.

           A black velvet bag sits on a milk crate between them.
                                  DELVER, ELF-KING
                        What pretty heaps of gold for the Deep-
                        Elf King. Most of it comes from the
                        darksy pockets of the double-traitor.
                        Guess I wrong?

           Skip rolls his eyes, but keeps it together. 

                                  SKIP
                        Karnage has amassed wealth with Mordom,
                        yes. But he’s with us, now. 
                             (beat)
                        Even so, we need the strength of the Dark
                        Elves... and their guile.

           Delver smiles at this...

                                  DELVER, ELF-KING
                        How knows thee that deepsy elves won’t
                        turn on thee again?

                                  SKIP
                        Yeah, well, I don’t know. Kenyon could
                        always pay you more.

                                  DELVER, ELF-KING
                        Ha! Now he thinks like elf-kind! We turn
                        and turn like leaves in autumn windies!

           The Laughing Elf cackles uproariously at this. 

                                  SKIP
                        Yes. Ha ha. Maybe there’s something,
                        though, that’s not gold... Something I
                        can offer, and Mordom can’t.

                                  DELVER, ELF-KING
                             (very serious now)
                        Perhapsey. Perhapsey so...

           EXT. A GRASSY FIELD FULL OF CARS - DAY

           The eve of THE FINAL BATTLE finally arrives. This campout
           is being held in the same hills where Skip fought, and
           lost, the “Battle of the Brooch” in the opening scenes of
           the movie.

           And while we’re only in the de-facto parking lot, it’s
           still a glorious late fall day. Astonishing foliage. Pure
           New England. 

           Skip is unpacking his Subaru.
           Kenyon’s SUV pulls in next to him. Kenyon gets out.

                                  KENYON
                        Hey there, Skip!

                                  SKIP
                        How are you doing, Kenyon?

                                  KENYON
                        Awesome. I heard about the buttkicking
                        you unleashed on the bleachers.

                                  SKIP
                        Yeah. We had a good day.

                                  KENYON
                        Seems like it. Anyway, listen: when you
                        said that thing about your dad, well, I’m
                        sorry. I hadn’t realized he had passed
                        away.

                                  SKIP
                        Oh, you know...

                                  KENYON
                        He was a legend, Skip. And I know that
                        company should have been yours. We all
                        do.

                                  SKIP
                             (taken aback)
                        OK. Thanks. Thanks, Kenyon.

                                  KENYON
                        It’s good to have you back, buddy.

           He offers his hand. Skip takes it. Kenyon sizes him up. 

                                  KENYON (CONT’D)
                        Maybe I shouldn’t have said hello, right?
                        I’m worried I won’t get much of a fight
                        out of you if you think we’re pals.

                                  SKIP
                        Maybe I want you to worry about that. 

           Kenyon laughs it off. 

                                  KENYON
                        Ha! OK! Good!
                             (beat)
                        You going to greet the Elder of Elders?
                                  SKIP
                        He’s here?

                                  KENYON
                        Oh, yeah. It’s the rematch of the year,
                        buddy. Everybody is here.

           EXT. THE GATES OF DARKON - MOMENTS LATER

           Skip hikes his equipment over to the check-in area. He’s
           sees Rebecca waiting for him. Ralph is sparring nearby
           with Chaz.

                                  REBECCA.
                        I see you brought Ralph along.

                                  SKIP
                        He’s registered and ready to play

                                  REBECCA.
                        He really wants to play with you?

                                  SKIP
                        Nope. He wants to be an Elf, god help
                        him.
                             (beat)
                        He wants to play with you.

           Rebecca doesn’t know what to say.

                                  SKIP (CONT’D)
                        He’s calling himself Rackstraw. I helped
                        him with it.

           Rebecca, touched, kisses Skip on the cheek. Ralph catches
           sight of her and rushes over.

                                  RALPH
                        Mom! I need a weapon!

           Skip, Chaz, Rebecca, and Ralph, now joined by Karnage,
           Marius, Darius, Conanicon, and Damon, all walk to a
           banner mounted on tent-poles: “The Gates of Darkon”

           A small crowd has gathered there around the Elder of
           Elders, garbed in a ridiculous flowing white robe with
           golden trim. He looks pretty shlubby, but everyone is
           treating him with the utmost respect.

                                  ELDER OF ELDERS
                        Bannor!
                                  SKIP
                        Greetings, Elder of Elders

                                  ELDER OF ELDERS
                        You still answer to that name?

           Skip doesn’t know what to say. 

                                  ELDER OF ELDERS (CONT’D)
                        I was under the impression that after
                        your fall to Mordom, “Bannor” was dead.
                        Yet I hear you recently fought under that
                        name. Is that true?

                                  SKIP
                        It was with my new realm, sir. I have
                        given up all my gold and land as agreed.

                                  ELDER OF ELDERS
                        But Darkon does not admit ghosts through
                        its gates.

                                  KARNAGE
                        Well, actually, it does admit phantoms.
                        And also dire wraiths.

                                  ELDER OF ELDERS
                        Ok, but...

                                  KARNAGE
                        I also know a banshee, which I believe is
                        a kind of ghost, in the Celtic tradition.

                                  SKIP
                        Karnage...

                        OK, OK. The point is: “Bannor” cannot
                        enter. 

                                  SKIP
                        I... I submit to your decision, Elder of
                        Elders. But please do not punish my whole
                        realm. They are strong and full of hope.
                        Turn me away if you must, but I beseech
                        you, in all humility, let my people pass.

                                  ELDER OF ELDERS
                             (confused)
                        Skip. Just pick a new name.

                        Also, Chaz, it’s stupid.

                        You can use noble titles, like Lord or

                        An unusual choice, but I’ll allow it.
                        Very well, “Skip.” Welcome to Darkon.

           EXT. A CIRCULAR MEADOW - DUSK

           In a circular meadow atop a hill, Team Empirica sit
           around a campfire. Rebecca and Ralph are with them... for
           now.

           A bearded troubadour plays a guitar as the teammates joke
           and talk to one another.

                        That’s pretty out-of-game, Chaz. But
                        we’ll let it slide.

           There’s a long pause as Chaz talks out of earshot. Only
           Rebecca seems to guess what’s going on. She looks at
           Skip, and kisses him, concerned. Skip doesn’t get it.

                                  CHAZ
                             (returning to the campfire)
                        Sorry, guys. I’m out of here.

                                  SKIP
                        What? What are you talking about? Where
                        are you going?

                                  CHAZ
                             (shrugs)
                        Baghdad, apparently.

                                  SKIP
                        I... oh, god. Really?

                                  CHAZ
                             (still breezy, but shaken)
                        Some fucking thing, huh? I have to be at
                        base by morning. 

           Skip stands. He doesn’t know what to say. They hug.

                                  SKIP
                        Take the car.

                                  CHAZ
                        Don’t worry, bro. You guys were fucked
                        even with me on your side.

           They laugh ruefully, and Chaz packs up and goes into the
           night.

           It’s only when Skip sits back down, blown over with
           emotion, that he notices: the moon his high and bright. 
           Rebecca and Ralph have slipped away.

           Skip looks at his teammates. He wants to say something,
           but he just stares into the fire.

           EXT. THE FINAL BATTLEFIELD - DAWN

           It’s a foggy cold November morning. Skip and his small
           band hike across a great green battlefield--a high
           plateau between a steep rise of thick woods to their
           right, and a gentle downward wooded slope to their left. 

           They greet a ragged line of other realms who, for one
           reason or another, are also aligned against Mordom.

           At the opposite end of the field is Mordom, at least 30
           strong now and imposing. They stand at the center of a
           much larger array of realms. It looks bad.
                                                                      #

           Skip brings the 6-strong army of Empirca together and
           does his best to rally their morale, his breath steaming.  ***

                        I don’t know what’s going to happen here.
                        Maybe we’ll succeed. Maybe not. But
                        that’s good. Because it means this isn’t
                        a story. This is real. As real as
                        anything. And the end isn’t written yet.

                        there too.

                        one.
                                                                      #

           He pauses. It’s not the most rousing speech in the world.

                                  SKIP (CONT’D)
                        OK, then. Let’s go kick some Mordomite
                        ass.

           All of Empirica cheers, as well as a few players from
           other Realms who were just listening in.

           Skip turns to face the foe.

           Both sides BEAT THEIR SHIELDS. For a long moment, that is
           all that can be heard. Finally, Skip orders the charge,
           and the armies race to meet one another.

                                                                      #
           The reality is that Empirica is grossly outnumbered, even
           with its few allies. And as they slog through a hard
           battle, Skip gives a nod to Karnage.

                                  SKIP (CONT’D)
                        OK, I’m going.

                        I bid thee luck.

           Skip turns. But Karnage stops him.

                                  KARNAGE (CONT’D)
                        But milord?

                                  SKIP
                        Yes?

                        Don’t run off into the woods with any

                                                                      #

                        If I live, I will be back. I promise.

           Karnage nods. Skip runs off toward the downward slope. 

                                  KARNAGE
                        Retreat, retreat to the woods!

           Empirica covers his escape by making for the steep,
           rising woods on the opposite side of the field.
           EXT. THE DOWNWARD SLOPE - CONTINUOUS

           Skip steals down through the woods on an errand of his
           own.

           EXT. THE LITTLE RIVER - CONTINUOUS

           Skip reaches the swift little river from the beginning of
           the movie and starts following its line against the
           current, splashing over the stones of its shallow bed.

           As he goes, he passes the spot where he previously had
           fallen, the house and deck hanging above the river.

           The little boy from those early scenes is there again. He
           watches Skip as he passes. 

                                  LITTLE BOY
                        Good luck, spaceman.

           Skip stops and turns. He looks up at the boy, who is all
           by himself, in pyjamas and wearing a superman cape. Light
           glints at his throat: the cape is clasped by the Brooch
           of Disruption.

           The two stare at each other in the gray cold morning. 

           EXT. THE REFUGE CLEARING - DAY

           We cut back to Empirica at war. Karnage and his soldiers
           have taken refuge in narrow clearing amidst the thickly
           wooded, steep hillside. There is only one path up from
           the battlefield. They are picking off the oncoming
           Mordomites with spells and arrows, but they are running
           low on ammunition.

           Conanicon rushes to Karnage.

                                  CONANICON
                        Mordom is massing at the bottom of the
                        hill, warmaster. It’s only a matter of
                        time.

                                  KARNAGE
                        Let’s hope it’s enough.
           EXT. THE ARKOPOLITAN CAMP - DAY

           Finally, Skip arrives at his destination: the tent city
           of Arkopolis, not involved in today’s battle.

           He sneaks his way through the tents, avoiding the
           sentries, making his way to the tent of Duke Manifred of
           Arkopolis. With surprising skill, Skip quietly “kills”
           the two guards, and enters the tent. 

           EXT. BOTTOM OF THE HILL - CONTINUOUS

           Kenyon (as Derleth) stands at the edge of the battlefield
           at the foot of the steep hillside. They have finished off
           all other opponents, now he turns smugly to his siege of
           Empirica. 

           A MORDOMITE LIEUTENANT approaches him with news.

                                  MORDOMITE LT.
                        Milord, my spies among the Dark Elves
                        tell me that Prince Bannor...

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH
                        Skip.

                                  MORDOMITE LT.
                        Excuse me. Skip has left the battle. He
                        has been sent by the elves in search of
                        some artifact held by the Arkopolitan
                        Duke.

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH
                        He is in Arkopolis now?

                                  MORDOMITE LT.
                        Aye, Milord.

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH
                        Is it a trick?

                                  MORDOMITE LT.
                        I do not see how, Milord. We have his men
                        trapped on the hill, and the Elves have
                        been paid twice what he paid them.

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH
                        Very well. I shall go myself. Assemble a
                        guard to accompany me. What is this
                        Elvish artifact anyway?
           INT. DUKE MANIFRED’S TENT - CONTINUOUS

           We cut to Skip, alone in the tent with Duke Manifred of
           Arkopolis, who is very confused.

                                  SKIP
                        I said, give me your belt, or I’ll kill
                        you.

                                  DUKE MANIFRED OF ARKOPOLIS
                        But why? It’s not magic or anything. It’s
                        fucking Banana Republic.

                                  SKIP
                        Look, I don’t know. The Elves want it for
                        some reason.

                                  DUKE MANIFRED OF ARKOPOLIS
                        Oh, god, I hate those guys.

                                  SKIP
                        I know.

                        I mean, who knows why they do anything.

                                  SKIP
                        Believe me, I know.

                             (Sighs, takes off his belt)
                        Fine...

           Suddenly, Skip hears Kenyon’s voice outside the tent.

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH (O.C.)
                        Skip!

           EXT. DUKE MANIFRED’S TENT - CONTINUOUS

           Kenyon stands outside the tent. His guard of 8 men hold
           the Arkopolitans at bay. 

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH
                        You are surrounded, outlaw! Come out and
                        face me.

           Skip and Duke Manifred exit the tent sheepishly, the Duke
           holding up his pants, Skip holding his belt.
           Kenyon and his men laugh.

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH (CONT’D)
                        Ho, ho! Honestly Skip, I don’t care what
                        you do on your own time. But when your
                        own men are dying?

           Skip just stares at him.

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH (CONT’D)
                             (now evilly)
                        Did you honestly think the Elves would
                        honor their deal with you?

           Skip keeps staring: he just doesn’t know. 

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH (CONT’D)
                             (has run out of taunts)
                        OK. I am going to kill you now.

           Kenyon’s guard surrounds Skip, pushing him to his knees.

           EXT. BOTTOM OF THE HILL - CONTINUOUS

           At the foot of the hill, a Mordomite soldier reports to
           the Lieutenant that Empirica have ceased firing arrows
           and spells.

                                  MORDOMITE
                        They are out of ammunition, my liege.

                                  MORDOMITE LT.
                        They may have rigged the hill with magic
                        traps. Send a raiding party. 5 men. 

           EXT. THE REFUGE CLEARING - MOMENTS LATER

                                  CONANICON
                        They’re coming up! Where’s Skip?

                                  KARNAGE
                        For various reasons, I would not count on
                        his return. Get into position. 

           The Mordomite raiding party begins to walk up the foggy
           hillside, but the warriors of Empirica have a few
           surprises left.

           Chaz’s training has borne fruit. Using the tree cover and
           the fog, they stealthily take out all Mordomites but one
           using kickass Marine maneuvers.
           The final surviving Mordomite stands alone in the fog,
           scared. Suddenly, he his grabbed from behind by
           Damon/Oxholt.

                                  SURVIVING MORDOMITE
                        Ahhh!

                                  DAMON AS OXHOLT
                        Tell your master, no magic, no traps.
                        Just death. Tell your master: this is our
                        fucking hill.

           He sends the Surviving Mordomite running. As Damon
           watches, him Karnage approaches.

                                  KARNAGE
                        Do you think he was scared?

                                  DAMON AS OXHOLT
                             (proudly)
                        Yup.

                                  KARNAGE
                        Scared enough that none will follow?

           Damon doesn’t know. 

           EXT. THE ARKOPOLITAN CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Skip is on his knees, flanked by two Mordomites, their
           hands on his shoulders.

           We see Kenyon from behind, swaggering over to his prey.

           Suddenly, arrows fly through the air and hit Skip’s
           guards squarely in their chests. The guards take a moment
           to process that they’ve been hit.

                                  MOROMITE GUARD 1
                        I am mortally wounded.

                                  MORDOMITE GUARD 2
                        I am mortally wounded.

           They fall. At that moment, the Dark Elves, including
           Rebecca and Ralph, move in swiftly, killing or capturing
           all of Kenyon’s guard with frankly astonishing speed and
           skill.

           In a moment, Kenyon himself is held by Delver, who holds
           a knife to his throat.
                                                                      #
           Ralph goes around taunting the Mordomites, while Rebecca
           smiles to Skip--though she doesn’t speak to him.
                                                                      #

           Skip is as surprised as anyone at this development--he
           knew something was planned, but not this. Skip stands and
           bows to Delver.

                                  SKIP
                        Greetings, Elf King.

                                  DELVER, ELF-KING
                        Hellos, Hellos, Human. Now you have what
                        you desired: onesy on onesy. None shall
                        interfere.

                                  SKIP
                        I thank you.

                        You Elvish bastards!

                                  DELVER, ELF-KING
                             (ignoring him)
                        Will you give us what we wants?

                                  SKIP
                        I will.

                                  DELVER, ELF-KING
                        Then stick your pigsy, Elf-Friend. Or die
                        alone.

           Delver releases Kenyon, who instantly rushes at Skip,
           screaming with real fury.

                                  KENYON AS DERLETH
                        AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!

           EXT. BOTTOM OF THE HILL - MOMENTS LATER

           Back at the bottom of the hill, The Mordomite Lieutenant
           confronts the one survivor of the raiding party.

                                  SURVIVING MORDOMITE
                        I’m not going back up there!

           The Mordomite lieutenant pushes him away. He’s shaken.

                                  MORDOMITE LT.
                        ALL MORDOMITES: ATTACK THAT HILL. LEAVE
                        NO SURVIVORS! NO SURVIVORS!
           EXT. THE REFUGE CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

           The Lieutenant’s orders ring out through the woods. All
           of Empirica hears it. Karnage’s head drops.

                                  KARNAGE
                             (to himself)
                        Then it is over.

           EXT. DUKE MANIFRED’S TENT - CONTINUOUS

           Back in Arkopolis, Kenyon and Skip are engaged in their
           big duel as the DARK ELVES watch on. 
                                                                      #

           Like any such climactic duel, the advantage goes back and
           forth, Kenyon fighting with his two handed black foam
           sword; Skip with his new sword and Empirica shield.

           Kenyon shoves Skip back with his shield, and Skip nearly
           topples.

           Seeing this, Ralph, clearly angered, lunges to help Skip,
           but Rebecca stops him.

                                  REBECCA AS ELVENMAID
                        Ni must mo busnesa.

           Unbelievably, Ralph replies in Elftongue. Somehow he’s
           picked it up, or perhaps he’s always known it. It’s the
           one line in Elftongue that is ever subtitled:

                                  RALPH
                        Chicia eiddo honky asen, Skip!
                        Subtitle: “KICK HIS HONKY ASS, SKIP”

           Skip, emboldened, fights back furiously, and then with
           one quick, Marine-style leg sweep, he puts Kenyon on his
           back in the dirt.

           His sword at his foe’s neck, he stares into the eyes of
           his old enemy.

                                  SKIP
                        That last move comes courtesy of the
                        United States Marines Corps

                             (containing his disgust)
                        No.

           Skip waves in the Elves. Delver forces Kenyon to hold a
           length of rope.

                                  DELVER, ELF-KING
                        You are bound.

                        keep you til then.

                                  KENYON
                        No! Not the Elves....
                                                                      #

           The Laughing Elf laughs.

           Skip turns to Rebecca and Ralph. Rebecca and Skip want
           desperately to embrace, but they know they can’t: a
           relationship outside the game cannot be carried over into
           the game.

           But Ralph cannot help but high five him.

                                  RALPH
                        Nice work, Bilbo.

                                  SKIP
                        It’s not done yet.

           He turns to Duke Manifred.

                                  SKIP (CONT’D)
                        Duke Manifred, my men are under siege by
                        Mordom.

                                  DUKE MANIFRED OF ARKOPOLIS
                        Then your men are dead.

                                  SKIP
                        That may be, but I have to try to save
                        them. Will you help me?

                                  DUKE MANIFRED OF ARKOPOLIS
                             (seeing Kenyon captured)
                        Yes. Fuck yes.

           They race off.
           EXT. THE STEEP HILLSIDE- MOMENTS LATER

           On the steep wooded hillside, Empirica makes its last
           stand. 

           Darius, Marius, Oxholt, Conanicon, and Karnage are trying
           to hold the narrow path up the hill, but they are being
           pushed back and up by a column of some 15 Mordomites, all
           in a line.  

           Marius, at the front of the pack, is killed.

                                  DARIUS
                        No!

           EXT. THE FINAL BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS

           We see Skip, Duke Manifred, and five Arkopolitan Warriors
           sprinting across the battlefield, rushing to the steep
           hillside.

           EXT. THE REFUGE CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

           We see Empirica beaten back into the small Refuge
           Clearing. The 11 remaining Mordomites, no longer confined
           to the path, flood into the clearing and quickly surround
           our four remaining heroes.

           EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL - CONTINUOUS

           We see the Mordomite Lieutenant, now alone, standing at
           the foot of the path that leads up the hill. Skip runs
           up, spins him around, and quickly kills him before racing
           up the path.

                                  MORDOMITE LT.
                        I am mortally wounded. But your men are
                        finished!

           EXT. THE REFUGE CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

           We see a bird’s eye view of Karnage, Conanicon, Oxholt,
           and Darius in a circle, taking refuge behind their
           shields, as they are tightly surrounded and harried by
           the Mordomites.

           Darius is killed as Skip runs into the clearing. He can’t
           see past the circle of Mordomites.
                                  SKIP
                        Karnage?! Do you live?

                                  KARNAGE
                        I live!

                                  SKIP
                        INCOMING!

           Skip raises his hand. He’s holding the Brooch of
           Disruption.

           Karnage sees this.

                                  KARNAGE
                             (to himself)
                        No. Please don’t throw it. I can’t catch
                        anything.

           Skip throws it. It wobbles through the air... AND
           DIRECTLY INTO KARNAGE’S HAND!

                                                                      #

                        I... I wield the Brooch of Disruption! I,
                        a mage of the ninth rank and warmaster of
                        the seventh, have right to bear this
                        brooch and speak its power.

           Everyone freezes as Karnage speaks. His voice is suddenly
           powerful. Plus: the Brooch of Disruption is a major
           weapon.

                                                                      #
                        All who hear me know this spell/Foe on
                        foe turn on themselves/Until death claims
                        their souls for hell. I am Karnage, mage
                        of the ninth order, warmaster of the
                        realm of Empirica, and I wield the Brooch
                        of Disruption!

           Slowly, the Mordomites, knowing they have no choice, turn
           on one another, robotically killing each other one by
           one.

                                                                      #

           It’s all a role-play, but it should seem strange and
           dreamlike, and the remaining warriors of Empirica walk
           through the chaos, amazed, weary, and relieved: Victory.

           Skip and Karnage greet one another and embrace. They walk
           through the surreal, role-played fight of their enemies.
                                  KARNAGE (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, Milord. That’s twice you’ve
                        saved my life.

                                  SKIP
                        I thank you warmaster. It was a good
                        plan.

                                  KARNAGE
                        It was a reasonable strategy. But war
                        fights itself once it is begun. The only
                        truly inspired part, if I may say so,
                        came before the war even started.

                                  SKIP
                        Which part was that?

                                  KARNAGE
                        The part where I convinced your father to
                        charge you with defeating Mordom.

           He walks on as Skip stands, stunned.

                                  SKIP
                        What did you say?

                                  KARNAGE
                        He wanted to give you the speedboat. Can
                        you believe it? 

           Skip and Karnage leave camera as the last Mordomite kills
           his last comrade and then himself.

           We hold on the clearing for a moment: 14 “dead” bodies,
           still and gruesome. Then an Elder emerges from the woods.

                                  ELDER
                        Game over.

           And one by one, they all get up. 

           EXT. BOTTOM OF THE HILL - MOMENTS LATER

           Skip and Karnage reach the bottom of the hill, where they
           are soon joined by their revived comrades: Marius,
           Darius, Oxholt, and Conanicon.

           Awaiting them are a company of Dark Elves, including
           Rebecca, Ralph, and the captured Kenyon. 

           Delver now bows to Skip.

                        Now you are king of Mordom and all its
                        former lands. Richy and richy you are.
                        But are you still prepared to pay the
                        price?

                        Shall I retrieve the belt, milord?

           The Laughing Elf laughs uproariously for a moment, and
           then suddenly stops, deadpan. 

                                  SKIP
                        No, Karnage. That’s not the whole price.

                                  DELVER, ELF-KING
                        The true price, warmaster, is a favor.
                        For many years we have raised and trained
                        this changeling...
                             (waves to a confused Rebecca)
                        ...fed her meat and roots, when deep-
                        elves eat only night air and starlight.
                        For the long lifesy of the king, I do not
                        know why we stole her in the first place.
                        She is very... boring.

           Rebecca is surprised and angry. She doesn’t know what to
           say, or what language to say it in.

                        Now we see she has borne a squealing
                        little piglet, mud-mouthed and hungry.
                        Are we to raise this one as well? No. It
                        is too much for elf-kind. Too boring.

                                  RALPH
                        Are you talking about me?

           Delver points dramatically at Skip.

                                  DELVER, ELF-KING
                        You take them. Marry. Leave elf-kind in
                        peace at last.

                                  SKIP
                             (smiling at Rebecca’s shock)
                        You know that I agree. But does the
                        changeling?

           Rebecca stares back and forth at them both in anger.
                                  REBECCA AS ELVENMAID
                        Fucking elves!

           EXT. EMPIRICA CAMPSITE - THE NEXT DAY

           Cut to Rebecca and Skip’s marriage... their in-game
           marriage at least.

           It is the next day, at the beginning of twilight. With
           the fog gone, the circular meadow is bright and beautiful

           All of Darkon has assembled for the ceremony. Skip and
           Rebecca stand in full costume. The Elder of Elders is set
           to officiate and stands between them.

                                  REBECCA AS ELVENMAID
                             (to the Elder of Elders)

                                                                      #
                        Let me ask you a question. Won’t it
                        violate the rules for us to be married
                        both in Darkon and out of Darkon?

                                  ELDER OF ELDERS
                        Hang on. Are you two already married?
                                                                      #

                                  SKIP
                        No! I mean... wait. Are you proposing?

                                  REBECCA AS ELVENMAID
                        That’s right, human. If we’re doing this,
                        it’s no game.

           It dawns on him: she just proposed to him, for real.

                                  SKIP
                        Oh. OH! Right. I mean: yes!
                             (then, to Elder of Elders)
                        But what about the rule?

                                  ELDER OF ELDERS
                             (shrugs)
                        You know what? Do whatever you want.

           That’s about all the ceremony they need. Skip and Rebecca
           kiss, and all of Darkon cheers.

                                  REBECCA.
                             (to Skip, half-sarcastically)
                        Look at that: a fairy tale ending.

                                  SKIP
                        Really? I didn’t even notice. 
           As they kiss again, we hear a voice-over epilogue. It may
           not be immediately obvious, but it’s Chaz’s voice.

                                  CHAZ (V.O.)
                        And so Mordom was defeated, its lands
                        given by King Skip to all the realms of
                        Darkon to explore and settle as they
                        liked.

           EXT. THE COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           The camera pulls back further to show the crowd gathered,
           the shape of the hill, and the great beautiful country
           that surrounds them.

           EXT. THE WOODS - DAY

                                                                      #
                                  CHAZ (V.O.)
                        Among those new pioneers was a dark
                        stranger, of unknown name, yet somehow
                        familiar in his gray eyes and dark
                        ambitions.

           We see Kenyon, now playing a different character, hiking
           through the woods at some point in the future. He’s now
           wearing a very long, enormous, ridiculous beard.

                                  CHAZ (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But for now the realms were calm and
                        ordered. While some empires failed...

           EXT. EMPIRES MINIATURES - DAY

           Mal, Jr. watches bitterly as the sign for Empires
           Miniatures is taken down and the equipment is carted out.

                                  CHAZ (V.O.)
                        ...Empirica would thrive and grow.

           INT. THE BACK ROOM OF STARBUCKS - DAY

           Conanicon is seen recruiting a new group of players at
           Starbucks.

                                  CHAZ (V.O.)
                        And once the King’s skill at weapons and
                        armor craft...
           INT. REBECCA’S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

           We see Skip designing a suit of armor on the computer.

                                  CHAZ (V.O.)
                        ...joined the Queen’s business savvy,
                        their online business was soon generating
                        a far greater fortune.

           EXT. SKIP AND REBECCA’S NEW HOUSE - DAY

           Skip, Rebecca, and Ralph stand outside a brand new, eco-
           friendly, underground house.

                                  CHAZ (V.O.)
                        They even hired the king’s brother to
                        help with the books.

           INT. SKIP’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mal, Jr. sits in Skip’s old house, working on a
           spreadsheet, then secretly clicking over to play World of
           Warcraft.

                                  CHAZ (V.O.)
                        News was not as good for Empirica’s
                        warmaster, who was forced to give up his
                        mask due to a recently discovered allergy
                        to latex...

           EXT. A DARKON BATTLEFIELD - DAY

           In the heat of battle, Karnage takes off his mask and
           scratches his neck feverishly.
                                                                      #

                                  CHAZ (V.O.)
                        But this too had a happy outcome, as it
                        allowed someone to finally see his face.

           As Karnage scratches, he notices the foam rubber monster *****
           woman from the very beginning of the movie. She takes off *****
           HER mask, and smiles at him. He returns the smile... 
           awkwardly.

                                  CHAZ (V.O.) (CONT’D)

                                                                      #
                        Ralph never did join Empirica, choosing
                        instead to join his mother’s people and
                        their wild unpredictable ways.
           INT. THE LAST HOMELY HOUSE - EVENING

           The Elves and Ralph, in full make up, are dancing like
           maniacs with the Banana Republic belt.

                                  CHAZ (V.O.)
                        And after some debate, the Dark Elves
                        decided they wanted the belt any way. It
                        was from Banana Republic, after all. 

           INT. BRADLEY FIGHTING VECHICLE - DAY

           We close up on Chaz’s face, riding in a car of some kind.  ***

                                                                      #
                                  CHAZ (V.O.)
                        As for the King’s brother, he traveled
                        far and wide, not knowing if he would
                        ever return to Darkon, but pleased to
                        learn such news as could be sent to him
                        by electronic mail...

           We pull back to reveal Chaz, in uniform, reading a
           printed e-mail as he rides in a Bradley fighting vehicle
           through the streets of Baghdad. 

           As he finishes reading, he smiles.

                                  CHAZ (CONT’D)
                             (Live; not V.O.)
                        Love you, bro.

                                  CHAZ (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...and to hear tales of those peaceful
                        lands beyond the sea, and the wise and
                        noble ruler who watched over them all.

           CHAZ puts the e-mail in his pocket. The Bradley squeals
           to a halt, and CHAZ steps out into the middle of a busy
           Baghdad market. Almost immediately, a car bomb explodes
           next to him, blowing him out of the frame.

                                                     FADE TO BLACK.
