           EXT.  PRIVATE AIRPORT -- DAY

           Dark, gray day.  TWO CORPORATE JETS idling on the runway.     Big 
           jets, engines whining, faced-off across a hundred yards  of 
           blacktop.  

           TWO LONE FIGURES -- one from each plane -- marching toward  the 
           empty middle in SUPER-SLO-MOTION...  

           ON THE LEFT -- THE BURKETT & RANDLE JET.  The famous blue-    on-
           red B&R logo tattooed across its frame.  AN ANXIOUS GROUP OF 
           EMPLOYEES -- ASSISTANTS, VICE PRESIDENTS, FLIGHT CREW -- all 
           gathered near the step-ramp, watching HOWARD TULLY,   their 
           beloved CEO, striding off into the breach.  TULLY the legendary 
           titan.  The mythic boardroom shogunate.  

           ON THE RIGHT -- THE EQUIKROM JET.  Slick and aggressive.  Silver 
           and green.  ANOTHER WORRIED ENTOURAGE gathered at the ramp, 
           watching RICHARD "SICK DICK" GARSIK rushing forward  into no-
           man's-land.  GARSIK the buccaneer CEO.  A corporate carnivore in 
           his prime.  Hypervisionary.  Hypereffective.  Hyperactive. 

           CREDITS ROLLING as this slow-motion encounter ripens.  And no, 
           this will not be a cordial union of peers.  Both men yelling -- 
           screaming -- as they draw closer.  Words lost beneath the roar 
           of the turbines.  Arms waving.  Toe-to-toe.  The Finger In The 
           Face.  The Belly Bump.  The Huff and Puff. The Touch-Me-One-More-
           Time until...

           A punch is thrown.  

           Even the majestic influence of slow-motion can't pretty this up.  
           It's an instant, ugly, awkward playground brawl.  And as TULLY 
           and GARSIK begin rolling on the runway, as those TWO TERRIFIED 
           ENTOURAGES break ranks and start their slow-motion sprint toward 
           the battle, as the CREDITS CONCLUDE...

           WE FADE TO BLACK and...

           EXT. MADISON AVENUE -- DAY

           Lunch hour on a sunny day.  Midtown in full parade.  Streets 
           jammed.  Sidewalks busy.    

                                  ONE YEAR LATER      

           RAY KOVAL in motion.  RAY with the good suit and the easy smile.  
           Gliding through the pedestrian passing lanes with       A PHONE 
           to his ear --    
                                                      #1  10/30/07   2.

                                 RAY
                        -- so I wake up, I don't even have a 
                        chance to think about how hungover I    
                        am, because I look out the window        
                        and realize we're driving North -- 

                                 DALE(OVER/PHONE) 
                        -- he's about three meters behind you -- 

                                 RAY
                        -- which is right about when I figure    
                        out I've hitched a ride on the wrong 
                        bloody convoy -- 

                                 DALE(OVER/PHONE)
                        -- he's in a navy turtleneck -- gray 
                        jacket -- he's got a phone, he just 
                        doesn't seem to be doing any talking --  

                                 RAY
                        -- six hours later, I'm on a mountain in 
                        Kurdistan, watching a couple infantry 
                        grunts try to wrangle thirty, hungry,  
                        U.S. Government Mules off these trucks --

                        -- he made the turn with us on Fifty- 
                        First Street --

           There's the guy he's talking about.  Call him TURTLENECK.    Is 
           he shadowing RAY, or not?   

                                 RAY
                        -- meanwhile, we're surrounded by a 
                        hundred, well-armed, seriously pissed-  
                        off Kurds.  Why are they so upset? 
                        Because they thought these guys were 
                        bringing them Toyotas, not donkeys -- 

           DALE RAIMES is half a block back.  Mid-thirties.  Appealing and 
           forgettable.  He looks to be just another walk-and-talk midtown 
           drone.  Anything but.  

                                 DALE(OVER/PHONE)
                        -- why don't you tap the brakes a little, 
                        let's see what he does -- 

           RAY -- suddenly -- shit, A PEN -- his pen -- he's dropped it   -- 
           there it is clattering across the pavement -- PASSERSBY swarming 
           past as he stops -- kneels -- scrambling to pick the damn thing 
           up and --

           TURTLENECK -- caught tailgating -- off guard -- forced to  pass -
           - fumbling to stay incognito and -- 

                                 RAY 
                           (right back in the flow)
                        -- hey, sorry, you still there? --

                        -- bingo -- that was sweet, man --  

           And here comes DALE -- passing RAY now -- blowing right by  him -
           - as if they were total strangers --   

                                 DALE
                        -- so look, there's no way he's working 
                        solo -- if we're gonna bust you out it's 
                        gotta be now, let's push at the corner -- 

           CUT TO 

           ONE BLOCK SOUTH.  Same time.  And here's a new player, this guy 
           is walking uptown, toward Ray and Dale.  His name is FETYOV.  
           Late-fifties.  Seen-it-all eyes.  Seen-it-all suit.  He too is 
           working a cellphone as he walks.  Except he's speaking Russian: 

                                 FETYOV

                        street.  There's woman, I'm behind her, 
                        she's wearing an orange sweater --) 

           CUT TO 

           RAY back on the move -- behind DALE now -- the two of them 
           continuing downtown, about half a block from the corner --   

                                 RAY
                           (more breezy phone chatter)
                        -- so these Kurds, right? -- they    start 
                        getting very chippy about it --

           FETYOV still heading uptown --

           CUT TO 

           TURTLENECK almost to the corner, trying to stall and --

           RAY rushing off across Madison Avenue, sprinting away through

           WHAM! -- pedestrian collision -- TURTLENECK just blindsided --

           THE DOOR flies open.  RAY hustling past, rushing down the steps, 
           past the bathrooms and -- 

           INT.  PIZZA DELI BASEMENT CORRIDOR -- DAY (CONT)

           Another DOOR slamming open.  RAY jogging through the bowels    
           of the building.  Another DOOR -- another HALLWAY -- another 
           STAIRWELL -- we're lost, but RAY knows where he's going -- 

           EXT.  MIDTOWN SIDE-STREET -- DAY

           A fire door popping open.  RAY out and up the street.  Walking 
           away like a guy that knows there's nobody following him.  

           INT.  GRAND CENTRAL STATION -- DAY

           The Main Concourse.  RAY standing dead center as the world 
           rushes around him.  It's 1:58 on the BIG CEILING CLOCK.      He 
           checks his watch.   Pulls his cellphone.  Eyes scanning  the 
           crowd as he dials.  And then, something catching his eye across 
           the concourse -- 

           HIS POV

           A WOMAN COMING DOWN THE MAIN STAIRCASE.  Meet CLAIRE STENWICK,    
           a very attractive, stylish, confident woman.  And she's rather 
           far away, but it did appear for a moment like she was looking 
           this way.  Except wait, now she's looking back the way she came -
           - now left -- now right...  She's lost. 

           CUT TO 

           RAY staring.  Eyes locked on her.  

           CUT TO 

           CLAIRE turning -- she's realized her mistake -- heading back out 
           through the crowd, toward the street behind her and -- 

           CUT TO 

           RAY moving -- tentative -- trying to keep an eye on her --

           CUT TO 

           FAR ACROSS THE CONCOURSE.  DALE pretending not to panic --

           EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE -- DAY

           RAY rushing around the corner -- scanning up and down the block -
           - he's lost her -- no, there she is up ahead -- 

           CUT TO 

           CLAIRE just noticing that the crosswalk light she's walking 
           toward is about to change -- breaking into a little jog as she 
           hustles across before the traffic surges and -- 

           CUT TO 

           RAY and he's losing her -- fuck -- where did she go? -- 

           CUT TO 

           CLAIRE strolling, window shopping, completely unaware she's 
           being pursued and -- 

           CUT TO 

           RAY and he's spotted her -- there she is, across the street.  
           And what appeared to be simply a matter of lust a few moments 
           ago is now starting to look a little different, because he's 
           pulling off his jacket as he walks, turning it inside out --   
           it's reversible -- suddenly, he's in a different color and -- 

           CUT TO 

           CLAIRE turning a corner and -- 

           CUT TO 

           RAY starting to run -- out into the street -- HORNS HONKING   as 
           he dodges through the traffic -- sprinting now -- up the 
           sidewalk -- coming around that corner and -- 

           She's gone.  

           INT.  SAKS FIFTH AVENUE -- DAY

           Minutes later.  CLAIRE strolling through the first-floor 
           cosmetics casbah.  Smiling and casual, moving toward the 
           elevator bank at the rear, except suddenly, she's not    heading 
           for the elevators anymore -- there's a side exit to the street 
           and she's on her way toward it, when -- 

                                 RAY 
                        Remember me?

           There he is.  In her path.  Smiling.  Waiting...

                        Long time, huh?  

                                 CLAIRE 
                           (it's not coming)
                        ...yes...I'm...I'm...

                                 RAY 
                        Gotcha. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                           (she just can't place him)
                        ...look, I'm sorry, really, I'm just...

                                 RAY 
                        Just what? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I'm drawing a blank.

                                 RAY 
                        Nice try.   

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Excuse me? 

                                 RAY 
                        A little professional courtesy would  
                        make this a lot less awkward.  

                                 CLAIRE 
                        How do I know you?

                        "How do you know me?" 
                           (is she kidding?)
                        Wow.  That's tough.  That's a strong play.  
                           (impressed)
                        Believe me, I spent a lot of time thinking 
                        what this would be like.  
                        Where we'd be.  What I'd say.  
                        What you'd say.  But I never...

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I'm terribly sorry, but...

                                 RAY 
                        You really want to go this way?

                                 CLAIRE
                        You clearly have me confused with    
                        someone else.

                                 RAY 
                        I don't know... 
                           (looking her over) 
                        I'm not great on names.  I should be.  
                        I try, but...  Faces, I'm definitely 
                        better.  Faces, I'd say I'm like a B,    
                        B-Minus.  What I'm good at?  Where I'm 
                        solid?  People-I've-Screwed. (shagged) 
                        That's  been a traditional area of 
                        strength for me.  

           CLAIRE blinks.  But she's a big girl.  It's a public place...

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Look, seriously, I don't know who you 
                        think I am, but wh-- 

                                 RAY 
                        You charm me.  Seduce me.  Screw me.  Then 
                        you dope me and ransack my hotel room. 
                           (he still can't believe it)
                        And how sick is this?  Last thing I 
                        remember before I passed out was how 
                        much I liked you. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I'm sorry...I just...you don't look 
                        crazy, which is the only reason I'm not 
                        screaming for a security guard, but-- 

                                 RAY 
                        I can't believe you're going this way. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Is this...
                           (glancing around)
                        ...it's a joke, right? 

                                 RAY 
                        You have any idea how far my ass was 
                        hanging out because of you? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Is this?  Are you selling something?  What

                        I got up the next morning, went back to

                        We're supposed to be on the same side, 
                        Theresa.  Which was a lousy cover name for 
                        you, by the way -- you're not a Theresa.

                        Who the hell hired you, anyway?

                                 CLAIRE 
                        How did you get this job? 

                                 RAY 
                        I've got news for you, okay?  The day
                        I left MI6, I had fifteen major  companies 
                        begging for my services. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Well, I guess you picked wrong.  
                           (shouldering her bag)
                        But you must be used to that.

                                 RAY 
                        Slow down. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I have a meeting in twelve minutes. 

                                 RAY 
                        Where's the drop?  Hand it over. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Forget it.  I'm not working with you. 

                                 RAY
                        What? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        You think I'm gonna let you be my  contact 
                        officer?  
                           (how amusing)
                        This is way over your head. 

                                 RAY 
                        Over my head?  Lady, I worked Yemen, 
                        Athens, and Cairo.  I was decorated    and 
                        promoted every place I served.   

                                 CLAIRE

                                 RAY 
                        Look, I'm sure you know your way around  a 
                        bidet, but I did twelve years in the 
                        field.  

                                 CLAIRE 
                        And how long have you been working for 
                        Equikrom? 

                                 RAY
                        Long enough.

                                 CLAIRE 
                        How long? 

                                 RAY 
                        Three weeks. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Three whole weeks? 
                           (like a knife)
                        Because I've spent the last fourteen 
                        months undercover inside Burkett & 
                        Randle.  I'm an Assistant Director of 
                        Counter Intelligence.  I'm all the 
                        way in.  So let's get this straight:  
                        I'm the asset here.  You're a delivery 
                        boy.  And the only thing I'm giving 
                        you is a message.  
                           (shouldering her purse)
                        Tell Duke I don't ever want to see 
                        you again.   

           She starts to move away from the bar.  His hand -- like a  vise -- 
           pinning her in her seat. 

                                 RAY 
                           (fast and hard)
                        I run field agents for a living.   There's 
                        only two ways to do it.  Either you bring 
                        them flowers, or hang em by their heels 
                        out the window.  Now maybe you're just so 
                        used to having your legs in the air you 
                        don't realize it, but you're upside down, 
                        sister.  I own you. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        You've got ten seconds to get your hand 
                        off me.  

                                 RAY 
                        Or what?  You won't be my friend anymore? 
                           (in total control)
                        I like this gig.  I like the money and 
                        I like the hours.  So I'm not going 
                        anywhere and you're gonna get over it, 
                        because if you ever mention again that you 
                        don't want to work with me, or that we met 
                        before, or that you think maybe someone 
                        else might do a better job -- hell, if I 
                        get replaced for any reason 
                        at all, I'll call those dupes over at 
                        Burkett & Randle and tell them that 
                        they've got an Equikrom spy in the 
                        heart of their security team.

                        Be a shame to let the last fourteen months 
                        go down the drain, wouldn't it?
                           (the smile)
                        So where's my package? 

           CLAIRE staring.  Pale with fury.  Beaten and not used to it.   
           She reaches into her coat.  Pulls out A GRAY ENVELOPE. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Tell Duke this is the one he's been 
                        waiting for. (moment between them)  
                           (envelope on the bar)
                        You screw this up, I'll ruin your life. 

                                 RAY 
                        I thought we tried that already. 

           That's it.  She's walking.  Fleeing. 

                                 RAY 
                        You want to take one last shot at that 
                        apology? 

           EXT.  THE BURKETT & RANDLE BUILDING -- DAY

           A fifty-story conglomasaur rising over Midtown.  The famous blue-
           on-red logo cast in steel at the center of the plaza.  

           INT. BURKETT & RANDLE LOBBY -- DAY

           A BAR OF SOAP.  But not just any bar of soap, this is a cake of 
           Burkett & Randle's "Finest Personal Purity Cleanser," in its 
           original paper wrapper.  The importance of this simple object 
           becoming manifest, as we start --    

           PULLING BACK TO REVEAL

           This piece of history housed within A PERFECT GLASS CASE and 
           presented with the museum quality of an irreplaceable piece of 
           jewelry.  A PLAQUE -- engraved platinum -- with these words:

                                Burkett & Randle 
                          Part Of Your Life since 1849 

           AND NOW WE SEE 

           THE LOBBY.  Huge.  Stark.  But real.  The display case like   a 
           shrine at the center of the rotunda.  And there's...  

           CLAIRE hustling back to work, just one of the hundreds moving 
           through this temple of imperial corporata.  Pulling her 
           laminated credential as she nears THE LOBBY SECURITY DESK.

           TRACKING NOW

           As CLAIRE is passed through.  As she skips the elevator bank. As 
           she heads for an escalator at the rear of the building...   

           ONTO THE ESCALATOR

           CLAIRE rising past a A SERIES OF BURKETT & RANDLE LOGOS 
           mounted (projected?) on the wall.  A hundred and fifty years 
           of trademark law on display -- testimony to the celebrated 
           history of Burkett & Randle.  That first 19th Century graphic  
           morphing slightly every forty years into the current B&R logo 
           we recognize from the corporate jet.    

           INT. ESCALATOR SECURITY POST -- DAY

           CLAIRE one of dozens waiting on line to pass their credentials 
           through a turnstile and ascend to the mezzanine and -- 

           INT. MEZZANINE SECURITY CHECKPOINT -- DAY

           Tucked at the end of a nondescript hallway, TWO EXECUTIVE 
           SECURITY OFFICERS posted near AN EXPRESS ELEVATOR.  CLAIRE 
           opening her bag for their inspection and -- 

           INT.  AN EXPRESS ELEVATOR -- DAY

           CLAIRE and ONE OTHER PASSENGER alone for the ride.  There's only 
           one button on the console.  She's pressing it and --  

           INT.  THE THIRTY-THIRD FLOOR -- DAY

           Elevator doors opening.  CLAIRE and THE OTHER PASSENGER stepping 
           out into a large, sterile foyer.  Etched into a set of glass 
           doors -- 

                          B&R COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE LAB        

           INT.  COMPETITIVE INTEL LAB -- DAY

           Through those doors, a final security checkpoint.  More serious 
           than the rest.  The kind of facility you'd expect to see in the 
           Pentagon.  In fact, from this point on, everything we'll see 
           here reeks of military issue.  THREE SECURITY TECHNICIANS stand 
           waiting as CLAIRE prepares to surrender herself to A BIOMETRIC 
           SCANNER --

           INT.  COMPETITIVE INTEL LAB HALLWAY -- DAY

           CLAIRE passing A SERIES OF LABELLED DOORS, each of which leads 
           to a suite of offices within:

                  ...PHYSICAL SECURITY...TECHNICAL SECURITY...OPERATIONAL 
                SECURITY..HUMAN INTELLIGENCE...TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE ... 

           CLAIRE keycarding her credential into a door labelled: 

                               COUNTERINTELLIGENCE           

           INT.  THE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE BUREAU -- DAY

           A busy, practical space.  Room for a dozen assistants and 
           cubicle employees.  There's a central common area dominated  by 
           a large display board with cases written in different color 
           markers, very much like a police squadroom: Active Cases, 
           Pending Cases, Closing Cases. 

           CLAIRE on the way to her office when -- 

                                 BAUER  
                        I thought you were shopping. 

           JEFF BAUER at his office door.  Early thirties.  Shifty and 
           engaging.  His relationship with Claire complicated by the fact 
           they currently share the number two position in this office.  A 
           man torn between the desire to seduce and destroy.  

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Didn't see anything I liked. 
                           (he's got a briefing book     in 
                            hand--)
                        You weren't going ahead without me, 
                        were you?                                                                                                                                                                  

           BAUER hesitates.  Caught.  Smiles.

           NED GUSTON is 50/60.  Marine Corps to the Chicago Police Dept. 
           to the F.B.I. to head of this unit.  He's alone here with CLAIRE 
           and BAUER in the midst of a weekly briefing.  There's  A

                                 GUSTON
                        Is this the guy who bought the boat? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Same guy.    

                                 GUSTON 
                        Get a team up his ass tonight.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I sent them this morning.  

           GUSTON glances over.  Almost smiles.  A NEW IMAGE just rising  
           as THE PHONE RINGS and-- 

                                 GUSTON 
                           (grabbing it impatiently) 
                        We're in a meeting.  
                           (and then slowing down       fast-
                            -)
                        Now?
                           (beat)
                        Everyone? 
                           (nervous beat)
                        They say why?
                           (obviously not, because--)

           CLAIRE and BAUER watching him slowly lower the phone, until --

                                 GUSTON
                        Tully.  
                           (catching his breath)
                        Mr. Tully's coming down.  
                           (beat)
                        He wants the entire floor gathered 
                        in five minutes.

           INT. HOWARD TULLY'S OFFICE -- DAY

           A Bonsai tree.  A fountain pen.  HANDS FOLDING A SHEET OF PAPER 
           with the artistry and precision of an origami master.   TULLY 
           tucking the paper into his pocket.  A LAPTOP the only other 
           thing on the enormous stone desk.  TULLY moving the 
           cursor..."click," and --  

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL

           TULLY alone in this monster penthouse suite.  Top of the world.  
           Stripped to essentials.  Stark, colonial Zen. 

           A TELESCOPE across the room, parked before a huge picture 
           window.  Activated by the laptop -- responding to coordinates 
           like an automated artillery piece -- gears turning -- axis -- 
           azimuth -- focus...  

           TULLY there as it finishes.  Eye to the lens and --  

           TELESCOPIC POV

           THE EQUIKROM BUILDING.  Ten blocks away.  Another imperial 
           monolith.  Logo at the top.  A beehive of offices and people 
                                                     #1  10/30/07   21.

           working.  The telescope rising toward the penthouse office,  and 
           there -- A SIGN in one of the windows -- handwritten: 

                           EAT ME YOU SENILE OLD LOSER!     

           TULLY pulling back from the scope.  Almost smiling, as -- 

           INT.  HALLWAY/PRIVATE EQUIKROM ELEVATOR -- DAY

           DICK GARSIK, AN AIDE and TWO BODYGUARDS stepping in.       GARSIK 
           checking his teeth in a mirror as the doors close     and they 
           descend -- 

                                 THE AIDE 
                        There's a dandruff shampoo marketing 
                        presentation at three...

           INT. SECRET EQUIKROM BASEMENT GARAGE -- DAY

           An underground VIP-only entrance.  BODYGUARDS out first.  GARSIK 
           and THE AIDE right behind them.  A HUGE MERCEDES BULLETPROOF 
           STRETCH parked there and -- 

           Front and center -- GARSIK'S DOUBLE -- this guy was probably  a 
           pretty decent match to start with, but dressed and groomed,  
           identically, he's quite a clone.  A tableau made more bizarre by 
           the TWO BODYGUARD DOUBLES he's got standing beside him.  

                                 GARSIK 
                           (to The Double)
                        C'mere...

           GARSIK practically choking the guy as he fixes his tie.  

                                 THE AIDE
                           (nervously looking around)
                        There should be another vehicle...

                                 GARSIK
                        Change in plans.  You're going with them. 
                           (before the guy can argue)
                        Let's go, folks...

                        Get out there and sell it. 

           THE AIDE hustled into THE MERCEDES behind THE DOUBLE, and   THE 
           MOCK BODYGUARDS and --  

                                 GARSIK
                        Go!  Go!  Get the hell out of here!

           Like a shot, THE MERCEDES peels up the ramp, chirping around the 
           corner, and the moment it's gone --  

           FROM THE OTHER DIRECTION -- A VAN -- a shitty, rust-bucket 
           PAINTER'S VAN -- rumbles into the spot just vacated --  

           And there's GARSIK and HIS TWO BODYGUARDS rushing to pull paint-
           stained jumpsuits on over their suits.  GARSIK done first, 
           already jogging around the van and -- 

                                 GARSIK 
                           (to the driver)
                        Move over.  Move -- I'm driving --

           THE BODYGUARDS can't keep up, struggling with the jumpsuits,  
           hobbling for the van as GARSIK revs  the engine and -- 

           INT.  THE UNIT -- DAY

           Equikrom's secret guerilla espionage facility.  Except all we're 
           seeing right now is an abandoned, vacant floor in a midtown high-
           rise office building.  Furniture scattered.   Carpeting torn up.  
           Phone and computer wiring pigtailed here and there.  Weird and 
           empty, except...VOICES -- SOUNDS -- leading us finally to...

           INT.  THE UNIT/BULLPEN -- DAY (CONT)

           A secret, windowless bunker of suites at the center of this 
           abandoned floor.  Two main areas: BULLPEN and TECH ROOM.   Lots 
           of slick gear, lots of tools and gadgets.  But raw.  
           Utilitarian.  At the moment,  SIX PEOPLE are crowded around a 
           lab table.  RAY, DALE, and FETYOV we already know...  

           DUKE MONAHAN is sixty, which is a miracle considering all   the 
           shitty places he has tested his body around the world.     He's 
           the boss here.  Project leader.  Mercenary spy for hire.  

           PARVEZ PATEL is a walking algorithm in his mid-twenties.  

           PAM FRALES can do anything.  Speak Mandarin.  Perform a 
           battlefield appendectomy.  Roll a joint one-handed.  At the 
           moment, she's using surgical tongs to pull A WINKLED PIECE    OF 
           PAPER from THE GRAY ENVELOPE Claire passed to Ray.

                        For crissake, Duke, calm down.  
                        Do something useful and punch up 
                        Howard Tully's fingerprints.  

           TIME CUT 

           AN OVERHEAD PROJECTOR.  As the light switch is thrown and TWO 
           IDENTICAL FINGERPRINTS are projected onto the wall.  One from 
           the drop.  One from the file.  

                                 PAM
                        That's a stone cold match.

                        Howard Tully.  

           DUKE grabbing THE WRINKLED PAPER and --

           CLOSE-UP

           IT'S A HANDWRITTEN SPEECH.  Fountain pen.  A working draft.  
           Corrections scribbled here and there.  Not much time to read it 
           though, because here he comes --

                           (swamping the room) 
                        How y'all doing?  Good to see ya.
                        I keep forgetting you're all over 
                        here till I get the damn bill every month.  
                        So what the hell you got 
                        there, Duke?  What's got everybody so 
                        fired up?  

           DUKE with no choice.  Handing him THE WRINKLED PAPER, as --

           INT.  THE BURKETT & RANDLE "WAR ROOM" -- DAY

           HOWARD TULLY pulling that carefully folded SHEET OF PAPER  from 
           his jacket.  It's a speech, his final draft, handwritten and 
           perfect.  And as he spreads it before him, we -- 

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL 

           A most serious conference room.  Full Corporate Strangelovia.     
           The big oval table.  The up-lighting.  "Generals" at the table, 
           each with a little plaque designating their command: PHYSEC -- 
           TECHSEC -- OPSEC -- HUMINTEL -- TECHINTEL -- COUNTERINTEL.  Each 
           director with their Senior Staff in position behind them.  Maybe 
           thirty people in the room.

           FINALLY TO

           GARSIK standing there, staring at the paper.  Staring as if  he 
           reads it again it might say something different.  

                                 DUKE 
                        Dick...

           But GARSIK is frozen.  RAY glances to FETYOV who gives him a, 
           "you-don't-want-any-part-of-what's-about-to-happen" look. 

                                 GARSIK
                           (an apocalyptic whisper)
                        What the hell does he have over there?

                                 DUKE
                        Dick, don't go dark on me now...
                           (full court cheerleading)
                        We've got to stay positive.  Look around! 
                        This is why we're here!  When you came 
                        to me -- our first conversation -- this is 
                        it, this is why we built this unit.

                                 GARSIK
                        I know what he's doing...

                                 DUKE
                        Dick.  Dick, look at me...
                           (it's not working)
                        This is a great team we've got here.  
                        We are so prepped -- we are so ready to 
                        deploy -- you say the word -- you turn  us 
                        loose -- unleash the beast, Dick,    and 
                        we will tear this thing apart! 

                                 GARSIK
                        ...he's just timing the blow...

                                 DUKE
                        No!  Wrong.  We caught a break here.   
                                                     #1  10/30/07   27.

                                 GARSIK 
                        A break?  You call this a break? 
                        I've got a shareholders convention in  ten 
                        days!  

                                 DUKE 
                        He's not thinking about that.  

                                 GARSIK
                        Are you out of your freaking mind?     
                        That's all he thinks about! 
                           (here it comes)
                        And believe me, if he's got a knife, 
                        that's when he's gonna swing it, because 
                        that's what I'd do!  I'd wait till he 
                        was right in the middle of a big old 
                        standing ovation -- I'd wait till he 
                        was just so overwhelmed with beloved 
                        waves of adoration that he couldn't 
                        even hear the sound of his own cojones 
                        as they hit the floor!
                           (eyes back to the paper)
                        Oh God, he's gonna crush me...

                        Then they're in the wrong business.

                        How are we supposed to work it up if we 
                        don't know what we're protecting? 

                                 GUSTON 
                        I don't know!

           INT.  "THE UNIT" -- BULLPEN -- DAY

           Emergency meeting.  Whole team.  Show and tell for GARSIK.  
           MONITORS, CHALKBOARD, CUSTOM-EQUIPMENT, and first up is --

                                 PATEL
                        B&R's mainframe network is a beast. 
                        We spent ten months probing -- VPN's,
                        Wide-Area Nets, Nodal PEAS -- we got 
                        nowhere.  The encryption and system 
                        awareness are tactically equivalent 
                        to anything we had at the Pentagon...  
                           (Duke COUGHS, pointedly--)
                        Right.  Good news.  The good news is
                        the two hundred new photocopiers that
                        B&R purchased last month.  We took a 
                        little visit to the vendor and made a 
                        few adjustments to one of the units before 
                        they shipped.  We now have a toehold 
                        within the network.  So the 
                        new issue becomes how do you explore 
                        without leaving footprints...
                           (wheeling out a piece of 
                            equipment--)
                        We call this..."The Ghost." 

           A LARGE, ODD, PROTO/BETA-LOOKING MACHINE spitting pages every 
           couple seconds into a paper tray --

                        It's not fast.  It's not easy.  
                        But this device allows us to hijack signal 
                        traffic without leaving any electronic 
                        residue behind.  
                           (pulling a page)
                        Right now we're hacking a photocopier 
                        in their Human Resources Department. 
                        We're still mapping, but so far we've 
                        tapped into twelve units.

                        in Westchester hasn't brought a major 
                        new product to market since 1997.  
                        In spite of that, we've made it a  
                        surveillance priority.  Rather than 
                        risk resources on a breach mission, 
                        we decided to utilize an external, 
                        behavioral-predictive forecasting grid
                        to gauge levels of excitement and 
                        optimism within the facility.

                        quality of vehicles in the parking lot.
                        2) We track the stock portfolios and 
                        mortgage payments of everyone who works  
                        on site.  3) We monitor the frequency 
                        of internet shopping and pornography 
                        searches from inside the labs.

                        plenty of free parking.  There's nothing 
                        going on here.  We feel confident that 
                        whatever this new product is, it came from 
                        outside the company.  The moment this 
                        meeting breaks up, we'll be going over 
                        every acquisition B&R has made in the last

                        This B&R building is very strong with 
                        security.  Is the same for us like the 
                        computer.  We are all the time feeling our 
                        way around this building, but not getting 
                        anywhere.

           After midnight.  CLAIRE walking home from work.  Striding uptown 
           through the Westside.  Her pace intense enough to   make you 
           wonder if it's exercise or punishment?    

           EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE -- NIGHT

           Same moment.  A TAXI.  Cruising downtown.

           CLAIRE just came in.  It's a one bedroom on a high floor with  a 
           partial view of the park.  Clean and bright and anonymously 
           Pottery-Barn-pleasant to the point of sadness.

           not eating the cold sandwich he's dragged back from the  deli -- 
           too busy sitting on the sofa-ette staring out into space.  
           Thinking.  She's out there somewhere...

           CLAIRE should be showering.   Should be eating.  Should be 
           sleeping before it gets too late.  Instead she's standing at the 
           window, staring out over her partial view of the city.  Knowing.  
           He's out there somewhere...

           RAY at a sidewalk cafe.  RAY with A STUNNING ITALIAN BLONDE.  
           RAY talking and THE BLONDE is laughing and THE WAITER is 
           pouring.  And now she's excusing herself for a moment and he's 
           watching her walk back into the cafe, and then his eyes drift 
           out across the passing scene and...he freezes.  

           ACROSS THE PIAZZA

           A WOMAN STANDING AT THE FOUNTAIN.  A very attractive, stylish, 
           confident woman.  And she's rather far away but it does appear 
           she's looking this way.  Except now she's adjusting her bag, so 
           maybe she was just stretching or something.  

           It's CLAIRE.

           EXT.  PIAZZA MINERVA -- DAY (CONT)

           CLAIRE passing the Pantheon.  Walking quick through the crowd.  
           Fishing for a key in her bag because there's HER VESPA locked  
           with about twenty others.  Just kneeling to the lock, when -- 

                                 RAY (OS)
                        Remember me? 

           She turns.  There he is.  Breathless.  Waiting...

                                 RAY 
                        Gotcha.

                        I'm drawing a blank here.

                        Don't.  Don't even try it. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Excuse me? 

                                 RAY 
                        Can I make a suggestion? 
                           (enjoying this)
                        A little professional courtesy would  
                        make this a lot less awkward.

                        Wow.  That's a strong play.  
                           (impressed)
                        And believe me, I spent a lot of time    
                        thinking what this would be like.    Where 
                        we'd be.  What I'd say.  What  you'd say.  
                        But I never...

                        I'm not great on names.  I should be.    I 
                        try, but...  Faces, I'm definitely 
                        better.  Faces, I'd say I'm like a B,    B-

           CLAIRE blinks.  But she's a big girl.  It's a public place.

                        Look, seriously, I don't know who you 
                        think I am, but wh--

                        You talk me up.  Seduce me.  Screw me.  
                        Then you dope me and ransack my hotel 
                        room. 
                           (he still can't believe it)
                        And how sick is this?  The the last thing 
                        I remember before I passed out was how 
                        much I liked you.

           INT.  ROMAN HOTEL HALLWAY -- DAY

           A five star, Roman Palace.  Sunlight through brocade curtains.  
           AN ITALIAN CHAMBERMAID dusting a vase, looking up as --     

                                 HOTEL MANAGER

                        (Anything moving in number four?) 

           The MAID shakes her head no.  THE HOTEL MANAGER stops at the 
           door to #4.  He listens.  Hears nothing.  He pulls A BULGING 
           ENVELOPE from his pocket.  Kneeling, he forces it through a mail 
           slot at the base of the door. 

           INT.  SITTING ROOM/ROMAN HOTEL SUITE -- DAY

           Ultra Euro Luxe.  Thick curtains drawn against the daylight.  
           THE CAMERA TOURING this incredible room:  A CHAMPAGNE BUCKET 
           with an empty bottle upside down in a puddle of warm water.  
           ROOM SERVICE TRAYS with the remnants of an amazing supper.  
           SPENT BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE everywhere.  THE FIREPLACE a 
           graveyard of shattered glasses.  FLOWERS stripped from vases and 
           scattered in some pagan arrangement across an antique carpet...   

           AND FINALLY

           RAY AT THE BEDROOM DOOR.  Propped there with a sheet half 
           clutched around him.  Taking in the carnage.  Everything he sees 
           a reminder of why he feels the way he does.  And there.  Shit...

           THE ENVELOPE just inside the door. 

           INT.  BEDROOM/ROMAN HOTEL SUITE -- DAY

           RAY with THE ENVELOPE, easing back into the huge, handcarved 
           bed; almost disappearing in its pillowy chaos of goosedown and 
           fine linen.  Trying to move as quietly as he can, because --

           RAY, with great reluctance, opens THE ENVELOPE...it is, of 
           course, THE BILL.  An epic, itemized catalog of the previous

                        Very. 
                           (he's serious)
                        Very worth it.  

           And she smiles.  And he's dumping the bill.  And this could get 
           very friendly, very quickly...

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hang on...
                           (hold the thought)
                        I'm crazy thirsty...

           She rolls over.  Finding bedside water.  There's the clock...  

                                 CLAIRE
                        Omigod...   

                                 RAY
                        What?

                                 CLAIRE
                        It's noon.
                           (she's rocked)
                        It's twelve-fifteen.  What happened to 
                        the wake-up call?
                           (pulling away)
                        I left a wake-up call...
                           (confirmation from her     watch 
                            on the table--)
                        Oh, God...
                           (already in motion)
                        I had a ten-thirty flight!  I'm supposed 
                        to be landing in Geneva right now.  

           Bang.  She's up -- she's out of bed.  RAY watching her race 
           around the room -- searching -- scrambling -- dressing, as -- 

                                 RAY 
                        You probably told me all this.            I 
                        just don't remember it.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        No.  I couldn't.  It's classified. 

                                 RAY 
                        Hell, I was supposed to be in Cairo  
                        two days ago...

                                 CLAIRE 
                        You told me London. 

                                 RAY 
                        The point is I blew it off.  

                                 CLAIRE 
                        And nobody called this morning?  

                                 RAY 
                        You were here. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I'm a heavy sleeper. 

                                 RAY
                        What're you saying?  I took the call   and 
                        didn't tell you? 
                           (now he's probing)
                        When did you set this up anyway? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Last night. 

                                 RAY 
                        Where was I? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        In the bath.

                                 RAY
                        We were in there together... 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        When I went for the ice.  

                                 RAY 
                           (incredulous)
                        While I was waiting? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                           (counterattack)
                        I can't believe they didn't call. 

                                 RAY
                        You snuck out of the tub to leave a
                        wake-up call? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        This is a five-star hotel.  How does  that 
                        happen? 
                                                     #1  10/30/07   40.

                                 RAY 
                        Welcome to Italy.  

           Suddenly, they're silent.  Squared off.   

                                 CLAIRE
                        Look, I told you it was classified.             
                        I shouldn't have to explain that to you. 

                                 RAY 
                        Well, this beats the hell out of Dubai. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        What? 

                                 RAY 
                           (rolling out of bed)
                        I'm still standing, right? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        There.  See?  There it is...

                                 RAY 
                        If you're looking for Egyptian Air 
                        Defense codes I'm keeping them in my socks 
                        these days.  

                                 CLAIRE 
                        See, I knew it.  You'll never get 
                        over that, will you?  You couldn't.  

                                 RAY 
                        I'm afraid that's classified. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        You actually think what?  That I'm playing 
                        you? 

                                 RAY 
                        Insane, right?
                           (he's found a champagne bottle 
                            with some life in it--)

                                 CLAIRE 
                        This felt like an assignment to you? 
                        Three days.  All this...
                           (now she's hurt)
                        What was the objective?  Rugburn? 

                                 RAY 
                        Who knows?  Maybe you didn't want me    in 
                        Cairo yesterday.  
                                                     #1  10/30/07   41.

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Oh God, that's so sad...

                                 RAY
                           (the Champagne)
                        Thirsty?

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Because that's exactly what I was just 
                        thinking.  That maybe you were playing me.  
                        That you cancelled my call -- that it was 
                        some revenge thing to get back   at me for 
                        Dubai.  Then I'm thinking how terrible it 
                        is that I think that way.  Then I realized 
                        we both think that way.  Then I'm 
                        thinking, is that what makes this so...

                                 RAY
                        So what? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Worth it.   
                           (wide open) 
                        Is that it?  That I know you're   thinking 
                        exactly what I'm thinking?  
                        Because then I'm thinking, do we both 
                        think like that because of what we do, 
                        or are we good at what we do because 
                        we think like that?  

           RAY hasn't moved since she started talking.  Staring at her.  

                                 RAY
                        Everybody thinks like that, they just 
                        don't say it. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Civilians don't think like that. 

                                 RAY
                        Bullshit.  Nobody trusts anybody.        
                        We just cop to it. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Okay, so cop to it. 

                                 RAY
                        Me?  I think you better go first. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Why?  What am I hiding?  
                                                     #1  10/30/07   42.

                                 RAY
                        This wasn't an accident, was it? 
                        Being here.  Meeting like this. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Wow. 

                                 RAY
                        You came looking for me, didn't you? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        You'd like that, wouldn't you?  

                                 RAY
                        I'm right, aren't I? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Because you went looking for me, right? 

                                 RAY
                        But why?  Just for this...
                           (the bed?  the sex?)

                                 CLAIRE
                        Isn't that enough? 

                                 RAY
                        Not for you. 
                           (pressure drop) 
                        What're we into, Claire? 

           She hesitates.  His hand drifts to her cheek.  Everything 
           quieter and more intimate by the moment.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        Can you imagine living like this?    

                                 RAY
                        Aren't we in enough trouble? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I mean having the money.

                                 RAY
                        Keep going...

                                 CLAIRE
                        How much do you think you'd need? 

           He shrugs, easing the hair back away from her neck...

                                 RAY
                        I don't know.  Twenty million?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I was thinking forty..   

           Her hand now, finding his chest...

                                 RAY
                        What do you have to do to get forty 
                        million dollars? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Go private.  Be smart.  Get lucky. 

                                 RAY
                        How smart?  

           His fingers tracing her shoulder... 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Smart enough to pick the right partner.   

                                 RAY
                        Private you mean? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Corporate.  

           His mouth to her neck.       

                                 RAY
                        And lucky?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Be someplace when something's happening.  
                        Be there first.  Hear it first.  

                                 RAY
                        Something inside. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Something big. 

                                 RAY
                        But do it up right. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Set it deep.  Take your time.  Know 
                        your way out before you go in.

           Lips to her ear.  Getting warmer.  

                                 RAY
                        You know what I think?

                                 CLAIRE
                        You like the idea. 

                                 RAY
                        I think you missed me.  

           She blinks.  She did, but...

                                 CLAIRE
                        I think you cancelled my call. 

                                 RAY
                        So we're even. 

           Forget it.  Her mouth finding his before either of them have  a 
           chance to say another word.  The champagne, sheets, all of  it 
           just falling away, as -- 

           WE COME OUT OF FLASHBACK AND INTO   

           INT.  MANHATTAN RESTAURANT BAR -- NIGHT

           A busy, loud, afterwork scene.  A swingle-ish suit-and-tie 
           crowd.  Meet BARBARA.  She's forty.  She's alone.  She's got her 
           briefcase tucked under the barstool.  Sipping the first  of the 
           two Cosmopolitans she allows herself on Tuesday and Thursday 
           nights.  Putting her drink back on the bar when, suddenly -- 

                                 MALE VOICE (OS)
                        -- oh, damn, excuse me...
                           (because--)

           HER DRINK has spilled -- she's jumping back -- he did it -- 

                                 MALE VOICE (OS)
                           (thick Tennessee accent)
                        -- look at this -- I am so sorry...

           It's RAY...just different.  Glasses.  Tweed coat.  Knit tie.  
           And luggage, he's got a suitcase there and one of those rolling 
           carry-ons and tickets and papers falling out of his pockets, 
           which is why he spilled her drink and -- 

                                 RAY
                           (deep sour mash accent)
                        -- here I am, squeezing around, making   a 
                        complete pig of myself -- 
                           (grabbing napkins and 
                            cleaning it up--)
                        -- look at this -- are you...? 
                                                     #1  10/30/07   45.

                                 BARBARA
                        I'm fine.  Really.  It's nothing. 

           THE BARTENDER jumping in now to finish mopping up and -- 

                                 RAY 
                           (her drink)
                        What was it?  Before I got here...

                                 BARBARA
                        Cosmopolitan. 

                                 RAY
                        That sounds good.  Was it good? 

                                 BARBARA
                           (slightly flustered)
                        Yes.  Very good.  They're great.    

                                 RAY 
                           (to the bartender)
                        We'll have two of those please. 

           THE BARTENDER goes to work.  BARBARA watching RAY struggle to  
           get his bags and papers organized there -- 

                                 BARBARA
                        Coming or going? 

                                 RAY 
                        Well, I woke up in Knoxville, I'm supposed 
                        to be sleeping in Belgium,    and here I 
                        am in New York waiting 
                        for a Cosmopolitan.  I guess I'm just 
                        not sure. 

                                 BARBARA 
                           (charmed already)
                        My daddy was from Tennessee.

                                 RAY 
                        You're kidding.  Where?  

                                 BARBARA
                        Western part of the state. 

                                 RAY 
                        Where? 

                                 BARBARA 
                        Just a little town.  It was actually named 
                        after our family.

                                 RAY
                        Your not gonna make me guess, are you? 

                                 BARBARA
                        Bofferd. 

                                 RAY 
                        Get outta here...

                                 BARBARA
                        What? 

                                 RAY 
                           (looking around)
                        Is this some kinda joke? 

                                 BARBARA
                        No.  Not at all. 

                                 RAY 
                        I used to go fishing in Bofferd.       
                        I grew up in Darnum, next county over.

                                 BARBARA
                        That's my name.  Bofferd.  Barbara

                        Damn...
                           (don't that beat all)
                        Well, it's nice to meet you, Barbara.  
                        I'm Jimmy Tierney...

                                 BARBARA
                        You don't seem like a Jimmy. 

                                 RAY 
                        Actually it's James.  
                           (sheepishly)

                                 RAY  (CONT'D)
                        Actually, it's Doctor Tierney, but...
                           (stopping now because--)

           His cellphone is RINGING and he's trying to answer it and   pay 
           THE BARTENDER who's just delivering their drinks and --

                                 RAY
                           (the phone call)
                        Hello...yeah...did you get them? 
                           (bad news beat)
                        And nobody there can help me out?
                           (worse--)
                        And what?  Wait at the airport all night? 
                           (big sigh)
                        Nope.  It's not your fault.  Thanks. 

           He hangs up.  Takes a big sorry swig on that cocktail. 

                                 BARBARA
                        Travel problem? 

                                 RAY
                        Yup.  I'm a pediatric cardiologist.    
                        We're opening a clinic in Ethiopia.  
                        My team's over there waiting for me,     I 
                        was supposed to fly to Brussels  tonight 
                        and then onto Nairobi, but       my ticket 
                        got scrambled, so I got on     a flight in 
                        the morning, but now     they're telling 
                        me it's too late to     get ticketed now, 
                        so I'm gonna have     to spend the whole 
                        night in the      airport just to make 
                        sure I can get      on the plane. 

                                 BARBARA
                        All they have to do is print you out a new 
                        ticket? 
                           (he nods)
                        Honey, that's what I do for a living. 

           RAY smiles.  She smiles.  Ain't life grand...   

           INT.  A DARK OFFICE CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

           At first, just sounds.  GIGGLING...WHISPERING...two voices 
           getting closer and closer, until...  

           BARBARA AND RAY appear around the shadows of a corner.  They're 
           drunk, or damn close to it.  Stopping here, because -- 

           A SECURITY DOOR.  Blocking their way.   The B&R logo.  
                                                     #1  10/30/07   48.

                                 BARBARA
                        Shhh....
                           (a playful finger to his 
                            lips--)
                        Quiet.  We have to be quiet.

           RAY playing along.  BARBARA just loving this.  Finding her 
           glasses because there's A KEYBOARD SECURITY CONSOLE there by the 
           door.  

                                 BARBARA
                        No peeking...

           RAY covering his eyes.  BARBARA punching in the numbers and -- 

           THE DOOR opens.  And she takes his hand.  Leading him inside.  
           And the GIGGLING begins anew, as -- 

           THE CAMERA LINGERS TO FIND

           FETYOV in the shadows.  Catching the door just before it clicks 
           shut.  Waiting as the laughter and whispering drifts farther and 
           farther away...

           INT.  MIDTOWN SALAD BAR -- DAY

           Lunch.  Crowded.  CLAIRE in the throng, waiting for her turn  at 
           the vinaigrette, when...

                                 BAUER (OS)
                        You getting that to go? 

           She turns.  BAUER there with a bag.  On his way out. 

                                 BAUER
                        Didn't you just get paged? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don't know...
                           (checking in her bag)
                        Why?  I just stepped out. 

                                 BAUER
                           (quietly now)
                        You read my memo last month? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Which one?

                        Vulnerabilities at the travel office?

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I don't remember. 

                                 BAUER 
                           (backing away with a smile)
                        I'll see you upstairs...

           And he's gone.  CLAIRE hesitates.  What was that?  Forget the 
           salad, she's leaving it there on the rack and -- 

           EXT.  STREET OUTSIDE -- DAY (CONT)

           CLAIRE out the door, hustling back to the office.  Up the  
           crowded sidewalk.  Stopping at the corner.  Forced to.      She 
           just missed the light.  Standing there, waiting, as --  

           THE CAMERA FINDS

           RAY ACROSS THE STREET.  Waiting there on the other side.  
           Glancing at his watch.  And then the traffic.  And then... 

           He sees her.  It is, it's her.  Wanting to call over to her, to 
           wave, to do something -- but he can't. 

           Then, just as the light is about to change, she looks up. 

           There they are.   

           Both of them hesitating.  

           The crowd swarming past them.  No choice.  They have to walk.  
           They have to walk toward each other.  And pass each other.  And 
           never say a word.  

           And they do. 

           Heading off without turning back...

           INT.  "THE UNIT" TECH ROOM -- DAY

           A COMPUTER SCREEN FULL FRAME.  Data streaming past.  A blur. 
           ANOTHER SCREEN beside the first.  And ANOTHER...

           WIDER TO FIND

           PATEL juggling three computers.  DUKE, PAM, FETYOV, and DALE all 
           standing there waiting.  

                                 DUKE

                                 PATEL 
                        Why do you think it's taking so long? 
                        This is six years worth of travel orders.    

           DUKE rubbing his hands.  This is big.

                        Super job, Ray.  Outstanding. 

           RAY sitting away from the group.  He nods.  A bit subdued.  It's 
           a homerun, just not one you want to take bow for. 

           INT.  GUSTON'S OFFICE -- DAY

           A SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHS.  HANDS flipping through them.    Black 
           and white shots, and some of them a bit murky, but no question, 
           it's RAY and BARBARA in the midst of their midnight office 
           crawl.  

           Wait...HERE'S A GOOD ONE -- nice and clear.  RAY with a big ole

                        Who is this guy?

                                 BAUER
                        We're not sure.  

           GUSTON handing the picture to CLAIRE.  Surprise.  And it's 
           amazing how quickly an intelligence professional can transform 
           shock and anger into an expression that looks almost like 
           curious detachment.  

                                 GUSTON 
                           (an even better shot)
                        Jesus...

                                 BAUER
                        Is that where they're on the desk?

           CLAIRE like a stone as GUSTON passes this next one over --

                                 GUSTON 
                        Is he an Equikrom agent? 

                                 BAUER
                        If he is, he's new.  We don't have him 
                        logged.  We think they're running some 
                        fresh players out there.

           CLAIRE handed yet another photo...

                                 GUSTON 
                        Get this woman up here. 

                                 BAUER
                        I was thinking I should conduct the 
                        interview over there at the travel 
                        office.  Rattle their cage.  See if 
                        there's anybody else who migh--

                                 GUSTON 
                        No.  I want her up here.  And don't   tell 
                        her a damn thing.  

                                 BAUER
                        I just thought...

                                 GUSTON 
                        And Claire's doing the interview. 

           CLAIRE looks up from the photo -- 

                                 BAUER
                        But, Ned...I wrote the memo...

                                 GUSTON
                        I want her to talk to a woman.  

           BAUER nods, sulking.  CLAIRE silent and stoic.  Still holding 
           that picture of RAY and BARBARA doing God knows what, as -- 

           INT.  "THE UNIT"/LOFT AREA -- DAY

           PILES OF PAPER -- computer printouts -- thousands of them -- 
           spread out in some sort of system across a huge expanse of 
           floor.  PAM leading a parade of DUKE, RAY, PATEL and FETYOV 
           through the maze --

                           (walk and talk and fast)
                        -- we took every company B&R bought 
                        last year -- they made fifty-seven 
                        acquisitions -- we tossed out anything 
                                 (MORE)

                        where the product was known or on the 
                        market already -- then we broke it 
                        down smaller -- we started looking for 
                        deals that had gone down with the least 
                        amount of notice -- when we did that, 
                        we found  a day last March where B&R 
                        bought seven companies in one afternoon.  
                        We thought that looked very curious, 
                        so we took the travel office records 
                        and layered them  over the locations 
                        of these seven mysterious acquisitions...

                        bought over the phone because nobody 
                        from B&R New York ever even visited them.  
                        The fifth one rated a golf outing for 
                        several Assistant Vice-Presidents.  The 
                        sixth, was toured by a Regional VP and 
                        several accountants, but number seven...

                        You can't believe the amount of travel 
                        last summer between New York and

                        six separate visits -- none of which 
                        were reported in his official schedule.

           BARBARA BOFFERD just sobbing her eyes out --

                        ...it was the way...when he talked about 
                        the children...helping the little 
                        children...mending their broken hearts...

           It's a small, sterile room.  No windows.  Desk.  Two chairs.  
           CLAIRE sitting there like a wall, just sucking it up as --

                        ...I know...I do...how I should know 
                        better...and I'm not...really not a 
                        gullible person...but the children and 
                        their little hearts...who could do 
                        that?...what kind of person?... 
                           (focusing now)
                        Who could do something like that? 

           CLAIRE like a robot.  Pushing a box of tissues forward. 

                                 BARBARA
                        And yes, I felt special...
                           (igniting a new wave of sobs)
                        ...that I could help him...and help the 
                        children...and yes...yes, he was cute... 
                        ...I admit it...everything falling out of

                        Maybe for you it happens all the time.  
                        You've probably got someone making you 
                        feel that way all the time. 
                           (weepy defiance now)
                        You know what?  I don't even care.      Do 
                        whatever you're gonna do.  Because, you 
                        know what?  I loved it!  It was  worth it!  
                        It was so very worth it!     It was

           Nice room.  CLAIRE in the bedroom unpacking her suitcase as THE

                        Hello?

                        Hey.  It's me.  

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Hang on...

           CLAIRE primping fast before she opens the door to --

                           (suit and tie)
                        There you are...

           And she throws her arms around him.  Right at it.  Both of them 
           starving for each other.  Barely closing the door...

                           (finally)
                        You're so early.  I just got in... 

                                 RAY 
                        I ran.    

                                 CLAIRE 
                        It went okay? 

                                 RAY
                        Not a hitch.  God, you feel good...

                        I'll look at it later.

           He's pulling off his jacket and tie even as he works her toward 
           the bedroom.  She wants to cut loose, but -- 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I can't believe you got here so fast.

                                 RAY 
                        What? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        You told them.  

                                 RAY
                        Of course.   

                                 CLAIRE 
                        And you're okay with it? 

                                 RAY 
                        I am now...

                        How?  
                           (that stops him) 
                        How did you do it?  You just walked in and 
                        said, what? "I quit." 

                                 RAY

                        They must've tried to talk you out of it. 

                                 RAY 
                        Not really, no...

                                 CLAIRE 
                        They can't be happy to see you go.

                        What're you trying to tell me?

                        You didn't do it, did you?

                        No way they just let you walk out. 
                        You just punched out?  That was it?  

                                 RAY

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Answer the question. 

                                 RAY 
                        Did they ask you to stay?

                                 CLAIRE 
                        You're ducking the question.

                           (the light dawning)
                        They did, didn't they?  They asked 
                        you to stay... 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Oh, this is classic...

                                 RAY
                        You're unbelievable...

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Look, I know the drill, okay? 

                                 RAY

                        That's what you're doing!

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I asked you how it went and you evaded!  

                                 RAY 
                        How it went?
                           (wide open)
                        I just terminated a twelve year career 
                        with MI6.  I spent an hour signing      
                        non-disclosure forms, I had a quick 
                        outplacement polygraph, and then I 
                        turned in my credentials and walked out on 
                        the only job I've ever really had.  
                        And now, right now, I'm getting the 
                        very distinct impression that you've 
                        changed your mind and kept your job 
                        and left me out in the cold.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        They kind of begged me to stay.

                                 RAY
                        And you don't call to tell me that
                        this morning? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I couldn't risk it. 

                                 RAY
                        But you told them no. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I was completely surprised. 

           RAY sags.  Holy shit.  He quit, but she didn't.

                                 RAY
                        What am I supposed to do?  I can't
                        go back.  I'm cooked...     

                                 CLAIRE
                        I hope you kept your passports. 

                                 RAY 
                        What? 

           What's she doing?  She's unbuttoning her blouse...

                                 CLAIRE
                        I mean, I turned in a couple to make 
                        it look good, but...
                           (he's staring)
                        We're gonna need decent passports.
                           (and she's smiling--)

                                 RAY 
                        You bitch...

                                 CLAIRE
                        What?  
                           (backing away)
                        I was sure they wouldn't let you go.
                        And you got here so fast...

                                 RAY
                           (enjoying this now)
                        Right... 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I got spooked.  I wanted to be sure.
                        I was feeling needy...

                                 RAY
                        You want needy?  I'll show you needy.

           Now he's pushing her back onto the bed -- taking over --    and 
           she's eager for that, as --

                                 CLAIRE
                           (a final whisper)
                        Admit it, you don't trust me either...  

           He ignores that.  But then, a moment later...

                                 RAY
                        You did quit, didn't you? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Ask me later.

           WE COME OUT OF FLASHBACK INTO 

           EXT.  DUNWOODIE INDUSTRIAL PARK -- DAY

           That's what the sign says.  An anonymous bunch of corrugated 
           warehouses and office structures baking in the Georgia sun.   

           INT.  EMPTY WAREHOUSE -- DAY

           The place is stripped.  Nothing but the floors, walls, and heat.  
           RAY and FETYOV, pretending to be prospective tenants, sweating 
           through their suits as they follow --

                        -- the total footprint, that's if you were 
                        interested in both buildings, cause 
                        they're both available right now, it's 
                        about twenty-two thousand square feet...
                           (continuing, as--)

           RAY feigns great interest, covering for FETYOV who's searching 
           without success for clues. 

                                 REALTOR
                        ...the ventilation, it's zoned, and 
                        you've got separate filtration systems 
                        for the lab, office, storage and loading. 

                                 RAY 
                        Sure is clean.

                                 REALTOR
                        Yes, indeed.  Last tenants left the place 
                        in terrific shape.  It's just spotless.

           FETYOV focusing on one of the few things left behind -- a desk -- 
           giving the thing a full-body cavity search...  

                                 RAY 
                        What kind of business were they in? 

                                 REALTOR
                        Dermavale?  Damned if I know.  Some 
                        kind of biotech.  They took the place, 
                        loaded in their gear, and that's about the 
                        last we saw of them.  Hell, they 
                        used to truck out their own trash.

           RAY -- what's he doing? -- he's popping open the COLLAPSIBLE

                        load out, which was done at night... 

           FETYOV scanning for trouble as RAY keeps working -- 

                                 DUKE (V.O.) 
                        ...consider that B&R has yet to disclose 
                        any financial statement regarding the 
                        acquisition...

           RAY is done and now it's clear, the "umbrella" is a dish --   a 
           parabolic surveillance microphone.  They're up.   

                                 DUKE (V.O.)
                        ...add in the fact that Ronny Partiz has 
                        been living for the last six months in a 
                        ten-thousand dollar a day penthouse suite 
                        in the Atlantis Hotel in the Bahamas...

           INT.  ATLANTIS HOTEL CASINO -- NIGHT

           The high-roller Baccarat Table.  RONNY PARTIZ in the flesh.   A 
           scrawny, wasted twenty-five-year-old dude wearing a buckskin 
           jumpsuit, huge blue sunglasses and flip-flops.  He's got a huge 
           pile of chips and a fresh Rum & Coke.     
                                                     #1  10/30/07   63.

                                 DUKE (V.O.)
                        ...and for the Coup De Grace, toss in 
                        the fact that he's playing Baccarat 
                        whenever he's sober enough to get to 
                        the table to the tune of three hundred 
                        thousand a week...

                                 GARSIK (V.O.)
                        Well goddamit, Duke!  Let's quit waltzing  
                        around and get on this guy!

           THAT ENDS THE VOICEOVER -- live sound now -- CASINO SOUND.  

                                 BACCARAT DEALER
                           (waiting)
                        Sir...

                                 RONNY PARTIZ
                           (coming to)
                        Oh, yeah.  Card. 
                           (as it comes out)
                        Nice...

           ACROSS THE CASINO

           A LOUNGE BAR.  RAY finding an open seat next to FETYOV.  

                                 RAY 
                        Forget his room.  It's like Fort Knox   up 
                        there.  Take a major operation.    

                                 FETYOV
                        I told you. 

                                 RAY
                        So what do you want to do? 

           FETYOV shrugs, hailing the bartender, as --  

           INT.  ATLANTIS HOTEL HALLWAY -- NIGHT

           FREIGHT ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING -- TWO ROOM SERVICE CARTS 
           wheeling out.  TWO WAITERS -- black pants, white jackets all we 
           see at first -- pushing the carts.  And we've been here before, 
           this the same hallway we saw Ray with the Bellman.  TWO MAIDS, 
           working their way through the evening turndown service, moving 
           aside to let THE ROOM SERVICE CARTS pass and -- 

           A NEW ANGLE REVEALS  
                                                     #1  10/30/07   64.

           CLAIRE AND BAUER are the waiters.  Passing THE MAIDS with     a 
           smile.  Wheeling their carts down the hall and AROUND THE CORNER 
           AND... 

           Bang -- the moment they're clear -- it's a whole new game.  
           CLAIRE with a key, rushing to RAY'S DOOR.  BAUER with a key, 
           he's working FETYOV'S DOOR -- six seconds later, they're 
           wheeling the carts in and --  

           INT.  RAY'S ATLANTIS HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

           CLAIRE closing the door behind her.  Locking it.  And then   she 
           stops.  Standing there.  Breathing it in.  She's here.  His 
           room.  Her lover's room.  The guy she's turned her life around 
           for.  Her partner.  Her man.  The guy who screwed
           Barbara Bofferd.  

           INT.  FETYOV'S ATLANTIS HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

           BAUER has the undercarriage of that serving cart wide open     -- 
           pulling stuff out as fast as he can -- laying it out for display 
           across the bed.  Bad stuff.  A cheater's kit. 

           QUICK SHOTS: WRAPPED RACKS OF ATLANTIS CASINO DICE...PLASTIC 
           COVERED DECKS OF CASINO CARDS...NIGHT VISION GLASSES...SOME 
           WEIRD LOOKING MODIFIED CALCULATORS...EYEGLASSES WITH WIRES 
           coming out of them, and finally, A HANDGUN...

           BAUER -- the moment he's done -- knocking on the wall that 
           connects to Ray's room -- THREE HARD RAPS and...

           INT.  RAY'S ATLANTIS HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

           Same drill.  CLAIRE finishing an arrangement of equally  
           incriminating items across the bed.  Returning the signal -- 
           THREE HARD RAPS ON THE WALL.  So she's done, she's on her   way 
           out, when she stops...  One last impulse.  

           THE MINIBAR.  What's she doing?  She's pulling A BOTTLE OF 
           CHAMPAGNE.   Tossing it onto the bed.  A message.

           INT.  ATLANTIS HOTEL HALLWAY -- NIGHT

           One minute late.  CLAIRE AND BAUER heading out.  Wheeling  their 
           carts back the way they came.  

           And here come THE TURNDOWN MAIDS.  Just coming around the 
           corner.  Like a slow-burning fuse; a couple more rooms and 
           they're gonna get to Ray and Fetyov's.  
                                                     #1  10/30/07   65.

           INT.  ATLANTIS HOTEL CASINO -- NIGHT

           THE BACCARAT TABLE.  There's a NEW DEALER and NEW PLAYERS,  but 
           RONNY PARTIZ is just where we left him.  And the passing hours 
           have only deepened the glaze behind his sunglasses.  

           ACROSS THE CASINO

           THE LOUNGE BAR.  RAY and FETYOV just where we left them.   

                                 RAY 
                        We're wasting time, Boris.  You want
                        to sit here all night?  Look at him.  
                        He's paralyzed.  He couldn't leave if 
                        he wanted to.  Gimme the credit card.  Let 
                        me get in the game.   

                                 FETYOV
                        Is a five thousand dollar table. 

                                 RAY 
                        Okay, so I'll split what I win.  

                                 FETYOV
                        Forget it. 

           RAY grunts.  Looks away.  His eyes drifting over the casino 
           floor, when, suddenly -- 

           He freezes.  

           CLAIRE walking through the crowd.  She and BAUER heading for the 
           BACCARAT TABLE and -- 

           RAY stunned.  Stunned and trying to hide it.  What the fuck?  
           Trying to think quick, what's the play here? 

                                 FETYOV
                           (oblivious)
                        What we do, okay?  We watch like this 
                        tonight.  Tomorrow we find someone who 
                        works upstairs in those rooms.  Okay?

           But before RAY can answer, or look back for Claire -- 

                                 MR. SECURITY (OS)
                        How's it going fellas? 

           MR. HOTEL SECURITY.  A big, smooth, jarhead enforcer.

                                 RAY 
                        Great.  We're great.  Thanks. 
                                                     #1  10/30/07   66.

                                 MR. SECURITY
                        Glad to hear it. 
                           (nice and easy)
                        I'm hoping you can help me out here.  
                        I need to take a look at your room keys. 

           CUT TO  

           THE BACCARAT TABLE.  CLAIRE and BAUER waiting at the rope line 
           as A CASINO CAPTAIN whispers to RONNIE PARTIZ and --  

           CUT TO 

           RAY AND FETYOV just realizing there are actually SIX SECURITY 
           DUDES around them and -- 

                                 RAY 
                        This is interesting...

                                 MR. SECURITY 
                        We're just trying to double check on a 
                        couple rooms upstairs.  

                                 RAY 
                        And you ladies are from housekeeping, 
                        right?  

                                 MR. SECURITY 
                           (the smile is fading)
                        I need to see those keys.

           CUT TO 

           RONNY PARTIZ trying to pack up and leave the Baccarat table.  
           He's just so wasted.  THE CAPTAIN -- BAUER -- ANOTHER DEALER   -- 
           everyone pitching in, trying to help him gather his chips, his 
           drinks, his smokes and --  

           CLAIRE waiting by the rope line, turning suddenly, because --  

           ACROSS THE CASINO 

           A DISTURBANCE -- over before it started -- FETYOV facedown 
           against the bar -- TWO SECURITY DUDES on him like a vise -- MR. 
           SECURITY working a walkie-talkie -- GAMBLERS ALL OVER THE PLACE 
           turning and staring and --  

           RAY standing there with his hands up.  Staring hard across the 
           floor toward the Baccarat table and -- 

           THERE SHE IS STARING BACK
                                                     #1  10/30/07   67.

           RAY AND CLAIRE finding each other across the crowded room.  Eyes 
           locked.  And it's only a moment, but there are volumes  of 
           meaning and ambiguity exchanged here.  What are they now?  
           Conspirators?  Lovers?  Allies?  Enemies?  And what do they 
           feel?  Is it yearning?  Amusement?  Jealousy?  

           All that in one quick look.  

           AND THEN -- RAY -- like a shot -- swept away into a fast-
           exiting, flying wedge of SECURITY DUDES -- 

           CLAIRE turning back just in time to see RONNY PARTIZ -- out cold 
           on his feet -- falling toward her, as --   

           EXT.  THE NIGHT SKY

           THE BURKETT & RANDLE JET cruising North and -- 

           INT.  THE BURKETT & RANDLE JET -- NIGHT

           A huge, luxurious plane.  But only three passengers tonight.  
           RONNY PARTIZ, out cold, curled into a fetal position on a plush 
           leather banquette.  CLAIRE and BAUER watching him. 

                                 BAUER 
                        This is so heavy.  

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Who do you think he is? 

                                 BAUER 
                        It's got to be this thing...this new 
                        thing, right? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        You think?

                                 BAUER 
                        What else could it be? 

           That question hanging in the air, as we --

           INT.  MIAMI HOTEL BUNGALOW SUITE -- DAY

           Super Luxe.  Cottage-style.  Palms through the shutters.     RAY 
           pacing around.  Barefoot.  Jeans.  But hyped up.  He's been 
           waiting.  There's A BOTTLE OF UNOPENED CHAMPAGNE in ice, he's 
           checking it for the tenth time.  Checking his watch.    His 
           hair.  And then...  

           THE DOORBELL RINGS.  RAY fighting the urge to rush.  Slow down.  
           Take a deep breath.  Stay cool.   

                                 RAY
                           (opening up--)
                        Hey, I was getting worried...

           CLAIRE from the airport with a weekend bag.  They kiss, but  
           she's all about getting inside fast and closing the door -- 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I got off the plane, I thought for a 
                        minute I was being tailed.  

                                 RAY 
                        By who? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I don't know.  I was probably just   being 
                        paranoid. 

                                 RAY
                        That's crazy.  Nobody knows we're here.   

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I know.  But what was I gonna do?        I 
                        had to run it out.  
                           (tossing her shoes)
                        I've been driving in circles for two 
                        hours. 
                           (she finds him, kisses him, 
                            tenderly this time--)
                        I didn't know what else to do.  I was 
                        gonna call, and then I thought, my God, 
                        we've got everything on the line, I don't 
                        want to start off sloppy.

                                 RAY 
                        You cut your hair.

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Omigod, that was like three weeks ago.

                                 RAY 
                        I do.  I mean it.  It's great.  
                           (lingering)
                        You smell good too.  

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Please.  I smell like a rental car. 
                           (pulling away, into the     room 
                            now--)
                        Wow, this is amazing...

                                 RAY 
                        I upgraded. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                           (really seeing it now)
                        This is more than an upgrade...

                                 RAY 
                        We're celebrating.  I've got some good 
                        news.  
                           (she turns back)
                        Actually, it's more than good news.
                           (he's so excited)
                        I nailed it. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Nailed what?  

                                 RAY 
                        We're in!  
                           (here it comes)
                        I've got it.  The answer.  The key.    The 
                        master plan.  I nailed it.  

                                 CLAIRE 
                        You're kidding.  

                                 RAY 
                        Sit down...  
                           (steering her))
                        Just -- come here -- just sit down -- 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Okay. 

           He's too amped to notice she's a little hesitant; too busy 
           trying to open the Champagne to pick up on her anxiety. 

                                 RAY 
                        How much money you think was spent 
                        on frozen pizza last year?

                                 CLAIRE 
                        What? 

                                 RAY 
                        Frozen pizza.  How big is the market? 
                           (he can't wait for her         to 
                            answer--) 
                        One billion dollars.  Billion.      That's 
                        just pizza.  I'm not counting enchiladas, 
                        blintzes, macaroni and cheese.  Just the 
                        pizza.    
                           (pop, and he's pouring--)
                        Master plan, right?  Objective one?  
                        Huge market.  Got it.  Objective two?  
                        Conflict, right?  Find a market where
                        the competitors hate each other so 
                        much they'd do anything to win.  
                        We get involved, we lead the charge, 
                        and when the price is right, we ditch.  
                        All we gotta do is find an angle.  
                        Maybe we flip sides.  Maybe we shop 
                        the intel.  We buy stock -- we sell 
                        it -- there's a hundred ways to go!
                           (headline news) 
                        Frozen Pizza.  
                           (he's so pumped)
                        We are -- right now -- today -- poised  at 
                        the brink of a pizza war.  A war for every 
                        freezer in every supermarket in America.  
                        There's a company called Foodgem, okay?  
                        Two months ago, the CEO, Mr. Foodgem, is 
                        watching TV with his granddaughter.  
                        There's an ad on the morning cartoons for 
                        something called Double-Crust Pizza.  Now 
                        this guy's been working on Double-Crust 
                        Pizza for six years.  He's got fifty 
                        million dollars invested.  It's a major 
                        new product for him.  Trouble is, he 
                        hasn't rolled it 
                        out yet.  The ad he's watching is for 
                        Pantry-Pride Double-Crust!  
                           (incredible, right?)
                        They stole his concept, his formula, 
                        the packaging and the ad campaign.  
                        So Mr. Foodgem is out for blood.  
                        They're taking off the gloves and 
                        breaking out the checkbook.  And here's 
                        the best part...
                           (all smiles)
                        Guess who they like for Director of 
                        Intel Operations?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I took a job yesterday. 

                                 RAY
                        What? 

           She just couldn't hold it in anymore.  

                                 CLAIRE 
                        That's why I was so paranoid.

                                 RAY
                        What do you mean you took a job? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        It's not like I could call and tell you. 

                                 RAY
                        I don't believe this...
                           (total incredulity)
                        What happened to doing this together?

                                 CLAIRE 
                        It was too good to pass up. 

                                 RAY 
                        We had a plan!  We agreed!  We go over 
                        everything!  We go over it -- we do it 
                        together...
                           (the injustice)
                        What happened to veto power?   

                                 CLAIRE
                        Ray, please...

                                 RAY
                        Can you get out of it?  Of course you can.  
                        You haven't even started yet. 
                           (there's hope)
                        Claire, look, I know we said we were  
                        gonna go out and get two jobs and see 
                        which one came up best, but now, with 
                        this, the pizza, we can push up the 
                        timetable.  It's perfect!  And we can 
                        be together!  I'll take the job -- you 
                        start working up the exit strategy -- 
                        build up our ID -- set up the banks -- off-
                        shore trading accounts -- whatever 
                        we need, you get it up and running.  
                        Then I'll bring you in, see?  I'm gonna 
                        need to staff up.  You'll apply -- 
                        we'll meet -- we'll like each other, 
                        hate each other -- whatever works best 
                                 (MORE)

                        Actually it's two jobs.  Equikrom wants to 
                        hire me under the table and then get me a 
                        job on the Counterintelligence desk for 
                        Burkett & Randle.

                           (silence)
                        You said they offered you the job.

                                 RAY
                        Of course they did.  They love me. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        You took it on the spot. 

                                 RAY
                        What?  Like you?

                        Nothing was formalized.

                        I know, but...

           But shit, what can he say?  What can she say?  Nothing.      So 
           he sits.  And there's this silence, this deflated sag.    The 
           two of them perched like bookends. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I could turn it down.

                        Oh yeah, that makes sense.

                                 RAY 
                        I think so.  

           Her hand reaches across the gap.  Finding his.  Taking it.  And 
           so they're holding hands.  Just that.  As the reality    of what 
           they're getting into begins to fill the room...

           quietly buzz around, when THE BIG DOOR OPENS and...

           BAUER comes walking out.  A little off-balance.  Like he's shaky

                                 ASSISTANT #1
                        Ms. Stenwick...

           INT. HOWARD TULLY'S OFFICE -- DAY

           CLAIRE in the one chair that faces his desk.  

                                 TULLY 
                        Someone made fire.  Someone was first.  
                        Not the idiot who found a burning stick 
                        and kept it going, I'm talking about the 
                        fella who could make fire.  And until that 
                        knowledge was stolen, that fella was the 
                        most powerful person on the planet.  And 
                        that means something.  To be first. To be 
                        most.  It means a great deal.      It 
                        means you have the opportunity to 
                        reproduce with the highest frequency and 
                        most desirable partners.  It means your 
                        offspring will have the greatest chance 
                        of survival and a better opportunity to 
                        make their own fire.  I personally believe 
                        human evolution has run its course.  We 
                        live in a world where people who can make 
                        fire have a tendency to wear condoms and 
                        sit in casinos and drink themselves into a 
                        stupor.  I believe individual evolution 
                        has been replaced by  something else, a 
                        shared evolution, a communal contest if 
                        you will.  I believe, Ms. Stenwick, in 
                        Corporate Evolution.      I believe that 
                        the corporation that is first -- that is 
                        most -- has the opportunity to 
                        manufacture with the highest frequency 
                        and in the most desirable markets.  And 
                        that its future shareholders will, by

                        I don't imagine you are quite aware of the 
                        service you and Mr. Bauer provided this

                        We were just doing our job, sir.

                        Mr. Partiz may appear a fool.  He is 
                        anything but.  He has given Burkett & 
                        Randle a gift that will change our

                        So the question, Ms. Stenwick, is 
                        whether or not you can continue to do

                        the kind of job we so desperately need you 
                        to do without knowing the stakes 
                        involved?  Can you really do your job 
                        without knowing what it is you're 
                        protecting? 
                           (pause)
                        What I need to know is, can I share my 
                        fire with you?

           INT.  JFK AIRPORT ARRIVALS TERMINAL -- DAY

           FETYOV descending an escalator.  He's sporting a fresh black eye 
           and the same stale tropical shirt he was wearing when last we 
           saw him in the Paradise Casino.  

           THE CAMERA MOVES ABOVE TO FIND

           RAY wheeling his carry-on, waiting his turn to get onto the 
           escalator.  He too looks a bit ragged and worse for wear.  

           DOWN BELOW

           THE BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA.  Crowded with TRAVELERS and SKYCAPS and 
           DRIVERS looking for their passengers and --  

           TURTLENECK (Remember him from the opening scene?) and his 
           partner MOUSTACHE.  These guys are over by the baggage carousel 
           pretending to be waiting for their luggage and --   

           PATEL pretending to be a limo driver.  He's in a black suit, 
           standing with a group of other drivers near the escalator. He's 
           holding a sign for: MR. DEEGLE, and -- 

           FETYOV ignoring him, heading out for the taxi stand and --  

           MOUSTACHE breaking away to give chase and -- 

           RAY coming DOWN THE ESCALATOR -- so casual and distracted  that 
           we're sure he must be missing all this -- until, the moment he 
           steps off -- bam, just like that, he's pulling a    U-turn -- 
           jumping right back onto THE UP ESCALATOR and -- 

           TURTLENECK -- he's pissed -- pushing his way through the  crowd 
           to get to the escalator and -- 

           RAY back on THE MEZZANINE -- moving fast, but a different 
           direction and -- 

           TURTLENECK jogging up the escalator and --

           It's a madhouse -- cars piled  at the curb -- HORNS HONKING    -- 
           RAY out of the building, jogging past HASSLED COPS and SKYCAPS 
           and SCREAMING CHILDREN and --

           CUT TO 

           TURTLENECK just coming out of the building -- stalled for a 
           moment -- eyes scanning -- where? -- where? -- there -- now he's 
           jogging and -- 

           CUT TO 

           RAY -- suddenly -- bolting out into THE STREET -- into the  THE 
           ONCOMING TRAFFIC -- weaving between the vehicles --rolling his 
           bag down the ramp and -- 

           HERE COMES A VAN -- "DEEGLE & SONS HARDWARE" painted on the 
           side.  The passenger door opening as RAY passes -- suddenly, 
           he's just gone -- and THE VAN, the door is shut and it's 
           speeding up now and --  

           CUT TO 

           TURTLENECK forty yards back -- baffled -- jumping back as     a 
           TAXI HORN BLARES behind him and -- 

           INT.  THE MOVING "DEEGLE" VAN -- DAY

           PAM at the wheel.  DALE was the guy at the door.  RAY catching 
           his breath as they speed away from the airport. 

                                 RAY
                        Where to? 

                                 DALE
                        Debrief.  Duke wants to talk. 

           RAY nods.  He's playing it cool, but that sounded ominous.    

           EXT.  SHEA STADIUM PARKING LOT -- DAY

           Empty.  THE DEEGLE VAN, is pulling away, leaving behind a   BIG 
           BLACK SUV. 

           INT.  BIG BLACK SUV -- DAY

           RAY in the back seat.  DUKE at the wheel.  DALE beside him, 
           opening a LAPTOP COMPUTER.

                                 DUKE
                        You're gonna set a meet with her.    

                                 RAY
                        Okay. 

                                 DUKE
                        And you're gonna bring Garsik. 

                                 RAY
                        To the meet?  

                                 DUKE
                        He wants direct contact.  

                                 RAY
                        That's a terrible idea.  

                                 DUKE
                        It's his dime. 

                                 RAY
                        Yeah, well she's my agent.  I told you 
                        when I came on board; once she's mine,   I 
                        run her my way. 

                                 DUKE 
                        Yeah, well, the question's been raised, 
                        Ray, is it just her you're running? 

           Pressure drop.  DUKE staring at him.  DALE too.  

                                 RAY
                        You'd better explain that to me. 

           DUKE motions for DALE activate the laptop.  Suddenly the car's 
           audio system fills with THE RAW BACKGROUND NOISE OF THE SAKS 
           COSMETIC DEPARTMENT COUNTER and the familiar sounds of --

                        ever saw, by the way."   

           RAY like a stone.  Watching DUKE stop the clip.  

                                 RAY 
                        Well, I'll give her this, she is one cold, 
                        nasty piece of work.  When did   she send 
                        it to you? 

                                 DUKE 
                        She didn't tape it.  You did.  We had    a 
                        bug in your phone.  We had the whole thing 
                        wired.  We had to.  New guy on the team?  
                        This late in the game...  

           RAY nods.  Pretending he's surprised.  Pretending he's been 
           caught and gonna take it like man.  And they're buying it. 

                                 RAY
                        What can I tell you?  You heard the tape.  
                        This bitch put me through the ringer. 
                           (sorry, but--)
                        Look, if I'd known it was her I never 
                        would've taken the job. 

                                 DUKE 
                        You didn't tell us the truth. 

                                 RAY
                        You firing me, Duke? 
                           (cold silence)
                        Why didn't you do it then?  Why not   fire 
                        me that day?  Why keep me around? 

                                 DUKE 
                        Why?
                           (a big smile blossoming)

                        Hell, we thought we were losing her!
                        We thought we'd left her out there 
                        too long and she was off the rails.  
                        That's why we brought you in.

                        The way she tries to blow you off in   the 
                        beginning? 

           RAY nods.  Like he's still off-balance.  

                                 RAY
                        So you were kidding about the meet

                                 DUKE 
                        No.  No, that's for real.  But don't worry 
                        about her.  Obviously, she 
                        doesn't need to know that we know 
                        what's going on here.  You just keep 
                        playing it straight. 

                                 RAY 
                        Absolutely.

                        I try, but...  Faces, I'm definitely 
                        better.  Faces, I'd say I'm like a B,    B-

                        Gotta admit, it's pretty amusing.  

           RAY smiles.  Yup.  It's a wacky world.

           EXT.  CENTRAL PARK WEST BUS STOP -- DAY

           One hour later.  Here comes RAY.  Just a guy out for a walk.  A 
           guy with a stone in his shoe.  Stopping there.  Having a seat.  
           Pulling off his shoe.  Shaking it out, as --

           INT.  PORT AUTHORITY BOWLING LANES -- NIGHT

           A quiet night.  GARSIK and RAY way down in LANE #15, lacing  up 
           their rental shoes.  GARSIK in "disguise" -- ripped jeans, 
           lumberjack shirt, knit cap, etc.   
                                                     #1  10/30/07   81.

                                 GARSIK
                        Never liked this game.  Any sport puts 
                        limit on your score's a waste of time.  
                        Three hundred?  That's it?  Bust your 
                        nut just to do something nine million 
                        other jokers might do?  Stupidest 
                        damn thing I ever heard of. 

                                 RAY
                           (nice and easy)
                        So, look, don't turn around.  But she just 
                        came in.

           CUT TO 

           THE BALL RACK.  CLAIRE in a kerchief and coat. Choosing a ball.  
           As if it were exactly what she came here to do and --    

           CUT TO 

           LANE #15.  GARSIK more hyped by the minute.  Loving this. 

                                 GARSIK
                        We're cool though, right?  She sees us? 

                                 RAY 
                        Oh, yeah. 

                                 GARSIK
                        I look natural, right? 

                                 RAY 
                        Super natural. 

           No chance for GARSIK to think about that, because -- 

                                 CLAIRE (OS)
                        Who picked this place? 

           There she is.  Dropping her ball.  Taking a seat. 

                                 RAY 
                        You have a problem? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        It's a little bright. 

                                 RAY 
                           (re: Garsik)
                        This gentleman, here is--

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I know who he is. 
                                                     #1  10/30/07   82.

                                 GARSIK 
                        You do? 
                           (a bit hurt)
                        Even with the hat and...

                                 RAY 
                        She's a trained professional. 

           GARSIK smiles.  Instantly flirting with CLAIRE. 

                                 GARSIK
                        Would you...we've got sodas...you want 
                        something? 

                                 RAY 
                        She's fine. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I'm starving. 

                                 GARSIK 
                        Well, hell, then...

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I'd love some pizza.  They have pizza? 

                                 GARSIK
                           (looking around)
                        I'll just bet they do...

           RAY shooting her a "what-the-fuck-are-you-doing?" look. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Even frozen pizza, or...

                                 RAY 
                        I don't think so. 

                                 GARSIK
                           (to Ray)
                        Why don't you go take a look see?

                                 RAY 
                        You'd smell it, if they did. 

                                 GARSIK
                           (like a hammer)
                        I don't give a damn if you've gotta go
                        to Sicily, get the lady some pizza. 

           RAY hesitates.  Sucks it up. 
                                                     #1  10/30/07   83.

                                 RAY 
                        Any particular topping you'd like? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Surprise me. 

           RAY nods.  Teeth grinding as he backs away and -- 

                                 GARSIK 
                           (now they're alone)
                        I want you to know, Ms. Stenwick, the
                        job you're doing for us, it's just, 
                        it's positively heroic. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Thank you. 

                                 GARSIK 
                        You met Dr. Partiz?  

                                 CLAIRE
                        We flew him back to New York last night. 

                                 GARSIK 
                        You spoke to him? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I know what the project is. 

                                 GARSIK
                        You what?  You know?  

           CUT TO 

           THE BOWLING ALLEY DINETTE.   RAY standing there waiting for THE 
           COUNTER SLOTH to check his freezer --  

                                 COUNTER SLOTH
                        ...mushroom...mushroom and onion... 
                        plain...mushroom...pepperoni...

                                 RAY 
                        Plain. 

           COUNTER SLOTH moving the box to the microwave.

                                 COUNTER SLOTH
                        You like it hot, or...?

                                 RAY 
                        Hot.  Very hot.  Extremely hot.  

           RAY glancing back and -- 
                                                     #1  10/30/07   84.

           HIS POV

           CLAIRE is standing -- standing like she's saying goodbye.    And 
           GARSIK is just sitting there -- sitting there like he can't get 
           up and -- 

                                 COUNTER SLOTH 
                        You want something to drink? 

                                 RAY
                           (turning, distracted)
                        What? 

                                 COUNTER SLOTH
                        A cold beverage? 

                                 RAY 
                        Yeah, sure...whatever...Coke... 
                           (looking back and--)

           CUT TO 

           CLAIRE is walking out -- she's leaving! -- and fast --   

           CUT TO 

           GARSIK looks positively stricken by whatever Claire's just  told 
           him -- trying to stand -- bracing himself --   

                                 RAY 
                           (rushing over)
                        What's going on?  What just happened? 

                                 GARSIK
                        ...you...get Duke...you get Duke...
                        tell him he needs a secure line...he's 
                        gotta call me on the plane...   

                                 RAY 
                        What did she say?

                                 GARSIK
                        Secure line, you hear me?
                           (wildly)
                        Only if he's sure!  I gotta get on the 
                        goddam plane and he's gotta call me!    
                        But it's gotta be goddam safe!

           RAY standing there.  Baffled.  Watching GARSIK rush off.
                                                     #1  10/30/07   85.

                                 RAY 
                        Sir?  Dick?
                           (Garsik glances back)
                        The shoes...

           Forget it.  GARSIK, drunk with catastrophe, waving him away  as 
           he stumbles for the exit.  RAY pulling his phone.  Speed dialing 
           and -- 

                                 RAY 
                           (the moment it's answered)
                        It's me.   I need Duke.  Now. 
                           (beat)
                        Yeah, well, tell him to hurry up. 

           So he's on hold.  Tearing off the rental shoes.  And then he 
           stops.  Stops because -- 

           THERE

           ON THE SEAT IN FRONT OF HIM -- A CHAMPAGNE CORK -- right  where 
           she was sitting.  Meant for him to see.  A signal.  

           DISSOLVE TO

           EXT.  OHIO APARTMENT COMPLEX -- NIGHT

           Night traffic on the expressway in the distance.  The lights of 
           the mini-mall across the street...     

                          CLEVELAND -- THREE MONTHS EARLIER  

           A FORD TAURUS pulls into the parking lot.  RAY emerges with    a 
           bag of take-out in one hand and his briefcase in the other.  A 
           weary gladiator home from the pizza wars. 

           INT.  APARTMENT COMPLEX LOBBY -- NIGHT

           Stark and fluorescent.  RAY enters.  Opening THE MAILBOX.  
           Reaching in without looking and then, he stops because -- 

           THERE

           IN HIS HAND -- A CHAMPAGNE CORK. 

           INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

           RAY sprinting up the stairs.

           INT.  RAY'S CLEVELAND APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           RAY rushing in.  Lights on to reveal an utterly temporary,  two 
           bedroom cardboard cave.  And...

                                 CLAIRE
                        I was starting to lose faith. 

           There she is.  Sipping Champagne.  Looking great. 

                                 RAY 
                        Why didn't you call me?  I could've   been 
                        home hours ago.

           Her answer, a long, hungry kiss.  Until...

                                 RAY 
                           (coming up for air)
                        Where's your bag?   

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I'm on the red-eye. 

                                 RAY 
                        No...

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I'm supposed to be in Houston.  I had  
                        to blow the connection.  It's the only
                        way I could steal a couple hours. 

                                 RAY 
                        You should've paged me.  I've been sitting 
                        in my office doing field 
                        reports for crissake... 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I couldn't risk it.  

                                 RAY
                        From a payphone?  

                                 CLAIRE
                        From anywhere.  

                                 RAY
                        Why?  What the hell's going on?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Nigel Bingham.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You were together in Athens. 

                                 RAY
                        He was my Station Chief.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        You on good terms? 

                                 RAY
                        Great, but why? 

           She's found a juice jar, pouring him some Champagne.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        Equikrom, the Special unit, they're 
                        hiring.  Duke needs a field officer 
                        and I figured out how to get you in. 

                                 RAY
                           (reset)
                        Whoa...  Slow down.   

                                 CLAIRE
                        It's happening, Ray.  It's war.  

                                 RAY
                        What do you mean war?

                        Big like top-secret, new product big.  
                        Big like you can feel it amping up 
                        by the day.  We've had four top-down      
                        tech sweeps in the past two weeks.  
                        Three days ago we started auditing 
                        passwords hourly.  This morning I 
                        got a message from Duke, he wants me 
                        to go active.  I'm gonna get word to 
                        him tomorrow that unless he gets me
                        a great field officer to work with, 
                        he might as well forget it.

                        These weasels at Dairy-Fair stole the

           A heavy beat.  And then...

           EXT.  WEST VILLAGE -- NIGHT

           Ten minutes after the Bowling Alley.  A TAXI speeds to the curb.  
           RAY jumping out.  Sprinting across the street and -- 

           EXT.  DARKER VILLAGE STREET -- NIGHT

           RAY hustling past brownstones and little shops.  Changing 
           direction suddenly -- disappearing around a corner and --

           EXT.  DARKEST VILLAGE STREET -- NIGHT

           RAY coming fast -- scanning -- careful.  And then, suddenly  he 
           stops at A BROWNSTONE.  He's got keys.  Working fast.      AN 
           IRON GATE beside the stoop leads to A BASEMENT DOOR -- 

           INT.  "THE SAFE HOUSE" -- NIGHT (CONT)

           Just an empty, basement studio apartment.  Nothing here but a 
           futon, folding table, two chairs and -- 

           THE REFRIGERATOR.  RAY rushing it open.  Nothing inside but a 
           bottle of Champagne.  Pushing that aside.  HIS HANDS rushing to 
           work loose the plastic door housing, snapping it off to find A 
           PLASTIC POUCH that's been stashed in here.

           THE PLASTIC POUCH tossed onto THE TABLE.  

           RAY pulling A CANADIAN PASSPORT from his pocket.

           TEARING OPEN THE POUCH -- working as fast as he can without 
           destroying the thing  -- just about to put that Canadian 
           passport in there, when --

           HE STOPS.  Because something's wrong.  Very wrong.  There's  
           something missing from the pouch.  He's dumping the contents out 
           over the table.  It's PASSPORTS and STACKS OF CASH in a whole 
           variety of  currencies, but something's missing, something 
           important... 

           RAY standing there.  Looking like a loser.  Like he knows he 
           just got burned and there's nothing he can do about it. 

                                 RAY
                        You double crossing bitch...

           EXT.  DARKEST VILLAGE STREET -- NIGHT

           CLAIRE walking alone.  Following the same route we saw Ray take.  
           Eyes scanning.  Pulling her key and then --

                                 RAY
                        Walk.

           RAY taking her arm, and she doesn't need to be told again.  Both 
           of them instantly, instinctively, snapping into mission mode.  
           And no matter how intense this conversation may get, they will 
           both attempt to stay quiet, aware, and in motion --

                        the travel money. 

                                 CLAIRE

                        I can't believe you screwed her!

                                 RAY
                        It was an assignment!  It was nothing.

                        You should see the pictures.

                        No... 
                           (that cuts it)
                        You're the last person I need to explain 
                        this to.  The only difference between this 
                        and our first date is that nobody was 
                        drugged into a coma and left for dead! 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Left for dead?  You were asleep in bed 
                        with a smile on your face.

                                 RAY
                        Yeah, for eighteen bloody hours!

                           (she's walking now--)
                        There it is --

                                 CLAIRE 
                        -- you can't get past Dubai, you say    
                        you can, but you can't --

                        -- what is the product? --   

                                 CLAIRE
                        -- and you know what?  I came back 
                        that night.  I took the pouch out, my 
                        passports, my money.  And I stood there 
                        and I thought, "Wait a minute.  Maybe this 
                        is good thing.  Maybe it's payback.  Maybe 
                        now we're even.  Maybe this is 
                        how we get past Dubai.  Maybe it's 
                        better this way."  So now I'm loading 
                        it all back, I'm putting everything away 
                        like it never happened, and then I realize 
                        there's something missing... "Where's 
                        Ray's Canadian passport?" --

                           (stop)
                        Yes, I took the Canadian passport.     One 
                        passport.  Why?  Because I was paranoid!  
                        All the probing and testing  and not

                        trusting me -- it gets to you.  
                        I thought what's harm in having one little 
                        parachute in case the plane 
                        goes down.  I wanted a hole card.  
                        That's it.  That's all it was.  And 
                        the travel lady?  Did I have to go 
                        that far?  Maybe not.  But it worked.  And 
                        you know what?  That's my cover.  That's 
                        always been my cover.   I'm a mess.  I'm a 
                        horndog.  I'm a slob.  
                        That's my rep.  That's my edge.  
                        I mean, we're here trying to run a 
                        triple game on some very smart, very 
                        motivated players.  What do you want 
                        me to do, play with one hand behind 
                        my back?

                        It wasn't your hand I was talking about.

                           (too hot)
                        You know what?  Get over it.

                        Same split.  New rules.  You keep your 
                        parachute, I'll keep mine.  Once we 
                        score and split all bets are off.  

                                 RAY

                        thing I'm gonna do is let some stupid,

                           (hard and sincere)
                        We came too far to stop now.  It's just 
                        different, that's all.  Once we score

                        Just try to keep your pants on till we get 
                        there. 

           RAY stuck.  Standing there, watching her disappear. 

           INT.  B&R BUILDING -- 38TH FLOOR -- NIGHT

           A vast expanse of cubicles and work stations.  It's midnight so 
           it's dark and vacant.  CLAIRE and GUSTON in conference with TWO 
           PHYSICAL SECURITY (PHYSEC) OFFICERS -- 

                                 PHYSEC #1 
                        ...we had a motion detector go off on 
                        Forty-One.  We figured it was just a 
                        malfunction till we got upstairs.  
                        The whole security cage was wide open.  It 
                        took a little while, but we found him down 
                        here hiding under the desk... 
                           (continuing as THE CAMERA  FINDS-
                            -)

           JEFF BAUER visible through A GLASS PARTITION.  Handcuffed    to 
           A LARGE STEEL-FRAMED WORKSTATION.  Pinned tight.  Shirt torn.  
           Covered in sweat.  A bruise ripening under one eye. Struggling 
           to figure out what's going on behind him --

                                 PHYSEC #1
                        ...We get to running his ID, he starts 
                        trying to tell us the whole thing was some 
                        kind of test.  We said, "Hey, 
                        that's great, but we still gotta call your 
                        boss."  That's when he started sweating.
                           (to his partner)
                        Where's the thing? 

           GUSTON watching his career flash before his eyes.  

                                 PHYSEC #2
                        Oh yeah...he had this...
                           (an envelope--)
                        "Par-ti-zone-all, Six Point One?" 

                                 GUSTON 
                        Let's just put that down...  
                           (the envelope)
                        Right where you picked it up. 
                           (struggling for calm)
                        Anybody else touch that? 

                                 PHYSEC #1
                        No, sir.  Just us.  And the suspect.  
                                                    #1  10/30/07   100.

                                 GUSTON 
                        Suspect?  That's no suspect...
                           (calling into Bauer)
                        YOU'RE NOT A NOT A SUSPECT, ARE YOU, JEFF?  
                        YOU'RE A BACKSTABBING LITTLE WEASEL!  
                        YOU'RE GONNA BURN, ASSHOLE!

                                 BAUER
                           (muffled through the glass)
                        I want a lawyer!   

                                 GUSTON 
                        FORGET THE LAWYER, WEASEL!  WHAT YOU
                        NEED IS A NET, CAUSE I'M THROWING YOUR 
                        BACKSTABBING ASS OUT THE WINDOW!

           THE TWO PHYSEC OFFICERS a little startled by all this -- 

                                 CLAIRE
                           (jumping in)
                        Is the area upstairs locked down now? 

                                 PHYSEC #2
                        It's got to be cleared out before we 
                        can re-arm the system. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        How long does that take? 

                                 PHYSEC #1
                        All three floors?  Twenty minutes...

                                 GUSTON
                        Go.  Go now.  Do it.  Do it now. 

                                 PHYSEC #2
                           (re: Bauer)
                        What about him? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        He'll be fine. 

                                 PHYSEC #1
                        Okay.  Back here.  Twenty minutes.

           GUSTON nods.  THE PHYSEC OFFICERS head off.  BAUER, the way he's 
           shackled, can see them pass -- 

                                 BAUER
                        HEY!  WHERE YOU GOING?  HEY, COME BACK!
                        YOU HEAR ME?  HEY, DON'T LEAVE ME WITH 
                        HIM!  HEY!!!  YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID!  
                                                    #1  10/30/07   101.

           So they're alone now.  CLAIRE watching GUSTON pace -- 

                                 GUSTON 
                        Okay...
                           (on the fly)
                        You stay here with Jeff.  I'll run 
                        downstairs and toss his office. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        You don't think we should call it in? 

                                 GUSTON 
                        No!  
                           (anything but that)
                        The only chance we have to save the 
                        department is to get out in front of   
                        this -- we gotta take the lead before 
                        anybody else gets involved. 

                                 CLAIRE
                           (the envelope)
                        What about that?

                                 GUSTON
                        Don't -- don't move it -- don't touch 
                        it -- just...just leave it. 
                           (sensing she's unsure)
                        Relax.  We're gonna call it in, okay? 
                        Let's just figure out what we're into. 
                           (backing away)
                        Just...just hold the fort.

                        No.     
                           (she is upset)
                        I'm burned.  You burned me. 
                           (pointing at Ray)
                        You let him burn me.

           RAY like he's been slapped.  J'accuse...

                                 DUKE 
                        What do you mean?  We got it.

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I left a trail back there a mile wide.  
                        I'm lucky I got out of the building!     I 
                        can't go back to work -- I can't go back 
                        home -- I'm totally burned!

                                 RAY
                        Wait a minute...

                                 CLAIRE 
                        DON'T YOU DARE!

                                 DUKE
                           (waving Ray off)
                        What do you need, Claire? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        What do I need?  How about a new identity?  
                        How about Kevlar bodysuit! 

                                 RAY
                        Duke...

                                 DUKE 
                        Stow it, Ray!

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I'm going underground.  I'll tell you 
                        where to send my pay and my bonus.  
                        And it better be more than I expected, 
                        because this was a nightmare. 

                                 RAY 
                        What is your problem? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        A copy machine?
                           (back to Duke)
                        He had me running all over the goddam 
                        building looking for a copy machine!

                                 RAY
                        It worked, didn't it? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Why didn't I just fax it? 

                                 RAY 
                        Why, because...tell her...
                           (appealing to Duke)
                        We had these machines in place.
                           (to the room)
                        Who the hell faxes anything anymore?

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I'm running back upstairs wondering how 
                        long it's gonna be before someone tosses 
                        me out the window, thinking, "What the 
                        hell has this guy got me doing?" 
                           (undone)
                        There were fifty easier ways to do this!  

                                 RAY 
                        Did it work or not? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        For who?  For you?
                           (to the room)
                        Was anybody with him when he got the 
                        formula?  Has he ever been alone with 
                        it?  Could he possibly have made a    copy 
                        of it? 

                                 RAY 
                        What?
                           (truly shocked)
                        What the hell're you doing?

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I guess that's a no. 

           But the smell is out.  PAM and PATEL trading a look, as -- 

                                 RAY 
                        You're sick.  She's sick.  I'd hate 
                        to hear what she had to say if it 
                        didn't work. 

                                 CLAIRE
                           (straight to Duke)
                        Look, I know this guy.  I should've 
                        told you before, but I couldn't because he 
                        was threatening the whole project. 
                                                    #1  10/30/07   114.

                                 RAY 
                        He knows!  He knows the whole thing!

           This was interesting enough already, but at this point, the rest 
           of the team is completely transfixed -- 

                                 DUKE 
                        He's right, Claire.  I do.
                           (trying to be delicate)
                        I mean, I know you met before and... 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Did he tell you he was on a CIA 
                        Observation Watch List?      

                                 RAY 
                        That is total bullshit! 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        How'd he get on this project anyway? 
                        We're doing this for a year and a half,    
                        how does he show up three weeks before   
                        the payday?  

                                 RAY 
                        I just brought this home!

                                 DUKE 
                           (curiosity piqued)
                        What kind of Watch List? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                           (backing away)
                        You know what?  No.  I'm done here.  

                                 DUKE 
                        Claire, wait...

                                 CLAIRE 
                        You got what you wanted, Duke.  
                           (her parting salvo)
                        You just better make sure you're the  only 
                        one who got what you wanted. 

           And she's gone.  And there is a long, nasty silence.  

                                 DUKE 
                           (finally)
                        Pam?

                                 PAM 
                        We weren't in the room with him.

                                 RAY 
                        What?  I was right there!  

                                 PATEL 
                           (Duke is staring at him)
                        It's possible...  

                                 RAY 
                        This is insane!  You bring me in to  
                        land the big fish and I deliver and 
                        this is the thanks I get?  This is
                        the victory lap?
                           (turning suddenly--)
                        What are you doing? 
                           (DALE hoisting Ray's    
                            overnight bag--)
                        You're gonna search me?  

                                 DUKE 
                        Takes five minutes. 

                                 RAY 
                        Because of her?  Because of that?  

                                 DUKE 
                        Does it matter? 

                                 DALE
                        Duke...

           Everyone turns.  DALE pulling A CRUMPLED BALL OF PAPER from 
           Ray's bag -- the one he threw in the garbage -- there it is. THE 
           FORMULA.  He's busted. 

                                 RAY
                        Ain't that a bitch...

           EXT.  SAN DIEGO CONVENTION CENTER -- DAY

           A HELICOPTER -- silver and green -- angling for the PARKING LOT.  
           On the Jumbotron marquee --

           Coming in for a landing.  GARSIK pulling himself together   for

           INT.  SCHIPOL AIRPORT TERMINAL -- NIGHT

           Welcome to Amsterdam.  CLAIRE camped out in an airport cafe. 
           Like she's been waiting for a while.  Alternating between 
           impatience and dread.  Scanning the passing travellers.  
           Checking her watch for the umpteenth time.  Where is he?     

           INT.  CONVENTION CENTER ENTRY TUNNEL -- DAY

           GARSIK leading HIS ENTOURAGE into the bowels of the building.  
           MUSIC and APPLAUSE echoing from the distance.   

           INT.  SCHIPOL AIRPORT TERMINAL -- NIGHT

           CLAIRE still waiting.  But not for long, she's out of time.     
           Packing up her stuff, just about to leave, when -- 

                                 RAY
                        Remember me? 

           There he is behind her.  But moving slow.  Sunglasses to hide 
           the shiner.  Looks like he's taken a beating.  

                                 CLAIRE
                           (watching him sit slowly) 
                        I guess Duke bought it. 

                                 RAY 
                        Oh yeah.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        I waited. 

                                 RAY
                        I see that.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        I've got the Dutch buyers upstairs. 
                        They'll go as high as 35 million. 

           Gulp.  

                                 RAY
                        Seventeen a piece? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Seventeen-five.   

                                 RAY
                        Works for me. 
                                                    #1  10/30/07   117.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Tell me you have the formula. 

           Pause.     

                                 RAY 
                        I thought you had it. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I asked you first. 

                                 RAY
                        You asked me first?

           She hesitates.  A crack in her facade.        

                                 CLAIRE 
                        If I told you I loved you, would it   make 
                        a difference? 

                                 RAY
                        If you told me, or if I believed you? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I love you.   
                           (he's staring)
                        You can believe me or not, I don't 
                        care anymore.  Maybe it's better if 
                        you don't.  Maybe that's it, maybe 
                        that's all we've got, this constant 
                        thing, this doubt, whatever the hell 
                        it is.  Maybe we're only good in the game.  
                        Maybe it only works for us 
                        when we're off-balance or freaked-out,
                        or I don't even know...
                           (her most vulnerable)
                        I just keep having this fantasy that 
                        we suddenly snap out of it, that we'll 
                        come out of this and be like people 
                        are supposed to be.  Like normal people.  
                        Like trusting and honest and...

                                      RAY 
                        We're not like other people. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I know that!  You think I don't know that!  
                        Do you have any idea how frustrating it is

                        you anyway. 

           Silence.  RAY staring at her.    

                                 RAY 
                        If I find out this is because you 
                        don't have the formula and you think maybe 
                        I do, I'm gonna be seriously 
                        disappointed.  

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Okay.  Okay, Here's what we do. 
                           (pulling it together)
                        On the count of three, whatever we have   -
                        - formula or no formula -- we put it 
                        out on the table.  A one-time, last-time 
                        deal.  No games.  No going back.  Okay?

                                 RAY 
                        I have it. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I said the count of three. 

                                 RAY
                        I have it.

                            from his pocket--)
                        Why wait?  What's the point?  
                           (flat out)
                        I love you.  I think about you all the 
                        time.  I think about you even when 
                        you're with me.  I look at you -- I 
                        can't stop looking at you -- I look 
                        at you, and I think, that woman...  
                           (beat)
                        That woman knows who I am and loves 
                        me anyway. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                           (overwhelmed)
                        I have it too. 

           She does.  Pulling another copy of THE FORMULA from her bag.    
           But he's not even waiting, he's reaching for her across the 
           table and she's right there and it's an awkward, but deeply-felt 
           kiss that's just gonna continue as THE SOUND OF MUSIC  AND

                        you, there's three things I don't like.     
                        I don't like any kind of controversy...

           As they were.  Except there's this weird buzz amongst THE 
           CHEMISTS -- lots of HUSHED DUTCH CHATTER -- all eyes on THE

                        this piece of crap transmitter 
                        in my phone, I'm gonna try and keep it 
                        focused, but...

                                 CLAIRE 
                        So you're like directing me now? 

                                 RAY
                        You want to go through all this and   have 
                        them not hear it? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        You are directing me. 

                                 RAY 
                           (kidding here)
                        Yes.  Shut up and do what I tell you.  

                                 CLAIRE
                           (seductive)
                        Come here and say that.

                                 RAY 
                        Claire, c'mon, it's midnight.  We've got 
                        to do this for real in twelve hours.  

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I know, it's just this whole thing 
                        makes me think about Rome and when I think 
                        about Rome I think about you     and when 
                        I think about you, well...
                           (that smile)
                        I can barely enunciate. 

           THE CAMERA STARTS DRIFTING AWAY NOW -- ZOOMING TOWARD THE 
           CEILING as -- 

                                 RAY (OS)
                        Let's just do it one more time. 

                                 CLAIRE (OS)
                        Can we do it without the towel? 

                                 RAY (OS)
                        I don't work naked.  

           THERE'S A DOT -- a speck -- ON THE CEILING -- that's where we're 
           heading -- and as we do -- as THE CAMERA BEGINS TO TAKE ON 
                                                    #1  10/30/07   125.

           MICROSCOPIC POWERS -- we will quickly see that it is more  than 
           a dot, it's some kind electronic device -- 

                                 CLAIRE (OS)
                        You know I know it. 

                                 RAY (OS)
                        So show me. 

                                 CLAIRE (OS)
                        You show me.  

           And just as we realize what we're looking at is A MICROPHONE, 
           the whole situation begins to... 

           MORPH INTO

           INT.  HOWARD TULLY'S OFFICE -- NIGHT (CONT)

           A LOUDSPEAKER on his desk, broadcasting loud and clear -- 

                                 RAY'S VOICE  
                        Tell you what.  Let's do it all the 
                        way through one more time and I'll take 
                        off the towel. 

           WIDER TO FIND 

           TULLY standing beside his telescope, listening to -- 

                                 CLAIRE'S VOICE
                        If you love me you'll do it without the 
                        towel now.   

                                 RAY'S VOICE
                        Okay.  From the top.  No towel. 
                           (a beat)
                        "Remember me?"
                           (the sound of LAUGHTER and--)

           There's JEFF BAUER...

                                 CLAIRE'S VOICE
                           (trying to stop laughing)
                        "...sure...of course...we..."

           There's NED GUSTON and...

                                 RAY'S VOICE 
                        "Long time, huh?" 

           There's RONNIE PARTIZ and...
                                                    #1  10/30/07   126.

                                 CLAIRE'S VOICE 
                        "...yes...I'm...I'm..."

                                 RAY'S VOICE
                        Gotcha. 

           There's PAM FRALES and...

                                 CLAIRE'S VOICE
                        "...look, I'm sorry, really, I'm just..."

                                 RAY'S VOICE 
                        "Just what?" 

           TULLY has crossed the room.  Turning down the volume on the 
           speakers.  RAY and CLAIRE'S rehearsal CONTINUING VERY QUIETLY in 
           the background, as -- 

                                 TULLY 
                        They're perfect.  We'll never get a better 
                        situation than this. 

                                 GUSTON 
                        Can we show you what we've got? 

           A PILE OF MATERIALS spread across TULLY'S DESK -- 

                                 GUSTON
                        This is the speech...  
                           (two copies)
                        We've got your copy, and then this is   
                        the rough draft.  We'd want you to handle 
                        it enough to leave behind some prints. 

           FLASHBACK -- "THE UNIT" -- TWO FINGERPRINTS projected on the 
           wall side-by-side.  THE WHOLE TEAM staring --

                                 DUKE 
                        Handwriting?  

                                 FETYOV
                        Hundred percent.  Is from the hand of 
                        Howard Tully.  

           TULLY moving along the presentation -- 

                                 BAUER 
                        For the travel records, we've logged 
                        about two-hundred dummy trips, cars, 
                        hotels, etc., and then buried them in 
                        the actual files...  
                                                    #1  10/30/07   127.

           FLASHBACK -- "THE UNIT" -- PILES OF HACKED TRAVEL DOCUMENTS 
           stacked across the floor and -- 

                                 DALE
                        ...four of these companies they must've 
                        bought over the phone because nobody 
                        from B&R New York ever even visited 
                        them...

           TULLY smiling now --  

                                 GUSTON
                        ...here's an inventory of all the 
                        backdated Dermavale acquisition stuff...

           FLASHBACK -- DUNWOODIE, GEORGIA -- RAY and FETYOV getting their 
           tour of the empty warehouse, as -- 

                                 REALTOR
                        Dermavale?  Damned if I know.  Some 
                        kind of biotech.  They took the place, 
                        loaded in their gear, and that's about the 
                        last we saw of them.  Hell, they 
                        used to truck out their own trash.

           TULLY excited, rushing ahead of them now -- 

                                 RONNY PARTIZ
                        That's the Ronny Partiz materials...
                           (and whoever this guy is,     he 
                            is nothing like Ronny Partiz--)
                        That's the yearbook...transcript...the  
                        plagiarized article...

           FLASHBACK -- "THE UNIT" -- that midnight emergency summit -- 

                                 DUKE 
                        ...and for the Coup De Grace, toss in 
                        the fact that he's been playing Baccarat 
                        whenever he's sober enough to get to 
                        the table to the tune of three hundred 
                        thousand a week.

                                 GARSIK 
                        Well goddamit, Duke!  Let's quit waltzing 
                        around and get on this guy!
                                                    #1  10/30/07   128.

           TULLY with a look of almost demonic anticipation -- 

                                 TULLY
                        Fine work.  Incredible.  Marvelous!
                           (decision time)
                        Twelve days.  That's the goal line.   
                        Garsik's got a shareholders meeting 
                        in exactly twelve days.  
                           (pacing away)
                        Put it in play!

           THE REST OF THEM watching him dance back to the telescope.  
           Sharing a communal sort of, "Can-you-believe-this?" look.  

                                 GUSTON
                        Sir, one question...
                           (Tully turns back)
                        Just so we can be accurate with our  
                        numbers here.  If there was a cure     for 
                        baldness -- if the thing actually existed -
                        - what would it be worth? 

           TULLY hesitates.  Smiles. 

                                 TULLY 
                        Anything.   

           INT,  SCHIPOL AIRPORT TRANSIT LOUNGE -- NIGHT

           RAY and CLAIRE just sitting there.  Sitting there as we left 
           them.  Like they've been sitting there for a very long time.  

                                 CLAIRE
                           (finally)
                        Don't.

                                 RAY
                        Don't what? 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Don't say it.   

                                 RAY 
                        Say what?

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I know what you're thinking.  
                           (he looks over)
                        You're wondering if I sent you a bogus 
                        formula.  You're thinking maybe I have the 
                        real one stashed someplace else.
                                                    #1  10/30/07   129.

                                 RAY 
                        That's sick.  Even for you. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        But it crossed your mind. 

                                 RAY
                        That's why I get the big bucks. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Because I would never do that. 

                                 RAY
                        Because you love me. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Exactly.  

           Both of them going quiet, because there's A WAITER coming toward 
           them.  And he's carrying a silver tray.  And on the tray is A 
           BOTTLE OF FINE CHAMPAGNE and TWO CRYSTAL FLUTES.    

                                 WAITER 
                        Ms. Stenwick?  Mr. Koval? 
                           (they just nod)
                        May I?
                           (he wants to open it--)

                                 CLAIRE
                        Who?  Who's it from? 

                                 WAITER
                        Compliments of Mr. Howard Tully. 

           A long, dead pause.  THE WAITER just hanging...     

                                 RAY
                           (barely)
                        Open it. 

           And THE WAITER goes to work, as -- 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        We got totally played, didn't we?  

                                 RAY 
                        Yup.  

           POP! -- and he's pouring, and -- 

                                 CLAIRE  
                        Must go back pretty far.  
                                                    #1  10/30/07   130.

                                 RAY
                        Like...

                                 CLAIRE
                        Way back. 

           They have their glasses.  Frozen there as the waiter exits.      

                                 RAY
                        I guess, on a strictly professional  level 
                        it's...

                                 CLAIRE  
                        Impressive.  

           They ponder that a moment.  It's sinking in.  

                                 RAY
                        At least we have each other.    

                                 CLAIRE
                        It's really that bad, isn't it? 

                                 RAY
                        Kind of, yeah. 

           She finally looks over.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        I didn't mean...

                                 RAY
                        I know.  

           He takes her hand.  One last stunned silence. 

                                 CLAIRE 
                        I can't breathe. 

                                 RAY
                        You'll be okay. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        When?

                                 RAY
                        When we wake up in Rome. 

           She nods.  Downs her Champagne.  

                                 CLAIRE 
                        We may have to wake up in Rome for a   
                        long time.

                                 RAY
                        Sounds like a plan.  

           He drains his glass.  Finds the bottle.  Finds her smiling at 
           him as he pours another round...

           As THE LOVE THEME FROM DUPLICITY begins to swell and...  

           WE FREEZE.  

           On them.  Like that.  As we found them...

                                      THE END
