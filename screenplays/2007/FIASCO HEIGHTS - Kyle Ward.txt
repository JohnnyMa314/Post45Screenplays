           OVER BLACK:

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        It always starts with a bang.

           BOOOOOOOM!

           Shards of glass and metal hit the air as an entire ARMORED 
           TRUCK goes up in a brume of fire. A shredded tire blows right 
           over us while the truck barrel rolls through the front window 
           of the FIASCO HEIGHTS SAVINGS & LOAN BANK.

           A tidal wave of smoke blankets the street while hot debris 
           rains down like hellfire confetti. And suddenly, FIVE MEN 
           DRESSED AS VAUDEVILLE VILLAINS race through the wreckage. 

           Each of them dawns an elaborate moustache and a black cape. A 
           classic disguise reminiscent of the evil genius who vandalized 
           streets and strapped innocent girls to railroad tracks.

                                 VILLAIN #1 (MASTERMIND)
                    (a tad British)
                        The package is inside, lock-boxed in 
                        the central vault...

           Fresh hundreds litter the sky as the thieves enter the bank.

           INT. FIASCO SAVINGS & LOAN BANK - NIGHT

           VILLAIN #2 -decked in a cowboy hat- spits some chaw and 
           SHOVES A SIX SHOOTER RIGHT IN OUR FACE:

                                 VILLAIN #2 (COWBOY)
                        Loot up that bag or I’ll blow your 
                        goddamn head right off!

           VILLAIN #1 jumps on top of a nearby table, removes a small 
           PISTOL and begins firing into the ceiling.

                                 VILLAIN #1 (MASTERMIND)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, if you haven’t 
                        noticed, this is a bank robbery of 
                        heterogeneous splendor. And we, are 
                        your dazzling neighborhood bank 
                        robbers. We’d like to welcome you to 
                        the show, and declare that it’s our 
                        great pleasure to confiscate your 
                        belongings this evening. Now, 
                        everyone stay quiet and remain 
                        seated during the performance, or 
                        things are gonna get aggravated. 

           ALARM STARTS SCREAMING.

           In seconds, every customer in the bank is kissing the floor. 
           And one of every six has pissed their pants by now. Then...
           An elderly SECURITY GUARD gets a rush of courage. He reaches 
           for his weapon... UNTIL ...the point of a Winchester rifle 
           snuggles up to his temple.

                                 VILLAIN #2 (COWBOY)
                        I’d think twice ‘bout that 
                        muchacho. Wouldn’t wanna get your 
                        head in a tussle.

           TWO OTHER VILLAINS pace the room itching for someone to get 
           brave. They’re a rough troupe -- bad news in the flesh.

           ANGLE ON: MONEY BEING SHOVED INTO A DUFFLE BAG...

           ANGLE ON: THE BAG IS QUICKLY PASSED OVER THE COUNTER...

           AT THE VAULT

           BAM-BAM! VILLAIN #3 -visible DRAGON tattoo on his neck-  pops 
           the vault guard and snatches the keys. He steps inside the 
           cage and starts dumping security boxes. 

           Diamonds. Pearls. Jewelry. He keeps jacking investments until 
           coming to AN UNNUMBERED BOX. The villain unhinges it and 
           eagerly reaches inside, removing...

           A BLACK LEATHER CASE with a RED CROSS inlaid across it. The 
           villain peels off his mustache, smiles big. And remember this 
           face - this flush, wrinkled face - because it belongs to 
           PATRICK MCBANISTER.

           Now, the gang rushes for the exit. COWBOY slings his COLT 
           .45’s into their holsters while McBanister secures the stolen 
           case under his cape. MASTERMIND turns to his fear-crippled 
           crowd and takes a bow...

                                 VILLAIN #1 (MASTERMIND)
                        They call us the VaudeVillains.
                    (bows again)
                        End scene. Motherfuckers!

           As he tips his hat, the fire RISES AROUND US. And...

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Stop.

           SCENE FREEZES: DEBRIS PAUSING IN MID-AIR.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        I might need to explain this.

                                         SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. COMMUNITY SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT

           A single light bulb sways from the ceiling, flickering 
           intensely. And just BELOW IT...
           WHAM! Some poor sap wearing a BATH ROBE takes a crushing hook to 
           the jaw. WHAM! A spray of warm DNA spits across the room. WHAM!
           Another. Just keep the punches coming. Bloody. Gritty. Brutal.

           VICTIM slumps against the ropes tying him to a swivel chair. 
           Note: each of the chair’s legs is drilled into the floor. That 
           way, it doesn’t tip over while SIX BRUTISH POLICE OFFICERS 
           continue fist-fucking this guy’s face into ground beef.

           SCENE FREEZES: JUST AS A FEW TEETH GO AIRBORNE.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        All right. I guess I’ll need to 
                        explain this too. So let’s just 
                        start from the beginning.

                                         SMASH CUT TO:

           A CITY LIMIT SIGN:

                    WELCOME TO FIASCO HEIGHTS
                      Population: 733,966

           And what makes this sign so unique are the successive BULLET 
           HOLES throughout it -as well as- the fact that 733,966 has 
           been crossed out repeatedly and replaced with lower numbers.

           NOW - THE CAMERA ROCKETS INTO THE SKY, WHERE WE GET A FULL 
           FRONTAL VIEW OF...

           THE GRIMMEST METROPOLIS YOU’VE EVER SEEN. Lurid skyscrapers. 
           Gothic architecture. You won’t find this place on a map.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Fiasco Heights. You drive to hell 
                        and back, you just might find the 
                        place.

           Soon, A TAXI CAB races from the city like a predator out for 
           its nightly rounds. We follow the cab from an aerial view as 
           it races across the barren highway.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        It’s a dead end turn with no end in 
                        sight...

           INSERT: A SERIES OF BLACK & WHITE CRIME SCENES CUT AT THE 
           SPEED OF MUZZLE FLASHES. 

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Right and wrong are afterthoughts 
                        here. Everyone’s decked in the same 
                        dark shade of gray...

           INSERT SERIES OF FLASH CUTS:

           - A DRY CLEANER nods as the clothing track parts to reveal 
           FIVE MOBSTERS counting money in the back room.
                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        The cleaners.

           - A PHARMACIST hands us a bottle of pills over the counter.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        The dealers.

           - AN OFF DUTY COP pops his cruiser trunk to reveal a wealth 
           of stolen arms. PRICE TAGS on everything.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        The door-to-door salesmen.

           - A GARBAGE MAN collects a stack of money from a friendly 
           housewife. His truck lifting a trash bin in the background... 
           HER DEAD HUSBAND’S CORPSE DROPS FROM IT.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        And the guys who take out the 
                        garbage.

           BACK ON THE CAB: A stroke of lightning streaks across the sky 
           outlining the city in raw illumination.  

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        All sins forgiven, never forgotten. 
                        No laws. No saving grace. Morality 
                        is a fallen angel in this town.

           Cue the rain. Heavy rain.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        And here, the angels fall faster 
                        than the raindrops.

           INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

           THE CABBIE takes a swig of coffee slush and slicks back his 
           thinning hair. He’s a bit of a slob, but who’s judging?

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        The cycle is as endless as it is 
                        vicious. It begins here. It ends 
                        here. And a whole lot’a people die 
                        in between.

           SMASH TITLE:         FIASCO HEIGHTS

           EXT. THE LAST CHANCE DINER - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

           Still raining. Wind ripping across the open road. And all we 
           can make out is a flashing NEON SIGN in the distance. 

                         “LAST CHANCE”
           It’s an old grease pit tucked within the trees of the highway 
           shoulder. A metallic glimmer fading to rust.

           INT. THE LAST CHANCE DINER - NIGHT

           A torn up jukebox struggles to play SINATRA’S Moon River over 
           the hiss of sizzling bacon and fresh ground coffee. Linoleum 
           shining from every angle - this place is straight out of a 
           “Leave it to Beaver” marathon. 

           We dolly through booths of dining patrons, none of which are 
           touching their food.  Instead, every eye in the joint is 
           staring towards the rear of the diner. It’s dead silent... 
           well, all except for the CRASHING and POUNDING and KICKING
           and CRYING coming from the men’s room. 

           INT. MEN’S ROOM - LAST CHANCE DINER - NIGHT

           WE’RE CLOSE ON THE TEAR FILLED EYES OF A DYING MAN.

                                 FLASK
                        Fuck! I told ya once and a thousand 
                        fuckin’ times, I ain’t seen the 
                        gal.

           SLAM! Flask’s face is smashed against the inside of a urinal.

           And as he rears back, we find the hot point of a .357 GLOCK
           31 pressed firm to his temple. This guy’s drowning in a pool 
           of his own sweat. 

                                 FLASK
                    (choking on blood)
                        Dear Father, who art in heaven, 
                        hallowed by thy...

           SLAM!

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Focus on me for a second.
                    (beat)
                        Where is the girl?

           Flask’s ASSASSIN readies his gun with a firm grip. His 
           identity is hidden beneath a weathered Fedora and the lifted 
           collar of an overcoat. We’ll be introduced soon enough.

                                 FLASK
                        I got nothing to do with that 
                        broad! Nothing!
                    (changing gears)
                        God, if you’re up there... I’ll do 
                        anything...

           SLAM! Flask spits a few chips of porcelain from his mouth.
                                 FLASK
                    (relenting)
                        Okay - okay. Fiasco Heights. Last I 
                        heard, that’s where she headed. But 
                        I’d start lookin’ for another prom 
                        date, pal, chances are she’s 
                        already dead. You go there, you 
                        won’t find nothin’ but heartbreak. 
                        The permanent kind.

           KILLER PULLS THE HAMMER BACK NOW. 

           Flask looses his nerve. He tears up like a school girl just 
           cut from cheerleading try outs.

                                 FLASK 
                        I’m gonna miss my family. I got two 
                        little boys. A wife -- I gotta wife. 
                        This is gonna be hard on them... 
                        God, please look after my boys.

           Killer stays calm, professional. And we can tell he’s one 
           cool motherfucker just by the suave in his voice. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        You finished?

                                 FLASK
                        Yeah. I’m finished.

           Killer slowly lifts his face to the florescent light. He’s a 
           striking presence, crisp and clean cut. Chiseled jawline. 
           Lean build. Dirty blonde hair - with a hint of charm and 
           menace in his eye. This is Nick Prine (aka NICK THE SAINT).

                                 NICK THE SAINT 
                        Say the word.

           Flask hesitates. He takes a deep breath - his last deep 
           breath - then closes his eyes.

                                 FLASK
                        Amen.

           BAM!!!

           A SPRAY OF BLOODY PULP FRECKLES THE ATMOSPHERE LIKE A B-
           POSITIVE RAIN SHOWER, AS...

           SCENE FREEZES: on Nick’s vicious glare. 

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Meet Nick the Saint. He’s what we call 
                        a professional “trigger”. That’s a gun 
                        for hire for all you tourists who 
                        don’t speak the language.  

           AND SCENE FLIPS COUNTERCLOCKWISE LIKE THE CHAMBER OF A 
           REVOLVER, transitioning us into A MONTAGE OF NICK FIRING FROM 
           VARIOUS ANGLES.  ALL STYLISH KILLS.
                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        He’s one of the best -- resume is 
                        nothin’ but gold stars.

           THEN SCENE REVOLVES TO:

           INT - FIASCO CITY MORGUE - NIGHT

           Camera PANS across a row of CADAVERS. Blue. Stiff. Each of 
           them atop examining tables with VISIBLE TOE TAGS.

           #1. CASANOVA DIEGO GONZALEZ. A CUBAN MAN. Dark hair with 
           frosted tips.  

           #2. “GIGGLES” VAN MORISSEY. Huge grin still plastered to his 
           mug. Entire torso covered in SMILEY FACE TATTOOS.

           #3. FRANKIE “THE BARBER” BAMBONI. Still dressed in his barber 
           get-up. A hideous toupee sliding off his scalp.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Casanova. Van Morissey. The Barber. 
                        Nick sent ‘em all to the morgue 
                        first class on a one way ticket. 

           BACK TO SCENE:

           UNFREEZE: As Nick signs the cross over Flask’s corpse. Then 
           kneels down and begins frisking it over...

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Try not to let the blood n’ guts 
                        turn ya sideways. Nicky believes in 
                        things like final prayers - last 
                        rites. He’s one of the good guys.

           ...And Nick removes Flask’s wallet and steals a twenty.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Well, as good as it gets in this 
                        story anyway.

           Nick cleans up in the mirror, wipes some blood from his chin. 

           INT. THE LAST CHANCE DINER - NIGHT

           The patrons sit motionless as a blood-splattered Nick 
           approaches the counter. He slides the twenty to the waitress, 
           and takes one long sip from his pre-ordered ROOT BEER FLOAT. 
           Maybe even licks some whipped cream off the spoon. 

           Then, he winks at a little girl starring nearby... turns... 
           slaps the skipping jukebox... and exits the diner.
           EXT. THE LAST CHANCE DINER - CONTINUOUS

           Streaks of blue neon outline Nick’s face in sharp flashes as 
           he adjusts the fit of his Fedora and steps into the pouring 
           rain. He waits for a moment, until...

           HEADLIGHTS. Our TAXI CAB screeches into the parking lot and 
           slams to a stop beside Nick. He gets in.

           INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

           Leather seats ripped from years of wear. Floor sprinkled with 
           trash and cigarette ash. This ride has stories.

                                 CABBIE
                        Where to guy?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Fiasco Heights. Cheapest hotel you 
                        know.

           Cabbie turns to his fare.

                                 CABBIE
                        You sure you wanna go that road? 
                        They don’t call this the Last 
                        Chance for nothin’.

           Nick jars the rain from his overcoat.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I’m sure.

           Cabbie flips the windshield wipers and pops into drive. 

                                 CABBIE
                        Well. Consider it a fare’s warning.

           FOOT HITS THE GAS - ENGINE REVS - TIRES SQUEAL - RUBBER BURNS

           The cab speeds into the night leaving the “Last Chance” in a 
           cloud of smoke. Neon fades into the background.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        More rain? It was raining when I 
                        left this shitbox a year back.

                                 CABBIE
                        Least twice a day now. Friggin’ place 
                        is a flood with traffic lights.
                    (beat)
                        What brings ya ‘round again, 
                        business or pleasure?

           Nick scopes out the cab and gets comfortable. He whips out A 
           SILVER LIGHTER and fires up a fresh cigarette.
                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Business.

                                 CABBIE
                        What kind a’ business? 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Mine.

           Cabbie takes this as his cue to ease up on the questions. 

           Nick tightens his lips into a slight grin, smoke slowly 
           dispelling between them. He leans down and picks up a 
           crumpled newspaper from the floor. 

           ANGLE ON: THE FRONTPAGE OF THE PAPER. Headline reads, “FLAVOR 
           OF THE MONTH” above a black and white photo of TWO DEAD 
           BODIES. Both appear to be frozen stiff.

                                 CABBIE
                    (re: headline)
                        Clean hits. New body count high 
                        according to city records. They 
                        think it’s some fuckin’ ice cream 
                        guy - goes by the name Mr. Frosty. 
                        Adds a new flavor to the menu for 
                        every vic he puts on ice. Ain’t 
                        that somethin’ sick?

           Passing a sign:

             8 MILES TO FIASCO HEIGHTS - WHERE IT’S ALWAYS SUNNY!!

           Cabbie grips the wheel tight and rounds a slick curve. Nick 
           glides across the seat in the back.

                                 CABBIE (CONT’D) 
                        In other news, Tony Fingers got 
                        waxed yesterday. His whole crew was 
                        taken over by that Jewish gang on 
                        the East Side. Now, they got the 
                        whole damn block in yarmulkes. You 
                        ever seen an Italian in a yarmulke? 
                        It’s worth full fuckin’ admission.

           Nick tosses the paper on the floor.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Ice cream guys. Dead kingpins. It’s 
                        all peaches and cream to me, pops.

           The cab hugs another curve, brakes riding heavy this time. 
           Nick puts his cigarette out against the leather.

                                 CABBIE 
                        I tell ya, you gotta have guts to 
                        make it in this town. And they’d 
                        better be bulletproof if ya know what 
                        I mean. I were you, I’d have me turn 
                        this ride around.

                        bed and breakfast six feet under.

           Nick leans forward as the cab CROSSES THE FIASCO BAY BRIDGE.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Ya know what, driver? I’ve changed 
                        my mind... I do like you after all.

                                 CABBIE (DELI)
                        Then if it matters, the name’s 
                        Delicontessi. But you can just call me 
                        Deli for cuts.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Fine, Deli, that business I was 
                        talkin’ about... just happens it’s 
                        the unfinished kind. I’m here to 
                        find a missin’ dame, and kill 
                        anyone whose laid a goddamn hand on 
                        her between now and then.
                    (beat)
                        Point is, I’d like to retain your 
                        services while I’m in town.

           Deli offers his card over the seat.

                                 DELI
                        Call that number anytime, 
                        anywhere... I’ll only be a minute.

           Cab passes along FIASCO’S TONIC REEF. Oddly constructed piers 
           and wharfs litter our view.

                                 DELI 
                        So what do they call you, friend? 
                        Ain’t nothin’ more important than a 
                        name. Like a calling card that 
                        don’t need callin’ out.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                    (hesitant)
                        I like names too, Deli. And killing 
                        people who got ‘em. 
                    (beat)
                        I’m Nick. Nick the Saint. 

           Driver immediately angles the rear view into the back seat. 

                                 DELI
                        As in the Nick the Saint? The most 
                        cold blooded trigger this town’s 
                        ever seen? Nah, you ain’t serious. 
                        Word on the street is that you were 
                        a pale horse. Dead as nails!

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Yeah, well, the street’s full of 
                        shit.

           Cabbie turns back now, confounded.
                                 DELI
                        Jesus H. Washington! I feel like 
                        I’m talkin’ to a ghost here.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                    (smiles)
                        Maybe you are.

           Some GUY pile-drives a WOMAN on all fours, just going to town

           camera. He’s probably gone through a roll or two by now.

                        Forgive me father, I’ve sinned. 
                        It’s been three days since my last 
                        confession.
           The window opens to reveal FATHER PISARRO (from montage), an 
           elderly priest with graying hair and a moustache to match. 

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        Three days? You were just in here 
                        yesterday, Doyle.

                        Are you screwin’ with me? My book 
                        has you a quarter in the hole. You

                        See, that’s part of my confession. 
                        I ain’t got the money. Was hoping 
                        to get by on that whole “forgive my 
                        debts” thing.

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                    (with a chuckle)
                        That’s just a limp clause. You want 
                        your debts erased, better find 
                        another church. This one’s 
                        Catholic. 

                                 LUCKY
                        Well, actually, I was hoping you’d 
                        let me play my debt. Spot me the 
                        money and ride it on tonight’s 
                        fight. Should be a sure thing - I 
                        hear there’s a patsy in the ring.

           Father Pisarro shakes his head in disgust.

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        The house doesn’t make loans. It’s 
                        policy. And that comes straight 
                        from the top. Look, I’ll forgive 
                        your sins, say a little prayer... 
                        I’ll even throw in a blessing free 
                        of charge. But your bets are no 
                        good here, Doyle. 

           Lucky gets desperate.

                                 LUCKY
                        Father Pisarro, this fight is a no 
                        brainer. I win, you win - blessings 
                        all around. I need this! Call it 
                        amazing grace in tens and twenties.

           Father Pisarro slams the window in his face. Lucky sits back 
           a beaten man. UNTIL -- THE DOOR TO THE BOOTH SWINGS OPEN. 
           Now - A HUGE, MUSCULAR GOON IN A PRIEST’S COLLAR GRABS LUCKY 
           BY THE SHIRT - RIPPING him from the confessional AND slamming 
           him against the wall. Father Pisarro stands behind the 
           monster.

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        Lucky -- meet THE POPE.

           The Pope pushes his forearm into Lucky’s throat.

                                 THE POPE
                        Hear you got a tithing problem, 
                        punk!!

           Lucky replies with, “Ugghhh.”

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        Now, listen up. I’m feeling a 
                        little religious today, so let’s 
                        put faith in motion. We’ll spot you 
                        the money on tonight’s fight. But 
                        know this, if you’re not grinnin’
                        by the final round, Pope’s gonna
                        give you a Judas neck massage. 

           The Pope drops Lucky. He falls to the ground like a twisted 
           cement bag. 

                                 LUCKY
                        Alright Father. I get it.

           The Pope picks Lucky up and begins dragging him to the door.

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        Good. Now go with God. And get the 
                        hell outta here, my son.

           ANGLE ON: Lucky being dragged across the purple carpet.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Every bet in Fiasco goes down in 
                        the “good book”. And if you don’t

           INSERT: A CUTAWAY OF THE RAWLEY RIVER. Quiet. Still. A 
           peaceful current. 

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        That’s the Rawley River. Prime 
                        source of holy water and home of 
                        the St. Charles Catholic Retreat 
                        for Sinners. 

           CAMERA SUDDENLY DROPS BELOW SURFACE TO REVEAL A WEALTH OF 
           BODYBAGS DECORATING THE SANDY FLOOR.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Let’s just say the place ain’t 
                        known for great fishin’.
           BACK ON: Lucky is lifted by the collar, carried passed a HOLY 
           WATER HOT TUB (which is at full capacity by the way) and 
           THROWN OUT THE DOOR.

           SFX OVER SCENE:  DING. DING. DING.

                                          SLAM CUT TO:

           INT. BOXING ARENA - NIGHT

           Two fighters going at it in flashes of flesh and blood. Jabs 
           echoing through the arena like thunder. 

           In the 11th row, Lucky screams with clenched fists. He’s 
           cheering for his life, yelling for his fighter (RED SHORTS) 
           with blow-by-blow accuracy. And in 5, 4, 3, 2...

           BAM!!! RED SHORTS TAKES AN UPPERCUT THAT PUTS HIS LIGHTS OUT.

           And Lucky’s not so cheery anymore.

           SUPER:                $50,000

           We stay on Lucky’s blank expression as the above number 
           quickly BEGINS TO RISE UNTIL HITTING -$100,000. “DING”.

           ANGLE ON: THE LOSING BOXER’S EYES ROLL BACK in his head 
           seconds before he drops like a wet noodle. 

           Lucky swallows his soul as the ref calls the fight. It’s wall 
           to wall cheers as the underdog celebrates his victory. And 
           across the arena, we notice A GROUP OF PRIESTS all staring at 
           Lucky from an exit tunnel. Shit... Shit...

                         LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Shit. I’d just booked a deep sea dive 
                        in the Rawley. Go fuckin’ fish.

           Lucky closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. Then, in a 
           sudden act of last resort, he rockets out of his seat and 
           hauls ass down the aisle. He knocks a few popcorn/soft drink 
           vendors out of the way and rushes for the exit.

           The priests immediately push through the celebrating 
           spectators in hot pursuit...

           INT. BOXING ARENA - ATRIUM - NIGHT

           Lucky skids around a corner, and straight into the most 
           gorgeous blonde we’ll see for the next 90 minutes. He plows 
           over her, knocking her purse across the floor.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        But this is when I really run into 
                        trouble...
           FREEZE ON: HOPE CAUFIELD. She’s beautiful. Flowing blonde 
           hair, heavy shine. Fair skin. Thick red lips. Curves right 
           out of a magazine. Here’s a femme fatale to the fucking max.

           SLAM SUB:           “TROUBLE”

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        I just didn’t know it yet.

           UNFREEZE: As Lucky quickly reaches down to grab a few of her 
           spilled belongings. 

                                 LUCKY
                        Really sorry, lady.

                                 HOPE
                        Just watch it, will ya.

           He hands over a pack of Virginia slims, some lipstick, then 
           returns to a dead sprint.

                                             CUT TO:

           EXT. BOXING ARENA - ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           THREE PRIESTS slam through the side exit into a pissed up 
           alley. But it’s all clear, no signs of washed up gamblers. 
           Other then a few bums, there’s nothing but the stench of 
           stagnant urine. The priests go back inside. 

           Slowly, Lucky steps out of hiding from behind an overturned 
           port o’potty -which- just happens to have a homeless guy 
           currently residing in it. Seconds pass, until...

           A SLEEK, BLACK TOWN CAR PULLS INTO THE ALLEY.

           Lucky ducks back down just as A FEW MYSTERIOUS FIGURES leave 
           the arena. He peeks up to catch our girl, Hope, getting 
           forced inside the vehicle. She’s whining, whimpering.

           Lucky comes up for air as the town car pulls away. Reading 
           the license plate numbers aloud before it disappears...

                                 LUCKY
                        10K QJ1
                    (to bum)
                        That’s a royal flush.

                                         SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. THE LIP LOUNGE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

           WHACK! NICK bitch-slaps a repulsive jazz club manager across 
           the face with a violin. Three strings pop on impact.

           The manager falls backward holding his face. He’s a greasy 
           slimebag, ratty hair. Face scarred from years of acne. 
           Looks like he’s been sweating for a week straight. This is 
           SWEATS POLINO, and hygiene doesn’t exist in his vocabulary.

                                 SWEATS
                        Doughboy’s gonna shit cinder blocks 
                        when he hears you’re back! He still 
                        thinks you’re ashes. Dead as the 
                        nails they put in your coffin.
                    (cough)
                        It really pissed him off, you 
                        tryin’ to leave without sayin’
                        goodbye. Just fuckin’ rude.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Where’s the girl, Sweats? I know 
                        she’s here. You seen her? 

                                 SWEATS
                        He’ll have a hit out on your ass 
                        before his bedtime snack. Didn’t ya
                        know, Doughboy is the most powerful 
                        boss in Fiasco now. The top dog. 
                        And he’s gonna gut ya wide open!

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Tell the fat lady he sings too loud 
                        and too often.
                    (hard beat)
                        I left because I wanted out. Plain. 
                        Simple. And non-negotiable.  

           Sweats struggles to a knee and wipes his greasy forehead.

                                 SWEATS
                        That’s what you think.  We ain’t 
                        some gang bang operation pushin’ 8 
                        balls at recess anymore. We’re big 
                        time now. Our guns are pullin’ in 
                        five figures a job - our gals can 
                        triple that on the right corner. 
                        We’re turning over more coke, more 
                        heroine, and more smiles than a 
                        fuckin’ happy meal. There’s power 
                        behind us guys now, Nicky. Power of 
                        the purest kind. So, you have no 
                        idea the shit you’re steppin’ into 
                        by whackin’ on me with a fuckin’
                        violin. I’m a made guy here!

           WHAM! Nick smashes the violin to splinters across his face.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Next you’ll say you can make pussy 
                        wet just by winkin’ at it.
                    (focused)
                        Where is she? Where’s Hope?

                                 SWEATS
                    (laughing)
                        Hope? You really care about some 
                        glossed up dame? YOU’RE. SO. 
                        FUCKED. <cough><cough><cough>
                                 (MORE)
                                 SWEATS (cont'd)
                        And your little valentine’s gonna
                        get fucked right alongside ya.
                        <cough> <cough> <cough>
                        Can’t you see, she’s playin’ ya, 
                        Saint. Like a puppet on chain-link 
                        wires. 

           Blood begins pouring down Sweats’ nose. Nick tosses him a 
           handkerchief from a nearby vanity table. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Here... you’re leakin’, Sweats. I 
                        think I busted a pipe or two.
                    (beat)
                        And while I’ve got your attention, 
                        I have a message for Doughboy.

                                 SWEATS
                        Yeah, what’s that?

           Nick removes a SILENCED SIG-SAUER and aims smack between the 
           eyes.... SPHIT! SPHIT! SPHIT! Blood peppers the mirrors.

                                          DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. LIP LOUNGE KARAOKE CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

           The nightclub is dimly lit. A classy joint lined with red 
           leather booths and musical motifs. Rich cigar smoke actuates 
           the air softening the mood to a smooth shade of gray.

           On the stage, your typical “broad in a night club” sings and 
           tosses a few winks to her crowd. She wears a white gown, fits 
           like a glove -but- more glitter than glamour.

           Now, we slowly pull back to reveal the singer reading her 
           words from a cue. Vacant piano - no musicians on stage. And 
           we realize, she’s singing karaoke... with a splash of noir.

           She delivers an enticing smile to some poor sap in the front 
           row - guy’s wife probably has dinner wrapped in the fridge by 
           now. His body goes limp as she turns to us with a seductive 
           gaze, winks, and blows a kiss right to the camera. 

           CAMERA HURLS BACK TO THE BAR where Nick chips away at a 
           cocktail like a programmed alcoholic. He stares at her -- 
           just for a few seconds, but it only takes her one to notice.

                                 TENDER SAL (O.S.)
                        Blink your headlights, Nick. That 
                        vixen has a leash on her.

           TENDER SAL (BARTENDER) nods to a corner booth, where we find 
           PAT McBANISTER -DRAGON TATTOO ON HIS NECK- giving Nick some 
           attention of his own. He’s flashy. Stylish. A celebrity as far 
           as gangsters go. That means he loves high profile gigs and the 
           media that follows them. And PS... he’s a bonafide prick.

           He winks at Nick and makes a pumping motion with his fist. As 
           in... “Yeah. I’m fuckin’ her”.
           Nick smiles vehemently and signals for two drinks.

                                 TENDER SAL
                        I seen that look before, and it 
                        usually means I gotta mop my floors 
                        in the morning. 
                    (pouring)
                        Just play nice would ya? He’s big 
                        time now. You don’t wanna reputation 
                        for puttin’ out the wrong stars.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Stars are meant for shooting, Sal. 
                        That’s how ya wish on ‘em.

           Nick grabs the drinks and goes for McBanister’s booth.

           AT McBANISTER’S BOOTH

           He drops in opposite McBanister. We can tell there’s a 
           rivalry here. Question is whether it’s friendly or not.

                                 MCBANISTER
                        Hiya Nick. Welcome back. Mind if 
                        you join me?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Not yet anyway.

           Nick slides the fresh cocktail across the table.

                                 MCBANISTER
                        I quit.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        So we’ll click to old habits. Or 
                        was it only the hard stuff that set 
                        your gun off?

                                 MCBANISTER
                        You’re just jealous because I had 
                        all the good gigs. I’m on contract 
                        with The Catholics now, see. Part 
                        time. Great benefits. A 401k.

           Nick lights up a fresh smoke.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Sorry to hear that. Thought they 
                        had enough choirboys to fondle.

                                 MCBANISTER
                        Cute. Very cute. 

           McBanister laughs it off and nods to the girl on stage.

                                 MCBANISTER
                        So whatdaya think of my new squeeze? 
                        They just don’t make trophies like 
                        that anymore, eh? Too many curves.
           Nick puts on a generic smile.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Yeah. I’m lookin’ for a girl myself.

           Nick slides a POLAROID PHOTO across the table. And, the woman 
           in the photograph is none other than... HOPE CAUFIELD (our 
           hot gal from fight night).

                                 MCBANISTER
                        Why you askin’ about this dame?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Curiosity. I hear it killed a cat 
                        once.

                                 MCBANISTER
                        And it’ll kill you too if ya keep 
                        on with the questions. 
                    (beat)
                        I ain’t seen her.

           McBanister starts to get edgy as his lady wraps her set.

                                 MCBANISTER
                        Why ya really here, Nick? What for?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Good reason. Bad intention. Maybe a 
                        mix of the two?
                    (beat)
                        Her name’s Hope. Just a gal who got 
                        thrown in the wrong drink with the 
                        wrong folks. Now she’s thin air 
                        with no tracks to follow. Just 
                        disappeared with something of high 
                        value. Something my current 
                        employers want back.
                    (beat)
                        You and me got history... it’s the 
                        only reason I’m asking.

                                 MCBANISTER
                    (cold)
                        I said I ain’t seen her. 
                    (colder)
                        But while there’s history on the 
                        table, I should probly let ya know 
                        that The Mormon was released.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        He’s out?

                                 MCBANISTER
                        Good behavior. Turned his last 
                        parole hearing into some PSA for 
                        that latter day mormon bullshit.
                        Not to mention, he had a wife on 
                        the committee. Those bitches are 
                        everywhere.
           Curtains fall as the stage crew resets for the next act.

                                 MCBANISTER
                        He’s workin’ for Doughboy again.
                    (cheshire grin)
                        See, I’d stiff ya myself -- but I’m 
                        givin’ ya the night off. Only since 
                        I know he’ll be lookin’ for old 
                        scores to polish up on.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Thanks for the clemency, it plays 
                        real genuine. Must be all the clergy 
                        they got ya hummin’ on. 

           McBanister opens his jacket enough to reveal the P.08 LUGER
           holstered inside. He shakes his head.

                                 MCBANISTER
                        Speakin’ of all that, I stopped to 
                        see your old gal Harley while you 
                        were out. She’s good company. Still 
                        partin’ those legs like the Red Sea, 
                        and worth every fuckin’ nickel.

           Nick LUNGES across the table -BUT- McBanister already has the 
           Lugor trained in his face. He’s clearly touched a nerve.

                                 MCBANISTER
                        I know. It’s not nice to point. And 
                        I’m usually one for manners, but 
                        you’re still crazy like a gypsy 
                        fuck, man.
                    (beat)
                        Now. Are we done catchin’ up on 
                        times of ole?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        For now. 

                                 MCBANISTER
                        Then scram, before I cause a ruckus.

           Nick holsters the gun he had poised under the table -- 
           McBanister lays down his Luger as well. It could have been a 
           tie, but we’ll never know. As Nick exits...

           THE STAGE CURTAIN RISES

           And now, LUCKY DOYLE brushes his fingers across the ivory of 
           a grand piano. He begins playing it up for a packed house. 
           The crowd claps -- they fucking love him.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        On Tuesdays, I fingered ivory at 
                        this decked down jazz joint off 
                        Grand. Isn’t a great gig, but it 
                        helps cover all you can eat sevens 
                        at the craps table.
           Lucky strokes a cord and nods to his saxophone player. 
           Applause erupts. He takes a pull off a glass of bourbon then 
           dives into another song - fingers moving so fast you’d think 
           this was a b-team version of Liberace.  

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        It was a good crowd. Well, all 
                        excluding the three gents at table 
                        8 waitin’ to plug me of course.

           WE ZOOM AROUND TO TABLE 8 - CAMERA ROTATES, FREEZING ON EACH 
           GANGSTER - BRANDING THEM AS #1, #2, and #3.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        They call ‘em the God Squad. Partly 
                        because they’re the loan out 
                        bruisers for the Catholic Syndicate. 
                        The other reason I’ll mention in a 
                        second. Point is, they been lookin’
                        to give me a led shower ever since 
                        my checks turned to rubber and I 
                        bounced at the big fight.

           Sweat lines the wrinkles in Lucky’s brow as we come to the 
           end of his performance -BUT- he quickly segues into an encore 
           of the same song. This is stalling at its finest.

           BACK ON: The gangsters patiently waiting at their table.

           Zooming slowly, we come face to face with #1. A slick greaser 
           in a custom pinstripe suit. EVEN HIS HAT HAS STRIPES. When he 
           turns his head down, they meet perfectly with those on his 
           suit. Meet PINSTRIPES.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Guy on the left is Pinstripes. He’s 
                        as queer as a glass slipper. Most 
                        fellas take him for a daisy, but 
                        that’s why they’re dead.

           ON #2. A BLACK MAN, late twenties, cleft chin. Muscular. 
           Toned. He wears a zipped up sweatshirt and a matching 
           headband. 

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        That looks like Knockout Jones. 
                        Three time undisputed champion - 
                        previous belt holder. He put Juan 
                        De Pompi in a box after the title 
                        bout a year back. I was in the 
                        fifth row.
                    (squinting)
                        At least I think that’s Knockout 
                        Jones.

           #3. THE POPE smiles viciously. Again, probably one of the 
           biggest thugs you’ll ever lay eyes on.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        And you’ve already met this ugly 
                        son of a bitch.
           BACK ON: Lucky in the middle of the SAME EXACT SONG. It 
           finally comes to end. The saxophone player stops as Lucky 
           tries to encore for a third time. 

                                 SAXOPHONE
                        Hey... We’ve done the encore three 
                        times now. My lips are numb.

           Lucky gives a sharp “FUCK YOU” stare to his partner.

                                 LUCKY
                        If you don’t play it again, Sam, 
                        I’m gonna shove that sax so far up 
                        your ass, you’ll have to pop the 
                        spit valve to take a leak.

           The saxophonist leads into another encore. But suddenly...

           HE DROPS like a ton of bricks on gravity. Lucky quickly looks 
           up to see Pinstripes aiming a SILENCED GUN, and it sends a 
           fierce ripple down his spine. Twice.

           THE CROWD GOES BALLISTIC. SERIOUSLY. THEY’RE OUT OF CONTROL.

           Lucky dodges behind the piano as a few silenced shots rip 
           through wood and wire. He kneels and closes his eyes. 

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        God squad reason #2. Even if you 
                        don’t believe in God, you’d better 
                        be prayin’ to someone that these 
                        fucks ain’t pinnin’ your tail.

           Lucky jumps off the stage, turns, and runs straight into the 
           presence of his killers. He dodges left in what seems like a 
           manageable escape -but- almost suddenly, he finds himself in 
           direct range of KNOCKOUT JONES.

           LUCKY’S POV: A RIGHT HOOK UNCOILS IN HIS FACE.

           BAM!

                                        SMASH TO BLACK:
                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Yep. That’s Knockout Jones.

           FADE IN:

           INT. ROOF TOP - FIASCO HEIGHTS - NIGHT

           Lucky is tied to a chair atop the skyscrapers of Fiasco 
           Heights. THE THREE GUNMEN dispersed around him.

           Pinstripes takes a seat in front of us. A fashionable man. He 
           has a European accent... smokes cloves... and, yes, he’s gay.

                                 PINSTRIPES
                        Hey Lucky, welcome to the last 
                        night of your life.
                                 LUCKY
                        Look, Pinstripes, I swear I’ll get 
                        ya the money...

                                 PINSTRIPES
                        Time to settle up. No more scams. 
                        No more deals. And no more of that 
                        orphan paper you been throwin’ at 
                        us for the past decade. This time 
                        we settle in cash.

                                 LUCKY
                        I gotta have more time. Gimme five
                        days.

           FREEZE FRAME

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Five. My favorite number. I do 
                        everything in fives. In fact, it’s 
                        the only stable recurring factor in 
                        my life. Superstition, ya know.

           INSERT QUICK MONTAGE:

           - Lucky sits at a bar. FIVE shots lined in front of him.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Like the five shots of whiskey I 
                        downed before the big fight.

           - Lucky cheering in the stands at the boxing match.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        The five minutes I actually 
                        attended the big fight.

           - Lucky’s sitting on the port o’potty from earlier. He stares 
           at five bullets and a revolver in his hands.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        And the five bullets I stared at 
                        for five hours after realizing I 
                        lost my ass when it was over.

           BACK ON: Pinstripes takes a puff from his clove. He stares at 
           a visible tattoo on Lucky’s forearm. It says: Let It Ride.

                                 PINSTRIPES
                        What’s your game, Lucky? What’s the 
                        one you “Let It Ride” on?

           Lucky bites his lip. No sense dying a humiliated man.

                                 PINSTRIPES (CONT’D)
                        C’mon. Is it blackjack? Poker? 
                        Maybe ya gotta fix on the Queen a’ 
                        Hearts?

           Inhale. Exhale.
                                 PINSTRIPES
                        I gotta game. I call it “Get 
                        Lucky”. ‘Course, you ain’t got 
                        nothing to play with, so I guess 
                        we’re bettin’ for your life.

                                 LUCKY
                        I’ve got it! Just give me ‘til...

           Pinstripes cuts him off and removes a pair of dice from his 
           pocket.

                        See, I like dice. You know why I 
                        like dice? Because they don’t lie. 
                        They can’t lie. So in the spirit of 
                        games, and the fact that we like 
                        playin’ ‘em, whatever number these 
                        dice spit out... that’s how many 
                        stories you’ll dive from.

           ZOOM POV: As Lucky glances over his shoulder. NOTHING BUT 
           GRAVITY. A dangerous realization sinks in as he finds the 
           legs of his chair AGAINST THE LEDGE.

                                 LUCKY
                        Oh, shit.... Please! DON’T DROP ME!

           Pinstripes shakes the dice in his hand, tauntingly.

                                 LUCKY (CONT’D)
                        OKAY -- I’ll get the 100 thousand!

                                 PINSTRIPES
                        And when we gonna see it?

                                 LUCKY
                        Tomorrow! I swear to ya.

                                 PINSTRIPES
                        Bravo. ‘Cause we don’t wanna kill 
                        ya, Luck. You’re an investment. 
                        That would be bad business. But if 
                        you don’t have the juice by noon 
                        sharp, our little game goes sudden 
                        death.

           He slaps Lucky, driving the point home.

                                 PINSTRIPES
                        You get the drift?

                                 LUCKY
                        Yeah. 

                                 PINSTRIPES
                        Good. And don’t take me for a Lucy. 
                        I’m double cream - double sugar, 
                        but that don’t make up for mean 
                        streaks. 
           Pinstripes flicks the clove at Lucky, and nods to Jones...

           Lucky grits his teeth as Knockout steps up. 

           DING. DING. An imaginary bells sounds over scene while Jones 
           winds up the right hook. Here it comes like a speeding...

                                            SMASH TO:

           EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

           ...CAR JETS PAST SCREEN IN A BLUR as Lucky does a triple axel 
           from it at 40 miles per hour. He hits the ground in a series 
           of barrel rolls and a mouthful of concrete. 

           In a half-conscious daze, he slowly sits up to catch the wind 
           that’s been knocked from him. And that’s the moment it hits 
           him. Literally. A NEWSPAPER slaps him square in the face. He  
           peels it off to reveal a picture of the robbed SAVINGS & LOAN.

           ROLLING SUB:           “THEN”

           TWO BODIES move in perfect cadence under the sheets. Shadows 
           shifting across the ceiling in steady motion. 

           Suddenly, a LATINO WOMAN rises from the sheets straddling 
           Nick. She moans aggressively. Bodies grinding. Harder now. 
           And as she comes, we...

           TIME CUT:              “NOW”

           ... to Nick sitting on the edge of the bed, buckling his 
           pants. His temporary female companion cradles him from 
           behind.

           Nick sets the POLAROID OF HOPE atop the night-stand.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Harley, I need the word out on this 
                        mug. She went MIA and I’m lookin’
                        to find her. Just see if any of the 
                        other gals know the face.

           Harley strokes her hand across his bare back. He has a 
           clearly visible scar. A BULLET WOUND.
                                 HARLEY
                        Is this the one from...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Yeah. That’s the one.

           Nick grabs his shirt - he continues dressing. 

           HARLEY moves into the light. The body, the lips... she’d be 
           perfect if not on double overtime.

                                 HARLEY
                        What’s this all about, Nicky? Say 
                        ya came back for me, and not just 
                        another good lay to notch up.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Like I said, it’s about a girl. 
                        Unfortunately, you’re not it.

           Harley grabs THE POLAROID and RIPS it in front of Nick’s face.

                                 HARLEY
                        I loved you once, ya know.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        That’s the problem, doll. Cupid

                        so do you if the money’s right.

                        You used to be a classy hustle,

                        spread ya like a stick of butter.

           Harley shoves Nick off of the bed.

                                 HARLEY
                        I thought you were dead, Nick!
                    (crying now)
                        You’ve known me for a liftetime.
                        Don’t treat me like I’m some cheap 
                        trick doing 9 to 5.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You are cheap, Harley. And those 
                        tricks are all you’ve got.

           Nick slides into his overcoat and goes for the door.

                                 HARLEY
                        No matter how many guys I fool 
                        with, you’re still the only man 
                        I’ve ever kissed.

           He pauses momentarily...
                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Well. That’s something.

           A few drops of rain split against the asphalt, signaling a 
           brief intermission in the hovering storm above.

           An anxious NEWSBOY runs to the corner with the morning’s 
           freshest headline. He lifts the paper over his head.

                                 NEWSBOY 
                        Extra, extra!! Savings and Loan

                        villainous traveling show. 

           Nick grabs a paper and flips the kid a quarter. He adjusts 
           his Fedora while browsing the front page.

                                 NEWSBOY

                        No sweat, kid.

           Nick takes the last drag from his cigarette and wedges the 
           paper inside his overcoat. Here comes the rain again.

           INT. ANNE’S SODA FOUNTAIN - NIGHT

           LUCKY, looking more unkempt than ever, shuffles a deck of 
           cards in his hand. He only looks up as Nick enters the shop. 

           He flips a card face up in his palm. It’s the JACK OF HEARTS. 
           He sighs and re-shuffles, it’s obviously not what he wanted. 

           CLOSE ON: A STREAM OF AMBER LIQUID flows into an icy mug. A 
           fresh layer of foam crests the rim, gliding down the glass 
           and over the hand holding it.
                                 ANNE
                        Well, look who’s back? And soaked 
                        to the bone I might add.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        It’s okay. I needed a shower.

           Anne (your “bubblegum gnawing”, prototypical diner chick) 
           slams the mug on the counter and plops in a scoop of ice 
           cream.

                                 ANNE
                        One root beer float. Your usual.

           Nick has a seat and sets down the damp paper.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Thanks Anne.

           ANGLE ON: THE PAPER. Same photo of the FISACO SAVINGS & LOAN 
           that Lucky saw earlier. HEADLINE READS: “ENCORE, ENCORE”.

           Nick tosses the paper aside and takes a long slug off the 
           float. He loves it - pops the cherry in his mouth.

           Now, he slides a NEW POLAROID of Hope over the counter.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Anne, you seen a gal come in here? 
                        About 5’9. Blue eyes. Reads like 
                        trouble if ya look past the blonde.

           Lucky suddenly perks up in his booth -- he begins to listen.

                                 ANNE
                    (re: photo)
                        Now that’s a catch. She your’s?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Once. Or twice.

           AND SUDDENLY - all the diner patrons go dead silent. Even the 
           jukebox dies. It’s like the entire place was just put on 
           mute. Every ear listening to the distant sounds of...

           AN ICE CREAM TRUCK

           A playful jingle that would seem harmless if not heralding 
           the presence of a killer. Each high-pitched note more deadly 
           than the last. This is a cruel calling card. A harsh melody 
           that serves as an open invitation to any challenge.

                                 ANNE
                        It’s that lunatic ice cream 
                        asshole. Has a dead eye for minors 
                        if ya follow. The pervert.

           Nick flips the paper to see FROSTY’S latest headline.
                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        And free publicity.

           ONE MOTHER in a corner booth grabs her children, holding them 
           tight. Another WOMAN at the pie rack brings her OVERWEIGHT 
           CHILD in close.

           Lucky pockets his deck and lowers into his booth. The other 
           patrons follow his lead and drop out of sight, holding their 
           breath in hopes of pure silence. That is, everyone except for 
           Nick...

           He calmly sits at the bar finishing his root beer float AS 
           THE ICE CREAM TRUCK CREEPS PAST THE FRONT WINDOWS.

           Anne slowly rises as the malicious tune trails off.

                                 ANNE
                        He’s lookin’ for trouble.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Capitol “T”.

           Nick finishes the last drop of his float. He slides the mug 
           across the bar -just as- the obese kid breaks from his 
           mother’s grasp and hauls ass out of the shop. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Oh my god - Tommy NO!!

           Nick turns to the window and watches the kid chase down the 
           ice cream truck. The vehicle screeches to a stop. 

                                 MOTHER
                        HELP! My baby! Somebody please help 
                        my baby!

           Anne gives Nick a look that says something like... “Get the 
           fuck off your ass and help the kid”.

           Nick shakes his head in regret, grabs the crucifix dangling 
           from his neck, and says the Cliff’s Notes version of a prayer. 

           He stands and turns to the counter.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Anne. Gimme the special.

           Anne smiles. She reaches under the counter and WHIPS OUT A 
           POLISHED S&W .38 SPECIAL. Sleek. Custom “J” frame. Solid 
           steel grips. She flips open the revolving cylinder.

                                 ANNE
                        Trigger’s been taken in. Quicker 
                        than a jackrabbit on roller skates. 
                        And she don’t miss neither. Two 
                        inch barrel could pinch a termite 
                        in the ass if it was lookin’ at ya
                        funny. Bad thing is... I only got 
                        one bullet.
           She stands a single HOLLOW POINT on the counter. Nick 
           hesitates for the fraction of a second.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Add it to my bill.

           Nick takes the gun and flips the chamber. He watches it spin 
           in his grip, then slings the chamber back into socket. Then 
           he looks at Anne and loads the bullet.

                                 NICK THE SAINT (CONT’D)
                        Fuckin’ fat kid and his ice cream.

           As he exits, Lucky slides over to the window and rips the 
           blinds apart in the anticipation of a showdown.

           INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - DAY

           The window slowly opens as fat kid approaches. He bluntly 
           demands his order. 

                                 FAT KID
                        Rocky Road. Double scoop.

           FROSTY eyes the child salaciously. White apron. Black bowtie.
           Paper vendor hat angled on his forehead. If it wasn’t for the 
           enormous scar down his cheek, he’d actually look the part.

           ANGLE ON: THE FREEZER. A HALF-FROZEN CORPSE crammed in amidst 
           the tubs of ice cream. Frosty brushes a limb aside and digs 
           his scoop into the carton of Rocky Road. 

           Frosty passes the ice cream through the window, just as...

                                 NICK THE SAINT (O.S.)
                        HEY KID -- SCRAM!!!

           Frosty comes to attention. His chapped lips curl into a 
           devilish smile. Here’s the challenge he’s been waiting for. 

           ANGLE ON: A SECOND FREEZER opens to reveal a styrofoam case 
           housing the dissembled parts of a TOMMY GUN. 

           EXT. FIASCO AVENUE - DAY

           A DROP OF SWEAT BREAKS ACROSS NICK’S TEMPLE.

           SUDDENLY, WE ZOOM INTO THE REAR DOORS OF THE TRUCK AS THEY 
           BURST OPEN IN FULL FUCKING FORCE!!!

           RAT-TAT-TAT... Mr. Frosty comes out in a blaze. The TOMMY GUN 
           spitting hot shells across the pavement. Muzzle flashing like 
           lighting in the palm of his hand.
           Nick runs for cover behind a beaten up CONTINENTAL as led 
           ricochets around him. Bullets everywhere! A haze of debris 
           surrounds us as ammo hisses overhead.

           Bits of shredded metal whiz by Nick’s face. Shards of glass 
           cascading over him as Frosty takes his cover apart. He ducks 
           as...

           POP! The tire explodes. Bullet holes just drilling the 
           automobile’s frame. Sparks ripping across the bumper as each 
           led point drives deeper into this vintage classic.

           Now, a pause... a momentary pause. The killer’s weapon 
           dispelling smoke into the atmosphere, its chamber churning 
           aggressively. He admires his work, we can it by the sick 
           glimmer in his eye.

           Nick staggers to his knee. Engine smoking over his left 
           shoulder. Glass still trickling from above. He uses the 
           moment to gather himself, but this is gonna get worse and he 
           damn well knows it.

           ANGLE ON: THE FAT KID. Dazed. Startled by the commotion. His 
           ice cream melting to the asphalt at his feet.

                                 NICK THE SAINT 
                    (signaling)
                        Kid! Move! Get outta the street!

           Mr. Frosty grits his teeth and lets it rip. The neighborhood 
           goes to hell! Bullets whizzing in every direction. Fragments 
           of brick and mortar come together in mid-air chaos.

           Frosty laughs... chime of the ice cream truck still ringing, 
           taunting, as all other noise falls away. 

           SLOW ON: Store fronts being dismantled by the utensil of a 
           hardened lunatic. The sinister jingle bringing a sense of art 
           to his destructive handiwork.

           Fat kid starts crying as the piercing noise of each bullet 
           strikes closer than the last. He’s paralyzed with fear...

           But, NICK MAKES HIS MOVE. He sprints across the intersection 
           and grabs the boy by the collar. Lifting him, he swings the 
           kid under his arm and dives behind a black ‘37 FORD... a 
           trail of ammo sparking at his heels. 

           Nick holds the kid tight in his grasp -while- Frosty paints 
           another fresh coat of bullet holes. Until...

           Another pause. The ice cream man is ready to reload -BUT- 
           Nick doesn’t hesitate for one fuckin’ second. He jumps from 
           the steaming car, aims the .38 special, AND...

           BAM!

           THE SHOT ECHOES...

           A PAPER ICE CREAM HAT FLOATS IN THE WIND...
           THE GLEE JINGLE CONTINUES TO CHIME as...

           THE ICE CREAM MAN DROPS TO HIS KNEES. His head sinks - a 
           fresh bullet smoking from it. Blood trickles down his white 
           apron as he falls. HARD.

           Local children pour onto the street -- it’s utter shock. 
           Witnesses to the death of a childhood landmark, the ice cream 
           man face down in a puddle of blood. 

           The frantic mother bolts out of the coffee shop and embraces 
           her child.

                                 MOTHER
                        Oh, baby! You’re safe! My baby!

           Nick slips the “special” into his waistline. Barrel still 
           sizzling - smoke surging in his face. He  strikes a stoic 
           pose and signs the cross. His overcoat flowing in the wind.

           A SINGLE CAMERA BULB FLASHES. 

           He makes his way through the commotion unperturbed. An 
           undaunted killer, unassuming savior.

           NOW - A SERIES OF BULBS FLASHING. This is tomorrow’s 
           headline... but Nick doesn’t care. He just presses forward, 
           out of sight. 

                                          DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. FIASCO HOTEL - NICK’S ROOM - NIGHT

           And we’re back at The Fiasco Hotel -- kind of place where 
           scumbags get nightly discounts and termites are rent free.

           Nick enters his disheveled room. Crucifix hung over the bed. 
           Choppy bits of neon light spilling through the blinds. The 
           slow twirl of a ceiling fan cuts the shadows perfectly.

           He grabs a bottle of whiskey off the mini-bar and takes a 
           pull. Here’s where we see the nerves shaken up from the 
           showdown with Frosty. The Saint is human after all.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        And this is where I come in.

           And without anticipation...

                                 LUCKY (O.S.)
                        I’ve seen this girl.

           Nick rips “the special” from his belt and spins to find... 
           LUCKY DOYLE holding up THE POLAROID he left at the diner.
                                 LUCKY
                        I spotted her at a bare knuckle 
                        brawl last night. And I think I can 
                        help you find her.

           Nick lowers the gun.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Who are you?

                                 LUCKY
                        The name’s Doyle. Lucky Doyle.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Yeah, I’ve heard of you. You’re that 
                        PI who never closed a case, right?

                                 LUCKY
                        You kiddin’ me? One more solved gig 
                        and I get my own stationary.

           In a flash, Nick grabs Lucky by the collar and throws him face-
           first against the wall -- gun firm to the back of his head.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I hope you’re not prone to lying.

                                 LUCKY
                        It’s no fib! I seen her at that 
                        fight - she was gettin’ shoved 
                        around by some mysterious figure.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Did you get a face?

                                 LUCKY
                        No. Hence the “mysterious figure”.
                    (beat)
                        Look. If I saw her again, I could 
                        definitely slip the tags on. Trust 
                        me, I never forget a face.

           Nick lets Lucky go, but still keeps the gun trained on him. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Why’d you break in here?

                                 LUCKY
                        I saw you at the diner earlier.  
                        Watched you put the heat to that 
                        chocolate-chipped fuck. Just 
                        thought that maybe we could strike 
                        a deal.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Deal? So there’s an exchange at the 
                        bottom of your glass?
                                 LUCKY
                        That’s why I always keep it half 
                        empty.
                    (beat)
                        I can come up with the girl 
                        guaranteed. I’ll just strap on my 
                        gumshoes, twirl a few moustaches, 
                        and whalla... one pocket full of 
                        miracles. See, missin’ dames are my 
                        bread and butter. And the fact I 
                        got her digits... her license plate 
                        digits that is... don’t hurt the 
                        case. She drives a “royal flush”. 
                        10-King-Queen-Jack-Ace. It’s pie.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Why do I feel like you’re selling 
                        used lemonade?  
                    (beat)
                        What do you want?

           Lucky smiles -- pearly whites in full glow.

                                 LUCKY
                        Protection. For 24 hours. You keep my 
                        back clean, and I’ll be your private 
                        dick to brush the streets with.

           Nick takes another swig.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I’m listening.

                                 LUCKY
                        I owe The Catholics fives stacks of 
                        high society, and they gave me 24 
                        ticks to come up shinin’. You keep 
                        me alive until I can say “payback”, 
                        and I’ll finger your bad guys.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Catholics? Rough crowd. They put a 
                        trinity on your heel?

                                 LUCKY
                        That’s the pickle. I got a 
                        threesome lookin’ to baptize me in 
                        the Rawley River. The God Squad.
                    (beat)
                        So, whatdaya say? You in?

           Nick thinks for a second. Another swig. More thought. Then...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You’ll need to sign a CT-17.
                    (off blank stare)
                        A contract. Just so I’m not liable 
                        if... ya know... you die. I’ll stiff 
                        arm the wrath of God as long as your 
                        shufflin’ the right cards.
           Now, Nick notices Lucky’s bruised face. A speck of blood runs 
           off of his cheek and trickles onto the carpet. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT 
                        Would you mind not bleeding on the 
                        rug?

                                 LUCKY
                        Oh yeah. Sure.
                    (steps aside)
                        It is a nice rug. Is it Persian?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Yes. I won it at the camel races 
                        right after I fucked my genie on a 
                        magic carpet. No you idiot, it’s 
                        not Persian! There’s a security 
                        deposit on the room. That’s all.
                    (beat)
                        Don’t be a numbnuts, or I’ll dial 
                        411 on my own.

           Lucky has a despondent moment while Nick grabs a towel from 
           the bathroom door.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Here. Freshen up.

           Nick tosses it over. Lucky dabs his wound, hands trembling.

                                 LUCKY
                        I can’t believe you were about to 
                        shoot me. That was traumatic.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You broke into my room. Were you 
                        expecting a firm handshake and 
                        meaningful conversation?
                    (a beat)
                        Besides, I didn’t do it.

                                 LUCKY
                        You’re a real sweetheart.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Yet.

           Nick loads a DESSERT EAGLE and tucks it under the pillow of 
           his bed. Then he removes a GLOCK 31 from his sock drawer and 
           holsters it along with “The Special”. Lucky just watches.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Now that we’re done swappin’
                        details, there are just a few 
                        things I’ll need to go over.
                    (ADD)
                        I’m famished. Do you like Thai?
           INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Nick and Lucky enter the elevator as the doors open. Nick 
           pushes the ground floor button...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You have 24 hours to come up with 
                        $100,000... right?

                                 LUCKY
                        Right.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Wrong. You have 21 hours. I break 
                        for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
                        During those times, you’re solo.

           The doors shut.

           EXT. HOTEL PARKING - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Nick and Lucky walking out of the hotel...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I don’t like too much attention, so 
                        you’ll have to be invisible while 
                        I’m here. Translation: just keep 
                        your ugly mug off the streets until 
                        we’re done solving my puzzle.
                    (he stops at valet)
                        I don’t have a car. You drive.

           INT. LUCKY’S RIDE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Nick and Lucky driving in a beat up clunker, absolute shit...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        For the most part, you are an 
                        amateur. I’m the professional. That 
                        means I’ll be the only one dealing 
                        with guns, knives and other things 
                        that kill people. Turn here.

           INT. RESTAURANT LOBBY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Nick and Lucky enter the lobby of a busy Thai restaurant. 
           They approach the hostess...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Never, and by that I mean never, 
                        tell anyone that we’re involved. 
                        It’s called trust. And if you break 
                        that trust, our contract becomes 
                        null and I walk. 
                    (to hostess)
                        Hi. Reservation under Weinberg.
           INT. RESTAURANT BOOTH - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Nick slurps up a noodle from his Pad Thai platter...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        If I take a bullet for you, which 
                        I’d rather not do under our current 
                        agreement, I’ll have to charge a 
                        small fee. Pain & grievances. If 
                        you have an aversion to that clause 
                        in any form... tough shit.

           Lucky forces a smile and downs a glass of green tea. His 
           expression says everything...”THE FUCK? I just hired Tony 
           Montana to watch my back”.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        So. Are you good with the terms?

                                 LUCKY
                        Well. That whole pain & grievance 
                        thing? I’m expecting to get shot at, 
                        quite a bit actually, so your fee 
                        could add up to 1/3 of my debt. 
                    (thinking)
                        Do you have a payment plan?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Yes. You pay when I say you pay.

                                 LUCKY
                        I can live with that.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Good. Then you’ve got a deal. I’ll 
                        be your rear view until we find the 
                        dame. 

                                 LUCKY
                        Okay. So. Isn’t there a contract I 
                        needed to sign? A... CT17... or 
                        whatever?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Nah. It’s all verbal. We’re good.
                    (beat)
                        Are you gonna finish your spring 
                        roll?

           Lucky looks a little perplexed as Nick scoops the last 
           remaining spring roll from his plate.

                                 LUCKY
                        Just wondering. Why do they call you 
                        “The Saint”?
                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Don’t know. For someone who kills 
                        people, I guess I’m just a really 
                        nice fuckin’ guy.

                                 LUCKY
                        There’re rumors about you. Trained 
                        by thieves, protected by God... 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        And on Sundays, I walk on water 
                        between the hours of 2 and 4.
                    (now deadpan)
                        Don’t believe everything you hear.

                                 LUCKY
                        You ain’t some chump with an itchy 
                        finger. That’s all I’m sayin’.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Stop. You’re making me blush.
                    (to passing waitress)
                        Can you bring the check to him 
                        please?

           Lucky reaches for his wallet as Nick lights up a fresh smoke.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        So. Where do we start?

                                             CUT TO:

           EXT. BLACK MARKETPLACE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Welcome to the black market. A street bazaar so big it makes 
           K-mart look like a garage sale. Anything can be purchased 
           here for a price: Arms, drugs, illegal immigrants. Anything.

           We PAN through the masses to find our guys. Lucky is shaking 
           hands with the PERSIAN OWNER of a small flower kiosk. But the 
           slant is... there are no flowers here. Just a smorgasbord of 
           illegal horticulture. 

           This boutique is brimming with coca plants, mushrooms, and 
           all the marijuana you can imagine. Winter Koning. White 
           Widow. B-52. Northern Lights. All labeled appropriately in a 
           mom & pop organization that could make the FDA shit bricks.

           Lucky shows the owner HOPE’S PHOTO, but Persian shakes a 
           negative and takes another hit of the Chef’s special. Now, 
           Lucky changes angles and leads us to a small newsstand nearby.

                                 LUCKY
                        Who is this girl anyway? 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Long story. Let’s just find her 
                        before I read you the bio.
           Lucky nods and turns to FRONTPAGE LOU. An older guy, mid-
           fifties, sits reading an issue of LIFE MAGAZINE.

                                 LUCKY
                        Frontpage Lou. What’s the news?

                                 LOU
                        Lucky! It’s been a few days. You 
                        come lookin’ for the scores again?

                                 LUCKY
                        Not this time, Lou. I’m gettin’
                        outta the number business. Direct 
                        orders from God.

                                 LOU
                        Yeah, I heard he has an eye on you. 
                        So that being the case -- I’ll keep 
                        the news to myself.

           Lou turns over the sports section of the most recent paper.

                                 LUCKY
                        Thanks. I actually came for 
                        somethin’ else, Lou... 

           Lucky whips out a tattered napkin with digits scribbled 
           across it. Nick watches curiously over his shoulder.

                                 LUCKY
                        ...These digits belong to a license 
                        plate. I need to know whose. Can ya
                        play the numbers for me?

                                 LOU
                        Yeah, I can play. I’ll flip ya the 
                        fresh headline in fifty ticks to an 
                        hour. 

                                 LUCKY
                        You’re a gem, Lou. A diamond in the 
                        rough without the diamond.

                                 LOU
                    (smiles)
                        Let’s just hope you’re outta that 
                        slump next time I see ya. Get ya
                        swingin’ for the fences again.

                                 LUCKY
                        But Lou, that’s what got me in the 
                        slump to begin with. 

           Lucky winks to his old friend and turns away with Nick. And 
           as they walk, we’ll pass through a small construction zone -- 
           about 10 PUERTO RICANS paving a sidewalk with fresh cement.

                                 LUCKY
                    (to Nick)
                        See. Easy as watchin’ tits shake.
                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Well. If you’re comparing the miracle 
                        of shaking tits to spending time with 
                        you, I’d much prefer the tits 10 to 1. 
                        Although, a case can be made that you 
                        are in fact an enormous boob. With an 
                        astoundingly profane vocabulary.

                                 LUCKY
                        More like vulgarly eloquent.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You wouldn’t know eloquent if they 
                        fed you pages from a dictionary.

                                 LUCKY
                        You’re just a rotten son of a 
                        bitch, aren’t you?

           SUDDENLY, Nick has a gun to his head. AND NOW, Lucky does 
           too. All 10 “ARMED” CONSTRUCTION WORKERS surrounding them.

                NICK THE SAINT
                                         LUCKY
           Fuck.
                                 Fuck.

           Nick puts a hand on the cement truck as the Puerto Ricans 
           order him to step over the wet sidewalk, and into the dark. 
           And what we’ll notice... is that he has casually left a SMALL 
           BLINKING DEVICE on the churning truck.

                                 PUERTO RICAN
                        Usted dado que coge, gatito!

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Sorry, I don’t speak French.

                                 THE MORMON (O.S.)
                    (very articulate)
                        I believe that he said you’re about 
                        to die. With lots of profanities 
                        sprinkled in for good measure.

           Nick looks up to see MICK THE MORMON approaching out of the 
           darkness. And we can see the meaning of the word “NEMESIS” 
           just by the hatred sparkling in his glare.

                                 THE MORMON
                        Welcome back, partner. Or, I guess ex-
                        partner is more politically correct. 
                        I was never really one for details.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Details like stabbing a friend in 
                        the back. You mean “actual” details 
                        like that, right Mormon?

                                 LUCKY
                    (whipsers)
                        Mormon? Mick The Mormon?
           Mormon steps into Nick’s personal space, pops a stick of 
           bubblegum in his mouth, and blows a HUGE bubble.

                                 THE MORMON
                        You’ve got a sack of brass coming 
                        back here, Nicky. But that big 
                        swingin’ dick always draws a crowd.

           Mormon lifts up an issue of the FIASCO TIMES evening edition -
           - a picture of NICK’S SHOWDOWN AT THE DINER covers the page 
           1. Headline reads: “THE SECOND COMING: SAINT RETURNS”.

                                 THE MORMON
                        But I’m not here for reunions, so 
                        I’ll make this short and painful. 
                        You don’t get out of Fiasco 
                        Heights, Nick. You die here, and 
                        your soul dies here with you.  

           Nick tries to make a move, but the Puerto Rican Workers click 
           their hammers. This is serious, and about to get interesting.

                                 THE MORMON
                        Careful now! We got a real life 
                        Mexican stand-off here, aye Nick?
                    (off Nick’s reserve)
                        C’mon. Where’s your sense of humor?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Never heard of him.

           The Mormon begins screwing a silencer onto his pistol. 

                                 THE MORMON
                        Thing is, you can’t quit The 
                        Franchise whenever ya want. No paid 
                        vacations in our line of work, Saint 
                        Nick. 
                    (beat)
                        You know what a mandate is?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Other than a noun, it’s the last 
                        thing you’ll say before I kill 
                        everyone here holding a gun.

                                 THE MORMON
                        Don’t be silly - look around. You don’t 
                        have a spic’s chance. Literally. And 
                        they’ve got hedges to trim in the 
                        morning, so let’s expedite this thing. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        10 seconds.

                                 THE MORMON
                        Mandate. “An authoritative command 
                        handed down from the most supreme...

           BEEP.... BEEP... BEEP...
           And, The Mormon turns to the cement truck just as...

           KA-BLOOOM! A WAVE OF WET CEMENT BLOWS ACROSS THE SCENE!

           Nick grabs Lucky and ducks behind a pile-on as cement eructs 
           overhead with tsunami force. Glass shatters... metal debris 
           flies overhead... car alarms sounding off everywhere.

           Drops of cement rain down like snow flurries as the chaos 
           settles. And that’s exactly when...

           Nick grabs the gun from his belt and rises to find 10 PUERTO 
           RICANS molded into place by a ton of wet cement. NONE OF THEM 
           CAN MOVE FAST ENOUGH, turning in what seems like slow motion.

           BAM. BAM. BAM. Nick goes around the scene, putting a fresh 
           bullet in each man with a gun. It’s the easiest round of 
           target practice anyone’s ever taken aim to.

           He stops. Each victim slumped in a coat of drying cement, 
           like salt pillars streaked in blood. But THE MORMON is gone.

                                 LUCKY
                        FRICK MY ASS! I can’t believe...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Just follow me. These are only the 
                        early birds.

           Nick takes off his “wet” overcoat, it clanks to the ground 
           with a THUD. He grabs Lucky’s arm and pulls him along.

                                 NICK THE SAINT (CONT’D)
                        There’s bound to be more of them, 
                        they always travel in packs.

           And on the period of that sentence - MACHINE GUNS ECHO!!! 

                                 LUCKY
                        Sounds about right!

           Nick and Lucky race back into THE BLACK MARKETPLACE, a poker 
           table goes over as they begin tumbling through a series of 
           booths to make their escape. A HOARD OF GUNMEN BEHIND THEM.

           BOOTH > AFTER BOOTH > AFTER BOOTH > AFTER BOOTH > AFTER BOOTH

           Finally, they plow through an assemblage of Arabs admiring 
           the newest dirty-bomb prototypes... and into safe passage.

           EXT. FIASCO BOULEVARD - CONTINUOUS

           On the street, Lucky hunches over to catch his breath. 

                                 LUCKY
                        I swear, I’m coming. One sec.

           Nick turns to his pathetic (and unlikely) partner.
                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        No stopping!

           AND LUCKY VOMITS. Everywhere. The pink kind of vomit that 
           says your lungs haven’t seen exercise in years.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Tell me you’re fucking joking.
                    (re: puking)
                        Just lemme know when we can 
                        continue RUNNING FOR OUR LIVES!!

           Lucky looks up with tear filled eyes, takes a deep breath. 
           Then pukes up another batch. Round two.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Oh Jesus. I don’t believe this.

                                 LUCKY
                        Okay - I think I’m good.

           Nick and Lucky bolt across the street free and clear. Well, 
           for at least a second or two -- or however long it took for 
           those THREE FORD MODEL A TUDORS TO SCREAM AROUND THE CORNER!

           Lucky jumps forward as rapid fire clicks at his heel. In the 
           near distance, Nick finds our getaway. It’s coming right for 
           us. It’s... 

           THE FIASCO HEIGHTS TROLLEY  

           Nick hops onboard and lifts Lucky up - a supped up TUDOR only 
           a few yards behind and gaining.

           Lucky pans the trolley... THE ENTIRE THING IS PACKED WITH 
           SENIOR CITIZENS. Obvious tourists on leave from the 
           retirement home. Cameras begin clicking, each tourist wears a 
           sweatshirt that says, “I SURVIVED FIASCO HEIGHTS”.

                                 LUCKY
                        Yes. Let’s think positive.

           THE TOUR GUIDE drops his mic and ducks for cover as...

           RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT. Fresh ammunition dances across the 
           trolley’s exterior sending the tourists into a frenzy.

           VROOOM - THE TUDORS ARE CLOSING IN FROM BEHIND.

           Nick grabs a hand rail and leans off the trolley. HE UNLOADS 
           HELL into the first vehicle. No luck. Time to focus. He 
           steadies -- finger taught on the trigger -- and fires...

           CRACK! The bullet pierces the windshield. DIRECT HIT! The 
           driver’s head goes off like a pinata. Tudor spins out of 
           control - tires giving way - and flips across the pavement. 

           Nick smiles as the vehicle continues to mash across the 
           asphalt. THE HOOD BLOWS. ENGINE IGNITES. BOOOOOOM!
           ONE TOURIST SNAPS A PICTURE. He wears hearing aids -- thinks 
           it’s all part of the tour. Next...

           TUDOR #2 speeds up on the right, getting even with the 
           trolley. Nick fires across the interior, but he only gets one 
           shot off before TUDOR #3 speeds up on the left. HE’S FLANKED!

           NOW - Nick steps into the middle of the trolley, reloads. He 
           takes in a breath of sheer valiance -THEN- aims both guns in 
           opposite directions and goes to work. BAM. BAM.

           One round in, TUDOR #2 peels from its lane and SLAMS HEAD-ON 
           INTO AN ONCOMING FOURTEEN WHEELER. The collision sends a 
           fireball the size of a boulder into the trolley’s rear... 

           Force alone rips us from the main line and jars the small 
           trolley right off its track. Live electricity spews from an 
           underground conduit as the car goes free-wheeling down the 
           hilly streets of central Fiasco. 

           BAM! GUNFIRE CONTINUES RAGING FROM THE ROGUE TROLLEY. BAM!

           TUDOR #3 pulls back and falls in behind the trolley. A 
           MARKSMAN steps onto the exterior floor panel and readies a 
           TOMMY GUN in his grasp. 

           Nick continues firing - THE TROLLEY PICKING UP SPEED NOW - 
           senior citizens screaming as the runaway cable car crashes 
           through a string of parking meters. Then...

           MARKSMAN GOES POSTAL! Nick holds firm as bullets graze his 
           head. He isn’t dodging them, merely being thrown from their 
           path as the trolley veers right, then left, then right again. 

           No more games. Saint edges around the back of the trolley and 
           takes the winning shot. An element of surprise at full 
           vantage as his bullet takes the Marksman’s hat off, just 
           happens most of his head is still in it.

           TUDOR #3 swirves violently, then regains speed.

                                 TOUR GUIDE (O.S.)
                        END OF THE ROAD!

           Nick turns to discover the runaway trolley speeding 
           towards...

           HANGMAN’S PARK

           HE SIGNS THE CROSS...

           EXT. HANGMAN’S PARK - NIGHT

           A quiet setting. Cobblestone bridge stretching across a steep 
           decline filled with pine and cedar. White-capped moss swaying 
           within the rock of a sarconic arch. 
           We pan up to a wooden sign - HANGMAN’S PARK - which instantly 
           SPLINTERS TO PIECES as our trolley explodes over the 
           cobblestone breaking 100.

           TROLLEY NOSEDIVES THROUGH THE TREES AS WE WHIP DOWNHILL. And 
           you can bet your ass there’s been a heart attack by now.

           NICK’S POV ON: THE BREAK LINE HANGING FROM THE EXIT PANEL.

           Nick pushes forward, velocity working against him as the 
           trolley goes red on the speedometer.

           AND WE’RE COMING TO A BODY OF FROZEN WATER. HANGMAN’S POND. 
           It’s growing on us like we’re free falling through the trees.

           PICKING UP MORE SPEED NOW! 110. 112. 114. 

           Nick pulls himself to the rear cabin - impact no more than 40 
           yards away. He reaches for the break line, THE THIN EMERGENCY 
           WIRE DANGLING FROM THE EXIT PANEL.

           WE’RE PLOWING OVER SMALL PINES. FASTER. FASTER. FASTER...

           NICK GRABS THE WIRE -AND- RIPS IT BACK! Pads grind as the 
           trolley digs into the dirt. We’re slowing. Slowing. Slowing. 
           Until...

           SMASH! The Trolley ping pongs between two oak trees and slams 
           into a log. Inertia hits like a crushing stab in the back as 
           the cable car lifts into the air, sailing forward... and 
           lands on the ice like a hulk of iron. Now, all passengers are 
           thrown forward as the trolley SPINS OUT OF CONTROL....

           TUDOR #3 pursues down the hill and onto the ice - firing from 
           behind the turning trolley.

           SCREAMS from every angle as the trolley spins at 360 degrees 
           with speed gaining. Nick holds his composure and continues to 
           fire at the final Tudor, opening a new line of sight every 
           time the trolley makes a full rotation.

           TUDOR GLIDES ACROSS THE ICE DODGING BULLETS - GETTING CLOSER!

           And TUDOR #3 slams into the rear of the trolly, knocking Nick 
           over the rail and onto the Tudor’s hood. THUD. Soon, the car 
           loses control -and now- TUDOR #3 is doing axles on the ice 
           too. Both vehicles twirling a dangerous tango.

           Nick slides down the hood and grabs onto the front grill. He 
           tilts his gun over the hood and PUTS A FULL CLIP INTO THE 
           WINDSHIELD. Brain matter sprays the windows as he puts a few 
           passengers to rest. But then...

           A FINAL THUG rises from the sunroof with a hot grenade in his 
           palm, but -BAM- Nick puts him back in his seat before it has 
           a chance to roll off his fingers.

           Nick immediately drops from the grill - lands on his back - 
           and puts his chin to the ice just as the Tudor glides right 
           over him. He safely slides out from under it, as...
           BOOOOOM! Chunks of ice go sky high as the Tudor detonates in 
           a ferocious explosion 15 yards away. The pond shakes! Ice 
           cracking now... everywhere... all around us.

           Nick jumps up as the pond under him begins to give way. He 
           attempts to tip-toe, carefully skipping over every new crack.

           BACK ON LUCKY

           Gritting his teeth as the trolley approaches the other side 
           of the pond. THIS BUNDLE OF RUNAWAY NOSTALGIA IS HEADED FOR 
           COLLISION. And here... it... comes...

                                            ANGLE ON:

           A FULL FRONTAL OF THE TROLLEY -- seconds before it slams into 
           the embankment FIRING LUCKY THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD like 
           regurgitated food. He hits the snow in a tremendous barrel 
           roll, leaving a path of frosted leaves fluttering in his wake. 

           Now, a few of the passengers stumble off the catastrophe with 
           minor cuts and bruises.

                                 FAT OLD WOMAN
                        I want my five motherfuckin’
                        dollars back!

                                 HEARING AID GUY
                        What?

           Lucky brushes some snow from his jacket, and turns to see 
           NICK UP TO HIS WAIST IN HANGMAN’S POND. He obviously didn’t 
           quite make it.

           Lucky spits a ball of frozen dirt from his mouth and runs to 
           pull Nick (chivering to the bone) from the water.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                    (teeth chattering)
                        D-d-don’t shay a w-w-w-word.

           Nick limps off through the park, agitated. Lucky follows. 

                                          DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. OUR SHEPHERD OF PEACE - CONTINUOUS

           A small cemetery. And just past it, Nick and Lucky stand at 
           the foot of an enormous sanctuary. Bats flutter through a 
           broken stained-glass window as Nick pounds on the door.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Sanctuary.

                                 LUCKY
                        Seriously, what are we doin’ here? 
                        I don’t do religion past midnight.
                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Sanctuary! Sanctuary!

           And the door slowly opens revealing a short, bald monk in a 
           velvet nightgown. 

                                 MONSEIGNEUR
                        Nick? Nick the Saint, is that you?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I’m back, Monseigneur. And I 
                        brought a vendetta back with me. 
                    (beat)
                        I need to borrow some equipment.

           INT. OUR SHEPARD OF PEACE - CONTINUOUS

           CLICK. The Monseigneur twists a SMALL CRUCIFIX beside the 
           organ, lifting the BAPTISMAL WALL to reveal a floor-to-
           ceiling armory. If it kills people, you’ll find it here. 

                                 MONSEIGNEUR
                        Take what you need, for there is 
                        always favor in the hands of the 
                        faithful.

           Lucky’s in awe as Nick straps up. He swings a silenced AK-47
           over his shoulder as Monseigneur approaches with TWO LARGE 
           SHOTGUNS. Both are tricked up, barrels sawed down to 7” with 
           R.I.P engraved in gunmetal across each side. 

                                 MONSEIGNEUR
                        How about twins?

           Nick grabs the guns -just before- the ridiculous ringtone to 
           Lucky’s cell goes off. He quickly hushes it, answers.

                                 LUCKY
                    (into phone)
                        Lou, what’s the headline?

           Monseigneur carries in a fresh change of clothes. Nick 
           quickly throws on a crisp shirt and a clean overcoat.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Bless you, Monseigneur. 

                                 LUCKY (O.S.)
                        We’ve got the plates!

           Nick turns to Lucky, undivided attention.

                                 LUCKY
                        They’re registered to one Patrick 
                        McBanister. You know the guy?

           Shock falls over Nick’s face... just for a second... then 
           it’s quickly replaced by 100% pissed-off rage & fury.
                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        C’mon, let’s move!

           Nick pulls DELI’S CARD from his pocket, and...

                                         SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

                        tracks?

                                 NICK THE SAINT

           Lucky fastens his seatbelt...

                                 LUCKY
                        Okay, so, I’ve got a few questions 
                        in my pocket. Heavy questions. 
                        Lemme kick-off by askin’ who just 
                        tried to kill you? Because now, and 
                        this is just my assumption here, 
                        but I’m pretty sure they wanna kill 
                        me too.

                                 NICK THE SAINT

           EXT. MCBANISTER’S PLACE - THE SUBURBS - NIGHT

           It’s the almost perfect neighborhood. Lemonade stands. 
           Trimmed hedges. Picket fences on every corner. Just ignore 
           the fact that it’s all covered in graffiti. This is gang 
           turf. 

           Nick sprints toward McBanister’s home. The gate is open - 
           front door ajar. He pulls his gun and enters with caution.
           INT. MCBANISTER’S PLACE - NIGHT

           The insides have been turned over. Every drawer, every shelf, 
           every room has been ransacked like some burglars were in for 
           a layover.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Fuck me!

           ANGLE ON: MCBANISTER’S BODY LYING ON THE LIVING ROOM FLOOR.

           Nick kneels down in a pool of blood, lifts McBanister’s head. 

           Lucky enters to discover A BODY GUARD hanging from a ceiling 
           fan, corpse circling the room from a NOOSE.

                                 LUCKY
                        Welcome to casa de “what the fuck’s
                        goin’ on here”?!?

           McBanister coughs up some blood. He’s been stabbed a few 
           times in the chest, shredded like a bowl of coleslaw.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Where is she, Pat? Tell me. Please!

           McBanister can barely move his lips. He points to a bookshelf 
           in the living room.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        What? What is it...?

           Nick tries to pinpoint what McBanister is aiming for.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I don’t see... was the girl here, 
                        Pat? 
                    (pleading)
                        She has a case with her. Where is 
                        it? I need it! Was she here!?!

           McBanister shakes his head, YES.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Where do I find her? Tell me. Come 
                        on, McBanister! Where?!?

           McBanister starts to talk, but all we can make out is the 
           gurgling of blood in his throat....

                                 MCBANISTER
                        Find...the... safe.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        What safe?

           McBanister struggles.
                                 MCBANISTER
                        Will never <gurgle> open. 
                    (and he smiles)
                        Swa...swallowed <gurgle>... key.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Where? What’s inside?

           And on the few remaining breathes he has left:

                                 MCBANISTER
                        Sa.. sa... sal...va...tion.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Salvation?

           McBanister shakes his head, YES again and for the last time.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        What does that mean?

           But it’s useless, we’re not getting any more out of this 
           dirtbag. He’s gone. Blood trickles from his mouth.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        He’s dead.

           Lucky stares at the hanging bodyguard, churning.

                                 LUCKY
                        Join the club. There’s dead folks 
                        decked all over the joint. This 
                        one’s a great centerpiece -- really 
                        livens the place up.

           Nick signs the cross over McBanister’s body. Final Respects 
           and all that jazz.

                                 LUCKY
                        What were they lookin’ for? Must be 
                        somethin’ of value. Value enough to 
                        hole punch that poor sap and dig 
                        for gold spots.

           Nick walks over to the bookshelf - there’s a book out of 
           place. A GIDEON BIBLE. Nick opens it to the bookmark, where, 
           we’ll notice the cut-out of a skeleton key in it’s pages. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Salvation.

           Now, Nick stoops down to find something of interest. And, 
           “DING”... THE WORD CLUE appears over AN EMPTY KETCHUP PACKET. 

           Nick looks it over. Touches it to his tongue.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Ketchup.

                        Mystery’s still the word, but as far 
                        as clues go, this one’s a keeper.

                                 LUCKY
                        So we’ve got a lead?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        McBanister used to be a freelance 
                        trigger in Doughboy’s pocket. 
                        Lately, he’s been clockin’ in for 
                        The Catholics. Total switch-hitter.
                    (thinking)
                        Between the two syndicates, there’s 
                        either a power play in the works, or 
                        they’re both after the same thing.

                                 LUCKY
                        You’re gal and her goody bag?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Right.

           NOW -- POLICE SIRENS SCREAM FROM THE DISTANCE!

           Lucky rushes to the window as AN ENTIRE SQUAD OF POLICE CARS 
           SURROUND THE HOME. Each car has #52 painted on the hood.

                                 LUCKY
                        We’re patsy pot pie.

           Nick pulls his pistol and peers out the window.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        The 52nd. It’s a set up.
                    (lowering blinds)
                        I’d back away from the window if I 
                        were you. They’re “criminal” with a 
                        Capitol One -- entire precinct is 
                        bankrolled by The Franchise.

                                 LUCKY
                        Great. There’s dirty bacon on the 
                        menu...

           CRACK. A WARNING SHOT RIPS THROUGH THE GLASS.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Right. SO GET AWAY FROM THE WINDOW!

           EXT. MCBANISTER’S CUL-DE-SAC - CONTINUOUS

           Deli raises his arms as a few standard issue Berettas are 
           thrown in his face.

                                 DELI
                        Don’t count me in. All I did was 
                        leave the meter runnin’.
           INT. MCBANISTER’S PLACE - CONTINUOUS

           Nick adjusts his Fedora and takes the safety off his gun.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Way I pitch it, we’re both swimmin’
                        in the same hot water.

           CRASH -as- a GAS CANNISTER projects through the window. Nick 
           watches as it hovers between our leads in SLOW MOTION -- 
           SKULL AND CROSSBONES spinning at it passes.

                                 LUCKY
                        Okay. We’ve got gas...

           BOOM...SPHISSS! The cannister destructs on impact. Lucky/Nick 
           cover their mouths and stay below the smoke.

           NOW - FOOTSTEPS ON THE ROOF. Nick fires into the ceiling. WE 
           HEAR A BODY THUD, SLIDE, AND DROP PAST THE WINDOW.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Not sure about you, but I don’t 
                        look good in frames. Let’s get the 
                        fuck outta here.

           Nick tears open a breaker box on the wall and flips a fuse. 
           He kills the lights. Well, all of them except for another 
           BLINKING DEVICE that he’ll attached above the front door.  

           NICK THROWS MCBANISTER’S BODY OVER HIS SHOULDER and peeks out 
           the rear window. Quietly estimating the distance to an open 
           garage in the distance... his guess is about fifty feet.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        My guess is about 50 feet.
                    (beat)
                        You ever wire a car?

           EXT. MCBANISTER’S PLACE - NIGHT

           O’TOOLE -RED HEAD COP- KICKS IN THE FRONT DOOR, ordering a 
           platoon of blues into the pad. And what they’ll never notice, 
           is that the BLINKING DEVICE HAS STOPPED BLINKING. 3, 2, 1, 
           and...

           BOOOOOM! THE HOUSE GOES UP IN A BLAST OF BRICK AND SHINGLE. 
           RED HEAD IS THROWN TO THE STREET, fire singing his hair. 
           Remnants of second hand furniture dropping from the sky like 
           a used rain sale. One torn sofa smashes atop a patrol car...

           And... CRASH! MCBANISTER’S TOWN CAR shatters the garage door 
           and races through the debris. Nick grits his teeth behind the 
           wheel and plows over every picket fence in the neighborhood. 
           IT SPEEDS through a series of backyards at full throttle.

           O’Toole jumps to his feet and signals to the platoon...
                                 O’TOOLE
                        Get headquarters on the line - I 
                        want all units on those raggidy
                        fucks. Have back-up cut ‘em off at 
                        the bridge.  

           And every squad car flashes to life.

           INT. TOWN CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Nick has the pedal to the floor. CAMERA ZOOMS into the rear 
           of the vehicle as Lucky watches McBanister’s corpse roll from 
           side to side.

                                 LUCKY
                        Why did we save the corpse again?

           Nick whips the town car into a 60 degree turn.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Well, the good news is that there’s a 
                        safe for us to crack, which may hold 
                        enough cash to square your sins. 
                    (speedometer at 90...)
                        Bad news is that the dead guy 
                        swallowed the key, so you’re gonna
                        have to go divin’ for it.

           Lucky’s eyes bulge to silver dollar size pancakes.

                                 LUCKY
                        Pardon? You want me to “dive in”? 
                        Why can’t you get it?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                    (annoyed)
                        Please. Not while I’m driving.

           Lucky stares at the corpse with complete disdain, as Nick 
           tosses a leather glove into the back seat...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        There. Use that.

           Righ on schedule, about 6 SQUAD CARS rip around the corner in 
           hot pursuit. Lights flashing behind us in flashes of blue & red.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        And hurry!!

           Lucky says “fuck” a few times in his head, and flips the body 
           into a doggy-style position. He pulls the leather glove on 
           snug -then- ankles McBanister. We can almost see tears as 
           Lucky gazes  into the dimpled bare ass bouncing in his face.

           He extends his arm back, ready to thrust his hand in...

                                 LUCKY
                        Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus!
           ...Lucky punches forward just as we SMASH TO:

           MASSES OF TAILING POLICE CRUISERS VROOMING PAST SCREEN. SIX 
           SQUAD CARS and 4 police MOTORBIKES speed with a vengeance.

           Nick races up an on-ramp that spits us right into the middle 
           of an insane autobahn-like freeway. ROUTE 99 - a road that’s 
           never heard of speed limits.

           Machine gun fire rattles across the townie’s exterior, as 
           Lucky throws his hand up. He’s holding THE KEY.

                                 LUCKY
                        I GOT IT!

           BASH! A POLICE CRUISER RAMS US FROM THE RIGHT!

           Town car swerves violently, then regains forward momentum. 
           Nick steers out of it and pushes back. The cruiser goes wide 
           proving that Nick has the bigger pair.

           Now, we’re coming up on the bridge -and- the police BARRICADE 
           blocking us from it. The stationary officers ahead open fire, 
           causing Nick to duck below the wheel. 

           ALL FOUR TIRES BLOW - sparks flying from the rims like ice 
           skates on an asphalt rink. The car skids wide, plowing 
           through a concrete median and flipping across three lanes of 
           oncoming traffic. Metal grinding as it barrel rolls with 
           sheer tenacity. 

           Smoke HISSES as the overturned town car settles. Nick checks 
           to see how many ribs he’s cracked - feels like three.  

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                    (to Lucky)
                        You okay?

                                 LUCKY
                        No. Seems that so far, all that pain 
                        and grievance shit is yours.

           Honk. Honk. Honk. Collisions ensue as every car on the road 
           stops on a dime to avoid the wreckage. Fender benders 
           chirping all around them like a catastrophic lullaby.

           Nick pulls himself from the crash, helps Lucky. But the 
           screams of police sirens only moments away as the chase 
           changes directions.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Mission accomplished. I’m pissed.

           Nick steps into the middle of the highway and fronts an 
           enormous UPS-style DELIVERY TRUCK. It stops. He aims his gun at 
           the ARAB DRIVER, forcing him out. Driver complies, of course.

           Nick climbs in and pulls the clutch down. Lucky stumbles into 
           the passenger seat. AND WE’RE OFF... AGAIN... WITH THE ENTIRE 
           52ND PRECINCT BACK ON OUR ASS. 
           Wait. Nick hears a strange noise... IT SOUNDS LIKE TICKING.

           He looks to A PACKAGE resting in the passenger seat beside 
           Lucky. Lucky picks it up - shakes it - puts it to his ear. 
           Fuck. Bad news... IT IS TICKING!

           Lucky heaves the package out the window -AND- we stay on it 
           as it sloshes beneath the grill of a pursuing cruiser. 

           BOOOOM! Metal twists as the cruiser goes up in two pieces. 
           Glass scatters through the air like someone shook up a snow 
           globe.

           Nick smiles. For a second. The split second it takes him to 
           hear... tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.  And they both look 
           over their shoulders to discover... THE ENTIRE TRUCK IS 
           LOADED WITH TICKING PACKAGES!

           Nick floors it as Lucky climbs into the back. He opens the 
           cargo door -and- begins throwing packages into the road. Each 
           detonating upon impact.

           Another cruiser blows across lanes - a second is thrown into 
           a series of grinding somersaults - then another. Lucky’s 
           creating a minefield of high octane fireworks, making it 
           almost impossible to follow them.

           Now, THE FOUR BIKERS weave to the front of the pursuing 
           caravan. Each unstrapping a TOMMY GUN from their bikes.

           Now, Nick shakes right as BIKER #1 puts a string of pearls in 
           the windshield. He aims his .38 SPECIAL out the driver side 
           and goes for the fences...

           BAM. BAM. BAM. BIKER #1 skips the bullets just as BIKER #2 
           ponies up next to the speeding truck.

           Nick jerks the wheel and tries to put BIKER #2 against the 
           walls. But the rider turn-tables grabbing onto the rear view 
           mirror -- his bike gets crushed as he lifts off.

           Biker #2 punches through the passenger window and takes aim, 
           however, Nick dives over and KICKS OPEN THE PASSENGER SIDE 
           DOOR. Biker #2 holds on for dear life as the door swings 
           fully open... AND SMASHES AGAINST A NO SPEED LIMIT SIGN.

           ON THE HIGHWAY: A MINIVAN OF DELINQUENT KIDS enters the mix.

           BIKER #1 opens another round from his Tommy -just as- BIKER 
           #3 comes up from behind the truck. Nick gets a sudden rush of 
           true grit in his blood... AND... HE SLAMS THE FUCKING BRAKE!

           Smoke rockets from the wheels as the truck stops cold!  WHAM - 
           Biker #3 slams into the rear bumper, jacking his body forward 
           and throwing him into the truck past Lucky...

           BIKER #3 SLIDES ACROSS THE FLOOR until his shoulders CRUNCH 
           between the front seats. Nick instantly puts the .38 to his 
           temple and pulls the trigger.
           ANGLE ON: THE BOTTOM OF THE TRUCK -AS- BAM! A BULLET HOLE 
           EXPLODES THROUGH FROM ABOVE. And a stream of blood follows.

           Nick puts the gear back into 4th and accelerates hard. BIKER 
           #1 still taking shots from the cheap seats two lanes over. 

           So, let’s welcome BIKER #4 to the party. HE’S COMING RIGHT AT 
           US AGAINST TRAFFIC -- TOMMY ON FULL. Nick treads the fire and 
           puts the pedal down. It’s a hard-ass game of chicken.

           WHAAAAM! And it couldn’t be possible, but BIKER #4 just went 
           into the grill with a flesh smoldering slam. Nick smiles.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Judges?

                                 LUCKY
                        I’d call it a tie.

           Now, RAPID GUN FIRE PELTS THE SIDE OF THE TRUCK as O’Toole 
           ponies up his armored cruiser adjacent to Nick/Lucky. Our 
           delivery truck getting shredded to pieces.

           Truck dances across lanes, but live rounds from BIKER #1 keep 
           us to the right. Suddenly, O’Toole’s cruiser taps the rear 
           bumper, more gunfire ensues. O’Toole smiles.

                                 LUCKY
                        We’re losin’ our cover...

           ENTERING FREEWAY: A FLATBED 16 WHEELER TRANSPORTING A ONE 
           STORY HOME. 

           Nick gets a crazy idea -and- goes right for it. Pedal kissing 
           the ground as the speedometer puts one in the record books.

           SLAM!!! The delivery truck plows into the home! Pieces of low 
           class architecture crack to pieces as the truck charges 
           through and jumps the trailer. It disappears in the eye of 
           destruction.    

           Then, out of nowhere, the side door of the home swings open 
           as NICK LEANS FROM IT and FIRES RAPIDLY. He cleans his 
           barrel, putting about five shots in O’Toole’s chest.

           Nick dives back inside when the final biker sprays another 
           round across the home. Spent ammo. A repeat performance.

           INT. MOVING HOME - NIGHT

           A cozy little place. Flowered wallpaper. Berber carpet. 
           Matching sofas. A mounted deer head... AND A HUNTING RIFLE 
           ABOVE THE FIREPLACE.

           Nick reaches for it. Checks the barrel.
           INT. MOVING HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Nick opens the bathroom window and steadies the rifle against 
           his shoulder. He takes a deep breath, aims carefully... BAM!

           WE GO SLOW MOTION

           AND FOLLOW THE BULLET AS IT TRAVELS ACROSS LANES - INTO THE 
           MINIVAN - BETWEEN A ROW OF FIGHTING DELINQUENTS - OUT OF THE 
           MINIVAN - AND MAKES A FATAL “CRACK” IN THE VISOR OF BIKER #1. 

           RESUME MOTION

           Great shot! Nick smiles because he knows it. But he soon 
           forgets as THE STRAPS BEGIN SNAPPING. Home leans, slowly 
           tipping off the 16 wheeler. Nick braces himself in the door 
           frame like there’s an earthquake in progress.

           NOW ON FREEWAY: A FULLY LOADED SEWAGE TANKER. 

           AND DON’T FORGET: THE CONSTRUCTION CARRIER WITH 6 CONCRETE 
           CYLINDERS.

           EXT. TRANSPORTABLE HOME - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           A vertical garage door lifts, revealing a PINK CADILLAC
           parked inside (the kind your mom drives after selling Mary 
           Kay for ten years). Lucky wires the engine and REVERSES THE 
           CADILLAC OUT OF THE TIPPING HOME - BACK ONTO THE FREEWAY.

           The house topples to the asphalt, and rolls in direct path of 
           the SEWAGE TANKER. Tanker collides and sputters into a 90 
           degree skid. As it cuts perpendicular to the other lanes, THE 
           CONSTRUCTION CARRIER has no choice but to carom into the 
           tanker at full speed...

           AN ERUPTION OF PISS & SHIT GOES SKY HIGH!! 

           WATCH OUT! THE CONSTRUCTION CARRIER hydroplanes across the 
           piss slicked asphalt -and- slams into the median, sending all 
           6 concrete cylinders toppling onto the highway.

                                 LUCKY
                        Ah hell!

           Lucky weaves as the cylinders roll across the lanes. He’s 
           dodging perfectly, until of course the final cylinder rolls 
           directly in front of us!  

           PINK CADILLAC CHUTES STRAIGHT INTO THE CYLINDER GOING 90 - 
           TURNS UPSIDE DOWN AS IT ROLLS LEFT - AND GETS SPIT OUT ON ALL 
           FOURS THE NEXT LANE OVER. 

                   DELI
                                      NICK THE SAINT
           HOOOOOOLY SHIT!
                                 HOLY SHIIIIIIT!

           Nick signs the cross. Lucky tries too, but fucks the rotation.
           And the Cadillac speeds into the clear....

                                 LUCKY
                        Now what? Wanna blow up the 
                        expressway?  

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Just drive. I got a feeling that 
                        all roads lead to heaven. My gut 
                        says the church is involved, so we 
                        follow the straight n’ narrow...

                                         FADE TO BLACK:

           SUPER:             A FEW MINUTES LATER

           INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - DAY

           The confessional window slides open to reveal a bloodstained 
           Nick  pointing the .38 Special right at us. A bruised and 
           battered Lucky is squeezed in beside him. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Forgive me father, I’m about to 
                        kill your ass.

           FATHER PISARRO stops cold, a frightened expression. His body 
           trembling so hard he’s breaking 10 on the Richter. He shrieks 
           as Nick punches through the screen and pulls his face into 
           the square... 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I think it’s time to fess up some 
                        shit, preacher man. McBanister was 
                        runnin’ with your crew, now he’s a 
                        pale horse. What did he fall into?

                                 LUCKY
                        Besides a mystery with lots of fun 
                        clues and folks named “Whodunnit”.

           Father Pisarro starts to whimper like a little bitch.

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        “Precious in the sight of the Lord, 
                        is the death of His saints.”

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                    (to Lucky)
                        He makin’ sense to you?

                                 LUCKY
                        Not a lick of it.

           Nick cocks “The Special”.
                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        You have no idea what you’re 
                        dealing with here... you’re messin’
                        with the ticking, tocking will of 
                        God.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Save it, father. We’re not drinkin’
                        the Kool-Aid. Just tell us what’s 
                        goin’ down. 

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        McBanister was just a part-timer. 
                        Did some work with the rest of our 
                        loan out muscle. Just blue collar 
                        stuff - pickin’ up our strays, like 
                        Doyle here. Whatever got him killed 
                        had nothin’ do with the church. He 
                        musta been swimmin’ in high tides 
                        on his own agenda.  
                    (to Lucky)
                        The Good Book still has you down as 
                        a sinner, my fuckin’ son.

                                 LUCKY
                        You’ll get the money.

           Nick puts the gun to Pisarro’s temple.

                                 NICK THE SAINT 
                        Is there a girl mixed up in this? 
                        Girl named Hope?

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        There’s no hope in Fiasco Heights. 
                        You of all people should know that.

           Nick fires a shot into the wood beside Pisarro’s face. 

           THE ST. CHARLES BOYS CHOIR, which has been practicing outside 
           the entire time, CEASES TO HUM.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        McBanister said something before he 
                        fell asleep. “Salvation”. What is it?

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        Something that we all need, but 
                        never ask for. And if you go 
                        lookin’ for it, you’ll end up with 
                        nothin’ but a handful of fire n’ 
                        brimstone.
                    (beat)
                        For years, we’ve been searching for 
                        it ourselves. Never come close. 
                        Frankly, I’m not sure it even 
                        exists. But in the chance that you 
                        find it, we’d be willing to reward 
                        you handsomely. 
                                 LUCKY
                        What kind of reward?

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        Riches in heaven. 

           Nick looks Pisarro in the eye...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        We’ll pass.

                                 LUCKY
                        Wait. I want a full pardon from the 
                        church, and safe passage outta town 
                        for my friend here. What about it?

           Nick looks at Lucky with an acrimonious stare.

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        That can be arranged. 

                                 LUCKY
                        Then consider that we’ll consider 
                        it. 

           Lucky turns to Nick with an optimist’s smile.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Not a chance.

                                 LUCKY
                    (to Pisarro)
                        Yeah, no, we can’t do it.

           Now, we hear footsteps outside the box... lots of them.

           INT. ST. CHARLES CATHEDRAL - CONTINUOUS

           Nick steps out of the confessional and rips Pisarro from the 
           neighboring box. He throws the priest down on his knees and 
           puts the gun to his head. 

           CAMERA SPINS TO REVEAL THAT THE ENTIRE ST. CHARLES BOYS CHOIR 
           HAS SURROUNDED THE CONFESSIONALS. 

           Nick presses the gun hard against Pisarro’s temple.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Tell the choir boys to back off, or 
                        it’s last rites on the fly.

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        It’s okay boys, let these men go. 
                        They have our blessing.

           Nick inches towards the door using Pisarro as a shield. Lucky 
           tries to intimidate the choir boys with his revolver -and it 
           does- seeing how it accidentally misfires into Pisarro’s foot.
           Lucky turns to Nick with a concerned look, “Ooops”.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Okay. RUN!

           And our heroes hall balls out of the church with about twenty 
           pissed off choirboys right behind them.

           INT. PINK CADILLAC - DAY 

           Both Nick/Lucky are covered in fresh gashes. Louis 
           Armstrong’s 1932 version of All of Me is on the radio.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You should come with a permanent 
                        fucking toe tag, you know that?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Relax, we made it out alive. Barely.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Barely doesn’t come in smaller sizes. 
                        That was as barely as it gets.

           Nick peers out the rain covered windshield.

                                 LUCKY
                        So, if The Catholics aren’t tied to 
                        this, then who connects the dots 
                        with your boy McBanister?

           Nick holds up the ketchup packet.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        This has Doughboy’s scent all over 
                        it, and my gut says that’s where 
                        our lines cross.

                                 LUCKY
                        Well, speakin’ of guts, mine are 
                        back on the endangered list. It’s 
                        deadline season, and with an injured 
                        priest on my conscience, I’d say 
                        mercy is fresh out of stock. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Loose the conscience, it only makes 
                        your shoulder heavy.
                    (beat)
                        Don’t worry about the priest.

                                 LUCKY
                        Easy for you to say. You’re focused 
                        on some dame who was up to her neck 
                        in deep shit. Face the facts!
                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        The only fact I’m starrin’ down, is 
                        that you’re a five star, blue 
                        ribbon, magna cume laude assfuck.
                    (beat)
                        Just hang onto that key until we 
                        find the safe.

           Nick turns up the radio, but Lucky turns it back down again.

                                 LUCKY
                        I didn’t sign up to be no sidekick. 
                        I need to know more about this dame.

           Nick hesitates for a second, then gives in. He likes that 
           Lucky is finally showing some balls.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        She disappeared a week back with 
                        something that belongs to my 
                        current employer. A briefcase - not 
                        even sure what’s in it.

                                 LUCKY
                        Could it be the same thing the 
                        church and Doughboy are dustin’
                        for? This salvation?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        It’s crossed my mind. But if so, I 
                        don’t think Hope knows what she’s 
                        into. I’ve got to find her before 
                        she gets too deep in the deep end.
                    (beat)
                        I cared about this woman. Once.

                                 LUCKY
                        Right, I know the song. She’s a 
                        keeper by you couldn’t “keep her”. 
                        My gal ran off too. Threw me a curve 
                        and took to an older fella. Lots a’ 
                        dollar signs in his wallet. It 
                        happens, ya know?
                    (lifts flask)
                        So here’s to broken hearts, and 
                        dolled up dames who break ‘em.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                    (irratated)
                        Keep tryin’ to cheer me up, and 
                        I’ll slap the retarded right off 
                        your face. 
                    (beat)
                        I think she was kidnapped along 
                        with the case.

           Lucky is silent. He’s not sure what to make of all this.
           EXT. HAMPTON ALLEY - DAY 

           A cobblestone alley littered with an assemblage of junkies 
           all huddled over timid can fires and dirty works.  Vagabonds 
           of the world unite here, in what could be the most beautiful 
           square in Fiasco. Very Victorian. A WOODEN SIGN SWAYS FROM 
           ABOVE: THE HAMPTONS.

           Camera pans through the derelicts to find our guys making 
           their way through the crowd. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        We’re lookin’ for a snitch named 
                        Mother Goose. Used to hole up in the 
                        local library - if there’s somethin’
                        goin’ down, he’ll know.

           At the end of Hampton Square, we come to a small USED BOOK 
           SHOP. A BLIND, BLACK MAN sits outside reading a brail edition 
           of The Inferno. His eyes hidden behind a massive set of 
           aviator glasses and thick dreads. And before Nick can speak..

                                 MOTHER GOOSE
                        If ya came for a story, we closed. 
                        I don’t rhyme no more, my brotha’.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Here’s a story. Once there was this 
                        mean motherfucker, who turned some 
                        scumbag’s face to pulp. All because 
                        he wouldn’t share with the other 
                        kids...

           Nick slaps Goose across the face with his leather glove.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        ...So start rhyming, or my knuckles 
                        get anxious.

                                 LUCKY
                        Excuse me. Did you just slap this 
                        man with a glove? 

           Now, Nick slaps Lucky across the face with the glove.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I’ve got an invisible dame, and a 
                        key I can’t put a lock to. It’s 
                        complicated math, but there’s 
                        “salvation” in the equation. What 
                        do you know?

                                 MOTHER GOOSE
                        I don’t know shit! So fuck up and 
                        off, man! 

           NICK SLAPS MOTHER GOOSE ACROSS THE FACE. AGAIN.
                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        See. I can rhyme too.
                    (slaps him again)
                        And I’ll keep the smack on til 
                        you’ve made bitch of the month. So 
                        start leakin’ the good stuff. 

                                 LUCKY
                    (trying to be hard)
                        What he means is quit duck, duck, 
                        ducking the question, Goose!

           Nick looks at Lucky, idiot. Slaps him in the face AGAIN.

                                 MOTHER GOOSE
                        Aw-aight, chill man. Hands off the 
                        Mother fuckin’ Goose.
                    (holding cheek)
                        Buzz in the air is that somethin’
                        called “salvation” was lifted from 
                        the Savin’s n’ Loan. That’s your 
                        sparrow - snatched up by some punks 
                        rentin’ costumes by the hour. Bunch 
                        a’ amateurs who love stealin’ the 
                        show if ya dig.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I dig. What is salvation?

                                 MOTHER GOOSE
                        Probably just a bogus name for 
                        somethin’ big n’ badass. Like end 
                        of the world type a’ shit. Kinda
                        shit you’d find in Pandora’s attic.
                    (adjusts glasses)
                        As fo’ dames, there’s too many to 
                        shake in this cum dump city. Best 
                        check the lost n’ found, maybe 
                        she’ll turn up. 
                    (beat)
                        THE END. That’s all The Goose 
                        knows. An’ there ain’t na happy 
                        endin’ on this motherfucka.

           Nick puts a cigarette in Goose’s mouth. He lights it. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Anything else I should hear? 
                        Limerick. Haiku. Say it however...

                                 MOTHER GOOSE
                        Look at ya, the prodigal ma’fuckin’
                        son n’ shit. He leaves a cold blood 
                        killer, returns a regular fuckin’
                        Marlowe gone rogue rotten on 
                        hurtin’ pills.

           Goose removes a $100 dollar bill covered in BLUE DYE.
                                 MOTHER GOOSE (CONT’D)
                        If I were you, I’d be lookin’ for 
                        villains. The kind that steal.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Who robbed that bank, Goose?

           Goose offers the stained bill to Nick. Smiles big, gold 
           shimmering from his mouth...

                                 MOTHER GOOSE
                        Well, that’s the hundred dollar 
                        question... isn’t it, Spade?

                                          DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. SMOKIN’ MOON NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           A classy joint filled with live music and second hand smoke. 
           Type of place that serves lung cancer as a side dish.

           Nick and Lucky down their cocktails like pros as a female 
           jazz singer begins a melancholy original.

                                 LUCKY
                        I bet she’s lip syncing.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        She’s not lip syncing.

                                 LUCKY
                        I bet she is.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        No. She’s not. And why are you 
                        trying to bet anything? Were you 
                        raised under a power line?

                                 LUCKY
                        I think she’s lipping, that’s all.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I wish you were lipping, but your 
                        perpetual articulation of gibberish 
                        clearly reminds me otherwise. Just 
                        stop talking, stop thinking, and 
                        stop fucking existing until I 
                        finish my drink. Please.  

           SMACK! NICK IS SLAPPED ACROSS THE BACK OF THE HEAD!

                                 HARLEY (O.S.)
                        That’s for walking out on me.

           SMACK! HARLEY (decked like a cigarette girl) gets him on the 
           other cheek.
                                 HARLEY
                        And that’s for stickin’ me with the 
                        hotel bill. You’re no good, Nick!

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Easy on the backhand, tootse. I’d 
                        say sorry if I could, but I can’t, 
                        ‘cause I don’t. Just ain’t my style.

           SMACK!!!

                                 HARLEY
                        Then that’s for bad style. And 
                        don’t call me tootse. I ain’t your 
                        damsel to distress. 

                                 LUCKY
                        She’s right... nobody says tootse
                        nowadays. Unless it’s rainin’
                        maltese falcons in Chinatown.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                    (to Lucky)
                        Shut up.

           Harley lights a cigarette and gives Nick a patented death stare.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        All right. I’m sorry. There, I said 
                        it. And I wish we could hammer out 
                        our old shit with a bit more love and 
                        affection, but I’m here on business.

           Harley inhales and turns to Lucky.

                                 HARLEY
                        Who’s the sap?

                                 LUCKY
                        Doyle. Lucky Doyle.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        He’s a client slash PI slash 
                        witness. Slash idiot.

                                 HARLEY
                        What’s got ya on the heel this time?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Bad religion. Catholics got him 
                        down with clocks ticking. And the 
                        plot thickens as I speak.
                    (inhale-exhale)
                        We need to see the girls.

           Nick reaches into Harley’s cigarette carton and helps 
           himself. He lights one up -as- Harley turns to Lucky.
                                 HARLEY
                        Sounds like a pinch. They got 
                        someone pinnin’ your tail?

                                 LUCKY
                        God Squad’s on the five behind. I’m 
                        a martyr in the making, and for 
                        bottom lines, Pinstripes wants me 
                        limper than a fag on sorority row. 

                                 HARLEY
                        Well if it’s queer you’re speakin’, 
                        he definitely knows the language. 

                                 LUCKY
                        Oh, he’s fluent in it.

                                 HARLEY
                    (to Nick)
                        All this fuss over a few Catholic 
                        fellas? Never knew you were soft in 
                        the center, Nicky.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Sorry babe, breakfast in bed is as 
                        soft as I go. 

           Harley hesitates for a second. Gives Nick another eye to eye.

                                 HARLEY
                        All right. I’ll take ya’s back to 
                        see the gals, but don’t think 
                        you’re off the hook. Me and you 
                        still have old shit to hammer out.
                    (beat)
                        C’mon. Follow me boys.

           The two follow Harley behind the bar, through the kitchen, to 
           a masquerade wall. Harley pounds on the wall a few times.

                                 LUCKY

                        Getting information.

           INT. STRIP CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           Loud music. Half-naked strippers. Pole dancing. This place 
           serves sin on the rocks.

           Nick and Lucky are up to their balls in strippers, so much 
           tit ‘n ass in their face it’s hard to breathe. And these are 
           the kind of lap dances that leave residue on your pants. 

           A stripper grinds her pelvis into Lucky’s waist...
                                 LUCKY
                        This is your idea of getting more 
                        information?

                                 NICK THE SAINT 
                        Yeah. Just remember... 

           Nick points to a large sign on the wall: HANDS OFF THE GALS!

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        No touching.

           Now - Nick whispers into a stripper’s ear. She takes a seat 
           on his lap and leans back into him.

                                 STRIPPER
                    (re: whisper)
                        Maybe.

           Nick holds up a ten dollar bill. She grabs it fast enough to 
           tell she’s addicted to the color green.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        A recent lift. Something of high 
                        value that’s between transaction 
                        and open ended. Savings & loan type

           Nick holds up another ten - she takes it.

           INT. CHEAP MOTEL - NIGHT

           Our stripper starts to undo her skirt while facing the 
           VAUDEVILLAIN IN THE COWBOY HAT. He sits on the bed and takes 
           a pull off a bottle of bourbon.

                        This is the address he usually 
                        calls from.

           And as she drops the period on that sentence - NICK IS 
           GRABBED FROM BEHIND AND RIPPED OUT OF THE CHAIR.

           A BOUNCER stands at the door with a FRANTIC STRIPPER.

                        C’mon. You’re not the only one with 
                        a new make-over. It was all you can 
                        eat knuckle sandwiches out here. 
                        That monster-fuck hit me so hard I 
                        had the same dream twice.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        That’s a DAMN SHAME! I’m so sorry 
                        it took that long to PUNCH my face, 
                        and THROW ME OUT OF THE CLUB! 
                    (beat)
                        When this is all over, you’d better 
                        disappear like Houdini after a bad 
                        lay. Otherwise, I might kill you 
                        myself.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Well. You need 100 grand to stay 
                        alive. I need to rid myself of your 
                        presence. So, in consideration of 
                        the predicament, I guess that puts 
                        me in the whole, “Hey - we need 100 
                        fuckin’ grand” category.

                                 LUCKY

           CLOSE ON: BILLY WILDE -in his cowboy hat- sips on a beer 
           while watching a hunting program. The BLUE PAINT BLOTCHES on 
           his face make his appearance unusual, but 100% recognizable.

           SUDDENLY - THE TRAILER JOLTS FORWARD. IT BEGINS MOVING!
                                 WILDE
                        The damn?

           Wilde runs into the kitchen and opens the window. From his 
           POV, we see his home speeding out of the trailer park.

                                 NICK THE SAINT (O.S.)
                        Nice place.

           Wilde jumps back against the refrigerator.

                                 WILDE
                        SHI-YIT! Who the hell are you? 
                        Jesus!

           Nick lays a gun on the table.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        No. I’m not Jesus, but he’s a good 
                        friend of mine. Unfortunately, he’s 
                        a bit more forgiving than I am. 
                        Here, have a seat.

           Wilde squeezes into the kitchen booth across from Nick.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I’m here to ask a pair of 
                        questions. 1) Where’s the score? 
                        And 2) where’s the fucking score?

           Wilde looks at the gun - then looks at Nick. He’s serious.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        What? Would it be easier in 
                        multiple fucking choice?

                                 WILDE
                        Look. I was just recruited into 
                        that gig. Elbow grease kinda work. 
                        Then I panicked... didn’t mean to 
                        take that bag... but...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Why don’t you go get it.

           With zero hesitation, Wilde goes to the closet and returns 
           with the DUFFLE BAG OF CASH. He sets it on the table and 
           opens it. Every bill inside is covered in BLUE PAINT.

                                 WILDE
                        It’s all there. I ain’t spent a 
                        cent of it seein’ how the cops been 
                        lookin’ for stains.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                    (zipping the bag)
                        Is there anything else? Anything 
                        top shelf?
                                 WILDE
                        There was a satchel. A black leather 
                        one. Hombres in the posse nabbed it 
                        quick -- said it was priceless. I 
                        got the feeling they wasn’t gonna
                        cut me in, so that’s why I ran off 
                        with the loot here.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Who were the players? 

                                 WILDE
                        Everyone stayed masked and 
                        anonymous. Even to me. But, I did 
                        overhear ‘em say somethin’ ‘bout a 
                        drop point. Some safe somewhere.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You don’t say. 

                                 WILDE
                        Yeah, I believe I just did. 
                        Anyhow’s, if things went 
                        unscripted, that was the fella’s
                        term for bad, we was to run and ron-
                        day-voo at this here place here...

           Wilde slides a small MATCHBOOK across the table to Nick. 

           INSERT: BLACK MATCHBOOK WITH A GLOSSY LIPSTICK KISS on it. No 
           name. No location. He flips the matchbook open to find a 
           number written on the inside flap:

                           “21”

           Nick studies it.

                                 WILDE
                        Exactly. I don’t know where this is, 
                        or where it ain’t, but I’d bet a dead 
                        dingo’s dong it’s where them boys is 
                        gonna flip that satchel.

           Now, the trailer comes to a stop. Nick gets up, grabs the 
           bag, and goes for the door...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Thanks. You’re hospitality’s been 
                        real Southern and all. 

           He exits -AND- almost immediately WILDE RUSHES INTO HIS 
           BEDROOM - GRABS A GUN - AND SPRINTS OUT THE DOOR AFTER NICK. 
           BUT...

           HE STEPS OUT ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT THE TRAILER HAS BEEN 
           PARKED BESIDE THE FIASCO SAVINGS & LOAN CRIMESCENE.
           The entire 31st Precinct has their weapons trained - THE DYED 
           CASH dumped right on the pavement beside him.

           WILDE DROPS HIS GUN upon the realization of being fucked.

                                             CUT TO:

           INT. PINK CADILLAC - NIGHT

           Cue radio, Rudy Vallee’s 1931 Brother, Can You Spare A Dime.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        The girl, the Catholics, the bank 
                        job, the Franchise... none of it 
                        adds.

           Lucky stares at the matchbook -then- an aura of brilliance 
           ignites. If light bulbs really went off overhead after strokes 
           of genius -well- we’d see about five of them right now. Or...

           BING! THE CAR LIGHT FLASHES TO LIFE ABOVE LUCKY.

                                 LUCKY
                        Then don’t add it. Smell it. 

           Lucky puts the matchbook to his nose and takes in the scent.

                                 LUCKY
                        That, my shamus friend, is a scent 
                        I could never forget. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Cut to the part where you tell me. 
                        And quit calling me your friend.

           Nick snags the matchbook back and sniffs for himself.

                                 LUCKY
                        It’s Jasmine with a hint of white 
                        sandalwood. Very distinct. Very 
                        rare. Very Chinese.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Chinatown.

                                 LUCKY
                        B-i-n-g-o. That spells you’re 
                        goddamn right. 

           AND LUCKY THROWS THE CADILLAC INTO A U-TURN.

           EXT. CHINATOWN - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

           CLOSE ON: An enormous BLACK BILLBOARD WITH A GLOSSY KISS MARK.

           Camera cranes down, finding an old bus station below the 
           billboard. And we’re smack in the middle of Chinatown:
           Neon characters flashing intensly against the orange glow of 
           shaded street lamps. Flaring “take-out” signs beat against a 
           swarming fish market. We’re not lost in translation here... 
           we’re fucking drowning in it.

           INT. CHINATOWN BUS STATION - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON: A METALLIC CASE CUFFED TO THE WRIST OF...

           RON WONG LEE, an Asian greaser in an Armani suit. He enters 
           the station and wanders through a maze of lockers. He stops 
           at LOCKER #21.

           Now, in one quick motion, Wong Lee removes a small pick, 
           thrusts it into the lock, twists, and pops the locker open 
           with ease. And inside, we’re starring straight at...

           THE BLACK CASE BEARING A RED CROSS... AKA “SALVATION”.

           Wong Lee switches out both cases, snapping the black leather 
           case to his wrist. He exits. Never once realizing that NICK & 
           LUCKY are watching every move from the 2nd floor balcony.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Blackjack.

           ANGLE ON: The locker opening again, this time to the METALLIC 
           CASE. And Nick reaches in, opening it to find a generous 
           amount of hundred dollar bills stacked neatly & packed tight.

                                 LUCKY
                        Jack-pot is more like it.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        That was Ron Wong Lee. Otherwise 
                        known as Don Wong. He’s a number 
                        cruncher for Doughboy. Looks like 
                        The Franchise has been funding that 
                        bank guzzlin’ drama club all along. 
                    (hands Lucky the case)
                        Here. You can use this to settle 
                        your sins. Feels heavy enough.

                                 LUCKY
                        So, The Franchise has the case. But 
                        whoever tipped the bank swapped it 
                        to them for a low bid. Maybe it’s 
                        just my private eye blinking here, 
                        but it doesn’t feel right. Why 
                        would the robbers need money after 
                        stealing a lot of money? Huh?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Well if I knew who they were, I’d 
                        ask them personally.

           Lucky removes his deck of playing cards from his pocket. He 
           begins to shuffle.
                                 LUCKY
                        My mentor, God rest his soul, once 
                        told me that if the investigation 
                        feels like a mirage, just drink the 
                        water. And if you’re still thirsty, 
                        then it wasn’t really water to 
                        begin with.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        So. What the hell does that mean?

                                 LUCKY
                        I don’t know. I just thought it was 
                        cool.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Idiot.

           Then Lucky lifts a card from the deck. THE QUEEN OF HEARTS.

                                 LUCKY
                        But maybe it means that your 
                        queen’s still on the board, eh?
                    (changing subjects)
                        The hell do you think is in that 
                        case anyway?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Don’t know, Mr. McGuffin, but it’s 
                        probably something that goes boom.

                                 LUCKY
                        Or ca-ching.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Either way, I don’t give a damn 
                        what’s in it, as long as there’s 
                        Hope at the end of the tunnel.

                                 LUCKY
                        So let’s snag Don Wong before he 
                        bags outta tea town.

           EXT. CHINATOWN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Lucky watches Wong Lee cross the street to THE RED PALACE. An 
           old establishment lit up like a cheap Chinese jerk joint. 
           Oriental ridges seem to glow within a blanket of red light 
           that coats the air. It’s almost mystical.

           Lucky turns to Nick as Wong Lee goes inside.

                                 LUCKY
                        Shit. The Red Palace. You ever hear 
                        of the China Doll 7?

           Nick lights a cigarette.
                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Nope. But I’m sure you’re gonna...

                                 LUCKY
                        Best lip massage I’ve ever had. 
                        Turned my head numb for 5.7 seconds. 
                        Even made my asshole tingle like...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        ...I get it.

                                 LUCKY
                        Well, if you cross these slant 
                        broads they’ll go Genghis-Khan on 
                        your ass. Knock ya out with your 
                        own stiff chubby.
                    (beat)
                        Good pal ‘a mine went in there once 
                        for a Saigon sucky-sucky, and he 
                        got blown alright... blown right 
                        the fuck away. Police found his 
                        nuts in different zip codes. Left 
                        one still had lipstick on it.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Is there a point coming on?

           FLASH INSERT: SEVEN CHINESE GIRLS ENTER FRAME IN A SINGLE 
           FILE LINE. AND WE’RE INTRODUCED TO THE DEADLY CHINA DOLL 7. 

           They stand shoulder to shoulder in a parlor, staring at us. 
           Their pale white make-up has them looking as dangerous as 
           they are beautiful.

                                 LUCKY(V.O.)
                        Right. Well, each of them gals is 
                        tattooed with a numbered dragon, 
                        right on the back of the neck... 

           FLASH INSERT: ONE OF THE GIRL’S TATTOOS. A COLORED DRAGON 
           CIRCLED AROUND THE NUMBER “2”. 

                                             BACK TO:

                                 LUCKY
                        If ya ain’t got an invite, the only 
                        way to stop them crazies is to kill 
                        the madam, Mai Dei. Except ya got a 
                        one in seven chance of that, since 
                        no one knows what number she is. 
                        Now ain’t them some sour odds?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        They don’t come any sweeter. Thing 
                        is, we’re here for Don Wong. I got 
                        no beef with the hookers.
           EXT. PINK CADILLAC - NIGHT

           Nick opens the trunk to reveal a wealth of guns stashed from 
           the Monseigneur. He reaches for THE TWINS. 

                                 LUCKY
                    (starring @ Red Palace)
                        Though pessimism isn’t a trait I 
                        expose regularly, I have been known 
                        to exhibit concern under 
                        unfavorable circumstance.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You think this circumstance is 
                        unfavorable?

                                 LUCKY
                        Well, I’d be lying if I said it was 
                        just fuckin’ peachy.

           Nick hands over a small DERRINGER. Lucky stares at it, 
           pathetically, in the palm of his hand.

                                 LUCKY
                        And I don’t mean to be dramatic, 
                        but can I maybe have a bigger gun?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You’re not being dramatic. You’re 
                        being a pussy. Just point and shoot 
                        - they all do the same thing. 

                                       AND WE SMASH TO:

           INT. RED PALACE - NIGHT 

           Nick kicks in the door of room #5 and interrupts Wong Lee in 
           mid-hummer. The hooker frantically splits -just as- Nick 
           rests the shotgun barrel on Lee’s chin.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I’ll give you a final prayer. Use 
                        it religiously.
                    (dead quiet)
                        Lucky, grab the case.

                                 LUCKY
                  With pleasure.

                                 DON WONG
                        Jush take it!

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I don’t remember asking permission. 

           Lucky grabs the case -BUT- it’s still cuffed to Lee’s wrist.
                                 LUCKY
                        But would you mind asking him to 
                        drop the cuffs? 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Drop the cuffs, Don Wong, or I take 
                        ‘em off... hands and all.

           Wong starts to tear up.

                                 DON WONG
                        I cun’t. Do’boy is kill me if I do 
                        not... he haus only key. 

           Nick notices A FIRE AXE resting in a glass emergency box 
           outside the room. WE HOLD ON IT FOR A SECOND.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Wrong answer. 

           KA-BOOOM!

           INT. RED PALACE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Nick descends a spiral staircase carrying the bloodsoaked
           BLACK CASE. Wong Lee’s arm still dangling from it.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        See, it’s cake.

           AND SUDDENLY...

           A swift kick comes out of nowhere and puts him on knees. He 
           looks up to find CHINA DOLL #4 rushing him from the corner. 
           He lifts the shotgun...

           BOOM!!

           Her smoking carcass slides across the floor, slamming into a 
           table of candles and burning incense. WE SEE THE NUMBER FOUR 
           tattooed to her neck as she slumps over. Dead. 

           Now, CHINA DOLL #7 kicks the gun from his hand just as his 
           finger sets off a misguided shot. The murderess screams and 
           KICKS AT HIM AGAIN - THIS TIME DRIVING HER SHARPENED STILETTO 
           HEEL INTO HIS SHOULDER.

           SNAP. His clavicle cracks like plastic, he’s pushed against 
           the wall - stiletto sliding farther inside him. TEETH 
           GRITTING IN EXTREME PAIN. 

           He grabs her ankle and slowly begins to push her leg back. 
           With only the tip left in his flesh - HE GRABS HER BETWEEN 
           THE LEGS, using his leverage to throw her to the ground. 

           NICK GOES FOR HIS WEAPON - CHINA DOLL #7 JUMPS TO HER FEET:
           She lunges forward as he lifts the shotgun, barrel driving 
           into her chest and stopping forward progress. Her jagged 
           nails claw at his cheek, but that’s where it ends... 

           BOOM! SHE’S FLUNG ACROSS THE ROOM SMASHING INTO A BUBBLING 
           FISH TANK. Glass and water floods the room. Flopping fish 
           struggling to breath. No use -- a whole lot of dead fish. And 
           a dead China Doll to match.

           ANGLE ON: LUCKY. He’s struggling - already on the ground with 
           TWO vicious girls atop him. He screams high-murder as they  
           stuff a gag in his mouth. And bad luck strikes hot again.

           Nick cocks his weapon and rushes the girls in mid-torture -
           but- they scatter like flies under a swatter. He reaches down 
           and rips the gag from his Lucky’s mouth.

                                 LUCKY
                        BEHIND YOU!!

           Saint ducks JUST AS THE BLADE OF A SWORD sweeps his head 
           space. He rolls off of Lucky and takes a shot. An instant 
           miss - THIS BITCH is playing the shadows to her advantage.

           He stands and reloads - probing the shadows around him all 
           the while. AND POW... Nick takes a shot to the temple. He 
           stumbles back. AND POW... another high kick to the jaw. 

           Falling to a knee, he sees ALL OF THE FEMALE KILLERS 
           encircling him within the shadows around the room. 

           NOW, the girl behind him whips a wire around his neck. She 
           tightens - life being squeezed out of him - he struggles for 
           a drag of air. 

           TIGHTER NOW. Choking. He reaches up and grips her hair. 
           Tugging so hard we can hear the roots being ripped from her 
           scalp -but- she holds firm. 

           He struggles to his feet with the killer on his back, she’s 
           yanking harder than ever. His face loosing color. AND...

           There. On a nearby counter, a plate of rotting CHINESE FOOD. 
           Decomposed eggrolls, maggot infested mongolian beef... all 
           combined to form the most disgusting platter in the history 
           of Chinese cuisine. But...

           There’s something else. Something that consumes his last 
           dying efforts. He goes for the plate, weakening faster. 
           Falling to the ground Nick reaches up, hand digging through 
           the moldy slop. THIS IS HIS ONLY SHOT.

           His hand wandering for it... THERE... A CHOPSTICK. He grabs 
           it, AND WITH EVERY OUNCE OF ENERGY LEFT IN HIM, he thrusts it 
           over his shoulder... STRAIGHT INTO THE EYE OF CHINA DOLL #3.

           THUMP. Her body hits the ground dead. A bloody chopstick 
           protruding from her socket. Nick rips the wire from his neck 
           and sucks in a lung-full of oxygen. 
           Now, CHINA DOLL #2 strips a beret from her hair - each toggle 
           razor sharp. She rears back and throws...

           WHISP. The blades drive into Nick’s thigh. He slumps over in 
           pain. Agony. This could be the end of the road.

           At once, the remaining killers come at him with everything 
           they’ve got - pouncing like a pack of wolves. AND SUDDENLY...

           BAM! A gunshot.

           Nick jerks up as one of the girls drops to the floor. Blood 
           spewing from her neck. She looks at him with tear-filled eyes 
           -- then -- hits the ground face first.  

           The other girls jump back, pure panic. Each of them begins to 
           cry profusely. Moaning. They each kneel beside their fallen 
           companion, attention no longer on Nick/Lucky.

           The Saint looks through the torn RICE PAPER WALL to see, 
           LUCKY, holding the DERRINGER he gave him at the cab.

                                 LUCKY
                        That’s her. Mai Dei.

           Saint turns to the mourning China Dolls. They crowd Mai Dei’s 
           body like a swarm of bees around their fallen queen.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        How’d you know?

           A smirk takes shape on Lucky’s face.

           ANGLE ON: Mai Dei’s tattoo. IT’S THE NUMBER FIVE.

                                 LUCKY
                        My lucky number.

           FLASH INSERT: A SLOT MACHINE. Dollar signs CA-CHING into all 
           three slots, sending A FOUNTAIN OF COINS FROM THE MACHINE.

           Lucky’s smirk transforms into a full fledged smile. He 
           hobbles over to Nick, and lifts the hitman to his feet.

                                          DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. RED PALACE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Nick/Lucky (and the case) are standing outside the Red 
           Palace. The sound of the moaning China Dolls has subsided.

                                 LUCKY
                        I can’t believe you shot the rest 
                        of them. That was just mean, man.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Why? You want them reminiscing our 
                        little visit over tea time? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NICK THE SAINT (cont'd)
                        Because I’m sure there’d be some 
                        bad fortune in those cookies. 
                        Anyway, it’s not like those gals 
                        sell tupperware or drive carpool... 
                        they wanted to kill us.

                                 LUCKY
                        Could’ve just been PMS.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        If it was PMS, we’d be dead already.

           Now, Nick holds up his thumb -and within seconds- A SLEEK, 
           BLACK HEARSE zips to a stop against the curb. 

           The driver steps out, dressed in black from head to toe. 
           Tinted sunglasses hide his glare. A fitted escort cap tilted 
           atop his head. He nods to Nick.

                                 MR. CLEAN 
                        How many?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Seven. It’s messy. May want to call 
                        the garbage guys on this one.

           MR. CLEAN smiles arrogantly. He opens the back hatch and 
           begins to mechanically slide AN EMPTY CASKET from the Hearse.

                                 MR. CLEAN
                        I think I can handle seven on my 
                        own, Nicky. 

           The casket slides onto the ground. IT’S ON WHEELS.

                                 MR. CLEAN
                        Just have to make a few trips.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        How much?

           Mr. Clean calculates mentally...

                                 MR. CLEAN
                        Well, that’s seven bodies at $500 a 
                        stiff. These caskets aren’t cheap, 
                        so you’re lookin’ at a few grand 
                        for parts and labor. Throw in the 
                        dumping fee, and I’d say you’re 
                        comin’ in with a total of $7500... 
                        plus tip.

           Lucky shakes his head in disbelief as Saint removes a wad of 
           cash from the Metallic case. He divvies up.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Your prices went up again.

                                 MR. CLEAN
                        Supply and demand, my friend.
           Mr. Clean pockets his fee and rolls the empty casket into The 
           Red Palace. Nick starts walking to the parked Cadillac.

                                 LUCKY
                        What... Who was that?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        The local cleaning guy. Like I 
                        said, I don’t want anymore 
                        attention.

           Nick tosses the “SALVATION” into the back seat, gives Lucky 
           the metallic case packed with cold cash.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        So, me and you... we’re good, 
                        right? I mean, no more bullies? 

                                 LUCKY
                        I guess. Why?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Because our contract became past 
                        tense about an hour ago. And you’ve 
                        got the money to pay your debts.

           Lucky sits on the curb.

                                 LUCKY
                        Look, I know I’m a fuck up...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        No. A fuck up is forgetting to 
                        carry the one in long division. 
                        You’re an absolute fucking
                        catastrophe.

           Lucky’s at a loss for words. He sighs. All he is to anyone is 
           a loser, and his expression does the thought justice. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I made you bulletproof, and you 
                        helped me put the 2’s together. 
                        That was the deal. Now you’re safe, 
                        and I finally have some leverage 
                        here to tie loose ends. If Doughboy 
                        wants salvation, he’ll have to pony 
                        up the girl.

           Lucky shrugs -- shakes Nick’s hand.

                                 LUCKY
                        Deal’s a deal. Thanks for the 
                        adventure. It was...

           Nick nods -and- slaps Lucky on the shoulder.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Well. Good luck.
                                 LUCKY
                    (already lonely)
                        With what?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Life. And all that shit.

           And like that... Nick hops in the car and takes off.

                                          TIME CUT TO:

           EXT. ST. CHARLES CATHOLIC CHURCH - NIGHT

           Lucky pulls into a “drive-thru” tithe deposit box at the 
           Catholic Church. He squares his debts.

           INT. CASINO ‘69 - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           Now, Lucky removes a roll of hundreds from his overcoat and 
           lays it on a roulette table. The pit boss exchanges his chips 
           -- Lucky puts it all on red.

                                 LUCKY
                        Let it ride.

           AND WE’RE CLOSE ON THE BALL AS IT DROPS ONTO THE WHEEL... 
           SPINNING... SLOWING... HOPPING IN & OUT OF VARIOUS SLOTS... 
           INTO RED 5... OUT OF RED 5... and into black 13.

                                 PINSTRIPES (O.S.)
                        Now that’s just the pits.

           Lucky turns to find THE ENTIRE GOD SQUAD standing behind him.

                                 PINSTRIPES
                        Cheers mate. How about we all go 
                        for a pleasure cruise? Give him his 
                        ticket, Champ.

           Knockout Jones rears back for the hook.

                                 LUCKY
                        Wait! My dues are paid.

                                 PINSTRIPES
                        This ain’t about that.

           And suddenly, Pinstripes steps aside revealing HOPE CAUFIELD
           approaching behind him.

                                 HOPE
                        Where’s Nick the Saint? And where’s 
                        the fucking case?

           Lucky is speechless. And will remain speechless when Jones 
           levels him, triggering the swipe dissolve that takes us 
           into...
           INT. MEAT LOCKER - NIGHT

           Pounds of meat hanging from razor sharp hooks. Cows strewn by 
           the row. And we dolly through vertical ranks of frozen beef 
           to find, LUCKY, hanging by his collar from one of the meat 
           hooks... FROZEN BODY BAGS dangling around him.

           Lucky breathes a heavy sigh. HIS BREATH SPELLS “FUCKED” 
           ACROSS THE AIR.

                                             CUT TO:

           EXT. CORNER OF 55TH AND 5TH - NIGHT

           The busiest corner in the city as far as wholesale women go. 
           A one stop shop and go for any STD on the market. Nick pushes 
           through the riff-raff and finds Harley hitting a fresh joint. 
           He takes her by the arm.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        How ‘bout a freebie?

           Nick is a mess. Scrapes. Bruises. Flesh wounds of the like.

                                 HARLEY
                        Jesus. What happened, Nicky?

           Harley wipes a streak of blood running from an open gash.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Cut myself shaving. 

                                 HARLEY
                        With what? A butcher knife? You’re 
                        chopped up pretty good. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Just got banged around - thought 
                        I’d see you about a fix-up. I’ll 
                        even pay by the hour.

           INT. THE FIASCO HOTEL - NIGHT

           Nick is up to his neck in bubble bath while Harley stitches 
           him up. He grits his teeth as she dabs a wound with alcohol, 
           then seals it with gauze. 

                                 HARLEY
                        So what’s with the suitcase? You 
                        packin’ for a bad trip? 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Only kind I take.

           He winces as she dabs another wound, his fingers digging into 
           the porcelain of an antique four-legged tub.
                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Thanks for the stitches, babe.

           Harley dabs his lip with some cotton. Nick stares her in the 
           eye, might be some emotion there if you look hard enough.

                                 HARLEY
                        I’d mend your wounds any day, Nick. 
                        It’s why I’ve never minded ya
                        takin’ a beating.

           The moment lingers. Then, Nick grabs Harley around the neck 
           and pulls her into the tub. She slides into him willingly, 
           taking his head from behind. They kiss. Momentum building...

           Nick tears her blouse wide open, breasts barely cresting the 
           suds. Passion ignites like brushfire. This is the kind of 
           love you don’t hold back on. Now...

           Nick rips her dripping wet panties from the water. Kissing 
           her rapid now, almost savage. The smell of sex in the air.

           Harley’s knees rise above the bubbles as she thrusts herself 
           into Nick. SHE MOANS. Water slapping against the rim of the 
           tub like a wave pool. SHE MOANS AGAIN. Nick’s hitting all the 
           right spots and he knows it.

           Nick cups her breast in his hand. The warmth of the water 
           makes her veins visible, because in this moment, she is truly 
           alive. And it’s the moment that everything comes to a climax.

                                          DISSOLVE TO:

           Harley holds Nick under the bubbles. He leans forward to pour 
           a shot of bourbon from a bottle resting in the soap dish. This 
           gives her another glimpse of his bullet wound. 

                                 HARLEY
                        Whose the guy behind the gun, Nick?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        He’s a sinner in a saint’s body.

                                 HARLEY
                        I always loved that guy. Sins n’ 
                        all. Every damn one a’ them. 
                    (beat)
                        I’m sorry about who I am, Nick. 
                        Sleepin’ around and all. I thought 
                        you were gone for good. The big 
                        sleep and all that jazz. I just 
                        wish I could take it back...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I’m over it. Besides, let’s face it, 
                        you’ll never teach kindergarten.

           Harley snuggles closer. 
                                 HARLEY
                        Tell me why you’re back. What are 
                        you really hidin’ in that closet a’ 
                        yours?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Skeletons. A whole lot of ‘em.
                    (beat)
                        That’s why I wanted out, Harls. A 
                        new life, a clean slate. I actually 
                        thought I could make good for all 
                        the shit I’ve done. Redemption, ya
                        know?
                    (lights a cigarette)
                        But when you’ve seen enough people 
                        die, put enough people in the dirt, 
                        there just ain’t enough of it to go 
                        around. I’m a condemned fella, see.

                                 HARLEY
                        And who’s this gal ya been chasin’?

           Nick stares at his reflection in the water, the eyes of a 
           cold blooded killer staring right back. He turns to Harley 
           and yields.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I was on a standard liquor run 
                        about a year back...

           SUPER:               A YEAR BACK

           And suddenly, SNOW FLAKES begin falling all around the tub - 
           yes, right there in the bathroom. Then the lights dim around 
           Nick & Harley, leaving only A SPOTLIGHT on the two.

           AND CAMERA SPINS CLOCKWISE AROUND THE TUB, CHANGING THE SCENE 
           TO:

           EXT. FIASCO BAY BRIDGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK - BLACK & WHITE

           SIX TUDOR TRUCKS wait in the middle of the bridge. It’s 
           foggy, snowing, wind so fierce it could take your face off. 
           And now, we find Nick filling a flask from a leaking LIQUOR 
           BARREL strapped down in the truck bed. Looks like there’s 
           about 10 barrels in all being transferred on this run.

                                 NICK THE SAINT (V.O.)
                        We were moving ten barrels of hard 
                        stuff up the city limits. That’s 
                        when Doughboy decided to downsize. 
                        He knew I was gettin’ out, see.

           Nick turns to find a loaded pistol in his face, and MICK THE 
           MORMON is the one holding it.

                                 NICK THE SAINT (V.O.)
                        He ordered my partner to put the 
                        led in my back, just for a splash 
                        of irony.

                                 NICK THE SAINT (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        I remember exactly what he said 
                        right before tuggin’ the trigger...

                                 THE MORMON 
                        I wish I could say the devil made 
                        me do it, but he’s not the one 
                        signin’ my check.
                    (”click”)
                        The only way out of this town, for 
                        you Nick, is in a wooden overcoat. 

           BAM! Nick goes down, snow turning red as he bleeds out.

           CAMERA WHIPS OUT OF THE FLASHBACK AND BACK ON NICK/HARLEY:

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        And he woulda’ shot me again, for 
                        giggles, if the cops didn’t show 
                        up. The good guys - 31st division.

           RED & BLUE LIGHTS BEGIN FLARING UP THROUGHOUT THE BATHROOM.

                                 NICK THE SAINT (CONT’D)
                        Seems the Haitians we were selling 
                        to ratted our score to the PD. They 
                        had wanted to take over our outfit, 
                        see. Mergers, acquisitions... every 
                        syndicate in town was trying to 
                        gain turf and maximize power. 
                    (beat)
                        Mormon was taken in, but the rest 
                        of Doughboy’s crew were ducks.

           GUNSHOTS ECHO AROUND THE BATHTUB.

           INSERT FLASHBACK MONTAGE

           EXT. CITY LIMITS - NIGHT - BLACK & WHITE

           - Nick staggers through some trees, past the city limit sign, 
           where in the distance, we come to A CONVENT.

                                 NICK THE SAINT (V.O.)
                        I sucked up some leftover strength 
                        and carried myself across the 
                        bridge. Found refuge just over the 
                        city limits.

           - TWO NUNS rush from the convent as Nick stumbles and faints 
           at its doorsteps.

           - Now, Nick is lying in bed while a few nuns care for him. 
           One is praying beside him, another nursing his wounds. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT (V.O.)
                        The sisters nursed me back into 
                        fair condition. One in particular. 
                        Her name was...
           The sister mending his wound removes the led slug from his 
           back with some rusted tweezers. She rises to soak a towel in a 
           bowl of hot water. And as her face comes into frame, we see... 

                                 NICK THE SAINT (V.O.)
                        Sister Hope Caufield.

           - Nick’s room at the convent. He hobbles into frame on a 
           wooden crutch, removes a hidden bottle of scotch from behind 
           a framed picture of the convent. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT (V.O.)
                        It took four weeks to get back on 
                        heels. That’s when she stopped by 
                        my room, caught me tryin’ to drink 
                        my lunch from the bottle.

           Nick turns to find Hope sitting on his bed nearby.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I offered her a sip, but she took 
                        her meals any which way but wet. 
                        Good nun, bad Catholic. 
                    (beat)
                        Either way, we were playin’ hearts 
                        by mornin’ mass.

           - Nick and Sister Hope lying in bed as a new sun gleams 
           through the blinds. They kiss -- in rapid fire. 

           - A FEW ELDERLY NUNS hand Nick a red crucifix while he eats. 
           They begin speaking, but we won’t make out the words...

                                 NICK THE SAINT (V.O.)
                        Before bein’ released, the sisters 
                        gave me a charge. Said I was the 
                        soldier of a worthy cause now.

           The nuns step aside revealing THE “SALVATION” CASE.

                                 NICK THE SAINT (V.O.)
                        They wouldn’t tell me what it was, 
                        but said the only precious thing left 
                        in this damned world was inside it.
                    (beat)
                        They asked me to safely escort it to a 
                        waiting party in the east. It was no 
                        longer safe at the monastery - too many 
                        interested parties. 

           Pan to find Sister Hope listening from behind a cracked door.

                                 NICK THE SAINT (V.O.)
                        I owed the sisters my life, so I 
                        agreed of course. But the prize was 
                        gone the next day, and Hope was 
                        gone with it.

           BACK ON: Nick and Harely in the tub.
                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        So that’s my tale, doll. And it 
                        don’t get no taller.

           OFF SCREEN: THE DOORBELL RINGS.

           Nick looks at Harley. She shrugs without a clue. Nick steps 
           out of the tub and throws on a bathrobe. 

           INT. FRONT DOOR - NICK’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Saint opens the front door to greet...

           POW!! A HARD BLOW TO THE JAW that literally lifts him off his 
           feet and into the living room. And THE POPE enters, charging 
           Nick like a juiced up bellhop with fresh headaches to deliver.

           SLOW ON: THE POPE’S DISTORTED FACE, and we hear the SFX of a 
           BULL SNORTING. A steriod induced bull that’s coked out of its 
           fucking mind of course. 

           Nick climbs to his feet and reaches for a GUN on the coffee 
           table -but- he doesn't quite make it before POPE grabs him by 
           the robe and flings him into the wall --

           -- Exploding through the other side in an eruption of 
           drywall, and slamming into an armoire in the bedroom.

           Nick quickly jumps onto the bed and REACHES UNDER THE PILLOW. 
           HE WHIPS OUT A DESERT EAGLE and takes a few misguided shots. 
           BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. Nothing serious. 

           THE POPE enters the bedroom in a rabid charge. He grabs Nick 
           and lifts him by the robe, then ... SLAM... puts him against 
           the wall in a fierce choke hold.

           Nick struggles for air. He reaches for a full bottle of wine 
           resting on a nearby dresser -- maybe this is a good idea. 

           CRACK! Not really. The bottle shatters over The Pope’s skull 
           with no result - leaving us with nothing but 500 lbs. of 
           pissed off bad guy.

           THE POPE LAUNCHES NICK ACROSS THE ROOM. His body hits the 
           ground, sliding across the hard wood floor into the next 
           room.

                                 THE POPE
                        Honestly, I hoped you’d be bigger.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Yeah. Me too.

           SUDDENNLY - Saint grabs a HOT IRON off of an ironing board 
           and slides across the floor on his knees. He rears back...

           SMACK! Nick hooks The Pope square in the nuts with the iron. 
           Steam hisses as the thug’s sack gets branded by Black & 
           Decker. 
           Pope grabs Saint by the neck!!! Squeezing tight!!!

           IN THE BATHROOM

           Harley covers herself with suds as PINSTRIPES and JONES 
           enter. She gasps as Pinstripes saunters up close.

                                 PINSTRIPES
                        No need to be shy, just the postmen 
                        ringin’. And we’re here for a pick-
                        up.

           Pinstripes grabs SALVATION and kneels to tub level. Then he 
           thrusts his hand into the water, grabbing her between the...

                                 PINSTRIPES
                        You even think about screamin’, and 
                        I’ll knot your neck tighter than 
                        those tied tubes you let everyone 
                        poke around at. 
                    (to Knockout)
                        Dry her off. We’ll take this piece 
                        of patch to go.
                    (stops, reconsiders)
                        On second thought...

           He turns, aims: Bang-Bang-Bang.

           EXT. THE FIASCO HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           NICK IS LAUNCHED OUT THE 15TH STORY WINDOW. DEAD FREEFALL. In 
           descent, HE CRASHES THROUGH FIVE VERTICAL NEON LETTERS 
           SPELLING OUT FIASCO. Each letter shatters into glass & sparks 
           as he falls. F-I-A-S-C... 

           ...Saint hits the O, which doesn’t shatter - merely shifts 
           and partially breaks away from the wall. He hangs on for dear 
           life. Our hero, hanging above the city from a neon letter in 
           his bathrobe.

           The Pope appears on the fire escape and makes his way down to 
           meet us. Nick is a sitting duck.

           NOW - Nick pulls the gun from his bathrobe pocket and unloads 
           hell. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. CLICK. CLICK. And we’re empty.

           Pope smiles and begins sliding on some leather gloves. His 
           shoddy laugh telling us that Nick hasn’t landed a shot. 

           Until, of course, we catch sight of the smoke rising up from 
           his chest. The laughing stops, smiles fade, guy’s so jacked 
           up it probably took him a few seconds to feel the pain. He 
           begins to groan... slowly reaching for his own piece.

           Nick has nothing left. No defense. He hangs in silence for a 
           moment -THEN- in spontaneous desperation, HE THROWS THE EMPTY 
           DESERT EAGLE.
           CLUNK. Pope’s head kicks back as the heavy weapon beans him in 
           the face. The Pope stumbles back in a temporary daze, his arms 
           flailing about as he collides into the railing and drops over 
           the edge.

           The earth shakes as his body THUDS to the ground. A short 
           flight. Estimated time of arrival... 4 seconds.

           Nick grabs a drain pipe and glances at The Pope’s lifeless body 
           - shards of asphalt broken up all around it. The impact of the 
           fall alone has set off every car alarm in a two block radius. 
           Let’s just call this professional handiwork on the fly. 

           Nick smirks to himself and begins to shimmy down the drain 
           pipe. As he reaches the ground, he checks Pope’s neck for 
           pulses. Nothing. Then suddenly...

           HEADLIGHTS coming straight at us! Nick has a second to react, 
           but he wastes it wondering, what the fuck! The car thwacks 
           him at the waist and sends him over the hood. 

                                        SMASH TO BLACK:

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Hey. Pssst. Nick is that you?
                    (beat)
                        Hey Nick. It’s me... Lucky.
                    (beat)
                        Nick. WAKE THE FUCK UP!

           INT. MEAT LOCKER - NIGHT 

           Nick opens his eyes to find himself hanging from a meat hook, 
           hands bound, with Lucky hanging just across the freezer. He 
           immediately makes a muffled cry through his duct-taped gag...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Mmmmm mmm mmmm? Mm mm mmmmmmm?
                    (subtitle:)
                        “WHAT THE FUCK? WHAT THE FUCK?”

                                 LUCKY
                        Yeah. I hear ya.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Mmmm mmm mm?
                    (subtitle:)
                        “WHERE ARE WE?”

                                 LUCKY
                        We’re at the Chop Shop.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Mmm mmmm mmmm? Mmmm. Mmmm mmmm’mm
                        mmmm. M mmm’m mmmmmm mmm mmmm!
                    (subtitle:)
                        “THE CHOP SHOP? GREAT. JUST FUCKIN’
                        GREAT. I CAN’T BELIEVE THIS SHIT!”
           FREEZE FRAME:

           AND SUDDENLY -- Lucky bursts into a very fast, very fluent 
           narration describing our surroundings.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        The Chop-Shop. So called for the 
                        hundreds of immigrant children 
                        illegally gift wrapping on the 
                        bottom floor.

           CAMERA SUDDENLY DROPS BELOW THE FLOOR, WHIRLING INTO A 360 
           DEGREE ROTATION. AND WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE CHOP-SHOP...

           Where groups of foreign children sit at long tables slaving 
           away on BRICKS OF COCAINE. Beads of sweat drip down their 
           faces -- you can’t buy this kind of labor. 

           The kid to the right cuts - who then passes to the kid who 
           packs - who then passes to the kid who wraps. The brick is 
           then dropped in a wheelbarrow at the table’s end. It’s a 
           solid procedure.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Damn kids are the best in the 
                        business. I know it sounds bad, but 
                        hell, it’s better than pumpin’ out 
                        sweaters or high end tennis shoes. 

           Another kid comes by and lifts the FULL WHEELBARROW. WE STAY 
           ON HIM as he wheels it down an empty corridor and dumps the 
           load INTO A LAUNDRY SHOOT. 

           WE DROP INTO THE SHOOT ALONG WITH THE FRESH BRICKS.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Each shipment is then dumped...

           WE WHIP THROUGH THE SHOOT - OUT OF THE SHOOT - AND DROP INTO 
           THE BACK OF A STOCKED SNOW PLOW.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        ...Loaded into a dozen snow plows, 
                        and shipped out to every slum and 
                        pissed up alley in Fiasco.

           NOW - A GARAGE DOOR OPENS AS A FLEET OF SNOW PLOWS EXIT THE 
           WAREHOUSE. Each one turning into a different route than the 
           last. And the latest shipment of drugs hits the city.

           WE ZOOM IN ON: ONE OF THE BRICKS. This particular brick then 
           dissolves into another that is presently sliding across the 
           children’s table. A visual effect that proves this process is 
           an endless cycle.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Pack. Drop. Rinse. Repeat. There’s 
                        always fresh powder in this 
                        forecast. And that’s just life in 
                        the Chop-Shop.
           The kids laugh, all starring forward at a mini-television. On 
           it, A BARNEY-LIKE DINOSAUR prances along to some dumbed-down 
           lyrical catastrophe.

                                 DINO THE DINOSAUR
                        Come on kids - sing with me.

                                 KIDS (ALL)

                        WATER-SPOUT...

           CAMERA RIPS BACK UP THROUGH THE CEILING AND TURNS ANOTHER 360 
           - AND WE’RE BACK ON NICK/LUCKY IN THE MEAT LOCKER...

           Nick tries to shake himself off the hook. No use.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Mm mmmmm mmm mmmmm mmmm. Mmmm mmm
                        mmm mmmm. Mmmm mmm mmm’m mmm mm...
                    (subtitle:)
                        “WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE. THEY GOT 
                        THE CASE. THE GOD SQUAD’s GOT IT...

           ...The refrigerated door cracks as KNOCKOUT JONES enters the 
           locker. He pushes aside some meat and grabs Nick around the 
           collar of his robe. He lifts him off the hook.

           INT. COMMUNITY SHOWER - CHOP SHOP - FEW MOMENTS LATER

           WHACK! Nick takes a crushing hook to the jaw. WHACK! Fresh 
           DNA sprays across the room. SIX BRUTISH POLICE OFFICERS 
           (52nd) are pummeling him, just like the scene from our open. 

           The cops back-off. the chair spinning dilatorily, allowing us 
           to view Nick’s beaten face in glimpses of flickering light.

                                 DOUGHBOY (O.S.)
                        Looks like you gotta knack for 
                        musical chairs. Here you are, best 
                        seat in the house.

           As the chair spins back around, we reveal the most 
           disgusting, hideously  FAT FUCK you’ve ever laid eyes on. 
           This is DOUGHBOY, kingpin of Fiassco Heights. MICK THE MORMON
           stands in the shadows behind him.

           He tosses a few tater tots in his mouth, then squeezes a 
           packet of ketchup right into his mouth. Notice that the 
           ketchup packet MATCHES the one Nick found at McBanisters.

                                 DOUGHBOY
                        Want some tots?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I’m full.

                                 DOUGHBOY
                        Suite ya’self.
           Now, Doughboy unwraps a bean burrito -and- takes a huge bite.

                                 DOUGHBOY
                        I got some bones with ya, and it’s 
                        gonna be fun picking ‘em. 

           MORMON approaches Nick and backhands him with brass knuckles. 
           Blood disgorges, violently, sending another stray tooth 
           rattling across the tile.  Mormon steps back.

                                 DOUGHBOY
                    (chewing tots)
                        You’re grinnin’ all over the floor, 
                        Nick. I guess I speak for the both 
                        of us when I say we’re all smiles.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Don’t talk with your mouth full, 
                        fat lady -- you’ll never hit the 
                        high notes.

           Mormon clobbers Nick again.

                                 DOUGHBOY
                        I’m gonna watch you suffer, and I 
                        don’t give a furry fuck in the 
                        summer time how long it takes.

           Nick struggles for breath.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I shoulda known you were behind 
                        this, the plot was drippin’ with 
                        grease. 

                                 DOUGHBOY
                        I’m behind everything in this town.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Touche.

           Mormon backhands Nick AGAIN... more flesh tears. More blood.

                                 DOUGHBOY
                    (nodding to the case)
                        Salvation. 100% unfiltered, pure 
                        and uncut. I hear the contents of 
                        this case are beyond priceless. So, 
                        humor me, what’s in the case? Tell 
                        me, before I open it.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        One burger no lettuce... side of 
                        curly fries... and a cookie.

           SMACK. Mormon wallops Nick again.

                                 DOUGHBOY
                        Wise ass.
           Doughboy stands and cracks Nick across the jaw with his CANE, 
           then he nods to the 52nd officers, they leave the room.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Who pulled off the bank score?

           Doughboy takes another bite of his burrito...

                                 DOUGHBOY
                        I did. I assembled a crew right 
                        outta the Catholics own back yard.

                                 DOUGHBOY
                        The God Squad works for me now. 
                        See, I couldn’t have my own guys 
                        gettin’ caught shoplifting from the 
                        offering plate. No way. I ain’t 
                        gonna start a war over this.
                    (bite of burrito)
                        And that girl you been flossin’
                        for... she’s a real floozy.

                                 DOUGHBOY
                        But couldn’t have done it without 
                        her. She planted herself in that 
                        monastery just days before you went 
                        limp on their doorstep. The timing 
                        was impeccable. She played you like 
                        putty, pal.
                    (beat)
                        It’s gonna be classic when you...

           BLAM! Chunks of brain matter and burrito freckle Nick’s face, 
           bloody bone fragments splattering the walls. And we dolly 
           back to find THE MORMON HOLDING A HOT TRIGGER -- gun clearly 
           visible through the giant hole in Doughboy’s head.

                                 THE MORMON
                        Call me impatient, but I got sick 
                        of waitin’ on his monologue.

           Nick’s face is dripping with high cholesterol. 

                                 THE MORMON (CONT’D)
                        Don’t look so shocked, Nick. You 
                        should be happy I gave that fat 
                        fuck a B positive shoe shine. 

           Mormon grabs the case -- slides up a chair in front of Nick.

                                 THE MORMON (CONT’D)
                        Now it’s just back to you and me, 
                        like old times. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 THE MORMON (CONT’D)
                        With Doughboy singin’ somewhere 
                        over the rainbow, I’m gonna run 
                        this show. And this case is gonna
                        help get me started.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Why? You’re low on motive, Mormon.

                                 THE MORMON
                        Don’t need motive when there’s 
                        greed in the air. I’ve already got 
                        buyers lined up for this shit.
                        Catholics included. They offered 
                        big bucks along with a cut of their 
                        own turf. And that’s real power, 
                        Nick. Genuine fuckin’ power. 

           Mormon lights up a cigar.

                                 THE MORMON 
                        See, unlike you, I actually know 
                        what salvation is. 
                    (inhale-exhale)
                        It’s a new recipe your crazy nuns 
                        concocted. A drug so potent it’ll make 
                        heroin look like cough syrup. Every 
                        tweaker in the city will kill to put 
                        this shit in their arm, and one fix 
                        will cost thousands. The only thing 
                        standing in my way were the sisters - 
                        trying to hide it, keep it all for 
                        themselves. God bless ‘em. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You’re a liar.

                                 THE MORMON
                        No. I’m a drug dealer. Salvation is 
                        a high so pure you’d think God was 
                        right there walkin’ you through it. 
                        So clean it feels like redemption 
                        running through your veins. So warm 
                        you’d swear you were kissed by 
                        angels. You’ll wake up feeling like 
                        a new man, with a fresh start. And 
                        after you shoot up once, you’ll 
                        never have the urge to do it again.
                    (inhale-exhale)
                        That’s what you want, right Nicky?
                        A new life -- a clean start? 
                    (now a vicious glare)
                        But let’s just talk about how my 
                        boys two-holed that cunt-whore you 
                        brought into this...

           WHAM! NICK HEAD-BUTTS THE MORMON, blood spills from his mouth!

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        How those words taste?

           Mormon gets up and grabs a MEAT HOOK -then- swings it into 
           Nick’s shoulder. Nick flinches in pain as it pierces his 
           flesh.
           ANGLE ON: A RUSTED CAN OF LIGHTER FLUID.  Mormon grabs it, 
           begins dousing Nick. It’s soaking into his robe.

                                 THE MORMON
                        Don’t get brave. Just because I 
                        don’t drink coke or watch R rated 
                        flicks, doesn’t mean I won’t make 
                        this hurt.

           Mormon grabs the case, but before he goes, he’ll make sure to 
           flick his lighter and strategically place it over the central 
           drain of the shower room. Fluid trickling towards it. 

                                 THE MORMON
                        I’ll leave the lights on for ya, 
                        partner. Sweet dreams.

           Nick struggles to free himself. It’s useless - the chair 
           swivels but it won’t budge. He tries to blow out the flame. 
           He blows - and blows - and blows. But no dice.

           Then... Nick sees something. Two eyes peering from an empty 
           shaft in the wall. Someone is watching him. He looks closer.

           IT’S ONE OF THE KIDS FROM THE CHOP-SHOP BELOW.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Kid. Hey kid. I need your help...
                    (kid doesn’t budge)
                        Do you like candy?

                                          JUMP CUT TO:

           INT. STAIRWELL - CHOP/SHOP - NIGHT

           VICTIM #1: A heavy gangster climbing the stairs. He’s 
           wheezing like a fat kid who just ran a mile. Gangster stops 
           for a break and takes a puff from an inhaler.

           He struggles up a few more steps, the wheezing continues. He 
           opens his mouth for a second puff of the inhaler, but the raw 
           end of A GLOCK 18 SELECT IS STUFFED IN IT INSTEAD. 

           Fatty’s lips quiver around the barrel.

                                 NICK THE SAINT 
                        Hey Wheezy.

           A whining whimper from tubby as Nick takes the trigger in. 
           BAM! The inhaler goes airborne. 

           INT. HALLWAY - CHOP/SHOP - NIGHT

           VICTIM #2: A BALD GOON hears the gunshots. He runs around the 
           corner, gun leading the charge. Within seconds, a string of 
           wire lassos his neck and lifts him to the ceiling. 
           Victim kicks wildly, but Nick only tightens his grip -- 
           there’s no mercy in these eyes.

           Once dead, Nick checks the victim’s coat tag for sizes. Looks 
           like a match. He holds the coat firm and shakes the goon out 
           of it. He begins to suit up, as...

                                             CUT TO:

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CHOP SHOP - NIGHT

           KNOCKOUT JONES carries a stiffer version of Lucky out of the 
           meatlocker. He sets him in a chair as TWO POLICE THUGS begin 
           strapping him down. 

           Lucky’s teeth are still chattering.

                                 PINSTRIPES (O.S.)
                        Calm down now Eskimo, you’re 
                        talkin’ so fast I can’t make out 
                        the words. 

           PINSTRIPES lights a clove and exhales in Lucky’s face.

                                 PINSTRIPES (CONT’D)
                        You been leakin’ trouble from the 
                        start, Doyle. Now we’ve gotta fix 
                        your pipes for good.

           Pinstripes lays his hand on Lucky’s shoulder, massaging.

                                 PINSTRIPES (CONT’D)
                        Here it’s my day off and I’m about 
                        to get my suit all dirty. It’s not 
                        worth the time and a half.

                                 LUCKY
                        Don’t get anxious on coppin’ feels. 
                        I try to keep cock outta my diet.

           Pinstripes hooks Lucky across the chin.

                                 PINSTRIPES
                        I’ll assume that’s just the 
                        frostbite talkin’.

           CLICK... Pinstripes pops a SWITCHBLADE against Lucky’s cheek. 
           Razor sharp edge pressing into the bone. He goes eye-to-eye.

                                 PINSTRIPES (CONT’D)
                        Don’t let the stripes fool ya. Last 
                        guy that took me faint got cut more 
                        crooked than a sunset in boy’s 
                        town.

           Piercing the skin with the tip of his blade. 
                                 PINSTRIPES (CONT’D)
                        Let’s consider this your 
                        intervention. Just call it divine 
                        since you won’t be livin’ through it.

           He glides the point down Lucky’s jawline with a malevolent 
           smile. 

           Pinstripes nods to Knockout, who opens a burlap sack and 
           begins filling it with SALT. He then slips the bag over 
           Lucky’s head and seals it at the neck with duct tape.

           Knockout now removes a GRENADE from his sweatsuit and balls 
           it up in his fist. PUNCH. JAB. HOOK. JAB. JAB. UPPERCUT. He’s 
           just pummeling Lucky’s face like a punching bag. 

           LUCKY’S MUFFLED SCREAMS ECHO as the salt drives into each 
           fresh wound along with the Champ’s knuckles. He swallows a 
           mouthful of blood & salt, then screams again.

           AND SUDDENLY -- BAM! THE ECHO OF A GUNSHOT.

           All heads turn to PINSTRIPES. He gasps, clove falling from 
           his mouth. Slowly, the WHITE STRIPES IN HIS SUIT BEGIN 
           TURNING RED as blood slowly seeps into the fabric. AND...

           BAM!! His chest opens in an eruption of blood. Pinstripes 
           falls to his knees and keels over in a lifeless pile. Behind 
           him...

           NICK THE SAINT enters in a fume of rising smoke. TWO LOADED 
           SHOTGUNS in hand. He gives COP #1 a point blank introduction.

           Cop #1 goes for his piece - but too late - Nick has him 
           caught in a face-off with two smoking barrels. BAM!

           Nick drops and weaves as both Knockout and Goon #2 reach for 
           their guns. They unload hell -but- Nick makes his way across 
           the room using frozen body bags as cover.

           THE SAINT flips on KNOCKOUT. One barrel locked and loaded.

           BOOM! NICK PUTS A HOLE IN JONES. His body projects backwards 
           into a wall and drops clean. But remember that grenade he was 
           using as a punching weight? Well, it slowly rolls across the 
           floor... and the pin doesn’t seem to be in it. 

           Nick dives just as... BoooooooooM!

           Every wood plank in the ground splinters at the force of 
           discharge. Floor blasting in an eruption of debris forcing 
           all of our players to free-fall into the factory floor.

           Nick drops onto a cocaine cumbered table, while Lucky smashes 
           to the ground in his chair. He’s out cold.   

           NICK STANDS COVERED IN POWDER -- CHILDREN ARE SCREAMING, 
           RUNNING RAMPANT ALL AROUND US... 

           Lucky stirs under the burlap sack.
           THE SCREAMING CHILDREN bolt for any available exit while COP 
           #2 springs to his feet and begins firing like a guerilla on 
           overtime. The motherfucker is lightning quick. Lucky hits the 
           ground...

           BAM. BAM. BAM. BAM. BAM. BAM. BAM. BAM. BAM.

           NOW, Nick throws one of the tables on end and kicks it toward 
           his enemy - FIRING THROUGH THE WOOD AS IT SLIDES ACROSS THE 
           FLOOR...

           THE DINOSAUR MUSIC PLAYS OS.

           COP #2 empties his pistols and reaches back for a two-hand 
           refill. Bricks of cocaine are going off around us like fire 
           crackers. Flurries of dope fill the air -- it really is 
           snowing in this fucking place.

           Nick glissades the tabletops, escaping one bullet at a time. 
           Debris creating a haze beneath the symphony of hissing ammo.

           Cop #2 strips his guns to hollow clips and drops them to the 
           ground. He reaches for his last weapon - a beretta strapped 
           to his ankle. BAM. BAM. BAM. He continues where he left off, 
           this dive warehouse being taken to pieces. 

           Nick squints his eyes as specks of cocaine pelt his face. 
           Bullets making musical mayhem as they land around us.

           THE DINOSAUR MUSIC SEEMS TO BE PLAYING LOUDER.

           KA-BOOOM!! Chunks of Nick’s cover go up in a fray of wood. He 
           spins and fires his shotgun. Smoke sizzles from the open 
           chamber as two fresh shells are dispensed. Now...

           Nick dives behind a wooden column, clumps of it projecting 
           into the air. His hands shaking nervously as he reloads...

           A STRAY SHOT TRIGGERS SOME ELECTRICAL WIRES FROM A FUSE BOX - 
           AN ENORMOUS SPARK - FIRE SPREADS ALONG THE WALLS.

           ...CLICK. Saint says an abbreviated prayer. He’s ready, and he 
           fires to prove it. BOOM. GOON #2 is flung against the wall as 
           a table mushrooms in his face. His gun slides out of grasp...

           Cop #2 quickly jumps to his feet and charges us. Thinking 
           fast, Nick grabs a sharp instrument (same one the children 
           were using to cut up the drugs) and heaves it across the 
           room. It whirls through the air with a sharp whisp, and...

           THUNK. The cleaver-like tool lodges into the goon’s forehead. 
           Blood torrents down his face like the floodgates just opened.

           And suddenly, CLICK - CLICK - CLICK - CLICK - CLICK - CLICK. 
           An arsenal of weaponry sounds off as The Mormon and a handful 
           of Franchise goons take aim.

                                 THE MORMON
                        Fitting way for the two of us to 
                        end up. Can I get an Amen?
           Nick faces them down, loads two fresh clips - he’ll double 
           fist this round. And...

           SCENE GOES COMPLETELY SILENT:

           Nick steps into the clear and takes a gulp of his own nerve. 
           But all we’ll get to hear is THE BEATING OF HIS HEART.

           BA-BUMP. BA-BUMP. BA-BUMP.BULLETS ZIP ACROSS THE SCREEN FROM 
           ALL ANGLES AS THE GUNFIGHT BEGINS. Everything in sync with 
           the pace of Nick’s heartbeat. BA-BUMP. BA-BUMP. BA-BUMP.

           He turns his head just as a BULLET GRAZES HIS CHEEK. Hot ammo 
           pings across frame, bodies going down with elegance around 
           him, as if the whole thing was choreographed by Bob Fosse.

           SOUND RETURNS: As Nick finds himself standing, miraculously, 
           with about 5 HOLES IN HIS OVERCOAT.

           Now, he aims into the camera -and- puts out one last shot 
           into The Mormon’s chest. Mormon goes down with gusto.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Amen.

           <BOOOM> Another circuit blows as Nick slaps Lucky conscious. 
           Fire roaring across the walls - this place has ignited.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        C’mon Doyle -- wake up!

           Then, BAM, Nick takes A SHOT IN THE BACK -and- keels to the 
           ground. A WOUNDED MORMON sits up against the wall across the 
           room - he’s bleeding out bad, dying. Nick slumps against the 
           opposite wall... THE CASE LYING DIRECTLY BETWEEN THEM BOTH.

                                 THE MORMON
                    (re: Nick’s back)
                        I know, that’s twice. I’ll tell ‘em 
                        your last words were “watch my 
                        back”. That’ll just kill at 
                        cocktail parties.

           Nick presses a thumb to his shoulder, applying pressure to 
           the wound.

                                 THE MORMON (CONT’D)
                        Seriously, I’m choking on the 
                        bittersweet of it all.

           AND POP!  Mormon screams like hell as his knee cap goes off 
           like a firecracker. Smoke surging from below Nick’s face, 
           where he firmly has the .38 “SPECIAL” aimed under his jacket.

           Nick smiles until... DING... the cargo elevator stops on 
           their floor. Doors opening slowly to reveal SISTER HOPE 
           CAUFIELD. She sexually saunters into the smoke, passing right 
           between Nick & Mormon. She reaches down and grabs the case.
           AN UNSETTLING FEELING COMES OVER NICK when he makes eye 
           contact with her. The heartache shows in his expression.

                                 HOPE
                        Don’t act so surprised, Nick, it 
                        doesn’t suit you. I’m no virgin 
                        when it comes to playin’ naughty. 
                        You should’a seen that.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I didn’t know you’d sell out for 30 
                        specks of silver. That’s all.

                                 HOPE
                        Try 15 million specks of silver and 
                        we’ll share the same page.

                                 THE MORMON
                    (through utter agony)
                        Nick, I’d like you to meet my wife. 
                        Or, one of them anyway. How’s that 
                        for twists?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                    (to Hope)
                        This whole thing was a play and I 
                        fell right between the lines. You 
                        stole the case and stashed it at 
                        the bank for your hubby here. 
                        Mormon just played dummy until The 
                        Catholics agreed to pay big, then 
                        ya tried to clean out everyone 
                        involved. Even Doughboy and your 
                        own outfit.

                                 THE MORMON
                        Plan B - we just sit back and let 
                        you clean ‘em all out for us.

           Hope walks over to her dying husband.

                                 HOPE
                        Bravo Nick. Ya solved the puzzle, 
                        but ya don’t get the prize this 
                        time around.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I’ve already had the prize, Hope. 
                        You’ve given it up a few times now. 
                        Unfortunately, I’d like to return 
                        it... too loose.

                                 HOPE
                        Don’t flatter yourself! I was 
                        always in the driver’s seat.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        And I was always in your rear.

           BAM! Mormon fires above Nick’s head. A miss. His final shot.
                                 THE MORMON
                        Hey! You’re talking about my wife!!

           Nick looks at his wound, blood trickling down his sleeve.  

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        How could you do it, Hope?

                                 HOPE
                        Don’t you understand? There ain’t 
                        no Hope. Never was. I posed like a 
                        school girl until the sisters 
                        showed the goods. Frankly, I 
                        couldn’t wait to get outta there. 
                        It drove me nuts - those bitches 
                        need to get laid. 

                                 THE MORMON (O.S.)
                    (coughs blood)
                        Baby... I may some help here... 

           Hope immediately turns her aim at Mormon.

                                 HOPE
                        Shucks honey, this case is only 
                        packed for one.

           BAM! The blow catches Mormon right between the eyes. His head 
           kicks back in a gust of blood, arms flailing to the side. 

           She turns back on Nick...

                                 HOPE
                        Sorry Nick. It was sweet, really 
                        sweet. But I love killing a good  
                        romance.

           She steps closer to him, cocks her gun...

           BAM. ANOTHER SHOT RINGS OUT. Hope stumbles backwards, blood 
           running down her neck. A look of extreme confusion takes face 
           as she slowly drops to the ground, spitting blood.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Let’s just make it a clean break. 

           More smoke surging in Nick’s eyes as he removes the “SPECIAL” 
           that is STILL tucked inside his coat.

                                 HOPE
                        Sa-save me, Ni-ck. Pl-ease save m-
                        me. Give me... what’s... in... th-
                        that ca-case... plea...

           Her body begins convulsing. Violently. Saliva spilling down 
           her cheek, fingernails digging into the concrete floor.

           NICK watches her for a moment, reaches for THE CASE. Then...
           ...HE OPENS IT.

           And there it is... SALVATION. AN 8” SYRINGE loaded with a 
           dense, crystal clear fluid. It almost has a surreal glow 
           within the streaks of moonlight shining through the flames.

           Nick stares at the syringe. This drug... this simple fucking
           drug... is the cause of all this. The one thing he was sent 
           to retrieve is just a needle filled with untested product.

           He reaches into the case, hands trembling. Lifts the needle 
           over Hope. She’s begging him, crying, pleading that maybe it 
           will kill the pain. Somehow.

                                 HOPE
                        Please. Nick.. it... it hurts.

           We can read the conflict on his face. A tear forming, rolling 
           down his cheek. His first sign of emotion... of weakness. 
           Maybe he did love this woman once. But only once.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I can’t.

           Her convulsions turn extreme. Blood torrents from her nose, 
           her mouth. Then her eyes roll back into her head. Gone.

           More moonlight spreads across scene as Nick places the 
           syringe back in the case. He picks himself up.

           He stumbles over to a semi-conscious Lucky, unties him.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Let’s get the hi-fuck outta here. 

           Nick holds the “salvation” and lifts Lucky onto his shoulder. 
           Together they hobble for the drop-shoot, the ceiling coming 
           down all around us.

           THE ROAR OF FIRE - WITH SOME BARELY AUDIBLE DINOSAUR MUSIC.

           INT. GARAGE - CHOP/SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           LUCKY and NICK DROP FROM THE SHOOT and land in a SNOW PLOW 
           brimming with coke. The two of them are blanketed as they 
           break open every brick upon landing.

           CLOSE ON: Our guys caked in white powder as the snow plow 
           pulls out of the garage. Both freckled in drugs & blood. The 
           Chop Shop going up in a blaze of fire behind them...

                                          DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. FIASCO HEIGHTS - DAY - ESTABLISHING

           The city is bustling. The streets more alive than ever. It 
           isn’t raining today. 
           And we track through the rooftops of Fiasco Heights, slowly 
           coming to FIASCO CENTRAL STATION. A structure that resembles 
           Grand Central if built during the Roman Empire.

           EXT. CENTRAL STATION - DAY 

           DELI is loading Nick’s bag into the taxi cab. Nick, arm in a 
           fresh sling, takes the “salvation” from Lucky.

                                 LUCKY
                        How ya feelin’, pal?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Like someone shot me in the back. 
                        You?

           Lucky smiles at the sarcasm for the first time. THEN...

           CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. Not again. And Nick/Lucky turn to 
           find a hard boiled crew of Catholic priests holding semi-
           automatics. Father Pisarro stands at the front of the group.

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        I think you got somethin’ that 
                        belongs to us, fellas.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                    (smiles)
                        In fact, I think we do, father.

           Nick hands over the BLACK CASE without a fuss.

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                    (to other clergy)
                        See brothers, even the blackest of 
                        sheep can still find their way. 
                    (to Nick/Lucky)
                        The Church thinks it’s best you two 
                        hitch outta town. Pronto. 
                        Otherwise, you’ll be escorted to 
                        the retreat for sinners. Just in 
                        time for 40 days and 40 nights of 
                        high tide on the Rawley.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You’re absolutely right, Father. 
                        I’m actually just leaving now. This 
                        place isn’t my scene anymore.

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        Right. Then go with God.

           And the holy mob mumbles amongst themselves, then turn to 
           slowly fade into a sea of pedestrians.

                                 LUCKY
                        Why’d you just hand it over? What’s
                        really in that thing?
                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Can’t say, but I’m pretty sure that 
                        this time... it goes boom.

           Lucky chews on that for a second, then cracks a grin as Deli 
           hands Nick the METALLIC CASE. Nick cuffs it to his wrist.

                                 LUCKY
                        You switched the cases?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Just a little trick I learned in 
                        pre-school. Let’s only hope they 
                        don’t open it till they get home.

           Nick winks at Lucky.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Maybe there is redemption out 
                        there, friend, just doesn’t always 
                        come in shiny black cases.

                                 DELI(O.S.)
                        Almost rush hour, Nick.

           Nick removes a BLACK CARD from his coat and hands it to 
           Lucky. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        If you ever need to find me... 
                        don’t. 

           INSERT CARD: “NICK PRINE: GUN FOR HIRE”.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Nevermind the gun for hire... it’s 
                        an old card, but the name still 
                        works.  I’m leavin’ that whole 
                        business, see.  Searchin’ for a new 
                        motto - with a lower body count.  
                    (thinking twice)
                        But then again, ya can’t turn a new 
                        leaf if ya’ve already burned ‘em 
                        all. Right?

                                 LUCKY
                    (faint smile)
                        So where do you go now?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I return the case and head east. 
                        Catch up on some reading. Maybe 
                        look into real estate... I think I 
                        could make a killing.

           Nick cringes as Lucky gives him a bear hug. He begrudgingly, 
           and painfully, returns with a pat or two.

                                 LUCKY
                        Who are you really, Nick?
                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Me? Oh, I’m just a bad guy tryin’
                        to make some good of the world. 
                    (considering)
                        At least I hope to someday.

           Nick painfully climbs into the cab.

                                 LUCKY
                        This is the end I take it?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        For now.
                    (final nod)
                        Best wishes, pal. I pray you’ll 
                        find the right streak to tread on 
                        until we meet again. 

                                 LUCKY
                        I’ll damn well try.

           And with that, Nick shuts the door. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Let’s roll, Deli.

           We stay on the cab as it departs, tracing aerially as it 
           races from the city, across the Fiasco bridge, and 
           disappearing in a misty rain.

           ON LUCKY

           Looks down at Nick’s card in his hand. 

                                 LUCKY
                        Oh, I think my streaks are already 
                        changin’.

           AND, IN A QUICK CUT:

           INT. CASION ‘69 - NIGHT

           Here we find DOYLE sitting at a POKER TABLE with FIVE other 
           players seated along with him. 

                                 LUCKY
                        And that’s how I found salvation.

                                 POKER PLAYER #1
                        So, what now Lucky?

           On that note, Lucky pushes all his chips into the pot. 

                                 LUCKY
                        Now? Well now... I go all in.

           AND HE GIVES US THAT LUCKY SMILE ONE LAST TIME.
                                              the end...
