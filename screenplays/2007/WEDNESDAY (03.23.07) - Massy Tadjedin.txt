          DREAMWORKS
             CARD ONE:

             Someone drives away from the police in Los Angeles County about  fifteen 
             times a day.

             CARD TWO:

             Someone won't make it today.  

             TITLE CARD:

             Wednesday.
           We move over, by, in, and around Los Angeles as CARRIE 
           answers SOMEONE’S questions. We meet some of our 
           CHARACTERS when they still couldn’t guess the day ahead. 

           EXT. 7-11 CONVENIENCE STORE, MORNING

           JAY FITCH-- around 30-- has just bought his first cup of 
           COFFEE for the day at the 7-11. One of the first things 
           we notice about Jay is his RIGHT EYE: red blood covers 
           most of the white part of it.

                                 CARRIE (O.S.)
                        It happens like this: you walk out 
                        your front door one day...and 
                        everything that had nothing to do 
                        with you can suddenly have 
                        everything to do with you. 

           Jay doesn’t talk much. Perhaps that’s why when he does, 
           his speech seems broken. His eyes, though-- even the 
           ailing one-- seem to take in everything.

           Jay sips his coffee on the way to his worn, PICK-UP 
           TRUCK. A long-neglected dent marks the front of the car.

           Jay wears jeans, and his shirt untucked. Nearly 
           everything about him is visibly tense.

           INT. APARTMENT, CALABASAS

           CARRIE STONE is 26 years old. She’s just showered. Her 
           face is clean and young.

                                 CARRIE (O.S.)
                        Right this second, there’s a Me 
                        out there. She just doesn’t know 
                        she’s me yet. But she is, and her 
                        life is seconds away from 
                        changing.

           Carrie makes a cup of COFFEE in the dated kitchen of her 
           studio. Her apartment reflects responsibility, and good 
           taste. Nothing is out of place; nothing ever has been.

                                 SOMEONE ELSE (O.S.)
                        Do you think it was avoidable?

                                 CARRIE (O.S.)
                        Sure. I mean...what isn’t?

           Carrie goes to her computer while the coffee brews. Open 
           on her SCREEN is an E-MAIL:

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Hi, Ms. Stone. I wanted to confirm that you are meeting with Nathan 
           Bookman tomorrow at 1pm. Our office will call you tomorrow morning 
           to set the location. 

           - Shalu Patel, Asst. To Mr. Bookman

           Carrie walks over to the bed, where TWO OUTFITS-- pants 
           and a top, and a dress-- have been meticulously laid side 
           by side. She dials her Mom from her cell phone.

                                 CARRIE (CONT'D)
                        Hey...I know-- I should have! But 
                        I can’t sleep. Of course I’m 
                        excited....

           Carrie pours herself COFFEE while she chats.

                                 CARRIE (CONT'D)
                        I called in sick. No, Mom, I’m not 
                        sick. I lied. We don’t get 
                        personal days. Ok, Mom....

           INT. ‘99 JEEP WRANGLER

           DECKER WALSH, late 30s, drives in a ‘99 Jeep Wrangler. 
           His coffee is in the COMMUTER MUG on his lap.

           DECKER is a Lieutenant in the LAPD in plain clothes 
           because it’s Wednesday. 

           Wednesday is Decker’s day off.

           The attach-if-you-have-to SIREN LIGHTS on the passenger 
           seat suggest his association with authority.

           Decker turns on his radio. The volume STARTLES him. He 
           SPILLS the hot coffee on his leg just as he pulls up to 
           the intersection. Decker closes his eyes, swallows his 
           anger, then reaches for a napkin.

           A WOMAN in the car next to him has seen all this.

                                 DECKER
                        Goddamnit!

           INT. CARRIE STONE’S APARTMENT, 9:00 AM 

           CARRIE carefully blow-dries her hair. Her cell phone 
           rings. She runs over to answer it.

                                 CARRIE 
                        Hello. Yes. [Smiling] Yes, I’m 
                        confirmed.

                        I’ve never been there. Can you 
                        tell me the cross streets?

           She writes the address down on a piece of paper. 

                                 CARRIE (CONT'D)
                        Ok, got it. Thanks.

           Carrie immediately walks over to her computer, where she 
           Mapquests the directions. Everything about her morning, 
           her preparation for this day, is meticulous. 

           Her CELL PHONE rings again.

                                 CARRIE (CONT'D)
                        Hello. Hi, Susan. [Beat] I’m ok, 
                        thanks. I mean, I’m not...but, you 
                        know...it’s nothing. It’s just a 
                        stomach thing. [Beat] Exactly. 
                        Great. Annette is great.

           Carrie admires her new DRESS on the bed.

                                 CARRIE (CONT'D)
                        She’s subbed for me before. Yeah. 
                        Tell her their Heart of Darkness 
                        quiz is in my top right drawer...

           INT. STARBUCKS, LOS ANGELES

           MURRAY-- 40s, memorably affable, with kind eyes-- stands 
           in line at Starbucks. A MOTHER WITH HER TWO GIRLS delays 
           impatient commuters late for work by waiting for her 
           daughter to decide if she wants a hot chocolate or not.

                                 SUIT IN FRONT OF MURRAY
                        Christ, is this for fuckin’ real? 
                        Some of us have work to get to.

           SUIT turns around to solicit support from the line.

                                 MURRAY [Discreetly]
                        Don’t be a dick, Man. Don’t do it. 
                        It’ll kill your whole day. Count 
                        back from 10 and order your 
                        coffee.

           SUIT’s taken aback as he nonetheless takes Murray’s 
           point. The way Murray lowered his voice and didn’t make a 
           scene endears him to us.
           INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE

           JAY speaks on the phone in a cluttered warehouse office.

                                 JAY
                        I told you I’m getting it and I 
                        meant it. Just gimme a chance. 
                        It’s been a tough few weeks.

           On the other end of the line is the muffled voice of an 
           ANGRY WOMAN.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        What are you giving her lunch 
                        money for? She’s five...I’m not 
                        lecturing you...Look, just promise 
                        me you’ll wait...

           INT. AMINAH’S HOUSE, SHERMAN OAKS

           AMINAH-- 40s, Pakistani, second generation, in a pant 
           suit-- takes a final sip of her coffee in the kitchen-- 
           where a SMALL TV broadcasts NEWS that she’s not watching.

                                 AMINAH
                        Moni, we’re late! Mooh-ni!

           MONI is Aminah’s serious, far-too-smart-for-her-age 16 
           year-old daughter.

                                 MONI (O.S.)
                        Just a second. 

                                 AMINAH [Calling out]
                        What are you doing?

                                 MONI [Appearing in the hall]
                        I have a current event 
                        presentation. 

                                 AMINAH
                        And none of the current events 
                        were going on last night, when you 
                        were watching Lost?

                                 MONI 
                        They were starting to. But it’s 
                        6pm in Baghdad right now. How 
                        could I have known what kind of a 
                        day they had last night when they 
                        were just getting up?

                        Let’s go. We’re late.

           Aminah grabs her KEYS as she ushers Moni out the door.

           EXT. DECKER’S EX WIFE’S HOUSE

           DECKER stands outside a house, waiting for someone to 
           open the door. Finally, KIM ACOCELLA-- 40s (the sister of 
           a soon-to-be ex-wife, CYNTHIA)-- answers the door. 

                                 KIM
                        Cynthia’s not home.

                                 DECKER [Flatly]
                        Morning to you, too, Sunshine. 

                                 KIM
                        She has a cell phone, you know.  

                                 DECKER
                        Does me no good when she never 
                        answers it.

                                 KIM
                        Some people might take that as a 
                        blow-off.

                                 DECKER
                        She’s my wife.

                                 KIM
                        Not anymore.

                            DECKER
           Technically....
                                                  KIM [Cutting him off]
                                              What do you want, Decker?

                                 DECKER 
                        Cyn called about the shower in the 
                        master. She asked me to come by.

           She looks at him doubtfully.

                                 DECKER (CONT'D)
                        How else would I know it’s backed 
                        up?

                        Well, it’s not a good time. 

                                 DECKER
                        Why not?

           DECKER’s angry but he smothers it, and tries again.

                                 DECKER 
                        Look, why don’t you offer me a cup

                        I don’t have time for this. I have

                        Great. Get your pants cleaned.

                        that?

                                 KIM [Incensed]
                        Thank you. I knew you’d make it 
                        easy.

           Kim SLAMS the door on Decker. And locks it.

           INT. AMINAH’S BMW STATION WAGON

           AMINAH and MONI are in the car, driving to school.

                                 MONI
                        So far, 64 women have died 
                        serving. Only eight died in 
                        Vietnam. Once upon a time, people 
                        thought it was anti-American to 
                        see women fighting. But now...you 
                        got William Jaeger in this article 
                        saying, “I’d rather it’d be your 
                        daughter than my son.”

           AMINAH looks at her daughter as if searching for some 
           physical manifestation of what must be wrong with her. 

                                 AMINAH
                        Is there any way we could try to 
                        talk about something less morbid 
                        first thing in the morning?

                                 MONI [Indignant]
                        We’re talking about current 
                        events, Mom. And, sure, I can 
                        think of 1000 ways we might have 
                        made them less morbid. 

           AMINAH grabs a PACKAGE from the backseat and gives it to 
           MONI, who betrays no reaction as she takes it.

                                 AMINAH
                        Sarah’s mom said the girls aren’t 
                        carrying backpacks any more.

           MONI opens the package and takes out a LARGE TOTE BAG.

                                 AMINAH (CONT'D)
                        Do you like it?

           MONI half nods; she likes it, despite herself.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MONI
                        It looks expensive.

                                 AMINAH
                        It was on sale.

           INT. CARRIE’S BATHROOM  

           CARRIE’s every hair is done. She opens boxes of new make-
           up as she sings to Tom Petty’s “Last Dance with Mary 
           Jane”-- excited by everything because it belongs to this 
           long-awaited morning. She starts applying her make-up.

                                 CARRIE [Singing]
                        Well she moved down here at the 
                        age of 18/ She blew the boys away, 
                        it was more than they’d seen...

           INT. APARTMENT, BURBANK, CALIFORNIA

           CAMILLE PEREZ-- 29, FOUL mouth, foul temper, gorgeous, 
           gorgeous face-- searches for a shoe. The incongruous 
           combination of her striking looks and searing tongue is 
           only exasperated by the fact that she’s a mother. 

                                 CAMILLE [Arguing on the phone]
                        Will you stop with the fucking 
                        lecturing already? It’s not like 
                        you’re parent of the fuckin’ 
                        year...Whatever. All this 
                        bullshit’s easier to worry about 
                        than actually talking to your 
                        daughter, isn’t it? God forbid you 
                        worry about that instead of who’s 
                        in a five mile radius. Oh, I am so 
                        tired of these shit excuses... For 
                        the 90th time, it’s a two bedroom, 
                        two bath so she will have her own 
                        room!

           STELLA-- 5, a sweet, sweet kid-- appears in the doorway. 
           Camille aggressively continues hunting her missing shoe.

                                 CAMILLE 
                        I’m late, Jay. You’re making me 
                        late, and you’re making me fuckin’ 
                        pissed off...No, you’re right. I 
                        should just let us fall so fuckin’ 
                        behind we wind up in that deluxe 
                        motel room with you, that 
                        it?...[Beat] Fuck you, Jay.

           CONTINUED:

           Camille hangs up, sees STELLA standing there. 

                                 CAMILLE [No longer yelling]
                        Oh, FUCK. You were waiting for 
                        Mommy to come pick out your 
                        clothes. I’m sorry, Baby. We’ll do 
                        that now. Just let Mommy get some 
                        coffee first. 

           EXT. JIMMY’S MOVING COMPANY, CALABASAS, CALIFORNIA, DAY

           JAY’s outside the warehouse amidst some random, discarded 
           furniture. A logo on a truck tells us this outfit is 
           JIMMY’S MOVING COMPANY.

           FRED-- 40s, Hispanic, the only other employee-- is 
           focused on something on the WEB while JAY paces the 
           WAREHOUSE-- eyeing the discarded furniture.

                                 FRED [Guessing]
                        Camille?

           Jay nods. (We realize JAY and CAMILLE-- long separated-- 
           are Stella’s parents.)

                                 FRED 
                        You gotta just wake up one day and 
                        say to her: bitch be gone. Bitch, 
                        just be gone. Kid or no kid.

           Jay seems less than impressed by Fred’s advice. Fred 
           doesn’t notice as he adjusts his dated computer screen. 

                                 JAY
                        What are you doing?

                                 FRED
                        You can see her jugs if you blow 
                        up the picture. 

                                 JAY
                        Who?

                                 FRED
                        Britney Spears.

                                 JAY [Agitated]
                        No moves today?

                                 FRED
                        We got something at 3. 
                        [Explaining] It’s Wednesday.

                                 FRED
                        How much?

                                 JAY
                        [Beat] Few hundred.

                                 FRED 
                        I got like...40 and maybe another 
                        20 in the car. The rest Lourdes 
                        counts. You ask Jimmy?

                                 JAY
                        Yeah. He couldn’t do it.

                                 FRED
                        I told him we should partner up 
                        with some of the local furniture 
                        stores for some deliveries. We’d 
                        book twice as many jobs.

           Jay’s not listening to him anymore.

                                 JAY
                        I’m gonna head out for a little.

           EXT. CARRIE STONE’S APARTMENT, CALABASAS, MID-MORNING

           Carrie walks out of her apartment-- in her new DRESS. Her 
           apartment complex is off a busy street in Calabasas.  She 
           gets into her used white VOLVO STATION WAGON, parked on 
           the street-- relishing even this bit of her routine.

           INT. DECKER’S CAR

           DECKER pulls away from the house. (It’s just after he 
           called Cynthia’s sister, Kim, a whore).

           Decker’s cool until he reaches the stop sign. Then he 
           unleashes-- in a single, severe HIT to his dashboard.

           EXT. STRIP MALL, WOODLAND HILLS, DAY

           Jay pulls into the parking lot with a Bank of America, a 
           Subway, a Mail Boxes R Us, and a Sushi-to-Go.

           Jay’s LEFT EYE squints as he watches people going about 
           their days in the parking lot.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           We anxiously watch Jay watch them. Jay’s car has no air 
           conditioning. We feel the sweat beginning to gather on 
           him. Our anxiety swells as he leans and reaches beneath 
           the passenger seat. 

           He produces a .38 SEMI-AUTOMATIC. 

           Jay stares at that GUN forever. He loosens his grip on it 
           so that it’s just lying in his palm for a while.

           We guess the hundred deliberations behind his eyes. 
           Finally (and no sooner) Jay grips the gun and tucks it in 
           his pants, under his shirt, and he gets out of the car.

           EXT. STRIP MALL, CALABASAS

           From AFAR, we watch Jay cross the parking lot.

           INT. BANK OF AMERICA, CALABASAS

           Jay enters the bank and eyes some forms at the deposit 
           counter until at least a FEW PEOPLE queue up near the 
           TELLERS. He sizes the employees at their desks.

           After a short while, Jay joins the CUSTOMERS in line. The 
           WOMAN before the man before him goes up to a TELLER. JAY 
           fastens his eyes on her-- removing it only to glance at a 
           surveillance camera.

           Then the man before JAY goes. 

           JAY watches the man offer his teller an inane greeting.

           And then...it’s Jay’s turn. We watch-- searching for any 
           bulge the GUN beneath his shirt might make.

           Jay takes in the MALE TELLER he’d be paired with and 
           starts to approach him when, without warning, he turns to 
           the CUSTOMER behind him.

                                 JAY
                        You, ah...

           The CUSTOMER stares at him-- sensing, if nothing else, 
           Jay’s fierce intensity.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        [Beat] You go ahead.

           Jay leaves the bank with his aborted plan.
           EXT. STRIP MALL, CALABASAS

           Jay’s back in the parking lot, with a few more pounds of 
           frustration. His eyes roll over the couple people who 
           walk past him and the other BUSINESSES in the strip mall. 

           INT. SUBWAY SANDWICH, STRIP MALL, WESTLAKE VILLAGE

           There are no other customers buying sandwiches at the 
           relatively early lunch hour. There’s only a single SUBWAY 
           CLERK-- 20s, inoffensive-- working behind the counter.

                                 SUBWAY CLERK
                        Can I help you?

           JAY reaches for his GUN and holds it out, just above his 
           side. It takes the CLERK a moment to catch it because the 
           sandwich station is blocking his view. 

           The moment he does, the CLERK freezes.

                                 JAY
                        I don’t want to hurt you. I just 
                        want the money in your register.

           SUBWAY CLERK’s too stunned to speak, or move.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        So walk over there, open the 
                        drawer, take out the money and put 
                        it in a...put it in one of those 
                        bags and give it to me. 

           The CLERK doesn’t immediately move.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        Look at me. You don’t have to get 
                        hurt today. It’s not your store, 
                        right? 

           The CLERK can’t speak that easily. 

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        Man, you gotta fuckin’ answer me 
                        for this to work. Ok? It’s not 
                        your store, right?

                                 SUBWAY CLERK
                        Right.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 JAY
                        Right. Good. So walk over there... 
                        take out the money from the 
                        register and put it in the bag.

           Jay’s other HAND-- the one without the gun, down by his 
           side, concealed-- shakes. 

           INT. CARRIE’S VOLVO, DAY, CONCURRENT

           Carrie listens to the RADIO as she waits to make a left 
           on a green light. She turns as the light turns YELLOW. 

           DECKER’s car is the one that just missed the light. These 
           are among the final hardly-a-thought seconds of the day.

           INT. SUBWAY SANDWICH, DAY, CONCURRENT

           The SUBWAY CLERK hands JAY the last of the money.

                                 SUBWAY CLERK
                        It’s almost $800, man. 

           Jay rolls up the MONEY and stuffs it in his pocket.

                                 JAY [Thinking aloud]
                        No, actually...

           Jay motions to the SODA MACHINE with his GUN. The CLERK, 
           seeing the movement with the gun, DIVES down. JAY squints 
           -- trying to focus his LEFT EYE, out of which, we’re 
           beginning to conclude, he really can’t see well.

                                 JAY
                        Hey, no Man....I’m not gonna...

           Jay can’t finish; nerves impair his speech even more.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        I’m not gonna hurt you...I just... 
                        gimme one of those cups. The 
                        plastic ones....

                                 CLERK [Slowly getting up]
                        What size?

                                 JAY
                        Ah...I don’t...

           The CLERK, shaking, picks one and hands it to JAY. Jay 
           hands the MONEY back to the clerk.

                                 JAY [Re: the money]
                        Put it in there. And get one of 
                        those lids...Now...get down...on 
                        the floor.

           The CLERK gets down on the floor.

                                 JAY 
                        Stay there until you count to ah 
                        ...1000. Don’t call anyone before 
                        that. You do, and people’ll get 
                        hurt for $800. That’d be...trust 
                        me, you’ll feel like shit if that 
                        happens. All right...so...

           Jay doesn’t finish his sentence. We’re beginning to 
           notice how frequently he doesn’t.

           INT. DECKER’S CAR

           We’re inside DECKER’S CAR, watching him exit a STARBUCKS 
           in a different strip mall. Decker gets in the car. 

           The attach-if-you-have-to SIREN LIGHTS on the passenger 
           seat prevent him from putting his MUFFIN on it. DECKER 
           throws the LIGHTS in the back and takes out his muffin.

           INT. JAY’S CAR

           Jay gets in his car. We catch how clammy his hands are as 
           he places his GUN in the DIVIDER between the front seats.

           He lets out a deep breath. He looks in the rearview 
           mirror. Nothing appears to be on his trail.

           Jay pulls out of his parking space. 

           INT. DECKER’S CAR/ EXT. INTERSECTION

           Decker’s enjoying his DONUT as he drives. He changes 
           radio stations as his car approaches the intersection.

           EXT. INTERSECTION, VALLEY

           Jay can’t help it; he looks as on edge as he feels.

           So he can’t help appearing that way at the intersection 
           he happens to be sharing with LIEUTENANT DECKER WALSH, 
           who’s just pulled up...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           There is a moment.

           DECKER reaches to the side pocket of his driver’s seat 
           for a napkin to wipe some powder sugar from his face and 
           happens to be drawn to JAY-- two lanes over, readying to 
           make a U-turn to head in the opposite direction.

           It’s as if JAY anticipates the moment. He slowly turns 
           his head towards Decker. The two men’s eyes lock.

           It doesn’t matter that Decker’s not in a police car, or 
           that he has no way of knowing Jay’s just committed a 
           robbery. 

           Jay knows what Decker is. And Decker knows what Jay is.

           Decker’s light changes as JAY just barely makes his U-
           turn in oncoming traffic. Decker’s expression verges a 
           moment on genuine excitement.

           Decker pulls down his window and indicates to the car now 
           next to him to HOLD ON as he SWERVES across the 
           intersection-- barely missing at least two other cars as 
           he U-turns after Jay.

           The other drivers HONK furiously-- having no idea the man 
           in the Jeep is actually an officer of the law.

           INT. JAY’S TRUCK/ EXT. CALABASAS

           Jay instantly spots Decker on his trail. Jay RUNS the 
           LIGHT as Decker approaches the intersection. 

           He squints his LEFT EYE to be able to better see out of 
           his right. 

           We cut to his POV: Jay has no peripheral vision on his 
           left side-- making the SCREEN dark on that side and the 
           objects ahead BLURRED so that the composite of his vision 
           is terribly disorienting. 

           This glimpse of what he sees makes his speed unbearable.

           INT. DECKER’S CAR

           Decker reaches in the back for the SIRENS he put there 
           only minutes before. He can’t get at them. 

           Decker turns around briefly to look for them and the 
           SECONDS are enough that he’s only feet from another car 
           when he turns back. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Decker swerves, nearly hitting another car and, still, 
           despite both misses, raids the intersection while the 
           light is red and oncoming traffic keeps on coming...

           We watch Decker’s circumstances, compounded with his 
           adrenaline, create an extraordinary anger.

           INT. JAY’S TRUCK

           JAY turns right at his next light. Each time he checks 
           his mirrors, it’s two fewer seconds he’s focused on a 
           street far too crowded for him to be WEAVING as he is. 

           Jay’s thrown off by the fact that Decker’s in a Jeep 
           though he still suspects an affiliation with the law...

           EXT. VALLEY CIRCLE ROAD, CALABASAS

           The light ahead has already turned YELLOW when Jay pulls 
           his truck up on the SIDEWALK and speeds towards it-- 
           passing through it too long after it’s red. 

           CARS HONKING and brakes BRAKING and PEOPLE YELLING create 
           an ugly cacophony as objects barely miss Jay’s path.

           INT. DECKER’S CAR

           Decker’s having even more trouble on Jay’s tail. He 
           drives on the sidewalk-- following Jay’s move. As Decker 
           navigates the non-street, he tries to take out his PHONE 
           from his pant pocket as adrenaline complicates it all...

           EXT. INTERSECTION, VALLEY CIRCLE ROAD, THAT VERY SECOND

           A MOTHER WITH HER TWO GIRLS (from Starbucks) exits a 
           store. They’re about to cross the street when Decker, 
           coming out of nowhere, nearly flattens them as he speeds 
           through the intersection.

           MOTHER barely snatches the girls in the divider 
           separating them from the other side of the street. She 
           stares after Decker’s car-- stunned.

           As she’s staring, TWO CARS-- turning to avoid Decker-- 
           CRASH head-on into each other.
           INT. ARROWHEAD TRUCK DRIVER/ EXT. INTERSECTION

           An ARROWHEAD TRUCK DRIVER listens to talk radio as he 
           readies to move the three very large, immovable parts of 
           his water truck so that it can turn left.

           (We will frequently cut from the manic chase to 
           relatively quiet, seemingly ancillary events that don’t 
           remain ancillary for long.)

           INT. JAY’S CAR 

           JAY strains his eye to try to see what happened in the 
           intersection behind him, but he can’t look too long 
           because of the TRAFFIC AHEAD, towards which he speeds.

           EXT. INTERSECTION, VALLEY CIRCLE ROAD

           It takes the MOTHER a moment to take out her phone and 
           punch in Decker’s license plate number.  The moment she’s 
           done with that, it’s 911 on the other end of the line...

           911. What is the emergency?
                                                   MOTHER [Hysterical]
                                              A lunatic in a Black Jeep-- 
                                              license plate  771FCJ. He’s 
                                              driving at least 80 miles 
                                              per hour on Valley Circle 
                                              Blvd! He nearly killed me 
                                              and my daughters! 

           INT. JAY’S TRUCK

           Jay’s drenched in sweat as he veers onto the sidewalk, 
           CRASHING the WINDOW of a MATTRESS STORE to avoid the 
           ARROWHEAD TRUCK now straight ahead of him.

           INT. CARRIE’S CAR

           Carrie enjoys a new song. Every detail-- down to the 
           tapping of her fingers-- smacks of the anticipation she 
           still has for the day she believes lies ahead.

           INT. POLICE CAR/EXT. STREET OFF VALLEY CIRCLE BLVD. DAY

           Inside a squad car about to pull onto VALLEY CIRCLE BLVD, 
           OFFICER GLEN BUNTING-- 40s-- receives the details of 
           Decker’s car and Valley Circle location on his vehicle’s 
           MDT (mobile digital terminal).

           OFFICER BUNTING switches on his squad lights.

           INT. DECKER’S JEEP, CONT’D

           Decker assaults the DIVIDER separating the oncoming 
           traffic. OFFICER BUNTING spots him immediately.

                                 DECKER [Spotting OFFICER BUNTING]
                        Oh. Fuck Me!

           Decker whips out his phone as Bunting’s SIRENS approach.

                                 DECKER 
                        This is Lt. Decker Walsh. I need 
                        you to send out a dispatch! I’m 
                        not in my squad car but I’m a 
                        goddamn Lieutenant in a Black ‘97 
                        Jeep Wrangler in pursuit of a 
                        suspect! 

           INT. JAY’S CAR 

           JAY’s leg shakes as he continues to drive away.

           INT. OFFICER BUNTING’S POLICE CAR

           OFFICER BUNTING picks up his own DISPATCH.

                                 OFFICER BUNTING
                        This is Officer Bunting, I need 
                        back up! I’m on Valley Circle Blvd 
                        approaching Burbank Blvd. We got a 
                        high speed pursuit here! 

           OFFICER BUNTING’S CAR moves in on Decker’s Jeep.

           INT. DECKER’S JEEP

           DECKER doesn’t slow down as he reaches back once more for 
           his SIREN LIGHTS to convey his own “Officer” status to 
           Officer Bunting. The confusion is exacerbating.

           DECKER veers too far to the right and grazes a MERCEDES. 
           He grabs the steering wheel with his left hand-- his 
           right holding the SIRENS-- and turns the car sharply to 
           the left-- thereby successfully spinning out of control. 
           INT. JAY’S CAR

           Jay slows as he sees this in his rearview mirror.

           INT. OFFICER BUNTING’S POLICE CAR

           OFFICER BUNTING-- to avoid hitting Decker-- spins his own 
           car out of control-- SLAMMING into the back of a VAN.

           INT. DECKER’S JEEP

           DECKER finally attaches the SIREN LIGHTS to his car. He 
           then straightens the Jeep back on the road, changes gears 
           and gets going.

           INT. OFFICER BUNTING’S POLICE CAR, CONCURRENT

           It takes OFFICER BUNTING more time to disentangle 
           himself. He calls into the DISPATCH.

                                 OFFICER BUNTING
                        This is Officer Bunting. I need a 
                        Vehicle ID...

           KIM is having the cup of coffee she refused Decker as she

           INT. HANGAR, BURBANK AIRPORT 

           CHARLIE-- 60s, laid-back-- surfs the web. He’s a SEGMENT 
           PRODUCER who oversees aerial reporting for local news.

           An MDT BASE rests on the edge of his desk. His partner, 
           MURRAY (from Starbucks) talks on the phone with KIM, his

           INT. OFFICER BUNTING’S POLICE CAR

           We catch some of the update on Officer Bunting’s MDT:

                    “Lt. Decker Walsh...Jeep.”

           The identification confirms Decker is a LIEUTENANT.

                                 OFFICER BUNTING
                        Oh, Shit! [Beat] Shit.
           INT. JAY’S TRUCK

           JAY speeds off the main road and heads down an ALLEY 
           behind some apartments in an effort to lose Decker.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING

           A TEENAGE BOY listens to music through his headphones as 
           he walks down the stairs of  his apartment building. The 
           stairs end in the ALLEY into which Jay has just turned.

           INT. DECKER’S JEEP

           Decker’s view is blocked by the CARS in front of him. 

           He PASSES where Jay turned off the street but, in a 
           matter of seconds, his instinct redirects him. 

           As Decker turns the CAR around, he hits a CAR coming in 
           opposite traffic. And that car SLAMS into another, and 
           inside just a few seconds, there is a SIGNIFICANT 
           ACCIDENT involving a total of four vehicles.

           Decker’s too intent on his prey to care, or stop. He 
           drives around to the opposite end of the ALLEY down which 
           Jay headed. 

           Decker RACES down the alley. He realizes sooner than Jay-- 
           delayed by his weak eye -- that they’ve found each other.

           DECKER accelerates towards Jay with the indignation of a 
           lifetime, oblivious to the collateral damage.

           INT. JAY’S TRUCK/ EXT. ALLEY 

           JAY figures out it’s Decker. And he’s now certain 
           Decker’s a cop because of the SIRENS affixed to his car.

           JAY REVERSES. We CUT TO HIS POV: the absence of 
           peripheral vision makes his speed excruciating.

           As he reverses, JAY puts his left hand out of the window 
           and mightily FLIPS DECKER OFF.

                                 JAY
                        Fuck you!

           DECKER gains on Jay-- not least because Decker’s not 
           crawling out a narrow alley in reverse.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           A CAT quickly scurries across the alley, just missing 
           Jay’s car as DECKER POUNDS into the front of Jay’s car.

           JAY reaches for the GUN (now on the passenger seat)-- 
           believing there is no other choice...

           INT. DECKER’S JEEP/ EXT. ALLEY

           DECKER also reaches for his GUN. 

           But then DECKER’S PHONE rings. He glances at it just long 
           enough to let up on the gas. And, at that instant, JAY 
           violently HONKS his horn, jolting Decker. So much that 
           Decker drops his phone as it rings, and rings, and rings. 

           Distracted, Decker doesn’t see the TEENAGE BOY who’s 
           suddenly in the alley. He looks up, slams the brakes.

           EXT. STREET (ALTERNATING BETWEEN THE TWO MEN)

           JAY pulls back out onto the main street.

           Decker CRASHES into a GARAGE as he swerves to avoid the 
           TEENAGE BOY. And his cellphone keeps on ringing...

           INT. JAY’S TRUCK

           JAY squints. Vehicles HONK as he tries to untangle his 
           car from them to get onto the street running 
           perpendicular. Miraculously, Jay doesn’t hit anything.

           INT. DECKER’S JEEP

           Decker’s back on Jay’s trail-- speeding towards him.

                                 DECKER
                        I’m gettin’ you, motherfucker!

           INT. JAY’S TRUCK/ EXT. STREET NEAR THE 101 FREEWAY

           Jay’s some distance above an on-ramp to the 101 Freeway 
           when Decker REAPPEARS in his rearview mirror.

           Jay licks his lips-- dry as sand by now- and SHUTS his 
           left eye to better focus with his right eye as he decides 
           to get off the street however he can. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Unfortunately, there is only one way. Jay swerves left, 
           down a sick steep SLOPE eventually arriving at the 101.

           Jay’s TRUCK nearly overturns as it gains too much speed. 
           He fights for control of it every inch down to the 
           bottom...where he just barely barely levels.

           INT. DECKER’S JEEP

           Decker sees Jay’s truck disappear down the slope.

                                 DECKER [So loudly]
                        Sonnuva...fuckin...

           DECKER looks like he’s about to follow Jay down the slope 
           when he decides against it at the last second. 

           That last second is a second too late.

           Decker BRAKES as he desperately turns his steering wheel 
           to prevent himself from going over the edge.

           The combination sends Decker’s Jeep SPINNING enough for 
           us to be certain he’s going to topple over the slope.

           But then, with less than some tens of INCHES to go, it 
           doesn’t. For a moment, Decker doesn’t remember Jay. His 
           leg shakes.

           This man knows how close he just came to ending.

           And his cell phone irreverently continues to ring as 
           SIRENS in the distance grow louder with their approach.

           INT. JAY’S CAR 

           Jay drives-- also shaking-- among the other cars on the 
           101 as he considers what to do.

           EXT. CIRCA MULHOLLAND (NEAR THE SLOPE)

           Decker’s gotten out of his car and is speaking to CAPTAIN 
           JOHN HIGGINS-- 50s, serious, forthright, in charge and at 
           the moment, severely reproachful.

                                 CAPTAIN HIGGINS 
                        What part of “suspended duty” was 
                        unclear here?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DECKER
                        What was I supposed to do? Pretend 
                        I didn’t see a criminal fleeing?

                                 CAPTAIN HIGGINS
                        Criminal? Did I miss something?

           Decker’s lips stay closed.

                                 CAPTAIN HIGGINS (CONT'D)
                        How the fuck can we have a 
                        criminal without a fuckin’ crime?

                                 DECKER 
                        I told you...he didn’t have 
                        plates. And he ran a red. 

                                 CAPTAIN HIGGINS [Wryly]
                        Oh, he didn’t have plates. Why 
                        didn’t you say so? That’s all the 
                        fuckin’ difference right there...

                                 DECKER 
                        You can’t question my judgment.

                                 CAPTAIN HIGGINS
                        I’d be an idiot not to! 

                                 DECKER
                        He was armed!

                                 CAPTAIN HIGGINS
                        You saw that..from as far away as 
                        you were? What was his weapon? 

                                 DECKER [Dodging the question]
                        Why would I lie about that?

                                 CAPTAIN HIGGINS
                        You were in an unmarked car, 
                        without your sirens. Did it occur 
                        to you he might not have had any 
                        idea what kind of nutjob was 
                        speeding after him? And that 
                        that’s why he fled?

                                 DECKER [Dead serious]
                        No. You don’t run like that unless 
                        you know what’s after you. 

           Captain Higgins can’t believe what he’s hearing.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 CAPTAIN HIGGINS
                        You need to work through your 
                        shit, Decker. That was the idea...

                                 DECKER [Snapping]
                        Oh, fuck that. He’s headed to the 
                        101 right now...as you and I stand 
                        here...talkin’ about nothing 
                        instead of calling CHP and air 
                        support. That man in his truck, 
                        Captain, is a criminal, and he’s 
                        about to do some crazy bad shit, 
                        and you will revisit this moment. 
                        So remember this look on my face 
                        right now when you hear he’s hurt 
                        someone because you personally did 
                        fuck all to stop him. 

           We catch how this briefly gives the Captain some pause.

                                 DECKER 
                        You think that little dick talk we 
                        had last night is what this is all 
                        about? Let me take care of that... 
                        that worthless noise you called a 
                        conversation isn’t a second cousin 
                        by fuckin’ marriage to what we’re 
                        talking about right now, Captain!

                                 CAPTAIN HIGGINS [Severely]
                        I’ll see you at the station.

           INT. JAY’S CAR/ EXT. 101 FREEWAY 

           JAY actually SIGNALS to change lanes. The driver in the 
           lane over lets him in. Jay raises his hand in gratitude. 
           It’s still shaking.

           Jay checks his mirrors. For the moment, he doesn’t see 
           anyone on his trail. He catches up to everything.

                                 JAY
                        Shit.

           He’s so distracted, he nearly rear-ends the car in front.

           He SLAMS on his brakes. And all this is still at at least 
           85mph, with impaired vision and frayed nerves.

           Jay veers to the right-- using the emergency lane and 
           dirt strip to the right of the freeway-- to exit.
           INT. CARRIE’S VOLVO

           Carrie glances at her gas gauge, then her clock. It’s 
           11:40. She has plenty of time before her meeting to stop 
           for gas. She pulls into a GAS STATION. 

           INT. DECKER’S JEEP

           Decker has some trouble REVERSING to get back on the 
           road. When he finally does, he calls someone identified 
           as “SAMMY” on his cellphone screen.

           INT. CONVENIENCE STORE, GAS STATION

           Carrie pays for some GUM inside the convenience store-- 
           entirely unaware in this moment how thoroughly her day, 
           and life, are about to change....

           INT. JAY’S TRUCK

           Jay’s GAS TANK LIGHT comes on. The MONEY from the Subway 
           Store sits in the SODA CUP besides him.

                                 JAY
                        Shit.

           EXT. GAS STATION, DAY

           Jay pulls into the GAS STATION. His eyes roll over a 
           middle-aged man filling up his BMW. 

           Jay looks in a different direction and sees CARRIE- 
           filling up her car. Jay takes in the sight of her.

           INT. JAY’S TRUCK 

           Jay removes a JACKET from the backseat, and his GUN. He 
           covers the GUN with the jacket.

           EXT. GAS STATION

           Jay walks over to Carrie. He nearly TRIPS on a CAN. 
           Luckily, his hand clutches the gun without firing it.

                                 JAY
                        Excuse me. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Carrie turns her head around as she’s pumping gas. It’s 
           the final time her face is still hopeful.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry...but I’m gonna need to 
                        borrow you and your car.

           After Carrie’s eyes take in his, they move down to the 
           barrel of HIS GUN, visible even with the jacket wrapped 
           around it.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        Don’t scream or you’ll get hurt.
                        We’re gonna do this quickly 
                        and...we’re gonna do this quietly. 
                        Look at me. Look at my mouth...

                                 CARRIE
                        Take my car. Just take it. Here 
                        are my keys. My..my... purse is on 
                        the frontseat. I have 50...I have 
                        60 dollars in it. You can have it. 
                        Take everything.

                                 JAY [Steadily]
                        Fine. But I’m still gonna have to 
                        borrow you.

                                 CARRIE [Realizing, crumbling]
                        No. Please, no...

           Jay moves the barrel of his GUN closer to Carrie. 

           Then, the gas PUMP clicks-- indicating her tank is full. 
           Both are startled by this slightest noise.

                                 JAY
                        Don’t do anything stupid. You 
                        scream, you get shot. You try to 
                        run, you get shot. You do anything 
                        beyond get in the passenger car of 
                        the seat quietly, you get shot. 

           He holds her eyes. Jay’s sudden composure and articulate 
           speech are notable.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        Let’s not get shot. Ok? Not today. 
                        [Beat] Get in the car. 

           Carrie gets in her car, commanding a body suddenly and 
           violently wracked with fear as best as she can. Jay 
           follows-- getting in the driver’s seat.
           INT. CARRIE’S CAR

           The moment Jay closes his door, words pour out of Carrie 
           at a speed we couldn’t have anticipated.

                                 CARRIE
                        What are you planning to do with 
                        me? You’ve made a mistake. This is 
                        a mistake! You can take 
                        everything.

           Jay doesn’t answer. He drives out of the gas station.

           Carrie’s eyes return to the GUN-- still wrapped in the 
           jacket, now placed on the divider between them. JAY 
           reaches for it, takes it and lets it rest on his lap. 

                                 CARRIE (CONT'D)
                        Please let me go. I can give you 
                        the money I have in my purse, you 
                        can drop me off at a red light. 
                        I’ll just open the door and get 
                        out. Like I wasn’t even inside. 
                        And I won’t say a word. I mean it. 
                        I’ll honor my word. You don’t know 
                        me, but that’s something you’d 
                        know about me if you did. [Beat] I 
                        will give you my car, and I will 
                        honor my word.

           Carrie looks to Jay. And receives nothing.

                                 CARRIE (CONT'D)
                        Please...

           And with the word, loses it.

                                 CARRIE (CONT'D)
                        My name is Carrie Stone. My 
                        birthday is October 29th, 1979. I 
                        have a mother and father in 
                        Encino. And, I...I don’t want to 
                        die today. I teach. I teach kids. 
                        I teach the eighth grade. I have 
                        no one else. No brothers or 
                        sisters. Please don’t do this to 
                        my family...

           Jay labors to keep her noise out...to stay focused.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 CARRIE (CONT'D)
                        Please don’t hurt me. Do you 
                        speak? Of course you do. You spoke 
                        back there at the gas station...

                                 JAY [Cutting her off]
                        You think you could be quiet?

           Carrie nods absently-- quiet for hardly three seconds 
           before she involuntarily starts again.

                                 CARRIE [Frantic] 
                        Where are you taking me? 

           Jay doesn’t answer her-- only making her more frantic.

                                 CARRIE 
                        Please just let me out of the car. 
                        You let me go right now and you’ll 
                        still have your life ahead of you. 
                        Right now, it’s that time 
                        before...the time.. where it could 
                        go really, really wrong for 
                        you...It’s still that time where 
                        it doesn’t have to. Please listen 
                        to me. I’m not ready to die. Do 
                        you hear me? I’m not ready to die.

                                 JAY
                        No one’s dying. Just be quiet.

           Jay SPPEDS towards the intersection.

                                 CARRIE
                        I can’t...I know you want me to... 
                        and I’m aware of the fact that I’m 
                        aggravating you right now...but I 
                        don’t want to die today. I don’t 
                        even want to get hurt, so...

           Carrie screams as it looks like they’re going to run the 
           red. Jay slams the brakes only as they approach the 
           intersection. 

           They finally come to a stop. Carrie abruptly reaches for 
           the DOOR HANDLE and pulls it-- opening the door.

           JAY grabs her immediately, VIOLENTLY and pulls her back 
           in-- not letting go of her arm once she’s inside. 

           Carrie SCREAMS-- terrified by his touch and proximity. 
           She sees his RIGHT EYE-- where blood covers the white 
           part-- as he reaches over and SLAMS the car door shut.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Stunned, she goes quiet. Just like that. No screams. No 
           words. Jay sees how he’s scared her and looks away.

                                 JAY
                        Just...please. Please...I don’t 
                        want to hurt you but... you can’t 
                        try to get out of this car. All 
                        right? You need to put on your 
                        seat belt and just...be quiet!

           Jay doesn’t finish his sentence. The light turns green 
           and they move through the intersection. Carrie’s still 
           but for the fearful rise and fall of her chest.

           They hit ANOTHER RED LIGHT. JAY leans over to Carrie. 

           She flinches as she CLENCHES HER EYES SHUT-- unable to 
           watch whatever he’s about to do. Her entire body shakes.

           We see how guilty Jay feels for this effect on her.

           Jay reaches across her for her SEAT BELT and straps her 
           in. She opens her eyes a few seconds after.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        I just need to be able to think. 
                        Ok?  Look at me...

                         JAY (CONT'D)
           I’m not gonna hurt you...
                                                   CARRIE [Hysterical]
                                              NO! I don’t want to look at 
                                              you! Don’t touch me!

           By now, Decker’s evidently reached “Sammy” on his phone.

                                 DECKER
                        Sammy, it’s Decker. Where are you?

           INT. AIRPLANE

           The quiet of the inside of a commercial flight offers a 
           jarring transition.

           We get our first glimpse of STEVEN-- 40, with clean 
           clothes, a close shave and remarkable self-possession.

           The only thing betraying that Steven’s circumstances are 
           less than desirable are his EYES-- WRENCHED as he 
           tolerates sitting politely between a STRANGER and a 
           WINDOW confirming he’s momentarily too far from wherever 
           he’s desperate to be.

           CONTINUED:

                                 STRANGER
                        What kind of work are you in?

           Steven keeps his eyes fastened out the window as he hears 
           Stranger’s every word. STRANGER leans forward to get 
           Steven’s attention and Steven knows he has to face him.

                                 STEVEN [Obscenely loud]
                        I’m sorry did you say something?

                                 STRANGER [Taken aback]
                        I was...I just...You going to LA 
                        for work or just a visit?

                                 STEVEN [Almost shouting]
                        I’m sorry, the altitude, it screws 
                        up my ears so it’s hard for me to 
                        understand you.

           Steven’s volume seals the deal. He looks back out the 
           window as his thoughts painfully resume.

           INT. SAMMY’S POLICE CAR

           Officer SAMMY MAIBERGER-- 40s, dimmer, and  meeker, than 
           Decker-- sits in his car with DECKER as he brings him up 
           to speed and starts the process of persuasion.

                                 DECKER
                        I’m basically giving you this one,

                        How are you sure he’s done 
                        something? Besides the missing

                        Right...And the red light.

           INT. CARRIE’S CAR, CONCURRENT

           Carrie’s trying, and failing, to be quiet beside Jay.

                                 CARRIE [Terrified]
                        I don’t care if my asking upsets 
                        you. What’s happening here? Am I

                        I...I don’t know...Can you just 
                        tell me what’s happening here?

           Jay doesn’t answer Carrie. Carrie’s CELL PHONE rings-- 
           jarring both of them. It’s clear Jay hadn’t factored in 
           her having one. He picks his GUN up off his lap.

                                 JAY
                        Get it out and don’t be stupid. 
                        Don’t try to answer it.

           Carrie takes her phone out and reads the CALLER ID.

                                 CARRIE
                        It’s my Mom. She’ll get worried if 
                        I don’t pick up.

           The mention of her Mom breaks her.

                                 CARRIE (CONT'D)
                        Please don’t do this to me.

                        Give it to me. Give me the phone.

           JAY grabs the cell phone from her. He rolls down his 
           window and THROWS IT OUT.

           Jay speeds recklessly-- terrifying Carrie even more. He 
           weaves between an indifferent BIG RIG and a MOTORHOME 
           commanding two lanes.

           Her SHOUTING hardly makes the ride any safer.

           Jay can’t help the briefest glance at her as he speeds 
           through the space narrowing between the metal giants.

           Carrie takes stock of her situation as she stares ahead-- 
           imagining her worst possible outcomes. The imagining is 
           unbearable. Her eyes scour the car for any exit possible.

           Without warning, CARRIE leans over to JAY and HITS HIM 
           with everything she has.

           Jay tries to restrain her, but something has been 
           unleashed. Carrie STRIKES him across his face. 

           She’s much stronger than she appears. JAY wrestles with 
           her while he drives. And then Carrie BITES his upper arm. 
           Terrifically hard.

           We can tell how hard by Jay’s eyes. He takes hold of her 
           WRISTS and RESTRAINS her so deftly we see how easily he 
           could hurt her if he wanted to.

           The deadness in his eyes daunts her.

           They both look at his ARM-- now BLEEDING through his 
           shirt-- in surprise. The sight scares Carrie even more.

                        Carrie Stone. He probably took her 
                        and her car at the gas station.

           Higgins is red in the face as his voice strives for calm.

                        Find out who his car was 
                        registered to. And where’s our 
                        goddamn air support?

           EXT. FREEWAY

           Carrie looks up at the FREEWAY TRAFFIC ALERT describing 
           her WHITE VOLVO, and license plate number. It takes both 
           of them a moment to register the sight.

                                 CARRIE 
                        That’s us. 

           And then comes the SECOND APB FLASH: “CAUCASIAN FEMALE 
           HOSTAGE.” Carrie stares at it-- stunned. 

           INT. HELICOPTER OVERHEAD/ EXT. SKY ABOVE L.A.

           MURRAY (the helicopter pilot) surveys the landscape in 
           question through his BINOCULARS. He stops as he sees a 
           POLICE CHOPPER and another newscopter on his wings.

                                 MURRAY
                        Charlie, we got guests.

                        Copy. They’ve put out a 1022.

           MURRAY returns to his BINOCULARS. It doesn’t take him 
           long to spot the white Volvo, distinguishing itself with 
           its speed on the 405 South.

                                 MURRAY [Into his headset]
                        They in a Volvo station or Sedan? 

           INT. CARRIE’S CAR, CONCURRENT

           JAY sees police enter the frame of his REARVIEW MIRROR.

                        You won’t have to look.

           Jay unceremoniously maneuvers the car across the diagonal 
           dirt slope parallel to a stretch of the freeway.

                                 CARRIE [Hysterical]
                        What are you...We’re gonna flip! 

           As if to prove her point, the CAR comes dangerously close 
           to doing so. Carrie clutches the handle of the car door.

           INT. DISPATCH BOOTH, LAPD BOOTH

           We see an LAPD DISPATCHER deliver an update.

                        That’s him! There he is!

           Decker relishes the news; his validation is unmistakable. 
           Sammy accelerates.

           INT. MURRAY’S HELICOPTER OVERHEAD

           Through Murray’s BINOCULARS, we instantly spot Jay and

                        to the Howard Hughes Parkway...

           As MURRAY flies his helicopter, he keeps one eye on the 
           activity below as he starts recording with his DV CAMERA. 
           It’s an estimable amount of activity at such a height.

           closer to Murray and flies LOWER TO THE GROUND.

                        Chuck, you gotta wonder what’s 
                        going through this guy’s mind. 
                        He’s on a freeway. He can’t even 
                        hope for any intersections to lose 
                        the police in. It’ll be 
                        interesting to see how this ends, 
                        even though I can already tell you 
                        it won’t be well.

                        Murray, do we have any idea why 
                        this guy’s running?

                                 MURRAY
                        It’s hard to tell with these. It 
                        could have started as a minor 
                        infraction or it could’ve started 
                        with something a lot more serious. 
                        We just don’t know. Something 
                        snaps and it never makes sense... 
                        but it doesn’t seem to stop them.

           INT. MURRAY’S HELICOPTER/ EXT. SKY ABOVE THE 405

           We conclude how close MURRAY is to the airport as a PLANE 
           appears much larger and closer than it maybe should. 
           Murray also spots the R44 RAVEN II now ahead and beneath 
           him. From his headset, he switches back over to CHARLIE.

                                 MURRAY [To Charlie]
                        LAPD’s moving in. We got two units 
                        up ahead and I got an R44 up here 
                        with me.

           INT.  CARRIE’S CAR, CONT’D

           TWO POLICE CARS enter the freeway from the ramp UP AHEAD 
           of Jay and Carrie’s car. Inside the car, the speed, the 
           nearness of other cars are unbearable.

                                 CARRIE
                        What are you doing? You think 
                        you’re gonna outrun them? On the 
                        freeway? Are you out of your mind?

           JAY leans out the driver’s seat-- stretching his neck to 
           see the HELICOPTERS trailing them in the sky.

                                 JAY 
                        Shit! 

           Carrie leans out her own window, looks up, assessing the 
           situation, and the HELICOPTERS, for herself. Jay speeds 
           reflexively-- actually GRAZING a car on his side.

                                 CARRIE 
                        You’re not gonna lose them! Get 
                        off before you get us killed!

           As she says it, they become SANDWICHED between a CEMENT 
           TRUCK and a MASSIVE CAR CARRIER TRUCK.

           CONTINUED:

           Their CAR scrapes the CEMENT TRUCK in the effort to speed 
           out of the trap. CARRIE takes stock, then makes a choice.

                        We’re near the airport. If you get 
                        close enough, they can’t fly 
                        overhead. ‘Cause of the planes 
                        taking off and landing. The 
                        helicopters probably aren’t gonna 
                        be able to follow us.

           Jay hadn’t thought of this. He’s surprised she has. 
           Several CARS they’ve nearly hit HONK FURIOUSLY at them.

           INT. HANGAR, BURBANK AIRPORT (CHARLIE’S OFFICE)

           CHARLIE (Murray’s partner) is on the phone with MURRAY in 
           one ear and AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL in the other. No one in 
           this process is allowed the luxury of a single task.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Murray, I don’t have clearance 
                        from air traffic control. You’re 
                        gonna have to pull back!

           INT. CARRIE’S CAR

           JAY and CARRIE encounter traffic as they approach CENTURY 
           BLVD EXIT. There’s not enough room on the side of the 405 
           for them to use the emergency lane to exit and the POLICE 
           CARS are closing in on them. Jay slows but doesn’t exit.

                                 CARRIE
                        You’re passing the exit!

           Too late, Jay’s passed it. Jay looks out Carrie’s window, 
           as if he’s measuring something. 

                                 CARRIE [Hysterical]
                        What are you...You can’t go on 
                        that ramp! What is wrong with you?

           Jay barely slows the CAR down. Carrie sees the POLICE 
           CARS less than a hundred feet behind them. She sees Jay 
           look in her sideview mirror and prepare to turn.

                             JAY
                                                   CARRIE [Hysterical]
           Hold on!
                                              What are you...

           There is a CONCRETE DIVIDER intended to prevent any cars 
           from falling over to Century Blvd running perpendicular 
           below. Jay steers the car towards it.

           Carrie SCREAMS as they shoot over the edge of the 
           freeway.

           INT. AMINAH’S BMW STATION WAGON, CONCURRENT

           We’re inside AMINAH’S CAR as she drives on Century Blvd 
           just under the freeway and directly under the overpass. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She’s still on the phone. We stay with her for about five 
           seconds until, 100 feet past it, the front of JAY and 
           CARRIE’S CAR lands on the back half of hers-- startling 
           life out of her.

           The metal of Jay and Carrie’s car misses Aminah’s body by 
           inches. Aminah calls out to God half in English, half in 
           Urdu, unable to make out exactly what brand of disaster 
           just visited her.

           INT. CARRIE’S CAR

           CARRIE’s HEAD HITS THE ROOF, THEN SMACKS THE WINDOW as 
           their CAR bounces and skids out of control.

           Their AIRBAGS BURST-- startling both of them. The sound 
           is deafening as WHITE RUBBER COVERS OUR ENTIRE SCREEN.

           The AIRBAG makes it impossible for Jay to see as the car 
           continues to move out of control. From the outside, we 
           see Carrie’s HEAD has CRACKED the GLASS. 

           Finally, their car skids to a stop. Though Jay and Carrie 
           can’t yet see, we see they’re on the opposite side of the 
           boulevard from Aminah’s car.

           (Fortunately the overpass from which their car fell 
           happens to be one of the shorter in LA.)

           INT. SAMMY’S POLICE CAR

           SAMMY and DECKER slam their brakes before they, too, go 
           over the overpass. SAMMY veers their vehicle, neatly 
           nestling into the side of a LEXUS SUV.

                                 SAMMY
                        Shit.

                        We’ll exit and turn back! There’s 
                        no way they’re driving after that.

           DECKER dials the DISPATCHER.

                                 MURRAY
                        Chuck, this is unbelievable. This 
                        suspect just took his car right 
                        over the freeway! He is not goin’ 
                        down easily. And, as much as I 
                        hate to say it, this has “mess” 
                        written all over it.

           We see MURRAY increase his altitude as he tries to 
           negotiate a different angle of observation from above. 
           Now, Murray mutes CHUCK and addresses CHARLIE.

                                 MURRAY (CONT'D)
                        Charlie, I can’t get closer. I got 
                        an R44 running interference. Do 
                        you copy?

           INT. OFFICE, HIGHRISE ON CENTURY BLVD, NEAR LAX

           The IRRITABLE SUIT from Starbucks speaks irately on the 
           phone as he sees the REFLECTION of the POLICE HELICOPTER 
           and MURRAY’S on his computer screen. 

                                 SUIT
                        I don’t care what Steve said...

           IRRITABLE turns around in his chair to incredulously look 
           out his window at what’s going on.

           INT. CARRIE’S CAR

           JAY and CARRIE both have blood on them.

           JAY reaches into his pocket for his SWISS ARMY KNIFE. 
           With it, he deftly CUTS his airbag and then Carrie’s. 
           WHITE DUST devours the air-- covering both of them.

                                 JAY
                        Are you ok?

           Carrie can’t speak. She’s in shock. Jay moves the 
           deflated AIRBAG off her.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        Let me see your head.

           Carrie is perfectly still as Jay carefully moves her hair 
           so he can see how badly her head is bleeding. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Despite the blood, it’s not a deep cut. But her CHEEK is 
           terrifically red-- the skin chafed from the airbag and 
           the window.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        You’re ok. Look at me. 

           Jay grips Carrie’s face and focuses on her eyes. 

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        Good. Look at me. You’re ok. 

           Carrie’s eyes eventually half-focus on Jay’s. 

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        You’re ok.

           Other cars have started to slow down around them but no 
           one has stopped. And no one is getting out of their cars.

           The DRIVER of the Lexus has come out to protest while

           EDDIE’S WIFE (the couple from McDonald’s) turns their VAN 
           back onto Century Blvd and spots the accident.

                                 EDDIE’S WIFE
                        Oh my God, Eddie! Look at that.

           I wonder if anyone got 
           hurt.

                        Should we call 911?

                                 EDDIE
                        No, we should turn around and take

           Through his BINOCULARS, MURRAY sees that the CONCRETE 
           DIVIDER of the freeway overpass has been destroyed.

                                 MURRAY [To the Station]
                        Chuck, at least one car has gone 
                        over the Century Blvd Overpass.

                        Murray, we’re still awaiting air 
                        clearance. Do you copy? You need 
                        to get out of that airspace.

           INT. CARRIE’S CAR/ EXT. CENTURY BLVD.

           JAY grabs his GUN and the MONEY from the Subway and gets 
           out of the car.  He comes around to Carrie’s side. He 
           opens her door and helps her out.

                                 JAY 
                        We’re gonna run over there 
                        together. Ok?

           We hold on Carrie’s FACE, holding on Jay’s. As Jay helps 
           her step out of the car, she stumbles-- her leg shaking 
           out of her control. Jay instinctively moves his hands 
           over her body, searching for more wounds.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        You’re ok. Look at me, Carrie. You 
                        can walk. Look at me. You’re ok.

           PEOPLE have started to come out of the stores. As they 
           pause on the sidewalks, some TAKE PICTURES of the wreck 
           with their cell phones.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        Gimme your hand.

           Jay holds his hand out for Carrie’s. She takes it. 

           JAY’s GUN is lowered by his side as he stops oncoming 
           traffic to cross to the gas station opposite them.

           Cars HONK and people exclaim surprise at the white, 
           sticken sight of Jay and Carrie. Jay stops the oncoming 
           traffic so they can cross.

           We watch them in almost slowed motion as they RUN, hand 
           in hand, across Century Blvd, in the middle of the day, 
           in the middle of Los Angeles. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Jay is pulling Carrie when she stumbles and FALLS badly 
           in the middle of the busy street. Her chin hits the 
           concrete as the skin of her knees and calves is painfully 
           scraped right off. And the CARS still barely stop...

           GRAVEL from the street mixes with the blood now starting 
           to wet Carrie’s leg. People honk, having no idea...

           JAY helps Carrie up. Having no time to urge her to walk, 
           he PICKS CARRIE UP and carries her across the street as 
           the world seems to slow so we don’t miss an inch of what 
           we’re watching.

           With a strength that’s inexplicable, Jay carries her an 
           entire block after they cross. 

           Every story has its moment and this is their’s. 

           Carrie stares at his face up close. He finally stops when 
           they reach the corner of a GAS STATION. Jay gently sets 
           her down. She stands, still stunned.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        Come on.

           Jay takes her hand and Carrie, still stunned, follows.

           INT. SAMMY’S POLICE CAR (APPROACHING CENTURY BLVD.)

           The VOICE of a POLICE DISPATCHER now confirms Sammy and 
           Decker’s proximity to Carrie and Jay.

                                 DECKER
                        Un-fuckin-believable. Faster. 
                        Jesus, come on, Sammy! Go, go, GO!

           SAMMY honks at oblivious cars as their SIRENS blare...

           INT. GAS STATION, CENTURY BLVD (NEAR THE AIRPORT)

           A GRAY-HAIRED WOMAN comes out of the gas station with a 
           heavily condiment-ed HOT DOG in hand.

           She’s left her SUBARU unattended. She hears presumably 
           irrelevant sirens in the distance as she sees CARRIE and 
           JAY driving off in her SUBARU.

           She runs after them and the HOT DOG smashes against her.

                                 GRAY-HAIRED WOMAN
                        Hey! Hey! They’re stealing my car!

           She SHOUTS to the OTHER PEOPLE fueling their cars.

           EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR CENTURY BLVD.

           SAMMY’s about to brake as the LIGHT at the intersection 
           TURNS RED when Decker SHOUTS at him.

                                 DECKER
                        No, don’t stop! Don’t fuckin’ 
                        stop. Go, Go! Go, goddamnit, go! 
                        We’re so close, Sammy! We’re 
                        getting the sonnuvabitch.

           SAMMY listens to Decker and hits the gas. 

           As DECKER and SAMMY go through the intersection, a TRUCK 
           cuts them off-- mercilessly SMASHING into SAMMY’S SIDE OF 
           THE CAR.

           INT. MURRAY’S HELICOPTER, OVERHEAD

           We see the incident from Murray’s POV (and his video 
           camera’s) as Decker and Sammy’s CAR GETS SMASHED, then 
           FLIPS a good two turns before it rests against a LAMPPOST 
           on the opposite side of the street.

           Murray is shocked, even as he continues to videotape.

                                                     CHARLIE (O.S.)
                                              We’re live! We’re live!
                            MURRAY
           Oh, Papa! Someone’s toast. 
           Charlie, go live! Go live! 

                                 MURRAY
                        Chuck, this is unbelievable. A 
                        truck just...ate the squad car. 
                        Smashed right into..

           As CHARLIE asks him a question, a PLANE-- which we 
           identify by its suddenly deafening sound-- is in MURRAY’s 
           immediate proximity.

           MURRAY, fixed on the activity below, steers his CHOPPER 
           up to be able to turn it around.

           Before he can locate the PLANE and vice versa, the 
           PLANE’S WING grazes-- just grazes-- Murray’s PROPELLER.

           The PLANE briefly but severely loses its balance as we 
           remain uncertain about what just happened.
           INT. PLANE

           As the PILOT tries to straighten out the plane that’s now 
           wobbling its descent, chaos consumes the cabin. Children 
           cry as PASSENGERS speculate what happened.

           STEVEN sits stoically in his seat while STRANGER beside 
           him naturally contributes to the commotion.

           INT. OFFICE, HIGHRISE ON CENTURY BLVD, NEAR LAX

           IRRITABLE SUIT offers us (and the person to whom he’s 
           speaking on the phone) commentary as we see portions of 
           Murray’s descent from his POV through his office window.

           INT. MURRAY’S HELICOPTER/ EXT. THE SKY

           We watch MURRAY not know what’s happening as his 
           helicopter tragically loses its means of staying in the 
           sky. It twirls miserably and completely out of control. 
           Its descent owns only a few seconds. 

                                 SUIT (O.S. Into the phone)
                        Hoooly....Shit. Something really 
                        bad is happening.

           It’s devastating to see MURRAY’S HELICOPTER spin and 
           plunge. We leave the instant MURRAY’S HELICOPTER makes 
           contact with a WAREHOUSE-- not waiting to see the massive 
           explosion we nonetheless hear off our screen...

           INT. PLANE

           Passengers scream as the PLANE hits the ground at an 
           angle, and too fast. The plane unexpectedly veers to the 
           left, as the pilots struggle to overcome its resistance 
           and straighten it. After a considerable distance, the 
           plane eventually comes to a stop.

           INT. STOLEN SUBARU

           We relocate ourselves with JAY and CARRIE, in the car 
           they’ve stolen, too far to have witnessed the business 
           with the helicopter, or the plane. Carrie’s face is dirty 
           from the street and the airbag powder and her blood so 
           that a couple silent TEARS leave trails on her skin.

                                 CARRIE [Disoriented]
                        What is the...where?

           CONTINUED:

           JAY looks at her-- surprised that she spoke. She swallows 
           -- only to realize how dry her mouth is.

                                 JAY
                        You’re in shock.

           CARRIE’s too traumatized to be anything but calm.

                                 CARRIE
                        [Beat] Why aren’t you?

           Jay reaches for a WATER BOTTLE in the car cupholder. 

                                 JAY
                        Here...drink some of this. 

                                 CARRIE [Suddenly]
                        I’m gonna be sick.

                                 JAY [Rolling down her window]
                        Lean your head out. The air’ll 
                        help. 

           Carrie leans her head out, then brings it back it in.

           Carrie drinks from the water bottle, then passes it back 
           to Jay. JAY takes it and one of the dozens of fast-food 
           napkins in the GRAY-HAIRED WOMAN’S car. He wets it and 
           motions to CARRIE to use on her badly bloodied leg.

           She doesn’t move so he leans over and does it himself.

                                 CARRIE
                        OW!

                                 JAY
                        I know. [Beat] I know.

           She abruptly moves her leg so he can’t touch it.

           INT. CYNTHIA’S (DECKER’S EX WIFE’S) HOUSE

           KIM ACOCELLA is at the COMPUTER in her sister’s house-- 
           with a Yoplait in front of her, e-mailing MURRAY as she 
           talks on the PHONE to her sister, Cynthia.

           We watch her e-mail MURRAY:

           Baby doll of mine, Wish you were here so I could crush and lick and 
           love you so much. Cannot WAIT to see you tonight...

           Kim smiles as she types. As she sends the e-mail, we see 
           a DIGITAL PHOTO of her and MURRAY on her desktop.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

           How she can’t know her reality, and Murray’s, in this 
           moment is heartbreaking.

                                 KIM [Re: Decker]
                        What do you think Decker was like, 
                        Cyn? His usual dick self. Well, 
                        you should’ve told me you asked 
                        him to come over. How was I 
                        supposed to know he wasn’t full of 
                        shit?

           As KIM returns to AOL, we see a PICTURE of President Bush 
           next to a HEADLINE, “Iraqis plan to ring Baghdad with 
           trenches” on her AOL START PAGE.

                        helicopter has crashed not too far 
                        from here. There’s speculation 
                        that the pilot was in a no-fly 
                        zone but we can’t confirm that at 
                        this time. We do know the LAPD was 
                        in pursuit of a suspect on the... 

           EXT. PARKING LOT, LONG’S DRUGS, LOS ANGELES, DAY

           We’re in a SEDAN broadcasting these details on the RADIO 
           as it pulls into a Long’s Drugs in the Valley. 

           We follow FRED’S (Jay’s coworker) WIFE as she gets out of 
           the car and walks into the PHARMACY.

           INT. LONG’S DRUGS, CALABASAS

           FRED’S WIFE walks past a cash register to do her 
           shopping, and we see CAMILLE working, ringing up a 
           customer, having no idea the woman who passed her is 
           married to Jay’s co-worker. Or that she has just heard 
           more to do with Camille’s life than Camille has.
           INT. GAS STATION, CENTURY BLVD (NEAR THE AIRPORT)

           A POLICE OFFICER interviews the GRAY-HAIRED WOMAN.

                                 OFFICER
                        Did you happen to see what 
                        direction they came from?

           Indignation quickens her speech.

                                 GRAY-HAIRED WOMAN
                        No! I told you everything I know. 
                        I told you they looked a fright 
                        with this white stuff all over 
                        them. You can’t miss ‘em! They’ve 
                        got my Subaru Forester.

           The OFFICER writes this down. 

                                 GRAY-HAIRED WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        Stop writing, for God’s sake! Just 
                        pass it along before they’re too

                        There’s no cause to be rude.

           TITLE CARD: THE CIRCUMSTANCES

           INT. CHEESECAKE FACTORY, OAK MALL, THOUSAND OAKS, THE 
           NIGHT BEFORE

           DECKER sits at the bar, not really watching the baseball 
           game being broadcast.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           (We can tell through the windows that it’s night, and 
           we’ll soon conclude that it’s THE NIGHT BEFORE.)

           INT. CAMILLE’S HOUSE, THE NIGHT BEFORE

           GORDON-- 40s, Camille’s thick, coarse, recent boyfriend-- 
           watches DANCING WITH THE STARS. A RETRIEVER lies on the 
           rug nearby. Everything about Gordon, from his hair-gel 
           hair to the way his shorts hang low, is egregious.

           As Gordon sips his beer, we move to the right where 
           STELLA (5) sits at the kitchen table, watching TV.

           Stella’s mother, CAMILLE, heats chili for STELLA. Gordon 
           finishes his beer and glances at Stella as he walks past 
           her on his way to the fridge.

           Gordon comes up behind CAMILLE and grabs her backside-- 
           with the child in clear sight.

                                 CAMILLE [Quietly, to Gordon]
                        Gordon, come on...

           Camille puts CHILI in a bowl for Stella. 

                                 CAMILLE  [To Stella]
                        Stella, baby...eat your chili. No 
                        getting up until that’s finished 
                        all right? No ice cream. Nothing.

           Stella deliberately doesn’t look over.

                                 STELLA
                        Can I eat it in front of the TV?

                                 CAMILLE [Preoccupied]
                        Sure.

           Stella tastes the chili, then summons the DOG. She holds 
           her bowl down and the dog finishes the chili in a matter 
           of seconds. Stella turns up the TV volume.

           INT. ELEVATOR, OAK MALL, THE NIGHT BEFORE

           CARRIE steps inside the mall elevator with three other 
           people. One of them is TEENAGE BOY (from the alley).
           INT. JAY’S ROOM/SUITE, AMERICA’S BEST VALUE INN, THOUSAND 
           OAKS, THE NIGHT BEFORE 

           JAY dials from a PHONE in what looks like a sparsely 
           furnished, 2-star motel room.

           INT. RESTAURANT, PORTLAND, OREGON, THE NIGHT BEFORE

           STEVEN sits at a table with his WIFE and another COUPLE, 
           enjoying a casual, weekday dinner. The restaurant is loud 
           so it takes him a moment to hear his CELL PHONE ringing. 
           (We alternate between the two locations.)

                                 STEVEN
                        Hello. Hello?

                                 JAY
                        [Beat] Hey. It’s me.

           STEVEN instantly recognizes Jay’s voice. Everything in 
           Steven’s face changes.

                                 STEVEN 
                        Hang on.

           STEVEN gets up and heads through the noisy restaurant, 
           out the front door, onto the relatively quieter sidewalk.

                                 STEVEN (CONT'D)
                        You’re back.

                                 JAY
                        Yeah.

                                 STEVEN
                        When?

                                 JAY
                        [Beat] A few months ago.

           Steven absorbs this as best as he can out on the 
           sidewalk.

                                 STEVEN
                        How are you?

                                 JAY
                        I’m fine. [Beat] How are you guys?

                                 STEVEN
                        Good. We’re all good.

           INT. CHEESECAKE FACTORY, THE NIGHT BEFORE

           DECKER is nursing his drink when he sees CAPTAIN HIGGINS 
           enter the Cheesecake Factory and walk over to him.

           INT. MACY’S, OAK MALL, THOUSAND OAKS, THE NIGHT BEFORE

           Carrie approaches a make-up counter in the skirt and top 
           she wore to work (school) the previous day. A slender, 
           made up MAKE-UP WOMAN-- striking-- approaches her. 

                                 CARRIE 
                        Hi. I need need some new make-up.

           EXT. RESTAURANT, PORTLAND/ INT. JAY’S MOTEL, CONT’D

           STEVEN is outside on the sidewalk in Portland, talking to 
           Jay, impervious to anyone and anything passing him.

                                 STEVEN
                        You haven’t called me in like, a 
                        year. I e-mail you like ten times  
                        telling you I don’t need a fuckin’ 
                        novel, just type “I’m alive” and 
                        hit “Send”. And you don’t even 
                        give me that. Now you call to ask 
                        me for a thousand dollars and  you 
                        can’t even tell me what it’s for?

           JAY shakes his head-- hating himself for calling.

                                 STEVEN (CONT'D)
                        Look, I’m not saying I’m not gonna 
                        give it to you, I’m just saying...

           This makes Jay hate himself even more.

                        Jay? Jay, you there?

           Steven glances at the people passing by as he fails to 
           connect with Jay.

                                 JAY
                        You’re right. I’m sorry.

                        Look, I’ll call you in a few days.

           Jay’s already hung up.

                        No! Jay! Fuck! [Shaken] Don’t you 
                        do this to me, Jay. Come on!

           DECKER and HIGGINS tread the small-talk terrain as a NEWS 
           FLASH plays on the BAR TV.

                        Here’s what I don’t get it. Every 
                        few weeks they say they caught the 
                        top Al-Qaeda guy. How many fuckin’ 
                        top guys can there be?  Either we 
                        don’t know what the hell we’re 
                        talking about or who the hell they 
                        got in charge, or we’re bein’ 
                        served C-grade bullshit. You ask 
                        me, they need some good cops in 
                        there to sort through this shit. 
                        You just look into these guys’ 
                        eyes and you know who the fuck’s 
                        up to something. And who the

           JAY parks opposite Camille’s house, where he has a view 
           of the living room through the curtains.

           We recognize STELLA’S small frame on the couch, watching

           This is the calmest we see him.

                        She could decide to share it.

                        I’m sorry. Would you kill me if I 
                        answered that?

                                 CARRIE
                        No, it’s fine.

                                 MAKE-UP WOMAN [Answering it]
                        Kevin, I’m at work... Whatever. 
                        Fine. Sure, whatever. I said Sure. 
                        [Forcibly] I said, “Me, too.”

           She hangs up but waits like she expects him to call back. 
           He doesn’t.  She sighs and walks back to Carrie’s face. 
           Carrie can see she’s shaken but asks nothing.

                                 MAKE-UP WOMAN 
                        It’s almost two years and he still 
                        won’t call me his girlfriend. Two 
                        years of five days a week together 
                        and...what is the point of hurting 
                        someone like that?

           Carrie still doesn’t offer a word of comfort.

                        When anything’s wrong in his life-- 
                        any little thing-- it’s “Baby, I 
                        love you.” But then if there’s the 
                        slightest improvement on the 
                        horizon, it’s “We just spent the 
                        whole weekend together, I gotta 
                        take the week and focus on my 
                        work.” And it’s...it’s just....

           She chokes on what it is for about two seconds, then 
           takes a tissue and expertly dabs around her eye.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I have, Jay! I’ve been taking care 
                        of her while you’ve been away 
                        doing your thing.

           There, in their lowered raised voices, lies the violence 
           between them.

                        bullshit it was, you wanted it 
                        more than me and Stella. Now, live

                        faces to see if one of ‘em was

           They can’t even hear each other. Hearing the shouting, 
           Gordon comes inside.

                                 GORDON
                        Is everything ok?

                        Gordon, please...

           Camille flashes a look at Gordon. Gordon leaves.

                                 CAMILLE (CONT'D)
                        Look, what do you want me to do

                                 CARRIE
                        No. And even if she did, that’s 
                        called a healthy fuckin’ 
                        relationship! And how is that the 
                        worst thing she could be seeing...

                                 JAY
                        That’s really what you want to

                        come back with something like 
                        Gordon?

           They’re both so practiced in hurting each other.

                                 CAMILLE

                        [Suddenly] Where is Stella?

           There aren’t that many square feet to search. Jay marches 
           towards the bedroom.

           INT. BEDROOM, CAMILLE’S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS)

           Jay sees his DAUGHTER-- terrified at the sight of him-- 
           watching TV on one side of the bed with Gordon resting 
           against a headboard on the other side.

           JAY heads over to Gordon and physically lifts him off the 
           bed. Camille rushes over to stop him. 

                                                   CAMILLE [Shrieking]
                                              Stop it, Jay! Please, stop 
                                              it! What are you doing? 
                      JAY [RE: Gordon] 
           You let this...sit on a bed 
           with our child? You ever 
           think how what she’s gonna 
           see could fuck her up for 
           the rest of her life?

           Jay lifts the bedside LAMP and readies to thrash it on 
           Gordon’s head.

                                 JAY
                        She’s never gonna be able to erase 
                        what she’s seen. Have you fuckin’ 
                        thought about that?

                                 CAMILLE [Desperately] 
                        Have you?

           Finally, this reaches him. Jay stops as his eyes stop on 
           STELLA, who looks on him as the scariest of strangers.

           Gordon is speechless, terrified.

           JAY lowers the LAMP, sensing the sudden quiet. He lets go 
           of Gordon. And he avoids his daughter’s eyes as he leaves 
           without a word.

           INT. MACY’S, MALL, VALLEY, THE NIGHT BEFORE

           Carrie quietly, uncomfortably pays for her make-up.

           EXT. PARKING LOT, MALL, VALLEY, THE NIGHT BEFORE

           DECKER-- now drunk-- walks to his car from the mall. The 
           overhead STREET LAMPS, against the sky, make a kind of 
           painting.
           INT. CARRIE’S CAR/ EXT. SAME PARKING LOT 

           Carrie’s pulling out of her parking spot when DECKER 
           walks right into her path. 

                     DECKER [With a slur]
                                                         CARRIE
           Hey, watch it, Lady!
                                              Sorry! 

           Carrie holds up her hand in an apologetic gesture. 

                                 DECKER [Mumbling, walking]
                        People should be allowed to walk 
                        to their cars without people 
                        running them over.

           Of course he won’t remember these words the next day.

           INT. DECKER’S JEEP, THE NIGHT BEFORE

           DECKER gets in his car-- so much less certain now that 
           he’s alone. He takes out his CELL PHONE and dials his 
           soon-to-be ex-wife, CYNTHIA.

                                 DECKER [Drunk]
                        Cyn, it’s me. Is this home or your 
                        cell? 

           INT. JAY’S CAR/ EXT. FREEWAY, THE NIGHT BEFORE

           Jay drives with his ailing, impaired right eye. He exits 
           at the sign for the V.A. HOSPITAL. A momentary CUT TO HIS 
           POV-- revealing a blurred sea of taillights-- is jarring.

           INT. DECKER’S JEEP, THE NIGHT BEFORE

           Decker’s talking into his phone.

                                 DECKER
                        I went to our storage unit today 
                        and I was going through one of the 
                        boxes...and it had our old 
                        answering machine and there were 
                        these messages we left each 
                        other...

           His eyes look so suddenly, uncharacteristically calm.

                        to the cleaners so...”Was my suit

                        And then there was one from me, 
                        sounding like...an asshole. [Beat] 
                        I want you to know I heard that.

           Decker doesn’t realize (he’s drunk) that his ear has 
           inadvertently struck the wrong button. We realize he’s 
           leaving a message when CYNTHIA’S CELL PHONE rejects it.

           DECKER controls himself, then belligerently presses 1...

                        Cyn-thi-a! It’s Decker...I screwed 
                        up. I was leaving you a message

                        you, Cyn. I miss you so much. 
                        [Beat] Who’s ever again gonna know 
                        what we do about each other? 

           DECKER stops, so sad as he hates himself for the 
           terrible, terribly inadequate message. He hits “End” on 
           the phone. His misery quickly yields to anger.

                        really wanted to speed things up.

           Jay takes the form-- not bothering to tell her a computer 
           is on the long list of things he doesn’t have.

           INT. WAITING ROOM, EMERGENCY ROOM, VA HOSPITAL

           JAY sits among 10 or so other people in the waiting room. 

           Another Veteran, EDDIE (from McDonald’s on Century Blvd)-- 
           30s, soldierly, and jittery, and insufferably talkative-- 
           spots Jay from a few seats down. EDDIE’s leg is wounded. 
           CRUTCHES rest beside him.

                                 EDDIE 
                        I been here almost two hours and 
                        they’ve taken like two guys in. 
                        Two weeks ago, we came in around 9 
                        and I got taken in at 2 AM....

                        it’s been hell since last week...

           EDDIE stops for Jay to ask “Why?”. Jay doesn’t.

                                 EDDIE (CONT'D)
                        In the same week, they downgraded 
                        my pay rate, then slapped me with 
                        a $3100 debt. $3100! Said I hadn’t 
                        accounted for my damn Kevlar 
                        helmet and my rucksack. Excuse me, 
                        but how ‘bout you account for my 
                        goddamn knee!

           Jay delays answering-- obviously preferring not to talk.

                        What part’s the cornea again?

           Jay shrugs, looks up at the ceiling.

                        How’d you get it?

                        I’ll tell you, my buddy, Mark, had 
                        it right: what’s goddamn 
                        demoralizing is they couldn’t get 
                        away with putting those out there 
                        unless everyone around there knew 
                        about it, ya know? I mean, they 
                        detonate ‘em from two, sometimes 
                        three streets away, then leave 
                        before we even know where to look. 
                        So it’s like you know everyone in

                        otherwise they couldn’ta pulled it

           JAY offers nothing-- his eyes fastened to that ceiling.

                        My name’s Eddie Gleason. 

           EDDIE holds up his left hand. This is when Jay notices 
           he’s MISSING THREE FINGERS. EDDIE waits for Jay to offer 
           his name. Jay just barely nods.

           We SWITCH TO Jay’s POV as he tries to drown Eddie out.

           Jay walks up to CYNTHIA, a VA NURSE-- 30s, patient, with 
           kind, assuaging, tired eyes-- behind the reception desk.

                        long it’ll be? I filled out my 10-
                        10 thing...

           Cynthia notes Jay’s AILING EYE and reads his desperation.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        What’s your name?

                        I should be in the system. 

           INT. SCREENING ROOM, VA HOSPITAL

           Cynthia writes down Jay’s answers as she asks him 
           questions. Her voice stays low, and gentle.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being 
                        the worst, how bad is the pain?

                                 JAY

                                 CYNTHIA
                        10 being the worst.

                                 JAY
                        I know 10. This is 8.

           Cynthia blinks sympathetically.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Can you cover your right eye? How 
                        well can you see?

           We CUT TO Jay’s POV out of his left eye. It’s blurry.

                                 JAY
                        It’s blurry.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Can you read the label on that 
                        bottle of soap near the sink?

           From Jay’s POV, the BOTTLES are blobs of color. Jay 
           shakes his head.

                                 CYNTHIA [As she notes all this]

           Cynthia comes closer; we notice how jittery Jay becomes. 
           Jay notices the SCAR on Cynthia’s eye and fixes on it.

           Cynthia moves Jay’s sleeve to take his blood pressure and 
           sees Jay’s upper arm: the skin’s been burned off 
           completely. Cynthia pauses briefly. Jay stares stoically. 
           She knows to carry on TAKING HIS BLOOD PRESSURE.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Has the pain in your eye gotten 
                        worse since you woke up this 
                        morning?

                                 JAY
                        Yeah. I can, uh, feel like a pulse 
                        in there...in my eye.

           C.U. as Cynthia shines the light-- Jay’s EYE looks so 
           red, and raw. Cynthia turns to put away the blood 
           pressure apparatus, and to be able to more easily ask:

                                 CYNTHIA 
                        Has anyone talked to you about any 
                        kind of VA support group? 

                                 JAY

                        Well, that’s...awful. 

           Then, unexpectedly, they both sort of SMILE. 

                                 CYNTHIA
                        I’ve had trouble with one of my 
                        eyes. I know it’s tough.

           Jay looks away, then nods.

                        Family’s not the right word for 
                        her.

           Cynthia smiles-- seeming to know what that means. 

                                 CYNTHIA
                        The blood is a subconjunctival

           INT. LARGE ROOM, EMERGENCY ROOM, VA HOSPITAL

           JAY is lying down on the papered hospital bed with his 
           eyes shut. EDDIE-- now on the other side of the large 
           room-- gets up and makes his way over to Jay’s corner.

                                 EDDIE
                        So what’d they say?

           Jay keeps his eyes shut-- recognizing the voice. 

                                 EDDIE (CONT'D)
                        They tell you what’s up with your 
                        eye?

           Jay shakes his head.

                                 EDDIE (CONT'D)
                        I’m still waiting for my guy. They 
                        had to page him. So where were you 
                        when the IED went off?

                                 JAY [Snapping]
                        Why would you want to talk about 
                        that shit here? 

           Eddie is taken aback. Jay notices, and doesn’t care.

                                 EDDIE
                        I know a lotta guys like you, Man,
                        and I’ve seen the group sessions 
                        the VA’s got do good things for 
                        them. First few months all you 
                        come out with is an addiction to 
                        valium, but then shit starts to 
                        lose some weight. 

                                 JAY
                        Jesus Christ, what is so fucking 
                        hard about shutting the fuck...

           JAY shakes his head, closes his eyes and walks over to 
           the other side of the room.
           INT. CARRIE’S APARTMENT, THE NIGHT BEFORE

           CARRIE walks in with her purchases. She takes out the new 
           DRESS and hangs it on the back of her front door. Then 
           she turns on the TV; the CNN broadcast couldn’t be more 
           removed from her present reality.

           INT. LOADING DOCK, VA HOSPITAL, TUESDAY NIGHT

           CYNTHIA-- the VA NURSE-- has gone out with her CELL PHONE 
           and a CUP OF COFFEE. She moves to where she has cell 
           service and she dials the name “DECKER” from her phone. 

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Deck, it’s me. I hope you can hear 
                        me ok ‘cause I don’t think I have 
                        good reception on the loading 
                        dock. Anyhow...I got your message.

           Her eyes are tired, and sad. She sighs.

                                 CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
                        You sounded drunk and, if you 
                        weren’t, then I’m sorry but...you 
                        sounded like you were. Anyhow... 
                        the drain in the master shower is 
                        plugged again and I tried to fix 
                        it but... Maybe you can come by 
                        tomorrow and have a look at it.

           Cynthia hangs up-- regretting her own message. We realize 
           Cynthia, the VA NURSE, is Decker’s soon-to-be ex-wife.

           INT. CARRIE’S APARTMENT, TUESDAY NIGHT

           Carrie is on the phone now-- in her pajamas-- with Vanity 
           Fair. She looks at photos in the “Vanities” spread.

                                 CARRIE
                        Yeah, lunch tomorrow. It’s just a 
                        meeting, but... no, yes..ok. I am 
                        excited. It is a big deal.

           Carrie smiles-- thinking nothing of events she has no way 
           of envisioning for one more night of her life.
           INT. LIVING ROOM, CYNTHIA’S HOUSE, NIGHT

           KIM and MURRAY walk through the front door-- giddy. They 
           turn on the LIGHTS-- kissing and fumbling and enjoying 
           every bit of both.

           KIM walks over to the blinking red light on the ENDTABLE 
           and plays the MESSAGES on the machine. 

                                 DECKER (ON THE MACHINE)
                        Cyn, you there? Cynthia, it’s me, 
                        Decker. If you’re there, pick up.

           Kim DELETES the message without a thought. 

                                 DECKER’S SECOND MESSAGE [Drunk]
                        I was thinkin’ ‘bout it, and I’ll 
                        go to the counseling thing...

           Again, KIM deletes the message. 

                                 MURRAY
                        I can’t believe you just did that. 
                        He wants to do the counseling 
                        thing...

                                 KIM
                        No, he doesn’t. He’s drunk-
                        dialing. That’s his thing. Two 
                        nights a week it’s counselling, 
                        one night it’s anger, another it’s 
                        grovelling and the other two it’s 
                        jack ‘cause he’s actually working.

           KIM goes to the kitchen, pours them some wine.

                                 MURRAY [Counting]
                        That’s six. [Beat] I just...I 
                        don’t think he’s a bad guy. 

                                 KIM 
                        Then you go right on thinking 
                        about him instead of doing 
                        something about me.

           Kim heads down the hallway, stopping to slip off her 
           dress. She looks back and playfully laughs at Murray-- 
           forgetting Decker and anything else.

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM, VA HOSPITAL, THE NIGHT BEFORE

           Cynthia comes out into the LARGE ROOM, looking for Jay.

           EDDIE sees Cynthia calling out for Jay but makes no move 
           to tell her where Jay went.

           EXT. VA HOSPITAL   

           JAY leaves through the sliding doors of the Emergency 
           Room-- his eye hurting him just as badly.

                                                            FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. HIGGINS’ OFFICE, VENTURA POLICE DEPARTMENT, PRESENT

           CAPTAIN HIGGINS sits opposite DETECTIVE SUMMERS-- plump, 
           middle-aged, habitually vexed-- and OFFICER BUNTING. A TV 
           turned to LOCAL NEWS broadcasts a report of the chase.

                                 CAPTAIN HIGGINS
                        A news chopper was in a no-fly 
                        zone. The rest is speculation. And 
                        it’s the FAA, they’ll have to 
                        investigate for at least a week.

           But his tone is worried.

                        the helicopter though eyewitnesses 
                        have confirmed a police pursuit of 
                        a suspect in a vehicle was 
                        underway at Century Blvd.

                        This is why we discourage stations 
                        from covering our pursuits.

           As we pull back, we see AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVES speaking 
           to the PASSENGERS from Steven’s flight.

           INT. SUBARU, PRESENT/ EXT. 405 FREEWAY 

           Jay and Carrie are farther south on the 405 Freeway. The 
           pursuit has spent both of them. They listen to the RADIO.

                        In the second of a series of

                        confront the threat posed by 
                        terrorism, President Bush on

                        of Europe in the 20th century....

                                 CARRIE
                        We probably gave that woman a 
                        heart attack.

           Jay can’t hide his relief that she’s speaking.

                                 JAY
                        She’ll be fine.

                                 CARRIE 
                        Keep on telling yourself that. 
                        [Beat] Look, you don’t need me 
                        anymore. I’ve done everything 
                        you’ve asked. You have your new 
                        car, just let me go.

           Jay is quiet. 

                                 CARRIE (CONT'D)
                        They’re gonna be looking for two 
                        of us so there’s no upside to you 
                        keeping me. You’ve got a better 
                        chance on your own...

                                 JAY [Cutting her off]
                        Stop! All right? I can’t..I’m 
                        not...I just need to figure out 
                        what I’m doing, ok?  Then I said 
                        I’d let you go. So just...

           Carrie knows to stop. They’re quiet for a stretch.

                                 CARRIE
                        [Beat] What did you do?

                                 JAY 
                        What?

           Carrie shakes her head; she knows he understood her.

                                 JAY 
                        I stole some money. 

                                 CARRIE
                        How much?

                        $800. 

           The amount gives Carrie pause and, unmistakably, 
           reassurance.

                                 CARRIE
                        I don’t believe you. 

                                 JAY
                        I don’t care.

           Both are quiet for some time.

           INT. SUBARU  

           JAY glances in Carrie’s direction every 10 or so seconds 
           in an effort to anticipate anything she might do.

                                 JAY
                        Look...it’s almost over for you. I 
                        just need to figure out...

           He doesn’t finish. Carrie stays quiet-- rewriting him and 
           her situation, now that she’s learned its $800 origin.

                                 CARRIE [Finally]
                        We could’ve really hurt someone.

                                 JAY
                        We didn’t..And...if we did, I did.

                                 CARRIE
                        What? What is that supposed to 
                        mean? I was in the car with you.
                        I could’ve tried to stop it.

                                 JAY 
                        You bit me.

                                 CARRIE
                        Evidently not hard enough.

                                 JAY
                        Everybody’s fine. So...just don’t 
                        think about it.

                                 CARRIE
                        We don’t know that. So I’ll think 
                        about it if I want to.

           She looks at the wound on her leg, then out the window.

                                 CARRIE (CONT'D)
                        This doesn’t happen in real life.

                        [Beat] Let me see your chin. 

           Carrie doesn’t move. He hands her the BOTTLED WATER.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        Here. Use this to wash it off.

           Carrie lowers the overhead MIRROR on her side. She sees 
           her face for the first time since her fall.

                                 CARRIE [Softly] 
                        Oh. Wow.

           INT. CAMILLE’S LIVING ROOM, NIGHT, PRESENT

           GORDON is flipping through channels when he sees VIDEO 
           FOOTAGE of Jay and Carrie’s CAR CHASE with a grainy 
           surveillance photo of JAY from the hold-up at the Subway.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        The suspect has been identified as 
                        Jay Fitch from Calabasas....

                                 GORDON
                        Holy... shit. Camille! 

           As GORDON watches, we see already edited VIDEO FOOTAGE-- 
           from a different angle-- of JAY and CARRIE’S CAR going 
           over the 60 feet of the overpass and landing on the very 
           back of Aminah’s car with a thud.  

                                 GORDON [Loud as hell]
                        Caaamillle!

           Camille comes in-- still in her Long’s Drugs uniform. 

                                 CAMILLE
                        Christ, Gordon, I’m ten feet away. 
                        Do you have to yell like....

           Camille sees Jay on the TV. She instantly knows she’s 
           seeing her life changing. Stella watches behind her. And, 
           as if on cue, there’s a KNOCK on Camille’s door.
           INT. LAX

           STEVEN walks through the airport. His gait suspects the 
           events towards which he’s headed.

           INT. HERTZ RENTAL STATION, LAX, CONCURRENT

           STEVEN is paying for his rental car. The HERTZ ATTENDANT 
           is a pleasant woman around Carrie’s age. She’s half-
           glancing at NEWS on a small handheld TV on the counter.

           By now, a CIVILIAN VIDEO of Murray’s crash has found its 
           way to the airwaves. Steven can’t see it.

                                 HERTZ ATTENDANT
                        Do you need directions anywhere?

           EXT. 5 FREEWAY, DESERT, AFTERNOON/ INT. SUBARU

           Jay and Carrie listen to the news about them.

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER
                        ..still significant back-up on the 
                        405 from a police pursuit near the 
                        LAX overpass where a suspect and 
                        his female hostage are believed to 
                        have broken over the divider. The 
                        two right lanes have been blocked 
                        by CHP. Traffic also backed up at 
                        Hawthorne Blvd...

           JAY turns off the Radio and anxiously looks ahead.

                                 CARRIE
                        What are you doing?

                                 JAY

                        Do you have to drive this fast for 
                        that to happen?

           JAY glances at his speedometer, and barely slows down.

                                 CARRIE (CONT'D)
                        What is your plan?

                        whole thing...it just...

           She can see she needs to reshape the question.

                                 CARRIE
                        Well, if you were to make one up 
                        right now, what would it be?

                                 JAY
                        [Beat] To get away. 

           She sees how completely he’s hanging on her reaction.

                                 CARRIE 
                        We need to stop somewhere. Neither 
                        of us can make it through another 
                        of those. And we need to clean up.

           While her words offer no comfort; they also inflict no 
           damage. Jay reaches for his GUN and looks as undone as 
           ever.

           about Murray. Her wrecked, catatonic face tells us so.

           Cynthia answers and we stay on her face as we watch it 
           now forever change.

           INT. STEVEN’S RENTAL CAR

           STEVEN sits impotently in traffic. On the opposite side 
           of the 405, some CONES still divert traffic from the 
           damaged section of the overpass Jay and Carrie went over. 

           EXT. MOTEL ROOM, NEAR ESCONDIDO, EARLY EVENING

           Carrie and Jay pull into the parking lot of an 
           unremarkable roadside MOTEL. Jay stares ahead-- lost as 
           he seems to finally recognize the day’s events. 

                                 JAY
                        How are we gonna do this?

           CONTINUED:

           As he momentarily relinquishes his grip on things, Carrie 
           knows-- unaccountably-- to take hold of them.

                                 CARRIE
                        How about...as easily as we can? 
                        Let’s just get out, commit to not 
                        hurting anyone, ask for a room, 
                        pay for it and clean up.

           Jay’s still holding his GUN. 

                                 CARRIE (CONT'D)
                        Do you have to bring that?

                                 CARRIE
                        What for?

                                 JAY
                        Just in case.

                                 CARRIE
                        There is no just in case if we’re 
                        just going to get a room. 

                                 JAY
                        They could have my picture. 

           Carrie hadn’t considered that. The consideration is 
           enough to revive her fear.

           INT. CAMILLE’S KITCHEN/ LIVING ROOM, PRESENT, CONT’D

           As DETECTIVE SUMMERS questions Camille, she busies 
           herself with a worthy amount of activity in the urgent 
           preparation of a dinner of tacos.

           Stella sits in the living room, not watching TV, hearing 
           every word. It takes SUMMERS a second to be able to show 
           Camille CARRIE’S DRIVER’S LICENSE PHOTO.

                                 DETECTIVE SUMMERS

                        No. But she’s not Jay’s type.

                                 DETECTIVE SUMMERS [Carefully]
                        Well, your daughter’s father...is 
                        in a lot of trouble, Ma’am. 

           Camille directs her anxiety to a FROZEN BAG OF CORN she 
           SLAMS against the counter. 

                                 DETECTIVE SUMMERS
                        You don’t have to be if you 
                        cooperate.

           Camille momentarily stops, then does the only thing she 
           knows to do with her vulnerability: quashes it.

                                 CAMILLE [Evenly]
                        No. I don’t have to be ‘cause I’m 
                        not.

           She commences the epic CHOPPING of onions and lettuce.

                                 DETECTIVE SUMMERS
                        Do you think you could do that 
                        later?

                                 CAMILLE
                        Sure. Let me just call my chef.

                                 SUMMERS [Patiently]
                        Ma’am, if Mr. Fitch didn’t own a 
                        gun...

                                 CAMILLE [Bustling once more]
                        There’s no “if”. He didn’t. And my 
                        name’s not Ma’am.

                                 DETECTIVE SUMMERS
                        Then do you have any idea where he 
                        might have gotten his gun?

                                 CAMILLE
                        Maybe he thought he deserved a 
                        souvenir and tucked it in his 
                        pocket after the war. 

           SUMMERS realizes this isn’t going to be the most 
           productive interrogation of his life. Camille LIGHTS the 
           gas stove and tosses the CHICKEN and ONIONS on it.

                                 DETECTIVE  SUMMERS
                        Does Mr. Fitch have a drug problem 
                        you’re aware of?

                        that.

                                 DETECTIVE SUMMERS 
                        Well, do you have any idea why he 
                        would have needed the money 
                        urgently?

                                 CAMILLE

                        Did anything happen that maybe set 
                        him off?

           CAMILLE faces SUMMERS-- KNIFE deliberately in hand as the 
           chicken and onion sizzle furiously in the background. She 
           uses lettuce to chop her way through this next answer.

                        He just came back from the Iraq 
                        five months ago. I’m no genius but 
                        maybe that left some marks.

           She sets down the KNIFE. 

                                 CAMILLE [Leaving]
                        I gotta pee. If you’re gonna stay, 
                        keep an eye on my chicken.

           EXT. PARKING LOT, MOTEL NEAR ESCONDIDO

           JAY walks behind Carrie-- his hands in his pockets, hers 
           nervously at her side. The blood and dust and day 
           covering both of them hardly make them inconspicuous. The 
           foot and a half space between them doesn’t help.

           They reach the reception office.

           INT. FRONT OFFICE, MOTEL NEAR ESCONDIDO

           The MOTEL MANAGER is an OLDER MAN. Carrie and Jay catch 
           his eye the moment they walk in. 

                                 JAY
                        How much for a room?

                                 MOTEL MANAGER
                        45. What the hell happened to you 
                        two?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The MOTEL MANAGER keeps his eyes especially on CARRIE.

                                 CARRIE
                        Long day.

           JAY takes out three TWENTIES from his back pocket. The 
           MOTEL MANAGER sees Carrie’s eyes dart anxiously to Jay’s 
           back pocket. She sees him see this.

           The MANAGER leans over to look at Carrie’s leg. She can 
           see how nervous Jay’s getting, how ready he seems to act.

                                 MOTEL MANAGER 
                        That’s quite a scrape.

                                 CARRIE [Not at all wavering]
                        It was quite a spill.

           The MANAGER’s look to her lingers: Is that all she wants 
           to tell him? Her look back to him doesn’t waver in the 
           least: Yes.

                                 MOTEL MANAGER 
                        I gotta go get you your change.

                                 JAY [Suspicious, nervous]
                        [Beat] Who has to go get change?

                                 CARRIE [Under her breath]
                        People who keep their cash 
                        register in another room.

           Jay looks at her-- so uncharacteristically out of sorts.

           The MANAGER comes back-- still just a little uncertain. 
           Carrie notices this and she notices Jay noticing it.

           In that moment, CARRIE steps closer to JAY-- as if she 
           knew him and really were accompanying him to the highway 
           motel. She rests her head against Jay’s shoulder. 

                                 CARRIE
                        Could you hurry up? We’re 
                        exhausted.

           The MANAGER gives them the change. We don’t miss the 
           relief in Carrie’s eyes as she lifts her head off Jay’s 
           shoulder.

           INT. HOSPITAL, UCLA MEDICAL CENTER

           CYNTHIA comes into the hospital-- still in her SCRUBS 
           from the night before-- and heads to the check-in desk. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        My...my husband, Decker Walsh, was 
                        admitted a few hours ago. I’m a 
                        nurse at the Sepulveda VA. He was 
                        in a car accident. 

           EXT. ALLEY, MOTEL NEAR ESCONDIDO

           JAY parks their Subaru in the alley behind the MOTEL. He 
           looks over at Carrie and she meets his eye. He looks 
           away. His moment of weakness has evidently passed.

           INT. CAMILLE’S LIVING ROOM, CONT’D 

           GORDON-- in some sort of work uniform-- walks into the 
           kitchen to get a beer. Detective Summers measures him 
           before Gordon gets out a word.

                                 GORDON [Lowering his voice]
                        Guy’s a fuckin’ nut job if you ask 
                        me. Camille knows it, too, but 
                        she’s too soft on him to say it. 
                        I’m not afraid to. 

                                 DETECTIVE SUMMERS
                        [Beat] Then why are you 
                        whispering?

           Gordon clears his throat.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM, ESCONDIDO

           Jay and Carrie walk inside. She looks over the room.

                                 JAY
                        Thank you for...cooperating back 
                        there.

                                 CARRIE [Dryly]
                        My pleasure.

                                 JAY
                        Look, I know shit’s slowed down.. 
                        but... I wouldn’t take that as an 
                        OK to try anything. 

           She just faces him-- her eyes admonishing the advisement.

                                 CARRIE [Wearily]
                        I need to clean up.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           We see her head hurt her as she walks to the bathroom. 

                                 CARRIE
                        There aren’t any windows but 
                        there’s a vent and a drain in the 
                        shower. You wanna check ‘em in 
                        case I try to crawl out?

           JAY scopes out the parking lot and motel grounds from the 
           window as he ignores her sarcasm.

                                 CARRIE (CONT'D)
                        [Beat] What is your name?

           JAY turns to her-- surprised, self-conscious. 

                                 JAY
                        Jay. 

           He looks back out the window-- unable to carry something 
           as light as a conversation now that things have calmed.

                                 CARRIE 
                        I never thought I was the kind of 
                        person who would just get in the 
                        car with someone who was trying to 
                        abduct me.

                                 JAY [Back still turned]
                        You didn’t just “get in the car.” 
                        I had a gun.

                                 CARRIE
                        Doesn’t matter. I have a brain. I 
                        always thought that would get me 
                        out of it somehow.

                                 JAY
                        It probably has. 

           She closes the bathroom door behind her.

           INT. BATHROOM, CAMILLE’S HOUSE

           CAMILLE sits on the edge of the tub, gripping the 
           enormity of what’s just happened. Her absolute stillness 
           makes her almost unrecognizable to us.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM, NEAR ESCONDIDO

           JAY is on the PHONE. We have no idea who with.

                        I’ll pay you extra to pick it up.

           INT. BATHROOM, MOTEL

           CARRIE sits at the edge of her tub. She WINCES IN PAIN as 
           the water washes over her badly scraped leg. She hits the 
           WALL in pain-- not wanting to scream. 

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        You ok?

                        I’m fine. 

           The BLOOD from her scraped leg reddens the water.

           CYNTHIA waits in this other hospital waiting room.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM 

           JAY mutes the NEWS, then picks up the MOTEL PHONE.

           INT. CAMILLE’S HOUSE/ ALTERNATING

           The PHONE RINGS. We see CAMILLE race out of the bathroom-- 
           only slowing as she reaches the kitchen. GORDON’s about 
           to answer the phone when she does her best to keep 
           herself from screaming at him not to.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I got it!

           She sees DETECTIVE SUMMERS watching her closely. Her 
           dinner is burning by now. 

                                 CAMILLE (CONT'D)
                        Great work with the chicken.

           She goes over to stir it, stealing the seconds in an 
           effort to be calm before she answers the phone.

                                 DETECTIVE SUMMERS
                        You gonna get that?

                        Oh, Right. You think it’s him.

           She shakes her head at him condescendingly.

                                 CAMILLE  [Answering]
                        Hello?

           It’s Jay. And as Camille turns away from Detective 
           Summers, we know she knew it would be. She doesn’t miss a 
           beat as she meets the Detective’s eyes.

                                 CAMILLE 
                        Hey, Jo-Jo. [To Summers] It’s my 
                        cousin.

           She turns, taking refuge in the chicken once more.

                                 JAY (ALTERNATING)
                        [Surprised] They there?

                        Yeah. 

                                 JAY [Evenly]
                        Wow. That was fast.

           Camille does her best to manage a swell of emotion.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I know, I saw it all on the TV. 
                        [To Summers, re: the smoke] You 
                        think you could open some windows? 
                        Jesus. [On the phone] I got the 
                        cops here, it’s crazy.

                                 JAY
                        How about all this?

           She turns on the KITCHEN FAN so SUMMERS can’t hear her.

                                 CAMILLE
                        How about it?

           Her face-- turned so no one can see it-- looks so very, 
           very sad as she says his words back to him.

                                 JAY
                        [Beat] I’m sorry, Camille.

           Jay keeps his eyes on the MOTEL TV as the single tender 
           word nearly undoes him.

                                 JAY
                        Sure.

           Camille hangs up. SUMMERS is right behind her. She 
           launches into a tirade lest he see how shaken she is.

                                 CAMILLE
                        How ‘bout you start askin’ the

                                 DETECTIVE SUMMERS
                        What?

           The feisty in Camille resurfaces at remarkable speed.

                                 CAMILLE

                        Why didn’t you people do something 
                        before it was too late?

           But as her voice shakes, we wonder who it is she’s really 
           asking that of. 

                                 DETECTIVE SUMMERS
                        I’m not with the army, Ma’am.

           She holds her stomach as she finds it harder to breathe-- 
           coming more undone with every word.

                        You people just...you fucked him 
                        up, then dropped him back in the 
                        middle of our lives with nothin’. 
                        Not one person came around to 
                        check and make sure he was ok.

                        I could have that call traced in a

           SUMMERS takes out his CELL PHONE.

                                 DETECTIVE SUMMERS
                        It’s Summers. I need a trace.

           STEVEN’S finally made it to America’s Best Value Inn.

                                 STEVEN
                        My name’s Steven Fitch. My 
                        brother, Jay Fitch, is staying 
                        here. 

           We finally confirm the relationship between them.
           INT. MOTEL ROOM 

           There’s a KNOCK on the door. CARRIE comes out of the 
           bathroom-- cleaned up. Jay sees her panic at the knock.

                                 JAY
                        I ordered some food.

           Jay tucks his GUN in his back pocket and opens the door. 
           Carrie holds her breath. A MAN holds PIZZA and a BAG.

                                 DELIVERY MAN
                        Here you go...

           JAY hands him money. Carrie lets out her breath.

                                 JAY 
                        Keep the change. [Closing the 
                        door] I got Tylenol, too. It’ll 
                        help your head.

           Jay takes it and a bottle of JACK DANIELS out of the bag.

           STEVEN sets his bag down and takes in the room in which 
           his brother has been living since he’s been back.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM NEAR ESCONDIDO, LATER

           CARRIE eats some pizza with her legs tucked beneath her, 
           looking so small against the headboard of the bed. 

           They’re watching surreal NEWS COVERAGE of themselves on 
           the TV. In the footage taken in the afternoon, a SMALL 
           CROWD had gathered on the sides of Century Blvd. 

                                 WOMAN ON THE NEWS
                        I saw this car race past me on my 
                        left and...when I turned to look.. 
                        I saw...it was like something out 
                        of the movies, the car just broke 
                        the railing and then disappeared. 
                        I mean...I’ve never seen someone 
                        ...leave the freeway like that.

                        Fitch is suspected of carjacking a

                        aren’t releasing but we have 
                        several eyewitnesses who have 
                        identified her as female....

           Carrie is rapt. Jay’s thoughts have travelled.

                                 JAY
                        I was thinkin’ I’d drop you off at 
                        the train station in... 

           The both hear it: a CAR pulling into the MOTEL PARKING 
           LOT. JAY moves to the window. It’s a POLICE CAR.

           Jay’s back straightens. He swipes his GUN off the table 
           as he watches, through the curtain, as an OFFICER gets 
           out of the car and momentarily looks around the lot.

                                 CARRIE [Behind him]
                        What is it? 

           Jay motions her to be quiet with his left hand and 
           readies his GUN with his right.

           The OFFICER starts to walk, but not towards the front 
           office. He’s headed for one of the rooms. 

           JAY squints his good eye and covers his BAD to be able to 
           better see. He still can’t.

                                 JAY
                        Come here. 

           CARRIE comes over.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        I can’t see him.  What’s he doing?

                                 CARRIE
                        He’s walking to one of the rooms. 

                                 JAY
                        Is he knocking?

                                 CARRIE
                        No...there’s a woman at the door.

           We see the WOMAN’S OUTLINE as the OFFICER slips inside.

                                 JAY
                        Did he go in?

                        Yeah. [Watching] I don’t think 
                        he’s here for us. 

           If she’s disappointed, we don’t detect it.

                                 JAY
                        We gotta get going. I was gonna 
                        drop you off at the San Diego 
                        train station, figured you could 
                        take a train back, but your 
                        leg...before we go...You got tar 
                        and the street on it when you 
                        fell. It could get infected. 

                                 CARRIE
                        What’s wrong with your eye?

           There’s no averting her question while she stares at him 
           like she does.

                                 JAY [Reluctantly]
                        I was walking down the street and 
                        a bomb went off.

           Jay can see Carrie doesn’t know if he’s kidding or not.

                                 JAY 
                        Not here. In Iraq.

           So much comes together for Carrie. Half of her is 
           surprised and half of her isn’t at all.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        I could clean it for you. 

                                 CARRIE
                        [Lost] What?

                                 JAY
                        Your leg. We should take care of 
                        it before we leave.

           FRED’S WIFE doesn’t answer as she continues watching.

           his co-worker.

           ENRAGED WOMAN is glued to her TV, knowing just how 
           relevant the broadcast is to her.

                        Jay Fitch is a United States 
                        Marine who recently served in 
                        Iraq. He was currently working at 
                        James Thompson Moving Company in 
                        Calabasas, California.

           EXT. MOTEL, NIGHT

           JAY tilts the bedside lamp so that the light is shining 
           on Carrie’s badly bloodied CUT LEG. We notice the 
           LIGHTBULB touching the cloth of the shade.

           CARRIE watches JAY carefully, gently tend to her wound. 
           Her eyes involuntarily well. Jay looks up and notices.

           She looks right into his eyes. In that moment, it’s as 
           deep a connection as any.

                                 JAY
                        You ok?

                                 CARRIE

           And in those six syllables lies the distance they’ve 
           crossed. As Carrie turns her head to the TV NEWS-- now 
           covering MURRAY’S DEATH-- we seem to sense it all about 
           to change.

                        We do know the pilot of the KTLA

           She holds her stomach as she walks over to the TV as they 
           put a picture of MURRAY on the screen.

                        Calm down. It was an accident.

           Her shoulders shake as she watches the footage of 
           Murray’s CRASH before she looks back at Jay.

           Jay walks over to the television.

                                 CARRIE 
                        Don’t you touch it!...Oh my God, I 
                        told you to get off the 
                        freeway...I was the one who said 
                        they couldn’t follow us near the 
                        airport. I was the one...Oh, God, 
                        I can’t breathe.

                        You didn’t do anything. It was me. 
                        It was all me.

           She begins to cry, suddenly and violently until her 
           attention returns to Jay, who’s just standing there.

                                 CARRIE  [Shouting]
                        You knew? You fucking...

                        Or what? You’ll shoot me? Do it! 
                        Get your gun! I don’t care! Go on! 

           Just then, the consequences of the shade on the bulb 
           transpire. Carrie turns to it as it catches fire.

           JAY turns in the direction Carrie’s looking. The moment 
           he registers the shade on fire, he heads for the 
           bathroom, gets towels, comes back and expertly puts it 
           out as Carrie watches without a word.

           They’re both quiet as the SMOKE claims the space between 
           them. Jay’s face is wracked with regret. Carrie looks at 
           him-- indicting and acquitting him at once. 

                                 JAY [Lost]
                        I’ll finish cleaning your leg and

                        I don’t want you touching my 
                        fucking leg!

           Jay sees how she’s looking at him. He blinks-- looking so 
           devastated, so defeated, so helpless in that instant.

                        I’m sorry.

           After many more quiet seconds, JAY finally gets the keys 
           and leaves the room. 

           Carrie watches him through the water in her eyes.

           EXT. HALLWAY, MOTEL, ESCONDIDO, LATE IN THE NIGHT

           From ahead, we watch JAY walk down the hallway alone.

           EXT. ALLEY, MOTEL, ESCONDIDO

           From the alley, we see JAY turn the corner and make his 
           way to the car by himself. 

           INT. SUBARU 

           From inside the car, we see JAY get in. His shoulders 
           rise and fall in the deepest of breaths as he stares 
           ahead for some silent seconds.

           Then, we hear the passenger door open and close as CARRIE 
           gets in beside him. We hear a single, stoic sniffle as 
           she stares ahead without a word. 

           Jay turns his head to look at her. She doesn’t look back.

           Jay turns on the car.

           INT. JAY’S ROOM/SUITE, AMERICA’S BEST VALUE INN

           STEVEN opens the drawer of Jay’s endtable next to the 
           bed. There is nothing in it. As Steven makes his sense of 
           this, he’s startled by a VIOLENT KNOCK on the door.

                        OFFICER (O.S.)

           STEVEN opens the door-- shocked to find two OFFICERS-- 
           one is OFFICER BUNTING-- with their GUNS aimed at him. 

                                 OFFICER BUNTING 
                        Put your hands behind your head!

                        What the hell’s going on?

           Steven raises his hands as he asks the question-- knowing 
           a good part of what he doesn’t actually know yet.

           INT. SUBARU, NIGHT

           Jay and Carrie drive. The Whiskey sits between them. We 
           guess they’ve been silent this whole time.

           JAY takes a moment, then puts the GUN in the compartment 
           on his car door in a gesture to set her at ease.

                                 CARRIE
                        How are you driving with your eye?

                        Fine, I hope.

           She’s in no mood for the attempt at levity.

                                 CARRIE
                        What was it for?

                                 JAY
                        What?

                                 CARRIE
                        The money. I’m assuming you needed 
                        it or you woulda set your sights 
                        higher than a Subway.

                        I have a kid. And her Mom was 
                        threatening to move in with this 
                        prick. And I been behind on what

                        money. And it just happened.

           Carrie’s quiet. This is the most he’s spoken.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        One minute I wasn’t serious about 
                        going in there and holding up the 
                        place and then...the next 
                        minute...I was. 

           JAY’s BAD EYE looks so red, and irritated and, just like 
           his other, so very, very tired.

                        some money.

           Jay ignores the question.

                                 JAY
                        Look, you gotta know you had

           Jay can see he’s jarred Carrie once more. After a minute

           CYNTHIA is beside Decker’s bed. The accident has done

           He can barely open his bruised eyes. His voice is so 
           MUFFLED-- and his lips so swollen-- it’s very hard to 
           make out his words.

                        happened, but...the plane’s 
                        wing...it hit Murray’s propeller. 
                        [Beat] His helicopter went down. 

           Decker closes his barely open eye. As he opens it, we 
           SWITCH TO Decker’s BLURRY POV as he sees Cynthia put her 
           head down to kiss his hand. 

                                 DECKER [Yelling his mumble]
                        Where was he?

           She looks at him. He knows she knows. Cynthia lowers her 
           voice that he might not hear her answer.

                                 CYNTHIA 
                        Somewhere near the airport.

           DECKER closes his eyes and MOANS a wail of real pain. 

           Decker’s eyes stay shut. He’s drawn the connection. And 
           in the second we see Cynthia’s face, we see, so has she.
           INT. SUBARU, LAST BIT OF NIGHT

           Jay and Carrie have turned on some music in the car.

                                 CARRIE
                        Five months ago I had my palm read 
                        and she said there would be a day 
                        at the end of summer that would 
                        change my life.

                                 JAY
                        You believe in that stuff?

                                 CARRIE
                        I do now.

                                 JAY
                        I don’t know if I’d want my 
                        daughter to turn out like you.

                                 CARRIE [Sarcastic]
                        Thanks.

                                 JAY
                        If she turns out like you that’ll 
                        mean she made it through whatever 
                        shit the world put out. ‘Cause 
                        she’ll still trust people.

           Jay sips a little more whiskey. It seems to be coaxing 
           the more-than-normal number of words out of him.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        Then, again, if she turns out just 
                        like you....there’s no telling 
                        what the world’ll do to her.

           This hits Carrie.

           CAMILLE is on the couch, watching the local NEWS in the 
           dark, at low volume, waiting for any update about Jay. 
           The blue glare of the TV reveals the worry on her face. 

           It also shows the outline of STELLA sleeping with her 
           head on her mother’s lap.

           EXT. PARKING LOT, MOTEL NEAR ESCONDIDO/ INT. HIGGINS’ 
           OFFICE, VENTURA PD (ALTERNATING)

           An OFFICER is calling CAPTAIN HIGGINS from the parking 
           lot of the motel Carrie and Jay were at. The MANAGER is 
           in the background. So is the COP Jay and Carrie saw.

                                 CAPTAIN HIGGINS
                        Can the manager ID them?

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Yeah, but his statement’s not 
                        doing anything for us. He didn’t 
                        see what they were driving and he 
                        doesn’t know when they left.

                                 CAPTAIN HIGGINS
                        Didn’t the smoke alarms go off? 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        No, he says they weren’t working.

           CAPTAIN HIGGINS is quiet as he chews this.

                                 CAPTAIN HIGGINS 
                        All right...Get outta there before

                                 CARRIE
                        Definitely.

                                 JAY
                        Yeah, well....Talking doesn’t cut 
                        it. If they were there...they know 
                        that. If they weren’t they never 
                        will. And 9 outta 10, any 
                        conversation is too much fuckin’

           Carrie nods; she knew as much but is no less surprised to 
           hear it said so plainly aloud.

                                 CARRIE 
                        I’ve pretended to care about the 
                        war way more than I actually have.  
                        I’ve spent time thinking I’m

                        the same thing. I haven’t done

                        Wait, I’m confused. Did you guys 
                        start chasing him right after he 
                        left the Subway? I mean...how did

           has just before it turns to day. It is one of the best 
           colors the world offers. The light around Jay and Carrie 
           is that blue.)

                                 CARRIE
                        Hey...your eye’s not red anymore.

           She’s referring to the now normal-looking white part of 
           Jay’s eye. She looks back out at the wide open.

                                 CARRIE (CONT'D)
                        I think...life is long. At least 
                        it should be.

           Jay and Carrie stare at each other, between the desert 
           and rocks and sky-- two bowling pins on the horizon.

                                 CARRIE [So softly] 
                        Do me a favor, think of this.

           Jay knows by looking at her to what she’s referring.

           INT. CAMILLE’S KITCHEN, MORNING

           CAMILLE looks out the window as she drinks coffee 
           standing up. Gordon’s eating cereal. In the background, 
           the NEWS seems to have moved on from Jay and Carrie.

                                 GORDON
                        Why haven’t they called you? You’d 
                        think they’d want to talk to you. 
                        Maybe they don’t know ‘cause you 
                        two were never married...

                        CAMILLE
                                                         GORDON
           Gordon..
                                              But, I mean...the police 
                                              found you ‘cause of the 
                                              registration. And Stella’s 
                                              got his last name...

                                 CAMILLE [Sharply]
                        Gordon!

                                 GORDON [Opening the refrigerator]
                        Yeah, Babe...

                                 CAMILLE [Calm as ever]
                        Could you get the fuck out of my 
                        house?

           Gordon looks at Camille-- shocked as he will ever be.

           INT. CAPTAIN HIGGINS’ HOME

           We’re in a room darkened with the aid of blinds. A PHONE 
           RINGS in the distance. The door opens.

                                 CAPTAIN HIGGINS’ WIFE (O.S.)
                        John, it’s for you.

           She hands him the phone.

                                 DETECTIVE SUMMERS (O.S.)
                        Sorry to wake you, Captain, but 
                        you said to check in. 

                                 CAPTAIN HIGGINS
                        What do we have?

                                 DETECTIVE SUMMERS
                        Nothing. We’ve put out the APBS, 
                        but we don’t have any leads and 
                        without air support...

           HIGGINS wearily rubs his eyes. 

                                 CAPTAIN HIGGINS
                        Well, he’s not gonna be able to 
                        cross the border with a hostage.

                                 DETECTIVE SUMMERS
                        If he even decides to do that. 
                        They could be hiding out in the 
                        desert.

                                 CAPTAIN HIGGINS
                        Not likely.

                                 DETECTIVE SUMMERS 
                        We don’t know for a fact they’re 
                        near the border. We could keep it 
                        in our court for another few hours 
                        before we call the Feds.

           We don’t miss the disappointment in the Captain’s eyes as 
           he hears mention of the Feds.

           INT. METROLINK TRAIN STATION, SAN CLEMENTE, MORNING

           Jay and Carrie’s stolen SUBARU turns into the parking lot 
           of the train station. Carrie stays completely put.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 CARRIE 
                        What if they’re hiding out there 
                        and they charge the car as soon as 
                        I get out?

                                 JAY
                        Then they charge the car. 

           She looks around-- making no move to get out of the car.

                                 CARRIE [Quietly]
                        No. No one’s charging the car.

           Carrie FOLDS some of the MONEY into the PAPER BAG.

                                 JAY [Watching her]
                        Tell her I’m sorry there’s not 
                        more. 

           Carrie nods. She will. 

                                 JAY
                        And get your leg taken care of. 

           Carrie nods. As he looks at her, he sees how torn she 
           looks. 

                                 CARRIE 
                        I’m sorry I bit you. That was 
                        barbaric.

                                 JAY
                        It’s not the worst thing in the 
                        world that you didn’t cooperate.

           She stares at him and doesn’t move a bit.

                                 CARRIE
                        This doesn’t feel right.

                                 JAY
                        What, you feel like you need to 
                        get even?

           Carrie’s unable to consider the joke. She looks at him. 
           And Jay looks at her. And, strangely, there’s no more 
           strangeness. There is only the enormity of goodbye.

           Carrie shakes her head. It’s her turn at being unable to 
           find the right words.  

                                 CARRIE 
                        At least tell me what you’re 
                        planning to do after I leave.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 JAY
                        Probably get some breakfast. Maybe 
                        borrow a different car...

           She instinctively puts her hand on his. Jay isn’t 
           prepared for the touch. 

           As the tears she’s been holding back the entire day rise, 
           she does everything to stifle them. She finds his eyes 
           and fiercely holds them.

                                 CARRIE 
                        You know...enough time passes and 
                        you can get used to anything. 
                        Whatever it is, and...I know it’s 
                        Something major...or many things 
                        major...you...

           She stops, unable to finish.

                                 JAY
                        You’re gonna miss your train.

           Carrie finally takes her hand off his and gets out of the 
           car. She begins to walk away, looking over her shoulder a 
           final time as she does. 

           She sees Jay slowly pull away.

           But, as she turns away, Jay stops the car.

           He SQUINTS to be able to see her as she approaches a 
           TRANSIT COP stationed just outside the train station. 

           EXT. TRAIN STATION, SAN DIEGO, CONTINUOUS

           The TRANSIT COP’S attention is immediately drawn to 
           Carrie. Her face is bruised, her chin is scraped, her leg 
           is cut, her dress is dirty and the expression on her face 
           is so tremendously sad. 

           Her eyes register the TRANSIT COP and roll right over him 
           -- detached. What he represents is the last thing on her 
           mind.

           INT. SUBARU, CONCURRENT, CONT’D

           JAY can’t see Carrie’s expression, but he makes out the 
           TRANSIT COP’S as he instantly singles her out. 

           The COP seems on the verge of approaching her as she 
           walks toward the station entrance.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           We feel JAY tense up as we watch him watch Carrie walk 
           past the COP, without a word, or the slightest pause.

           We feel Jay’s relief, and gratitude.

           And, as his eye relaxes its squint, we see how he’s 
           finally seeing her, and missing her.

           Jay watches until she’s too far to watch any more. 

           And then he drives away.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, LOS ANGELES

           STEVEN sits on the bed in his hotel room-- several mini-
           bar drinks into the morning. He stares at a show on the 
           TV-- his thoughts years away.

           INT. TRAIN FROM SAN DIEGO

           Carrie takes a seat by the window. She looks around at 
           everyone and every thing. It’s one of a countless number 
           of things Carrie will do differently from now on. 

           She smooths her skirt and fidgets as she catches her 
           reflection in the window of the train. 

           So much about her has changed in two dozen hours.

           INT. BATHROOM, CAMILLE’S HOUSE

           CAMILLE still has the MORNING NEWS on as she washes her 
           weary face-- listening for any word about Jay. 

                                 MORNING NEWS (O.S., ON THE TV)
                        Kate Moss tells British Vogue of 
                        her daughter, “I feel like I’ve 
                        got a partner in crime” “I’m never 
                        gonna have to be on my own 
                        again.”...[Beat] And, coming up 
                        after the break, do Mike and Susan 
                        finally find their way back to 
                        each other? 

           This arrives over a PROMO for Desperate Housewives. As 
           the broadcast continues, Camille dries her face with a 
           towel, then buries her face in it and cries.
           INT. COFFEE SHOP, NEAR SAN DIEGO, THURSDAY MORNING

           JAY walks up to the counter-- carefully avoiding any 
           looks to the left or right. 

                                 JAY
                        Can I get a cup of coffee and a...
                        A piece of that apple pie. [Beat] 
                        Two pieces actually. 

           The WAITRESS starts readying the order for him and JAY 
           puts a bill down on the counter. 

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        Where’s your Men’s Room?

           The WAITRESS indicates it’s around the corner. 

           INT. TRAIN FROM SAN DIEGO

           As CARRIE sits on the train, letting the two dozen hours 
           take shape, their reckoning begins.

           With no warning, they take her over in waves until what 
           begins as a single TEAR down her face gives way to 
           SOBBING that shakes her from shoulders to hands.

           The three other people too close not to miss and hear it 
           look away, as if their discomfort is polite.

           Carrie doesn’t notice as she folds inside herself.

           INT. BATHROOM, COFFEE SHOP, NEAR SAN DIEGO

           JAY looks himself in the mirror like it’s been years 
           since he’s seen his own face.

           This is the last time we will see Jay.

           INT. TRAIN FROM SAN DIEGO

           We stay on CARRIE’S FACE as it leans against the window 
           of her seat-- red, puffy, and so spent. Eventually, we...

                                                                  CUT TO:
           INT. RADIO STATION, DAY, NEW YORK, A YEAR LATER

           As we locate ourselves in a RADIO STATION STUDIO, we make 
           sense of Carrie’s words at the opening of the film.

           We finally move around and see CARRIE-- her hair shorter, 
           her eyes older.

                                 RADIO HOST
                        Everyone who hears stories like 
                        yours or Ashley Smith’s, going all 
                        the way back to Patty Hearst’s, 
                        can’t help asking: Why didn’t you 
                        run?

            We realize SOMEONE ELSE is the RADIO HOST.

                                 CARRIE
                        Well...

           We stay on her face.

                                 CARRIE (CONT'D)
                        Everyone wasn’t there.

           There’s an awkward pause as the HOST waits for more and 
           realizes Carrie’s not about to give her any.

           INT. AMINAH’S DAUGHTER’S CAR, PRESENT 

           We recognize MONI, AMINAH’S daughter (now 16), listening 
           to the broadcast as she now drives herself home from 
           school. She’s so rapt, the CAR behind her HONKS to remind 
           her the LIGHT has changed.

           INT. RADIO STATION, DAY, NEW YORK, CONT’D

                                 RADIO HOST 
                        Do you think you suffered from 
                        Stockholm Syndrome?

                                 CARRIE
                        I don’t know. I don’t know that I 
                        believe two people producing a 
                        bond during a traumatic experience 
                        is a syndrome. So maybe I’m still 
                        suffering from it. Maybe we should 
                        all be suffering from it.

                                 RADIO HOST
                        Right, what if Camille hadn’t been 
                        so tough on him? What if any of 
                        them, really, had behaved... 
                        better, or just differently?

           Carrie smiles to herself as she remembers Jay’s words.

                                 CARRIE [Softly]
                        Yeah. You could get lost in the 
                        House-of-What-If if you wanted.

           As the INTERVIEW continues, we return to the very end of 
           that Wednesday and some of our characters.

           INT. CYNTHIA’S HOUSE, MORNING

           CHARLIE (Murray’s partner) pours two cups of coffee in 
           Cynthia’s kitchen. We follow him carrying it out to the 
           living room where Cynthia’s sister, KIM, sits on the 
           couch -- her face ravaged by grief. 

                                 RADIO HOST (O.S.)
                        How did you find all the other 
                        people involved?

           Next to her sits CYNTHIA-- comforting her sister and 
           needing comfort herself.

           We move over to the endtable to the left of them, where 
           we see a handsome PICTURE of DECKER AND CYNTHIA in 
           another decade, before life happened to them.
           INT. SPARE BEDROOM, EDDIE’S APARTMENT, VALLEY

           EDDIE sits at a dated COMPUTER, in a dark, cluttered 
           room, chatting online in his bathroom. 

                                 CARRIE (O.S.)
                        I asked how this happened. 

           INT. CAMILLE’S KITCHEN

           CAMILLE watches STELLA eat every bite of her cereal as 
           the TV stays tuned to the news. STELLA looks at her 
           mother, looking at her. 

           INT. STARBUCKS, STRIP MALL, CALABASAS, THURSDAY MORNING

           STEVEN stands in line at the same Starbucks Murray bought 
           his cup of coffee at the day before. It’s his turn to 
           order but he had no idea. He’s looking blankly at the 
           STARBUCKS EMPLOYEE asking him what he’d like.

           Steven needs a minute. He puts his hand up to cover his 
           eyes and there, at the counter, he steps aside, unable to 
           control the timing, or force, of his breakdown.

           Behind him is the MAKE-UP WOMAN. She and the Starbucks 
           EMPLOYEE respectfully look away from him. Just then, 
           WOMAN IN HER 60s (from Long’s Drugs) walks in-- oblivious 
           to it all.

                                 CARRIE (O.S.)
                        But I’m sure I didn’t find all the 
                        other people involved. 

           We move out of the STARBUCKS into the parking lot where a 
           NEWSPAPER DISPENSER carries the bleak headlines of 2007 
           on its front page.

           We move farther into the parking lot where the ARROWHEAD 
           DRIVER is parked on one end of a lot into which MOTHER 
           and HER TWO KIDS-- in their car-- are pulling.

           INT. DECKER’S HOSPITAL ROOM

           DECKER looks out of his hospital window.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 CARRIE (O.S.)
                        There were probably a thousand 
                        details that didn’t make it into 
                        the story even though, who knows, 
                        maybe they were the story. 

           INT. RADIO STATION, DAY, NEW YORK, A YEAR LATER, CONT’D

                                 RADIO HOST
                        [Beat] Do you think Jay made it?

           Carrie sips coffee as the question is asked. Still, her 
           eyes betray how the question undoes her.

           Her MIND momentarily FLASHES to the moment in the MOTEL 
           BATHROOM, when JAY cleaned her leg and, for the briefest 
           of seconds, looked up and caught her eye. 

                                 CARRIE
                        Yes.

           We pull back, show the HOST and CARRIE in the same frame.

                                 RADIO HOST
                        Has he gotten in touch with you?

                                 CARRIE
                        If he had, I’d never say.

           We linger on Carrie’s FACE as longing overtakes it. 

                                 RADIO HOST 
                        From what we’ve seen in pictures 
                        of him...Jay Fitch was quite a 
                        good-looking guy. Did you...notice 
                        that during your time with him?

                                 CARRIE 
                        Of course I did.

           The look in her eyes is unforgettable.

                                 THE END.
