                                                               FADE IN:

           EXT.  THE VALLEY - DAY

           The outline of snow-capped mountains shimmers against a lapis 
           blue sky.

           In the distance, on a ridge overlooking a valley, a MAN sits on 
           a boulder, looking at the opposite side of the gorge.

           He watches a WOMAN walk swiftly up a path on the side of    the 
           cliff.  A light veil covers her head and shoulders.  Her 
           silhouette looks nimble and girlish.

           Her profile shows for a second as she pulls back a lock of hair.  
           She's beautiful.  This is ZAPHIRA.

           The man - ABDUR - is barely seventeen, with light, bright eyes, 
           dark curly hair, and a handsome face.  He wraps his prayer beads 
           around his fingers as he gazes at Zaphira.

           Zaphira approaches a cluster of mud houses rising from the soil.  
           A village perched on top of the ridge.  Below the houses, a 
           pebbledash cliff.  She enters a narrow passage carved into the 
           side of the mountain.

           Abdur has made up his mind.  He stands up and begins to scramble 
           down.

           INT.  THE CAVE - DAY

           The cave is semi-dark.  It's large, more than a single chamber.  
           Walls are stacked with boxes, sacks of grains, provisions.  In 
           the distance, a number of rifles stand propped against a wall.

           ZAPHIRA pants from the climb.  A film of sweat covers her skin.  
           She removes her veil, dips it in a jug of water, and pats her 
           arms, neck and chest.  Her skin glistens.

           Behind her, silhouetted against the entrance, a figure slides 
           in.  Zaphira senses his presence and turns round.  Abdur moves 
           into a shaft of light.  Still, he watches her.

           Zaphira rapidly covers her shoulders, the veil adhering to her 
           skin.  For a moment the two of them look at each other.  Silent 
           but for their breathing.

           Abdur moves closer.  He too is covered in sweat.  Zaphira 
           hesitates, then slowly hands him the pitcher.  Their fingers 
           brush for a second.

           A SUDDEN NOISE startles them.  A trapdoor on the roof of the 
           next chamber is being opened.  MEN'S VOICES.  A ladder is 
           lowered.  They look alarmed.
                                 ABDUR
                        Go!

           Zaphira quickly wraps herself in the veil.  Abdur motions her 
           out.  She points at a pile of empty burlap sacks behind him.

                                 ZAPHIRA
                        I need those!

           Abdur grabs a bundle of sacks and hands them to Zaphira.

                                 ABDUR
                        Quick!

           She runs off towards the exit.  Voices get closer in the next 
           chamber as MEN descend the ladder.

           Abdur grabs a second ladder resting against the wall and climbs 
           up it.  He reaches another wooden trapdoor in the ceiling, opens 
           it, and exits the cave without being seen.

           INT.  COMPOUND - CONTINOUS

           He emerges from the trapdoor into the empty room of an abandoned 
           house.  A couple of chickens peck on the mud floor. He walks out 
           into the yard.

           EXT.  COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS

           He heads briskly out of the gate of the compound into an alley.  
           Turning a corner, he stumbles into his friend, MANSUR.  Same 
           age, fuller face, stronger build.  A flash of guilt crosses 
           Abdur's face.

                                 MANSUR
                        Where have you been?…  I've been 
                        looking all over for you!

           He doesn't wait an answer.  He grabs Abdur's arm.

                                 MANSUR (CONT'D)
                        Hurry!  They’re about to go!

           The two boys run along the narrow alley, skirting a loaded 
           donkey pushed by an old man.

           INT.  THE HUJIRA - DAY

           The room is smoky, packed with turbanned men sitting cross-
           legged on the carpeted floor.  They work quickly in silence.

           Hands open boxes, pull out bullets.  Fingers move nimbly along 
           the barrels, cleaning, adjusting.
           Boxes are passed around and stowed, satchels are tightly packed.  
           Final preparations for a military operation, perhaps a terrorist 
           attack.

           Abdur and Mansur stoop under the low archway and enter.  They 
           sit down awkwardly in a corner, looking around, eager for a 
           task.  Nobody pays them attention.

           MALIK AZAM, the village Chief, is a tall, handsome man.  He 
           stands and takes in the room with a glance.

                                 MALIK
                        Brothers, let's pray to Allah for his 
                        guidance during our mission. May we 
                        come back victorious in his glorious 
                        name.

           Everyone kneels, touches their forehead to the ground 
           repeatedly, invoking Allah.  The two boys join in.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        Should any of us lose his life in the 
                        jihad, he will have fulfilled his duty 
                        and enter Paradise.  From that day he 
                        will enjoy eternal bliss and hundreds 
                        of virgins will satisfy his every 
                        desire.

           The men are absorbed in prayer.  Faces tense, eyes shut, as they 
           consider losing their lives.

           Abdur digs Mansur in the ribs at Malik's words.  Mansur knocks a 
           gun standing against a wall.  It falls.  A big man in a large 
           turban, BASHIR - turns around and sees the boys. He makes an 
           angry gesture, motioning them to be still.

           Malik has heard the commotion and notices Bashir’s gesture.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        What is it, Bashir?

                                 BASHIR
                        Nothing.  My son Mansur and his cousin 
                        Abdur are here.....

           Abdur straightens up, serious-faced.

                                 ABDUR
                        Malik Azam, we want to come along and 
                        fight the infidels.

           Malik looks at the boys with a mischievous smile.
                                 MALIK
                        That's good: the two of you are ready 
                        to become mujahaddins!  Come closer, 
                        let me take a good look at you.

           The two boys timidly step forward under his gaze.  The men are 
           smiling as well.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        Razak and Bashir, you must be proud of 
                        your sons. Look at them...  They can't 
                        wait to become muhaj and serve 
                        Allah...

           RAZAQ, Abdur’s elderly father, and Bashir look at each other 
           uneasily.

           Malik strokes his beard, amused.  He prods Mansur's skinny legs 
           with the tip of a rifle.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        .... Although I must say these  
                        chicken legs look too thin for two 
                        day's march over the pass...

           The rest of the men chuckle.  Mansur straightens up and tries to 
           look as fierce as possible.

                                 MANSUR
                        Please, Malik Azam.  We're strong and 
                        know how to fight.  We're ready for 
                        jihad.

           Malik shakes his head.

                                 MALIK
                        You two stay and look after the 
                        village.  Fetch the women from the 
                        orchards.  They'd better stay out of 
                        the fields.  Go on now.  And don't 
                        come back in here again.

           The men resume their preparations.  Abdur and Mansur struggle to 
           contain their disappointment.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE - DAY

           Abdur and Mansur run along the alleys, skirting off donkeys, 
           people, children running  behind a ball...

           The place has a timeless quality.

           In the distance one can see young boys herding cows and sheep up 
           the slope where the pasture is greener.
           Small children come up the steep path, bent in two under the 
           weight of  the firewood they carry on their back.

           A couple of elderly men dusted in flour pour grain into a 
           funnel.  The flour sprinkles out from two prehistoric millstones 
           along a hand hewn wooded channel that guides the grain into 
           burlap sacks.

           Mansur, burning with humiliation, walks ahead, head low, fuming.  
           Abdur catches up, mimicking a pleading voice.

                                 ABDUR
                        Pleeeaaaaze Maaalik...  We're ready 
                        for jihaaad!!!

                                 MANSUR
                        It was your idea to go in there!

                                 ABDUR 
                             (laughing)
                        I didn’t think you’d whine like a 
                        girl!

           Mansur grabs a stone and feigns throwing it at his friend. Abdur 
           laughs and runs off.

           They career down the track, past the last mud houses, screeching 
           like children.

           Below them, along a green slope that descends into the river 
           course, close to a watermill, a group of WOMEN is visible in the 
           distance.  The women pick fruit from the walnut, apricot and 
           apple trees and gather them into large baskets.

           EXT.  THE ORCHARD - MOMENTS LATER

           The women climb the track leading up to the village.  They carry 
           heavy baskets on their backs, filled with apples and apricots.  
           They wear colourful peasant clothes with bright scarves on their 
           heads.

           Among them is Zaphira, Malik's daughter.

           EXT.  ON THE TRACK - DAY

           Mansur and Abdur spot her.  Mansur grins.

                                 MANSUR
                        There she is!

           He hurtles down the slope.  Abdur looks anxious and then 
           launches down after him.

                                                                CUT TO:
           Mansur, leading, careers onto the path in front of Zaphira.  
           She's come up from the orchard and is unloading her basket into 
           a sack strapped across a donkey.  Abdur stops behind Mansur, 
           uncomfortable.

           The girl keeps her eyes to the ground, struggling with the heavy 
           basket.  Mansur steps forward.  

                                 MANSUR (CONT'D)
                        Let me help.

           She shakes her head, keeping hold of the basket. She avoids 
           Abdur's eyes but there's a palpable tension between them.

                                 MANSUR (CONT'D)
                        Don't be stubborn.

           He struggles to get the basket from her, hands intentionally 
           touching hers.  Abdur instinctively steps forward.

                                 ABDUR
                        Let her go, she doesn't want your  
                        help.

           Zaphira turns towards Abdur on an impulse and their eyes meet 
           for a fleeting moment.  She blushes.  The basket falls and the 
           apples roll on the ground.

                                 ZAPHIRA
                             (to Mansur)
                        Look what you've done!  Go away.

           SHIRIN, Zaphira's mother, comes up the path with her heavy 
           basket.  More women follow.  Shirin's face is weathered but she 
           has her daughter's green eyes, the same fine features.

                                 SHIRIN
                        What's going on here?

           Mansur and Zaphira kneel, picking up apples.

                                 ABDUR
                        Nothing.  Mansur was trying to help.

           SHIRIN looks at the apples, the boys.  She doesn't like these 
           two being so close to her daughter.  She wipes the sweat from 
           her face and unloads her basket into the burlap sack.

           She and the other women get on their knees and start picking up 
           the apples.

                                 SHIRIN
                             (sternly to Zaphira)
                        Get off home.
           Zaphira covers her head with the scarf and moves off.  Shirin 
           shakes her head.

                                 SHIRIN (CONT'D)
                             (to Mansur)
                        She can carry a basket without your 
                        help.

                                 MANSUR
                        I was only...

                                 SHIRIN
                        I warn you, if I catch you around my 
                        daughter once more, I'll tell Malik 
                        Azam.  Then you and your Dad’s hopes 
                        will be pickled, won’t they?

           Abdur watches Shirin load her basket and hit the donkey with a 
           stick.  She starts up the path.  The rest of the women follow, 
           ignoring the boys.

           EXT.  ALONG THE MOUNTAIN - LATER

           The two boys run and leap along the ridge, hopping from rock to 
           rock like mountain goats.  Below them a stream the colour of 
           jade snakes along the mountain folds, shimmering in the light.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Abdur rests on a rock.  Mansur catches up with him.  He's 
           excited and giggly.

                                 MANSUR
                        Hey...  I got close to her, I could 
                        smell her skin!

           Abdur tries to smile, uneasy.

                                 MANSUR (CONT'D)
                             (mischievously)
                        I could make out her breasts under her 
                        dress.  Isn't she beautiful?

           Abdur shrugs.

                                 MANSUR (CONT'D)
                             (teasing)
                        Hey, Abdur.  I won't have to wait to 
                        go to heaven to have the most 
                        beautiful virgin take care of me!

                                 ABDUR
                        Has your father paid a visit to Malik 
                        already?
                                 MANSUR
                        Yes, he went the other day.  He put 
                        down his offer.

           Abdur snorts, shaking his head.

                                 MANSUR (CONT'D)
                        What is it?

                                 ABDUR
                        It’s not clever to rush when you 
                        ask for a girl’s hand.  It raises 
                        the price of the bride.

                                 MANSUR
                             (worried)
                        What do you mean?

                                 ABDUR
                        If you're too much in hurry, Malik 
                        will think there's something wrong 
                        with you.  He might think you lack 
                        something.

                                 MANSUR
                        I don't lack anything.

                                 ABDUR 
                             (teasing)
                        How do you know?  You haven't spent a 
                        night with a woman yet!  You still 
                        have to find out whether everything 
                        you need is in the right place!

           Abdur pokes his friend between his legs, laughing hard.  He 
           begins to scramble down the path towards the stream.  Mansur 
           bounds after him.

           INT.  MALIK AZAM’S HOUSE - DAY

           Zaphira crouches in the kitchen flattening naan bread with her 
           hands.  Her YOUNGER SISTER puts the bread inside the tandoori 
           oven, seeing that there's enough wood burning inside.  Shirin 
           appears from behind a curtain

                                 SHIRIN
                        Quick, bring the bread.  Your father’s 
                        ready to go.

           Zaphira fills a plate with rice and meat, takes out a few naan 
           breads from the oven, and goes into the next room.

           Malik and a couple of his OLDER SONS are packing their weapons 
           in  neat bundles.  Zaphira places the food on the oil cloth.  
           Malik smiles at her.  He has a soft spot for his beautiful 
           daughter.

                                 MALIK
                        Sit down with me a moment.

           The girl sits on a cushion next to Malik.  He brushes her head 
           with his hand.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        How beautiful you look: fresh as the 
                        first snow on the mountains. Lucky is 
                        the man who gets you as his bride.

           Zaphira frowns and turns away.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                             (laughing)
                        What now?

                                 ZAPHIRA
                        I don't want to be anybody's bride 
                        yet.  You know I don't want to leave 
                        home, father.

                                 MALIK
                        Soon you'll have to. But I'm not going 
                        to give you away for just a  few sacks 
                        of grains!  If Bashir wants you for 
                        Mansur, he'll have to pay more than he 
                        offered. Besides, your mother tells me 
                        that boy behaves impudently.

                                 ZAPHIRA
                             (shrugs)
                        He acts like he owns me already.  I 
                        don't like him near me.

                                 MALIK
                             (amused)
                        That's good, that's good, my pretty 
                        one.  A modest girl shouldn't let any 
                        man come close to her.

                                 ZAPHIRA
                        Besides, he smells like a goat.

           Malik roars with laughter, her brothers chuckle.  They all find 
           this very funny.  Shirin peeks from behind a curtain. Malik pats 
           his belly, laughing hard.

                                 MALIK 
                             (to Shirin)
                        See?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MALIK  (CONT'D)
                        Your daughter has taken after her 
                        father.  She's fearless.  Her tongue 
                        burns like hot coal!  Good for you, 
                        Zaphira...

           She takes her leave and scuttles away to the next room. Shirin 
           grabs her arm.

                                 SHIRIN
                             (whispering)
                        Don't think I don't know your game.

                                 ZAPHIRA
                        What game?

                                 SHIRIN
                        Don't try and be clever with me. It'll 
                        be your father's decision who you 
                        marry, not yours.

           EXT.  ALONG THE MOUNTAIN - LATER

           The two boys are still walking briskly along the ridge.  The 
           stream flows right beneath them, shadowed by silver poplars.

                                 ABDUR 
                        What about Malik Azam?  Am I his herd 
                        boy?  Looking after his sheep…

                                 MANSUR
                             (mocking)
                        We can’t manage the march!

                                 ABDUR
                        I'm ten times stronger than him!

           Suddenly a SPLASHING sound, like a body wading into water.

           They stop in their tracks and look below.  Towards the stream 
           flowing at their feet.

           EXT.  THE STREAM - CONTINUOUS

           A group of EUROPEAN MEN crouch on the sandy bank.

           The faces: hard and dirty, exhausted yet alert.  Unruly hair, 
           filthy faces, three days' stubble.  They're haunted, at the end 
           of their tether.

           They've swept off their shirts.  Now they splash down into the 
           cold water, wincing at their blistered feet.
           EXT.  ALONG THE MOUNTAINSIDE - CONTINUOUS

           The boys watch the men intently from behind a boulder.  Abdur 
           points at:

           EXT.  THE STREAM - CONTINUOUS

           A stack of rifles propped against a tree.  Shiny, long, glinting 
           in the sun.

           One of the men stands up:  CAPTAIN STEWART, late twenties, well 
           muscled, fair-haired.

           He looks up at the mountain ridge anxiously, shielding his eyes 
           from the sun.  Not a sound, save for the flap of an eagle 
           circling above his head.  A decorated lapis pendant hanging onto 
           his chest glints in the sun.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Two of the men, TROLLOPE and HIGGINS, watch Stewart and exchange 
           a glance.

                                 HIGGINS
                        He hasn’t got a clue.

                                 TROLLOPE
                        He'll march us over the Hindu Kush 
                        before he admits it.

           Another stocky man, BARNES, eyes Stewart dismissively.

                                 BARNES
                        Smug bastard.

           Stewart picks up his jacket and motions his men to move.

                                 STEWART
                        Let's pitch here.  We're not that far 
                        from the rest of the army.  I 
                        recognize this place.

           The men reluctantly get up, discontent on their faces.

           Only now, when Stewart and his men pick up their red uniforms 
           from the river bank along with their rifles do we realise that 
           they are Redcoats of the British Army.  This is the 1840's, 
           during the first Anglo-Afghan war.

           Stewart and his men are part of the troops leaving Afghanistan 
           after the uprising in Kabul.
           EXT.  ALONG THE MOUNTAINSIDE - CONTINUOUS

           The boys whisper to each other, buzzing with excitement.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY

           They race along a track, through outskirts, into the village 
           square.  It's deserted.

           An OLDER WOMAN sweeps the mud floor around her house.  Hens and 
           turkeys pick in the dirt, CHILDREN play their games.  Not a man 
           in sight.

           The boys dart up the path that leads out of the village, 
           climbing the mountainside.

           EXT.  ON THE PATH TO THE MOUNTAIN - MOMENTS LATER

           Just outside the village, the fighters march up in a single 
           line,  holding on to their rifles, swords at their waists.  
           Malik leads the way.

           Mansur and Abdur run up, panting, excited.

                                 ABDUR
                        Malik Azam!  Stop!  We've seen 
                        kaffirs!!

                                 MANSUR
                        Below the round rocks.  By the river!

                                 ABDUR
                        They've guns!

                                 MANSUR
                        New, big ones!

           Malik stops.  The rest of the men gather.

                                 MALIK
                        Kaffirs?  How many?

                                 ABDUR
                        Just a few.  Washing in the river.

                                 MANSUR
                        There may be more behind.

           Malik and the men exchange worried looks.

                                 MALIK
                             (to his men)
                        What are they doing here?
           The boys rush to offer explanations.

                                 ABDUR
                        I think they're lost.

                                 MANSUR
                        They look tired.  Like they've been 
                        marching a long time.

           Malik reflects, then turns to his men.

                                 MALIK
                        Omar, go and tell Sadar about this.  
                        He has enough men to attack without 
                        us.  We must head back.  Get the women 
                        and children down in the caves.  They 
                        mustn't find us.

           He looks at the boys who are waiting for his reaction.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        Good work.

           The boys grin.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE - LATER

           Everybody moving around quickly, in a frenzy.

           Just above the houses, young boys herd cows and sheep out of the 
           stone pen.  In a cloud of dust, they push the cattle down the 
           slope, forcefully beating their backs.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Men hurry down a path that runs below the village along the 
           mountainside, pushing their horses with them.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The cattle come tumbling down among the cries of the herders 
           into the square of the village.  Then down the same path that 
           the men and the horses have taken.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Women carry the baskets filled with fruit and sacks of flour 
           inside the houses.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Men, women and animals crowd the narrow entrances of the various 
           passages carved into the pebbledash cliff that connects the 
           village to a warren of caves.
           They move quickly, push the animals inside, and soon they all 
           disappear.  The village is left empty.  A ghost town

           INT.  COMPOUND - LATER

           The empty room where Abdur had re-emerged earlier.  The trapdoor 
           open in the middle of the floor.

           Abdur and Mansur help pass the last burlap bags of flour and 
           rice to the men below.  Then they slide inside the trapdoor and 
           close the lid.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

           The village is completely deserted and totally silent save for 
           the gloom cries of crows.  It has an eerie atmosphere, as if 
           nobody has ever lived here.

           INT.  THE CAVE - CONTINUOUS

           Abdur and Mansur climb down the wooden ladder that connects the 
           house to one of the caves.  It's very dark.  They can barely 
           make out what's around them.

           The boys head deeper into the cave.  It's crowded with animals: 
           cows, sheep, horses.

           A dim light reveals silhouettes around them.

           The women huddle together, attending a small fire, preparing 
           food.  Among them, Zaphira and Shirin.

           Zaphira doesn't turn her head but meets the look of her friend, 
           MUSARRAT, as the boys pass them.  The girls exchange a glance.

           The boys move further on into the cave.  They come upon Malik, 
           seated in a circle with his men.  A fire projects eerie shadows 
           on the walls.  Men sharpen their swords as they listen to the 
           Khan's words.

           Mansur and Abdur, the youngest here, sit down next to their 
           fathers, close to Malik.  Their newly-earned position.

                                 MALIK 
                        ...  They must have got separated from 
                        the main army up the pass.  Or maybe 
                        they're going a different route and 
                        there are more behind.  It doesn't 
                        matter.  We'll wait for nightfall and 
                        then take them by surprise.

           A murmur of approval runs through the audience.  Razak, a 
           village elder and Abdur’s ageing but proud father, raises his 
           hand to speak.
                                 RAZAQ
                        I'm not afraid of fighting the 
                        infidels, Malik Azam.  But I do have a 
                        question.

                                 MALIK
                        Speak, Razaq.  You give wise advice.

                                 RAZAQ
                        We’ve heard our King gave them his 
                        word they can leave in peace.  What 
                        good is another battle then, when 
                        we'll lose many lives?  Can't we let 
                        them go?

           Malik nods slowly, pondering a moment.

                                 MALIK
                        The King can agree to what he 
                        likes.  You know they stopped 
                        paying us the tribute to pass 
                        through our land.  If we let them 
                        go, they'll think we're cowards.  
                        Too weak or too simple.  They'll 
                        return and use our land and our 
                        women as if they belong to them.

           Men shake their heads, grunting in agreement.  Mansur's father, 
           Bashir, shouts angrily.

                                 BASHIR
                        Razaq, you heard what they got up to 
                        with our women in Kabul.  Do you want 
                        them bringing their filthy ways to our 
                        village?

                                 MALIK
                        Well said, Bashir!
                             (mockingly to Razaq)
                        What got into you, Razaq?  How come 
                        you're feeling so merciful these days?

           Everyone laughs.  Razaq shakes his head and tries to accept the 
           joke as gracefully as he can.

           A child places a teapot and glasses on the oilcloth. He goes 
           round with a kettle, gently pouring warm water on the men's 
           hands.  Another one lays bowls of rice, bread and yoghurt on the 
           floor.  The men help themselves with their hands.

                                 ABDUR
                        Malik Azam, Mansur and I can go out 
                        and keep watch on them.  We can find 
                        out if more have turned up.
           Malik looks round, surprised.  He had forgotten about Abdur and 
           Mansur.

                                 MALIK
                        Good.  Be careful, though.  They 
                        mustn't know we're here.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Zaphira hands another plate of rice to the boy serving the men.  
           As she does so, she glimpses into the men's cave, sees Abdur in 
           the middle of the circle, the men nodding and smiling at him.  A 
           smile curls her lips.

           She catches Shirin's severe gaze and quickly resumes her work.

           EXT.  THE VALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           From the other side of the valley:  Abdur and Mansur scramble 
           along the path again.  The sun is beginning to set.  The 
           mountain is bathed in an orange glow.

                                                                CUT TO:

           They reach a viewing spot above the English camp.  They crouch 
           behind a boulder and look down.

           EXT.  THE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Stewart's camp consists of only five or six tents.  A handful of 
           men, a few horses.  Uniforms are dirty, tents are ripped.  A few 
           AFGHAN HANDS help to pitch the last of the tents.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The disgruntled troops huddle around a fire, breath condensing 
           in the cold.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Stewart rummages through large wooden boxes holding the troop's 
           supplies by the mess tent.  He throws out their contents in a 
           fit of rage.

                                 STEWART
                        There must be rice!

           He kicks an empty box on the ground and repeats in Pashtu to 
           HASSANI, the Afghan cook.

                                 HASSANI
                        Everything gone, sir.  You give orders 
                        to pack enough for five days.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 HASSANI (CONT'D)
                        You say we must travel light so we 
                        catch up with the army.

           Hassani picks up the mess that Stewart has created.

                                 STEWART
                        You're bloody thieves, that's what you 
                        are.  That's why there's nothing left!

                                                                CUT TO:

           The soldiers exchange a knowing look.  They seem to be used to 
           Stewart's fits of temper.  Barnes and Higgins watch him darkly.

                                 BARNES
                        I tried to get him to leave with the 
                        others.  Oh, no.  Him and his ruddy 
                        bridges.

                                 HIGGINS
                        Right.  On and on about them.

                                 BARNES
                        The niggers will burn them now we've 
                        gone.

           Trollope looks at Stewart who paces up and down shouting in 
           Pashtu to Hassani and his men.

                                 TROLLOPE
                        And we have to take orders from him.

                                 HIGGINS
                             (sniggers)
                        Watch him.  He shouts and screams at 
                        the dishonest scum like the rest of 
                        us.  But give him the chance and he’ll 
                        spend the evenings talking to them 
                        rather than us officers.

                                 TROLLOPE
                        He’s gone native alright.  When he 
                        caught Barnes and me with those girls 
                        in our quarters, you should have heard 
                        him.  "No respect for the locals", he 
                        says, "a disgrace to the uniform!”

           Everyone laughs.

                                 BARNES
                        If two years without a woman is his 
                        idea of respect, give me disgrace.
           Everyone roars with laughter. Barnes shakes his head with 
           contempt.

                                 HIGGINS
                        Bloody savages.  First they cut 
                        General Macnaughten to pieces, then 
                        behead poor Burns.  And I heard there 
                        were plans for the rest of us if we 
                        hasn’t get out.  And all he can go on 
                        about is the “honour” of the niggers.

           The men murmur in disapproval. Barnes gives Stewart an hostile 
           look, full of contempt.

                                 BARNES
                        A man should look after his own.

           A young Afghan KITCHEN-AID brings over a pot of soup.  He pours 
           a scanty portion into each of the men's cups.

                                 BARNES (CONT'D)
                        Where's the meat?  Is this all we get?

           The Afghan boy shrugs, not understanding English.  Higgins 
           sniggers.

                                 HIGGINS
                        You could shoot your horse, Barnes.  
                        Walk over the mountains.

                                 BARNES
                        Very funny.

           EXT.  ON THE RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           The sun dips.  Abdur and Mansur look down at the camp.  They 
           keep their eyes fixed on the men and their rifles, propped in a 
           standing pyramid by the fire.

                                 ABDUR
                        Look.

           He points at Stewart loading his gun by the mess tent, talking 
           to the Afghan aids.

                                 ABDUR (CONT'D)
                        That man.  He's speaking Pashtu.

           Mansur tries to listen.  The faint sound of Stewart's voice gets 
           lost in the wind.

                                 ABDUR (CONT'D)
                        Can you hear what he's saying?
           Mansur shakes his head.

                                 ABDUR (CONT'D)
                        Let's get closer.

                                 MANSUR
                        Careful.

           The two boys move silently behind the rocks and scuttle further 
           down.

                                                                CUT TO:

           They peer out from behind a thorny bush, close to one another, 
           tense with excitement, breathing hard.

           EXT.  THE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           From the boys' POV:  Stewart, back to the boys, scans the 
           opposite ridge-line, hand shading his eyes from the setting sun.  
           An older Afghan, SAYEED, by his side.

                                 STEWART
                             (in Pashtu)
                        Is it safe here, Sayeed?

           Sayeed shrugs.

                                 SAYEED
                        Why not sir?

                                 STEWART
                             (aggravated)
                        Don't answer me with another question!  
                        Yes or no, for God's sake!

                                 SAYEED
                        I think so, sir.

           Stewart keeps scanning the landscape, unconvinced.

                                 STEWART
                        If this is where I think we are, then 
                        there should be a village somewhere 
                        past that ridge.  Which clan controls 
                        the pass?

           Sayeed shakes his head with an impenetrable expression.

                                 SAYEED
                        I'm not from here.  I don't know about 
                        this tribal area.
                                 STEWART
                             (exasperated)
                        You're such a filthy liar! Five years 
                        of service with me and I still can’t 
                        get a straight answer from you!  Get 
                        my gun before I lose my patience!

           Stewart turns to the men, forcing an upbeat tone, shouting in 
           English.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        There should be wild goats on the 
                        ridges.  Maybe even deer, if we’re 
                        lucky.  Who’ll join me?

           Barnes elbows Trollope.

                                 BARNES
                        You go.  You know he's a lousy shot on 
                        top of everything else.

           Trollope reluctantly gets up and grabs his rifle.

           Stewart continues to scan the ridge-line.  He turns around with 
           a swift movement.  Looks up in the opposite direction, towards 
           the boys.

           EXT.  ON THE RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           The boys duck down.  Rocks fall.

                                 MANSUR
                        Damn it!

           EXT.  THE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Stewart, startled, peers up.

           Hassani, rinsing a pot in the river, lifts his head.  He catches 
           a fleeting movement through the leafy bushes.  A speckle of 
           white.  The boys' clothes.

                                 HASSANI
                        Hey!

           EXT.  ON THE PATH - MOMENTS LATER

           Abdur and Mansur run for their lives on the path.

                                 MANSUR
                        Quick!  This way!

           Abdur stops his friend with a hand.
                                 ABDUR
                        Not back to the village!

           But Mansur pulls away again and runs on.  Abdur races after 
           him.  He’s nearly abreast with him when something CRASHES 
           through the bushes next to them.  Two horses coming from 
           opposite sides.

           Trembling legs, necks hovering, veins running across the 
           animals' flanks.  Flaring nostrils, the wild pupils of the 
           horses.  Then the barrel of a gun pointing at them.  Two men 
           shouting.

           It's Stewart and Trollope who have trapped the boys between 
           them.

                                 STEWART
                             (addressing them in
                             Pashtu)
                        Don't move!  Where are you from?

           Mansur and Abdur have no way out.  They don't respond.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        Speak.  Where's your village?  I have 
                        no time to waste.  Speak up or I'll 
                        lose my patience!

           EXT.  NEAR THE VILLAGE - DUSK

           Abdur and Mansur walk slowly towards the village, heads down.  
           The camera pulls back to reveal they're strapped with long 
           leashes around their necks.  They follow the English officers' 
           horses.

           As they pass in front of the cliff that hides the caves, they 
           exchange a glance.  Abdur grimaces.  Burning in humiliation.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

           The village looks deserted.  A ghost town.  The wind blows 
           through the deserted square, wooden doors slamming.

           Trollope ties the two boys next to the well to keep an eye on 
           them.

           INT.  INSIDE THE HOUSES - CONTINUOUS

           Stewart barges in and out of different compounds.

           He strides across the courtyards, turns baskets upside down, 
           looks under the charpoys ( string cots) and inside the wooden 
           chests.  Nothing.
           Exasperated, he walks back into the square.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

           He reaches Trollope and the boys.

                                 STEWART
                        Nothing.  Not a goat.  Not even a bowl 
                        of rice, damn it.

           He turns to the boys, in Pashtu.  He's furious.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        Where is everybody?  Speak up, you 
                        dumb fools!

           Abdur and Mansur refuse to answer.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        I want meat.  Tell me where I can get 
                        meat.
                             (to Trollope)
                        They must have some food, even if they 
                        have been left behind.

           He pushes the boys around, raising his voice.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        I said speak.

           He raises his gun.

                                 MANSUR
                        Everyone leaves, sir.  They hear the 
                        English are coming through the pass.  
                        Our people have a great fear of your 
                        army, sir.

                                 STEWART
                        What are you two doing here then?

           Mansur hesitates.  He looks at Abdur who comes to his aid, with 
           sudden inspiration.

                                 ABDUR
                        They leave us behind to look after the 
                        village, sir.  We have nothing, just 
                        some apples from the trees.  We are as 
                        hungry as you, sir.

           He hits his stomach with a hand, mimicking a beggar feigning 
           hunger.  It's a good act and for a split-second Stewart buys it.
                                 TROLLOPE
                        Captain, look!

           Trollope points to a faint wisp of smoke coming from a chimney.  
           Stewart touches the side of a round clay oven.

                                 STEWART
                        Warm.

           He looks at the muddy ground around the well.  Fresh cattle 
           tracks.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        What's this?  You're lying scum!

           He grabs Mansur and points the gun at his head.  He turns to 
           Abdur.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        I'm going to shoot your friend. Blow 
                        his head off, understand?  Tell me 
                        where everyone is?  Where are the 
                        animals, the food?  I'll shoot him 
                        now.

           Abdur is in a panic.  He exchanges a glance with Mansur.  But, 
           for all his terror, Mansur motions Abdur not to speak.

           Abdur is about to say something, though - when a LONG, DEEP 
           SOUND from behind a house startles the English.

           It's the LOWING of a cow.  The animal, left behind in the rush 
           into the cave, trots innocently from behind a wall and across 
           the path.

           Now Stewart's found meat for an army, he doesn't care about the 
           boys.  He and Trollope look at each other and explode in 
           laughter.

           EXT.  THE CAMP.  MESS TENT - NIGHT

           The sky is a starry dome.  The camp-fire is the only light in 
           the whole valley.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Abdur and Mansur, tied back to back, sit outside the mess tent 
           next to the horses.  They watch the English soldiers who have 
           gathered around the camp-fire where the meat is roasting.

           The flames illuminate the soldiers' faces: their contented 
           expressions as they bite into the meat, juices dribbling down 
           their hands.
           The boys avidly check every detail of the soldiers' appearances: 
           their bright redcoats, heavy boots, golden buttons, the fairness 
           of their hair and complexions.

           The soldiers, restored and buoyant now.  A fiercer, more 
           confident group than the one the boys watched at the stream.

           EXT.  HILLSIDE - CONTINUOUS

           Stewart scans the landscape from the top of a boulder.  Trollope 
           reaches him, short of breath.

                                 STEWART
                        Trollope, I want two sentries posted 
                        up there.

                                 TROLLOPE
                        Everything all right, sir?

                                 STEWART
                        Yes, of course. Just using the 
                        necessary precautions.

                                 TROLLOPE
                             (nodding)
                        Food's ready if you'd like some, sir.

           Stewart waves dismissively.  He lights a clay pipe and offers a 
           puff to Trollope.  Then gestures towards the valley.

                                 STEWART
                        Look.  Makes one feel humble, doesn't 
                        it?  Will you miss it?

                                 TROLLOPE
                        To be honest, sir, I can’t wait to get 
                        home.

                                 STEWART
                        Got a wife?

                                 TROLLOPE
                        And four little ones.

                                 STEWART
                        Well done, Trollope!  You didn't waste 
                        time.

                                 TROLLOPE
                        No children yourself, sir?

           Stewart shrugs, evading the question.  A beat.  The two men 
           smoke, watching the sky.
                                 STEWART
                        No place for a family if you want 
                        adventure.  In my book anyhow.  The 
                        South Downs are too tame for my 
                        taste.  And those bleak grey skies. 

           Trollope looks at him, puzzled.

                                 TROLLOPE
                        They are bleak, yes.  Still, a pint by 
                        the fire with the wind howling outside 
                        sounds good to me, sir.

           Another beat. Stewart keeps smoking, lost in his thoughts, 
           taking in the vastness of the vista below him.  Trollope stands 
           next to him, shifting uneasily on his feet.

                                 STEWART
                        Did you ever really talk to any 
                        Afghans?  Did you get down to the 
                        bazaar?

                                 TROLLOPE
                        Out of bounds to us, sir.  You know 
                        that.

                                 STEWART
                        That’s why you missed it.  The 
                        magic of this place.  See this?

           He takes off the lapis pendant from around his neck.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        A thousand years old, they said.  
                        From when Alexander was here.

                                 TROLLOPE
                        Here, was he?

                                 STEWART
                        Yes, Trollope.  Alexander the 
                        Great.  Don’t think it’s true, of 
                        course.  You can’t believe a bloody 
                        word they say.  But just maybe it 
                        is.  They said they dug it up from 
                        some ancient battlefield in the 
                        mountains.  Beautiful, eh?

                                 TROLLOPE
                        Very fine, sir.

           A silence.  Trollope notices how anxiously Stewart keeps 
           scanning the landscape.
                                 STEWART
                        Just a precaution.  I may admire 
                        them but I don’t trust them.  
                        There’s an old Afghan saying.  “You 
                        can never buy an Afghan, you can 
                        only rent one”.

                                 TROLLOPE
                        I'll see to it, sir.

           Trollope nods and turns back to camp.  Stewart takes a moment to 
           look at the sky.  Something still doesn't feel right.

           EXT.  THE CAMP.  MESS TENT - CONTINUOUS

           The boys look nervously at the guns propped by the men's camp-
           fire.

                                 MANSUR
                        Will they kill us?

                                 ABDUR
                             (hiding fear)
                        Maybe.

                                 MANSUR
                        Whatever happens, we mustn't say where 
                        the men -

                                 ABDUR
                             (seeing Stewart)
                        Shhh!  He understands.

           Stewart approaches.  He has brought some meat on a plate.  He 
           sits next to the boys and bows his head, touching his chest.

                                 STEWART
                             (in Pashtu)
                        Salaam alekum.  May the blessings of 
                        Allah be upon you.  Here, have some of 
                        this food.  You must be hungry by now.  
                        Please be my guests.  You don't need 
                        to be afraid.

           He slides the plate over the boys, then cuts the rope tying 
           their hands.  They're both surprised by such manners but still 
           look scared.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        I just didn't want you to run away 
                        before we'd had a talk.  Please 
                        forgive me for being rough earlier.
           He smiles as he watches the boys grab the meat and eat 
           ravenously.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        Tell me.  What's your village called?

           The boys look at one another.  They don't know whether to answer 
           or not.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        Which clan do you belong to?  Who's 
                        your chief?  
                             (laughs)
                        Come on, my belly's full, I'm not 
                        going to eat you.

           Mansur still looks suspicious of the Englishman but Abdur seems 
           eager to engage in conversation with the stranger.

                                 ABDUR
                        Our Chief is Malik Azam and we belong 
                        to the Gilzai clan

                                 STEWART
                        Malik Azam!  I heard of him in Kabul.  
                        He has a reputation as a great fighter 
                        - and an honest man.

           Mansur tries to nudge Abdur to stop talking.  But Abdur can't 
           help smiling.

                                 ABDUR
                        Yes.  He's a great leader.  All this 
                        land, from here to Jugdaluk, belongs 
                        to the Gilzai people.

           Stewart nods and offers water from his flask.  He clearly knows 
           how to charm the locals.

                                 STEWART
                        Listen, I'll let you go back to your 
                        village and send my respects to your 
                        Chief.  But first I need your help.

           He pauses to light his pipe, taking his time.  The boys watch 
           him with a mix of fear and fascination.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        You know we English have been made to 
                        leave your country after the uprising 
                        in Kabul.

           Abdur nods but now silent.
                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        My men and I were left behind.  We 
                        need to join the rest of the army.  I 
                        think they must be near Gandamak.  Do 
                        you know Gandamak and the road to 
                        Jalalabad?

           Abdur nods again.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        Good.  Where is it?

           Mansur doesn't flinch. Abdur hesitates, then points at the 
           mountain.

                                 ABDUR
                        Over there.  Across the pass.

                                 STEWART
                        How far?

                                 ABDUR
                        Two days.

           Stewart looks worried.  He doesn't think his men can face that.

                                 ABDUR (CONT'D)
                        One day, if you take the shortcut.

                                 STEWART
                             (lighting up)
                        The shortcut?  Do you know it?

           The two boys look at one another.  Abdur hesitantly nods.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        Excellent.  In the morning you can 
                        show us the way.  I'll pay you and 
                        then you can get home.

           Mansur glares at Stewart with open hostility. Stewart continues, 
           now addressing Abdur who looks more sympathetic.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        So you know your king promised us safe 
                        passage to the border to make sure we 
                        leave peacefully?

           The boys are absolutely deadpan.  Neither answers.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                             (pressing)
                        I want to make sure we're going to be 
                        safe going through the gorge.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        We're leaving as friends.  Malik Azam 
                        does know that, doesn't he?

           Stewart stares at Abdur waiting for reassurance. The boy  
           doesn't know what to say.  Suddenly Mansur takes over.

                                 MANSUR
                        Malik Azam heard what the King 
                        said.

           Stewart looks at him.  Mansur nods.  Stewart doesn’t know 
           whether to trust his words but has no choice.  

                                 STEWART
                        Good.

           He holds out his hand to Mansur.  Mansur takes it and shakes 
           it firmly.  Abdur stares uncomfortably at the ground.

           EXT.  UP THE MOUNTAIN - CONTINUOUS

           The sentries on the ridge, looking out.  Below them the camp-
           fire glows in the darkness.  Not a sound, save for the crickets 
           and the distant voices of the soldiers.

           EXT.  THE CAMP - LATER

           The camp-fire has turned to cinders.  Men doze off.

           Stewart approaches his troops, wrapped in his pattu  - the shawl 
           every Afghan wears.  He looks like a native.  He has regained 
           his confidence and resumed his brisk tone.

                                 STEWART 
                        Get some sleep.  We break camp at 
                        four.  It's going to be a long march 
                        across the pass but those boys say we 
                        can be in Gandamak before nightfall.

           Men grunt "yes, sir", shuffling as they position themselves for 
           the night.  Barnes looks sceptically at Stewart.

                                 BARNES
                        Does that mean we're in the hands of 
                        those two now?

                                 STEWART
                             (glaring)
                        Unfortunately Barnes you're still in 
                        my hands. I'm the one who's giving 
                        orders and your job is to follow them.

                                 BARNES
                        That was the impression I had, sir.
                                 STEWART
                        Once we join the main army, you can 
                        moan to your heart's content.

           EXT.  ROUND THE CAMP-FIRE - LATER

           Abdur and Mansur lie against each other, tied up again.  Their 
           faces by the dying embers of the fire.  Abdur spots a movement 
           of something up in the dark.  The animal sense of someone who 
           knows these mountains.

           He nudges Mansur.  They are alert but silent.  On the other side 
           of the fire, the English soldiers lie asleep.

           One of the sentries, further up, is visible in the half-light.  
           A shadow moves quickly behind him.  It's only a second.  Two 
           Afghans jump on him from behind and silently slit his throat.

           We sense movement from the other side as well.  Abdur looks at 
           Stewart who has been roused.  He stares at Abdur and there is a 
           moment of contact.  Too late.

           As Stewart is about to scream an order, a volley of SHOTS comes 
           out of the darkness.  The men are caught unprepared in a hail of 
           FIRE.

           Abdur and Mansur, tied-up in their corner, desperately try to 
           free their hands.

           The English run around, shouting, grasping at guns.  Stewart and 
           Barnes try to get them in some order.

                                                                CUT TO:

           In the chaos, Hassani and the group of Afghan aides run off, 
           deserting camp.  As they run past, the boys shout to get their 
           attention.

                                 MANSUR
                        Hey, brother, cut this rope!

           Hassani looks at the two boys.

                                 ABDUR
                        In the name of Allah!  Don't let us be 
                        killed by our own brothers!

           Hassani pulls out his knife and cuts the rope.  A desperate look 
           in his eyes.
           EXT.  BEHIND ROCKS ABOVE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           The boys begin to scramble away.  A HISSING bullet grazes Mansur 
           on the shoulder.  He loses his balance and falls while Abdur 
           keeps on after Hassani in the distance.

           Mansur tumbles down the ravine.  He's knocked out unconscious.  
           His shoulder now bleeding profusely, his body covered in 
           scratches.

           Abdur finds himself behind a rock, looking down on the camp.

           Suddenly he feels a presence next to him - one of his fellow 
           villagers with his sword.  The man grasps Abdur's shoulder, nods 
           darkly, reassuring.

           Abdur looks down and in the distance he recognizes Mansur's body 
           lying among the rocks. He scrambles down to reach him, amidst 
           hissing bullets.

           EXT.  THE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           The villagers tumble out of the night, waving their swords with 
           a harrowing WAR-CRY.

           The English FIRE wildly - but people seem to be coming from all 
           sides.  Trollope falls, Barnes is caught by a sword.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Stewart FIRES desperately, his lips mouthing a silent prayer.  
           It's a man-to-man battle.  The English fight on with bayonets 
           and swords.  Men fall to the ground.

           EXT.  UNDER THE ROCK - CONTINUOUS

           Abdur has crept round and reached Mansur who shows no sign of 
           life.

                                 ABDUR
                             (checks his heartbeat)
                        Mansur!  Can you hear me?

           No response.  Abdur looks around for help.  A couple of horses 
           are still tied up behind what is left of the British tents, just 
           below him.

                                 ABDUR (CONT'D)
                        I'll take you back to the village.  
                        Wait here.  I'll be back in a minute.  
                        Mansur, can you hear me...?
           Mansur doesn't move. Abdur sneaks down by the horses.  He cuts 
           both their tethers, holding onto one.

                                                                 CUT TO

           As Abdur moves off, Stewart crawls behind one of the tents 
           behind him, making for a gully by the river.

           Stewart turns back to see the warriors descend the mountain with 
           a CRY in the last charge led by Malik Azam.

           This is the final blow but, in truth, the English are already 
           finished.

                                                                CUT TO:

           In the dark and through the dust, the battle looks like a scene 
           from hell: cries, shots, bodies on the ground, horses pounding 
           on top of them.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Abdur, half-way up the mountain with his horse.  He finds a gun 
           in the saddle.

           He looks down and sees the villagers turning over bodies, 
           looting what they can.  They take guns, boots, red jackets.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Abdur has reached Mansur and struggles in the attempt to load 
           his friend's body onto the horse.

           Suddenly he glimpses something moving on the other side of the 
           camp.  It's Stewart.

           EXT.  ALONG THE RIVER-BED - MOMENTS LATER

           Stewart limps along the river-bed, panting.  In the dark he 
           makes out the shape of the runaway horse, drinking.

           He gets closer.  The moon shines on the horse's back.  It has 
           gone astray in the melee.  Stewart whistles gently, pats the 
           horse's muzzle.  It’s good to touch something warm and alive.

           He mounts the animal and spurs it away.

           EXT.  UP THE TRACK - CONTINUOUS

           Abdur watches him.  He looks back at Mansur:  his eyes are still 
           closed but he's moaning faintly.
           Abdur has a moment of indecision.  Then once he's made sure his 
           friend is alive, he resolves to follow Stewart.  He'll prove 
           himself to Malik and the village.

           He spurs his horse to climb the path.  The gun across his lap.

           He's moving across the top to cut off Stewart's only line of 
           retreat.

           EXT.  ABOVE THE GORGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Abdur climbs a steep stony track, kicking his horse, spurring 
           him on.

           He begins to descend on the other side and stops on top of a 
           flat rock overlooking a narrow pass.  He dismounts and looks 
           down.  Waiting for his target.

           Abdur's POV:  Stewart desperately gallops along the stream at 
           the bottom of the valley.

           As Stewart enters the narrow pass, he's forced to slow down.  
           The horse negotiating its way across the water, stumbling on the 
           stream's stony bottom.

           Abdur slowly points his rifle.  Aiming.  His hands shaking 
           slightly.  He knows he cannot miss.

           A SHOT tears the silence in two.  Stewart's horse collapses and 
           crashes to the ground.

           Abdur mounts up, spurs his horse, and comes tumbling down.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Stewart can barely move from underneath the fallen animal.  
           Abdur points his rifle.

                                 ABDUR 
                             (in Pashtu)
                        Don't move or I'll shoot.

           Stewart looks at his captor, resigned.

           EXT.  UP THE TRACK - DAWN

           The first birds' chatter in the trees.  The murmur of the stream 
           as dawn lights the sky.

           On the mountainside, across from what once was the English camp, 
           a lonely horseman climbs the steep track towards the village.  
           It is Abdur, Stewart's rifle strapped across his saddle along 
           with his own.
           Stewart follows on foot.  It's his turn to have a leash tied 
           around his neck.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY

           The village celebrates the victory.  There's a sense of great 
           animation.  Children play excitedly, women scurry around.  The 
           smoke of roasting meat fills the air along with the rhythm of 
           drums.

           INT.  THE HUJIRA.  KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           The women, under the gaze of Shirin, cook rice, separated by a 
           curtain from the men's room.  They attend a fire built on the 
           floor among blackened pots.

           Some dance to the rhythm of the music from next door.

           The women hand food to young boys who take it into the men's 
           room.  The women are not allowed to enter.

                                                       CUT TO:

           Malik sits in the center, talking animatedly with his men.  Some 
           are bandaged, others still wear bloody clothes.

           Mansur, his hair matted in dirt and blood, a bandage wrapped 
           around the shoulder, sits among them, close to Malik, his future 
           father-in-law.

                                                                CUT TO:

           In the women's kitchen, Zaphira looks out of the small window 
           that gives out onto the courtyard and sees:

           Abdur, crossing the courtyard with his prisoner in tow.  Zaphira 
           watches him in awe.  She motions the other women to come and 
           look.

           EXT.  THE HUJIRA COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Abdur dismounts the horse, holding his prisoner on a leash.

           Men gather around him. Women huddle and peek from the window.  
           They're curious to see a kaffir.  They've never seen one before.

           Abdur walks slowly through the crowd.  This is his big moment 
           and he knows it.

           He sees his father's proud smile, catches a glimpse of Zaphira 
           and Shirin at the window.  Everyone whispering, nodding towards 
           him.

           Mansur runs out of the hujira.  Excited to see his friend.
                                 MANSUR
                        Praise Allah you're safe!  I woke up 
                        and you were gone.  I thought you'd 
                        been hit!  I was about to go down 
                        again to search -

           But Abdur ignores Mansur's attempt to greet him and walks past, 
           wrapped up in himself.  He wants to savour every moment of his 
           grand entrance into the hujira.

           Mansur watches, pained, ignored.

           INT.  THE HUJIRA - CONTINUOUS

           Abdur brings the prisoner inside and presents the English rifle 
           to Malik.  It's a beautiful hunting rifle, the first of its kind 
           to be seen.

           Malik calls for silence and the music stops.  Again, women peep 
           from an opening of the curtain.

           Stewart has been forced to kneel in front of Malik, hands tied 
           behind his back.  His jacket is soaked in blood, his face ashen 
           with despair.

           Abdur pushes him in the back, forcing him to bend over and touch 
           his forehead to the floor.  The men sneer, amused by the display 
           of humiliation.

           Malik pokes Stewart's shoulder with the muzzle of his newly 
           acquired rifle.  Stewart lifts himself up and looks him straight 
           in the eyes.

                                 ABDUR
                        He's the Chief of the Kaffirs. He 
                        speaks some Pashtu.

                                 MALIK
                        The Chief speaks Pashtu, does he?
                             (to Stewart)
                        Well then, listen to me, kaffir.  Our 
                        brothers have sent news of a great 
                        victory.  Today we have killed every 
                        single Englishman crossing the valley 
                        from here to Gandamak.  You should 
                        thank Allah you're alive.

           Stewart holds his gaze.  He doesn't flinch.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        You are a lucky man indeed.  Our Holy 
                        book says a prisoner's life is spared 
                        if he converts to Islam.  Did you know 
                        that?
           Stewart shakes his head, slowly, defiantly.

                                 STEWART
                             (in Pashtu)
                        Kill me now, if you like.  You would 
                        do me a favour.

           Malik explodes in a hearty laughter.He turns to his audience 
           with a sarcastic smile.

                                 MALIK
                        Did you hear?  The infidel begs me 
                        to kill him!  He wants to show us 
                        he's not a coward like the rest of 
                        them!

           Stewart holds his gaze, impassive.  Nothing matters to him after 
           what he has witnessed.

           Abdur's worried.  He didn't expect this.  He feels Stewart 
           belongs to him.  He isn't ready to let go of him so quickly.

           But Malik laughs a deep laugh as he turns to his prisoner.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        Unfortunately my arm's aching from too 
                        much work.  It doesn't have the 
                        strength to cut off another dog's 
                        head!

           Relief on Abdur's face.  The crowd cheers.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        I hear you're a Chief.  Good. You’ll 
                        be worth a lot of money then!  You're 
                        our prisoner now and till your people 
                        pay us, you can work for us.  And 
                        learn our rules of honour.

           But Stewart is feeling far from grateful.

                                 STEWART
                        You talk of honour?  You don't even 
                        know the meaning of the word! You 
                        attacked us as we were leaving in 
                        peace.  Your king made a deal with us 
                        in Kabul.

           He spits on the ground.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        I spit on your honour!
           Beat.  Abdur looks at Malik, fearing he may behead the crazy 
           Englishman right now.  But Malik explodes into laughter.  He 
           finds the Englishman amusing.

                                 MALIK
                        But you had no deal with me!  This is 
                        my land, not the King's.  Understand?  
                        You should have kept on paying me 
                        tribute if you wanted to pass through 
                        here.

           Malik turns again to his audience

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        I wonder why they stopped?  Is it 
                        maybe because they believed they had 
                        defeated us?  Yes, this must be the 
                        reason.  One doesn't pay for what one 
                        already owns!

           His audience chuckle, enjoying the show.  Malik turns to Stewart 
           again.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        You were wrong, Kaffir, because this 
                        land belongs to the Galzai people and 
                        always will.  You should have chosen 
                        another route if you wanted to save 
                        money.  Not to mention your men's 
                        lives.  What kind of a soldier are you 
                        if you don't even know these rules?

                                 STEWART
                        I'm no soldier.  I never came here to 
                        fight.  I'm a builder.  Me and my men 
                        have been building bridges and roads.  
                        For your people.  To make their lives 
                        better.

                                 MALIK
                             (pondering)
                        I see...  Bridges and roads.

           Malik makes a face, shaking his head slowly.  The men snigger.  
           He turns to Stewart scornfully.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        We lived in this land long before your 
                        bridges and roads.  And we managed to 
                        cross rivers and climb mountains 
                        without your help.

           Malik turns to the rest of the men, eyes sparkling.
                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        Still we can make use of a builder 
                        from Inglestan.  These people know how 
                        to make things.
                             (to Abdur)
                        Take him away now.  In the morning 
                        we'll put him to work.  

           Abdur pushes Stewart away.  Malik watches the Englishman leave 
           the room.  Malik sits down and resumes eating.  He motions 
           Razaq, Abdur's father, to sit next to him.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        Razaq, come here.  We must talk. Your 
                        son has proved a very brave fighter.  
                        A future warrior.  There's something 
                        you and I should discuss.

           Malik whispers in Razaq's ear.  He motions first at Zaphira, 
           peeping from a window looking onto the courtyard.  Then at Abdur 
           as he returns.

           Razaq bows repeatedly to Malik's words.  He's clearly thrilled.  
           Abdur absorbs the Chief's benign expression, bows his head and 
           touches his chest.  He's caught a glimpse of Zaphira and 
           understands what's going on.

           So does Mansur.  He’s disappointed.  Especially when he sees 
           Malik and Razaq shake hands to seal their agreement.

           Abdur is now the hero and the center of attention.  Mansur seems 
           forgotten.  His marriage hopes in ruins.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Zaphira and Shirin watch from the window looking onto the 
           courtyard.  Zaphira exchanges a look with her mother who nods  
           in confirmation.  A faint smile curls Zaphira's lips.

           INT.  THE CELL - NIGHT

           A door creaks in the semi-darkness.  It's Abdur.  He looks 
           around the small room.  Stewart is curled up in a corner like a 
           bundle of rags.

           Abdur puts down a plate of food   Stewart slowly gets up.  He's 
           freezing, his breath condensing in the cold.  Abdur hands him a 
           pattu.  Stewart nods and wraps himself in it.

           Abdur pushes the food closer to him with his hand.  He sits with 
           his legs crossed next to Stewart and watches him eat.
           Stewart seems unaware of his presence, his eyes haunted, fixed 
           on the wall.  He's a broken man.  All he can think of is the 
           bloodbath he caused.  The men in his charge, now dead.

           Abdur leans in.  He inspects the blonde fuzz that covers 
           Stewart's forearm, mystified.  Touches the golden buttons on 
           Stewart's redcoat, his belt buckle.  Looks at his boots, timidly 
           touches a strand of his hair.  Stewart doesn't react.

                                 ABDUR
                             (in Pashtu)
                        The Chief says you're my prisoner now.

           Stewart turns to the boy, as if for the first time.  Only now 
           does he realise how desperate his predicament is.  The burden of 
           guilt, his only companion.

                                 STEWART
                             (in Pashtu)
                        Are they really all dead?

           Abdur nods.  Stewart closes his eyes and lets his head fall 
           between his hands.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY

           Another day in the village.  Children play their noisy games in 
           the early morning light.  Wood smoke fills the air.  The same 
           old woman from earlier sweeps the dirt floor outside her 
           compound.

           EXT.  THE RIVER - DAY

           Shirin goes down the path to the bottom of the valley where the 
           jade green stream snakes beyond the poplars.

           Shielded from view by the trees, the rest of the women are 
           washing clothes here and bathing knee-high in the water, half-
           dressed.

           Burquas of different colours hang from a big tree, like giant 
           flowers.

           Shielded from the eyes of men, the women laugh and gossip in a 
           more relaxed way.

           TWO LITTLE GIRLS, about five or six, play with a faceless doll 
           on the river bank.  They dress her in finery and place her in a 
           makeshift palanquin.

           One of the young unmarried girls, Musarrat, comes out of the 
           water and stops to watch their game.
                                 MUSARRAT
                        What are you up to?

           The girls reply very seriously.

                                 CHILD 1
                        This is Abdur.

                                 CHILD 2
                        And this is Zaphira.  We've made her a 
                        beautiful dress.

           Musarrat motions at Zaphira to come and watch.  Zaphira looks 
           radiant and beautiful, her hair loose on her back, wearing only 
           a petticoat that leaves her shoulders bare.

                                 MUSARRAT
                             (laughing)
                        Look.  They've made you your wedding 
                        dress.

           Zaphira laughs, patting both girls on the head.

                                 ZAPHIRA
                        I haven't even had the engagement 
                        party yet.

           The children look at one another, perplexed.

                                 MUSARRAT
                        Why not play the settling of the dowry 
                        then?

                                 CHILD 1
                        How ?

           Musarrat pulls out some grass blades from the river bank.

                                 MUSARRAT
                        Well, here, make these into the golden 
                        bracelets from the groom.

           The little girls take them and wrap them around the doll's arms.  
           Musarrat turns to Zaphira.  A hint of jealousy in her voice.

                                 MUSARRAT (CONT'D)
                        You must be happy now.  You’ve ended 
                        up with the one you always wanted.

           Zaphira shrugs.  Musarrat's too nosy for her liking.
                                 ZAPHIRA
                        It was my father's decision... Abdur 
                        is a great mujahad.  I had nothing to 
                        do with it

                                 MUSARRAT
                        You don't know how lucky you are. My 
                        family just accepted the offer of that 
                        mullah from Istaleph.  He's three 
                        times my age and his front teeth are 
                        missing.

                                 ZAPHIRA
                        I would kill myself if I had to marry 
                        a man that old.  Abdur is -

           She stops as her mother approaches behind them.  Shirin has 
           overheard Abdur's name and Zaphira's independent tone.

                                 SHIRIN
                        Zaphira, Musarrat!  Stop gossiping.  
                        Come and help over here.

           The young women reluctantly obey.  Shirin pulls Zaphira to the 
           side, more affectionate than before.

                                 SHIRIN (CONT'D)
                        I don't want to hear you talk like 
                        that again!  Why can't you learn to be 
                        more modest and reserved?

           Zaphira nods in apology.  Shirin manages a smile.  Zaphira 
           smiles back.

           EXT. THE WATERMILL - MOMENTS LATER

           Abdur walks briskly on the path that winds down towards the 
           stream.  In the distance, at the bottom of the canyon , the 
           women wash their clothes by the river like tiny colored dots.

           He passes some young girls carrying heavy loads on their head.  
           They modestly turn their faces the other way and pull their 
           chadors just enough to hide their profiles.

           Down by the stream, under the shade of poplars, a tall man is 
           visible, wrapped in a pattu. He's working by the old watermill, 
           strengthening the walls of the water course.

           Abdur approaches as the regular clatter of the grinding stones 
           grows louder and louder.  The watermill is partly being rebuilt 
           with new stones and looks solid.  The man, Stewart, is 
           surrounded by children who help carry stones.
           Sitting on a rock, clearly relaxed, is a YOUNG MAN with a 
           gun.  A guard for the prisoner.

                                 STEWART
                             (in Pashtu)
                        Ahmed, over here!  I told you already!  
                        Am I talking to the wind?  Lay the 
                        stones the other way, I said!

           Stewart turns to greet Abdur.  Stewart's transformed.  Tanned as 
           an Afghan, his hair and beard have grown.  He wears a turban to 
           protect himself from the sun and a salwar kameez.

                                 ABDUR
                        Salam Alekum.

                                 STEWART
                        Alekum salam.

           Stewart sits down wearily under a tree.  He shakes his head, 
           indicating the children.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        No discipline...

           Abdur shrugs and crouches down next to him.  Abdur takes out 
           flat bread from his pattu, absorbing Stewart's tired face.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        It was a mess.  The stones weren't 
                        packed tight enough.

           Abdur offers bread.  Stewart softens, accepts it with a light 
           touch of his hand to his chest.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                             (to one of the children)
                        Bring us tea.  Quick!

           Stewart and Abdur eat the bread together.  Stewart feeds 
           hungrily, savouring the taste.

                                 STEWART (CONT'D)
                        Look.  Here's your friend, Mansur.

           Mansur emerges from behind the trees along with two YOUNG MEN.  
           They carry their rifles and several partridges strung together.  
           Mansur looks more mature.  A light beard shadows his chin.  He 
           instinctively stiffens as he sees Abdur.

                                 ABDUR
                        Salaam Alekum.
                                 MANSUR
                        Alekum Salaam.

           Their greeting feels formal and uneasy.  Abdur tries to smile 
           encouragingly.  He points at the birds.

                                 ABDUR
                        Looks like you had good hunting. I'd 
                        like to come along with you one of 
                        these days.

           Mansur shrugs.  He doesn't respond.

                                 ABDUR (CONT'D)
                        It would be like old times.

           Mansur exchanges a glance with the other two.  He turns to Abdur 
           with a sneer.

                                 MANSUR
                        I thought you were too busy hanging 
                        out with your new friend here.  And 
                        then there’s preparations for your 
                        wedding.  You can’t have time for us?

           Abdur doesn't reply.  Mansur's sarcasm hurts him. Stewart 
           watches the young men disappear. 

                                 STEWART
                        You won his girl, did you?

                                 ABDUR
                        He's been jealous since you turned up.  
                        I’ve just been lucky.

           Abdur leads off, Stewart following.  They begin to walk up the 
           hill, back to the village.  The guard is with them.  Stewart 
           nods at the beginnings of a stone wall on a slope above them.

                                 STEWART
                        We need to work on those terraces 
                        before the snows come.  But I’ve 
                        told Malik Azam I need stronger 
                        lads than those to build them 
                        properly.

                                 ABDUR
                        I’ll help you.  We can do it 
                        together.

           Stewart is gratified by Abdur's enthusiasm for building.  He 
           nods gratefully.  Abdur smiles.
                                 ABDUR (CONT'D)
                        After I'm married, of course.

           Stewart laughs.  They share the moment together.

           Halfway up the hill, something suddenly catches Stewart's 
           attention.  It's a faint THROB in the air.  Before he can 
           figure it out, the MUEZZIN CALL resonates across the valley, 
           covering up the sound.

           Abdur stands to go.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY

           Abdur watches the guard shut Stewart in a hut.  Abdur crosses 
           the square and joins the men performing ritual ablutions.  They 
           splash hands and feet before entering the mosque.  The call of 
           the muezzin covers the vibration from the distance.

           INT.  MOSQUE - DAY

           The men are gathered in the mosque, kneeling and touching their 
           foreheads to the ground.

           The humming sound becomes more distinct, draws closer.  It turns 
           into an unmistakable DRONE, a noise filling the sky and covering 
           the men's invocations.

           Everyone in the mosque scrambles up and rushes out.

           INT.  CELL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Stewart eagerly scans the sky from the tiny window of the room 
           where he's confined.  The DRONE ever louder.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

           The men race out of the mosque as:

           A first HELICOPTER rears over the ridge-line in an EXPLOSION OF 
           NOISE, its roaring blades circling ominously over the village.  
           ANOTHER HELICOPTER follows.

           INT.  CELL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Captain watches the helicopters.  Zoom-out to reveal the 
           torn army fatigues he's wearing.  Only at this point do we 
           realize that the former Captain Stewart (same actor) is now a 
           Russian prisoner.  

           The same lapis pendant that Stewart wore before hangs round his 
           neck.
           His name is CAPTAIN KORNIKOV.  This is 1980.  Afghanistan is 
           under Soviet occupation.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

           Everyone's running around.  There's a great confusion, shouting 
           orders, dust flying.

           Malik turns to Abdur.

                                 MALIK
                        Quick!  Gather everyone into the cave!  
                        Go get the women!

           Abdur sprints towards the river.  Mansur materializes next to 
           Malik.  He's eager to be given a task.

                                 MANSUR
                        What about the Russian?

                                 MALIK
                        Get him below.  Tie him up.

                                                       CUT TO:

           Men barely have time to rush down the pebbledash cliff that 
           leads to the hidden entrance to the cave.  Everyone crowds into 
           the caved passage.

           EXT.  THE RIVER - CONTINUOUS

           Down by the stream, the women are terrified to see the 
           helicopters.  They rush to the tree and grab their burquas to 
           cover themselves and take shelter.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           The first chopper rocks down in a clearing next to the village, 
           whipping up dust clouds.

           SPETNAZ TROOPS - Soviet special forces - jump out with rifles, 
           sprinting off as the second chopper comes in to land.

           They race around, shouting in Russian, ready to fire at anything 
           that moves.

           EXT.  THE VALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Abdur is with the women at the bottom of the valley.  They're 
           cut off from the village by the helicopters.  Abdur doesn't know 
           where to hide.
           Suddenly Zaphira appears next to him.  She hands him a burqua 
           just before Russian soldiers appear on the ridge above them.  
           They look into each other's eyes.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

           The Spetnaz troops sweep through the village.  We see how the 
           place has changed during these years of war.

           Houses are shattered, their mud walls strewn like grain from 
           broken sacks.  Timbers twisted and snapped.  Lush orchards, now 
           barren land.

           No sign of livestock in the pen, just a couple of skinny cows 
           grazing on rocky terrain which were previously green pastures.  
           The millstones and the watermill look abandoned.

           The Russians are as frightened and disturbed as the English 
           were.  They shout and kick open the doors of the empty houses.

           EXT.  THE VALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           The sound of a SHORT BREATH, amplified by the fabric.  The BEAT 
           of Abdur's pounding heart.

           POV:  from inside the tight grille of a burqua.  The image is 
           blurred.  We can only see details framed by the tight grid.

           The Spetnaz troops come tumbling down the steep track.  They're 
           wired.  They shout, herd the women together.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY

           From POV of the burqua's grille:  the rest of the troops are now 
           gathered in the square by the well.

           The Commander, KOZLOV, a striking broad-shouldered man, forties, 
           paces up and down, shouting orders.

           One of the younger soldiers, IVONIN, a kid of nineteen, drags  a 
           sleepy-eyed Razaq out of a mud house.  Razaq acts up the old 
           man, waving his hands in surrender.

                                 IVONIN
                        He's the only man in there.  Looks 
                        like the rest buggered off.

                                 KOZLOV
                        How the hell did they know we were 
                        coming?

           Kozlov grabs SIDDIQ, one of the Afghan officers who speaks 
           Pashtu.
                                 KOZLOV (CONT'D)
                             (to Razaq)
                        Tell him we're looking for Malik Azam 
                        and his men.  Tell him we know they 
                        have Captain Kornikov with them.

           Siddiq shouts to Razaq in Pashtu.  Razaq shakes his head.

                                 SIDDIQ
                        He says there's only him and the 
                        women.  The men are in the mountains. 

           Kozlov grabs Razaq by the tattered shirt.

                                 KOZLOV
                        Bullshit.
                             (shouting)
                        Captain Kornikov?  He's here.  We know 
                        he's been in this village!

           One of the soldiers drags a sack of rice out of a house.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Commander, there's enough rice to feed 
                        a regiment...

           Kozlov hits Razaq with the butt of his rifle.

                                 KOZLOV
                             (to SIDDIQ)
                        Tell him I'll shoot him if he doesn't 
                        talk.

           Razaq keeps shaking his head and denying anybody is there like a 
           litany.

                                 KOZLOV (CONT'D)
                        Oh yeah?  And what about that fucking 
                        rice...?  Who's that for, then, 
                        grandpa?

           Razaq shakes his head, begging.  Kozlov kicks him hard in the 
           belly.  Razaq falls to the ground.

                                 KOZLOV (CONT'D)
                        We're wasting our time.  The bastards 
                        will be up there by now.  Took 
                        Kornikov with them, I bet.
                             (to Ivonin)
                        Line up the women.

                                                                CUT TO:
           The panting from inside the burqua is faster now.  Kozlov paces 
           up and down next to the women huddled together against the wall.  
           A wild look in his eyes.

           He and his men pass a flask of vodka to one another. Their 
           frenzied energy is a mix of booze and adrenaline.

           The children who played with the doll now cry, grasping their 
           mother's burquas, frightened by the strangers.

                                 KOZLOV (CONT'D)
                        It's like talking to fucking ghosts.  
                        Let's see them.

           The soldiers begin to rip off the burquas. it's a terrible 
           violation and we should feel this.  They uncover Shirin, then 
           Musarrat who keeps her head low, tears streaming down her face.

           The women scuttle to cover themselves as the Russians snigger.  
           Kozlov pulls off another burqua.  It's Zaphira.

           She is so beautiful that the soldiers stop and stare. The girl 
           bows her head, trying desperately to avoid the men's eyes, to 
           conceal her face as much as she can.  

           Kozlov is struck dumb.  He looks as if he's about to seize her 
           to take her away.  But then he turns away.

           He stops in front of the grille of the burqua that Abdur's 
           wearing.  Kozlov's face a few inches away.

           Kozlov looks down at the ground.  He smiles.  A pair of male 
           shoes poke out from the robes.

           Kozlov turns away, then swings back and punches Abdur's stomach.  
           He rips the burqua off him in triumph.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Abdur is led into one of the village compounds by the Russians.  
           They open a gate and throw him into an empty courtyard.

           INT.  THE CAVE - CONTINUOUS

           The cave is now an armoury.

           On the floor, reels of detonating cord, blasting caps, time 
           pencils for delayed explosions.  On one side, stacks of boxes 
           filled with grenades and ammunition.  English and Chinese 
           lettering on the sides:  American weaponry.

           Men hold their breath, listening to every sound from above.  
           Kozlov's SHOUTING, soldiers ECHOING him.
           Malik exchanges a glance with his men.  They know Abdur must 
           have been caught by now.

           Among them sits Kornikov, gagged, resigned.  Mansur has just 
           tied Kornikov's hands behind his back.

           Malik signals to the men and they silently begin to unpack the 
           boxes.

           EXT.  INSIDE THE COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS

           Kozlov sits on a stool and lights a cigarette, as if about to 
           enjoy a show.  He calls Siddiq to his side.

                                 KOZLOV 
                             (indicating Abdur)
                        Tell this bastard we know ways to make 
                        people talk.
                             (laughs)
                        Tell him we Russians have a special 
                        talent for that.

           Everyone laughs.  Siddiq translates and pokes Abdur with his 
           rifle.  Abdur listens, then replies firmly.

                                 ABDUR
                        The men left days ago.

           Thwack!  Abdur reels as Kozlov butts him with his rifle in the 
           back, then slams him around.  Abdur, breath knocked out of him, 
           Kozlov breathing rage.

                                 KOZLOV
                        You know who we're looking for! 
                        Another scumbag like you told us 
                        you've had Kornikov in this village...  
                        It's funny, the minute we put 
                        electrodes to his balls, he remembered 
                        everything!

           He gives Abdur a couple of powerful blows but Abdur holds his 
           gaze.

                                 KOZLOV (CONT'D)
                        Where are Malik Azam and the other 
                        men?

           ABDUR doesn't flinch.

                                 KOZLOV (CONT'D)
                        As you like.
                             (to a soldier)
                                 (MORE)
                                 KOZLOV (CONT'D)
                        We need some help here.  Bring that 
                        girl.  The beauty.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Zaphira is dragged into the compound.  The officer strips her of 
           her burqua and looks at her, checking her body and face.

           The men begin to laugh, pacing round her.  Abdur feels things 
           could get out of hand any minute.  He addresses Siddiq under his 
           breath.

                                 ABDUR
                        Tell them to leave her.  She's my 
                        wife.  She doesn't know anything.

           Siddiq translates into Russian.  As an Afghan, he’s unhappy with 
           what's happening with the girl.  Kozlov laughs.

                                 KOZLOV
                        Your wife, is she?  Lucky boy.  Even 
                        better.  She can do some housework for 
                        us.  Let's see...

           He looks around, kicks a charpoy and a sack of rice that bursts 
           open.  A couple of chickens run off.

                                 KOZLOV (CONT'D)
                             (to Siddiq)
                        Tell her to get some rope and a bucket 
                        of water.

           EXT.  THE COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

           Zaphira enters the gate of the compound.  She has a bucket of 
           water balanced on her head.  She puts it down and sees Abdur 
           tied like a goat, hands and feet bound together.

           Kozlov shouts in Russian for the bucket.  He points with a 
           finger at his feet.

           Zaphira complies.  She meets Abdur's steady gaze.  She can 
           hardly hold her tears back.

           From behind, a soldier grabs her.

           Abdur is about to react, but in that instant Kozlov pushes 
           Abdur's head in the bucket and keeps it under.

           His men hit Abdur hard with their rifles.  They pass the vodka 
           around.  Drunken laughter.

           Abdur's body writhes desperately in their grip.
           INT.  THE CAVE - CONTINUOUS

           Down in the cave, the men hear the Russians SHOUTING and 
           LAUGHING.  They all kneel and recite verses of the Quran, bowing 
           their head to the ground.

           Behind them, an unpacked American Stinger missile.

           Malik gives the signal to move out, one by one.  He calls Mansur 
           over, indicating Kornikov.

                                 MALIK
                        It's too dangerous to take him.  Stay 
                        here and guard him.

                                 MANSUR
                        Why not just cut his throat?

                                 MALIK
                        He’s too valuable.  We can still trade 
                        him for our prisoners. 
                             (off Mansur’s look)
                        They’ll never find you down here.
                             (to the men)
                        Let's go.

           The men begin to leave silently.

           EXT.  OUTSIDE THE CAVE - MOMENTS LATER

           The men quietly scuttle out the cave, one by one, and take a 
           path up between the boulders.

           They climb up the mountain in a single line, unseen by the 
           Russians.

           EXT.  THE COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS

           Liutenant LOGINOV and Ivonin press Abdur's head underwater.  
           Abdur struggles to free himself.  He kicks as hard as he can.  
           He comes up, gasping, breathless.

                                 KOZLOV
                        Where's Kornikov?  Where've they got 
                        him?!

           Abdur doesn't answer.  They shove him underwater again.  Kozlov 
           nods at ANTONENKO, a wiry dark-haired man with a cruel stare.  
           Antonenko strides over to Zaphira.

           Abdur bursts up out of the water, catches a glimpse of Zaphira, 
           on her back.
                                 KOZLOV (CONT'D)
                        Just going to let us have your wife 
                        then?  My men could use a little bit 
                        of fun...

           Antonenko uses his knees to pin Zaphira's arms on the ground 
           above her head.  He presses his hands on her shoulders.  Zaphira 
           moves her head from right to left, crying, fighting hard.

           Abdur struggles, agonised.  His head is pushed underwater again.  
           This time they hold him for a long time.  He fights desperately.

           Suddenly his body goes limp.  The soldiers exchange a glance and 
           let him go.

           Loginov pulls him out of the water.  Abdur's body falls on the 
           floor.  He opens his eyes, heaving, still alive.

           Sees Antonenko, sitting astride Zaphira's legs.  He runs his 
           hand underneath her garment and clutches her breasts.  Even 
           Siddiq can't help but turn his head away from this sight. 

                                 SIDDIQ
                        Anton Antonovich, don’t go too far!  

           Antonenko sneers at Siddiq and attacks the waistband of 
           Zaphira’s trousers with new zeal.

                                 ABDUR
                        Stop!  Let her go!

                                 KOZLOV
                        So you’ll show us where he is?

           Abdur stares at Antonenko’s hands, transfixed.  He nods.

                                 KOZLOV (CONT'D)
                             (to Antonenko)
                        Enough, Sergeant!  Let her go!

           Antonenko stops, frustrated.  He leaves Zaphira on the floor, 
           her legs exposed underneath her long shirt, still pinned to 
           the floor by another soldier.  He strides over to Abdur, 
           buttoning up his flies, ill-tempered.

                                 ANTONENKO
                        I was enjoying that.

           The soldiers laugh.  Kozlov nods an order and Loginov drags 
           Abdur out of the compound at Kozlov’s side. 

           The soldier holding Zaphira to the ground keeps his grip on her 
           and looks at his comrades.  The men exchange a glance.  
           Antonenko takes a puff of a colleague's cigarette, stomps the 
           butt under his boot and moves towards Zaphira.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE SQUARE - MOMENTS LATER

           The women huddle together, terrorized.  The little girls, 
           crying.  Their mothers, trying to calm them.

           The women watch Abdur, escorted by the Russians, lead them 
           towards one of the houses.  Razak, sitting in shock outside his 
           house, looks up as Abdur passes.  Razaq’s eyes search his son’s 
           face.  Abdur is pushed on, crushed, head bowed.

           A soldier gestures with his rifle at the women, dismissing them.  
           The women race to their houses for shelter, Shirin looking back 
           in anxiety at the compound.

           The women slam doors shut, Shirin last of all.  The soldier 
           cocks his ear, turns round to the compound.  He hears the 
           muffled cries of Zaphira, then a man's prolonged guttural moan.  
           Muffled laughter from other soldiers.

           INT.  VILLAGE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Inside an empty house, Abdur shows the officers the trapdoor 
           hidden under sacks of grains.

           He's a broken man.  He has lost everything.

           INT.  THE CAVE - MOMENTS LATER

           The cave is empty except for Mansur.  He has moved away from the 
           gagged Kornikov to check the exit.  He is about to leave when...

           ... there's a huge EXPLOSION.  A smoke grenade, thrown from 
           above.  Mayhem.  Smoke, rubble, men yelling, wild rounds of 
           SHOTS raking the floor.

           The Russians barge in from the trapdoor.  They SHOUT, a mad look 
           in their eyes.

           Mansur falls to the ground, SCREAMING in pain.  He's been hit on 
           the shoulder.  The Russians immobilize him.

           Dust and smoke fill the air, everyone's COUGHING.

           Kornikov wriggles, gagged, and tries to attract their attention 
           from the corner.

                                 IVONIN
                        Don't shoot!  Kornikov's here!

           Everyone gathers.  As dust and smoke settle, the soldiers 
           release Kornikov.  He hugs his comrades, on the verge of tears.
           EXT.  THE VILLAGE SQUARE - MOMENTS LATER

           A soldier drags Mansur out of the cave.  He pushes him down next 
           to Abdur who has been tied up in a corner.

           They look at each other.  Abdur’s abject look tells Mansur 
           everything.  The soldier ties them up together, back to back.  
           Their hands touch.

           Abdur squeezes his friend's hand.  Mansur stiffens and pulls his 
           hand away.

           INT.  THE CAVE - CONTINUOUS

           Everyone's high from the attack, soldiers running around the 
           cave, carefully opening boxes, prodding them, looking out for 
           booby traps.

           Kozlov checks the ammo and make of the guns.

                                 KOZLOV
                             (shouting)
                        Load all the weapons!  You've got 
                        twenty minutes and then we get the 
                        choppers out.  We'll hunt the buggers 
                        from the air before it gets dark!

           Men hauls weapons up.

                                 KOZLOV (CONT'D)
                             (to Kornikov)
                        Was Malik Azam here as well?

                                 KORNIKOV
                        Yes.  They only left ten minutes ago.

                                 KOZLOV
                        This time we're going to get the 
                        bastards.  Come on, get moving!

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE SQUARE - DUSK

           The sun begins to descend towards the cliffs.

           Mansur and Abdur, tied back to back together, watch from the 
           edge of the cave as the first chopper is loaded, prior to take-
           off.

           Men load the weapons, running back and forth from the cave's 
           entrance.

           Abdur spots Kornikov.  He's drinking from a flask, propped 
           against a stone wall.  
           He's dishevelled, two day's stubble on his chin, his pattu 
           filthy with dirt and dust.  No trace of the Westerner in him 
           now.

           For one second his gaze meets Abdur's.  The two men stare at 
           each other, then Kornikov lowers his eyes.

                                 MANSUR
                             (to Abdur)
                        .... All our weapons gone because of 
                        you.  The big hero!  Look at your 
                        friend now.

           Abdur doesn't respond.  His eyes are on Kornikov.

                                                       CUT TO:

           Kozlov approaches Kornikov.  He hands him a pack of cigarettes.  
           Kornikov avidly lights one.

                                 KOZLOV
                        Tell me about Malik.  Did you get to 
                        know him?

                                 KORNIKOV
                        He interrogated me at the beginning 
                        but after that I didn't see much of 
                        him.  But he's bright - and brave.  
                        They say we trained him.  He certainly 
                        knows our tactics.

                                 KOZLOV
                        Did they ever take you to their camp 
                        up there?

                                 KORNIKOV
                        Only once.  They mainly kept me in the 
                        caves.  They hardly ever come down 
                        here.  Only for supplies.

           Kozlov nods, absorbed in his thoughts.  He looks at his men 
           loading the helicopter and checks the time.

                                 KOZLOV
                        We'll get them this time.

                                 KORNIKOV
                        Careful.  I think they took one of 
                        those new American missiles with them.

                                 KOZLOV
                             (shrugging, then to his men, 
                              shouting)
                        Out in ten, boys!  
                                 (MORE)
                                 KOZLOV (CONT'D)
                        I want everything loaded and then get 
                        the fuck out!  Hear me?

           Kornikov drinks more.  Hands the flask to Kozlov.  He's had 
           enough.

                                 KORNIKOV
                        Haven't touched it in months.

                                 KOZLOV
                        Right.  Look at you.

           Takes in Kornikov's poor state.

                                 KOZLOV (CONT'D)
                             (sarcastic)
                        You stink like a goat.  If you didn't 
                        speak Russian, I'd take you for one of 
                        them.  But I've seen worse.

                                 KORNIKOV
                        Actually they fed me okay. In a 
                        way.... they looked after me.  That 
                        boy over there, Abdur...
                             (motions at him)
                        ... He's the one who -

                                 KOZLOV
                             (interrupting him)
                        You’re the lucky one.  Remember  
                        Captain Movchan?

                                 KORNIKOV
                        Of course.  We were in Kandahar 
                        together.  Why?

                                 KOZLOV
                        Three months ago he and his men were 
                        ambushed not far from here.  We saw 
                        photos of them.  Heads and limbs cut 
                        off.  They’d gouged out their eyes 
                        with screwdrivers.

           Kornikov closes his eyes.

                                 KOZLOV (CONT'D)
                        We think it was probably Malik and his 
                        men.  They’re just beasts.

           Loginov runs over, short of breath.

                                 LOGINOV
                        First chopper ready, sir.
           Kozlov stands up and walks over to the helicopter.  He watches 
           his troops carrying boxes.  Looks up at the mountains.

                                 KOZLOV
                        Kornikov, you've got one minute to 
                        pick up anything you want to take.  
                        Imagine, you lucky bastard, this is 
                        the last you’ll see of this 
                        godforsaken country.  Next week, 
                        you’ll be downing vodka in Rostov, 
                        feeling like a real Russian again!

           Kornikov nods, spaced out, uncertain.

                                 KOZLOV (CONT'D)
                        Come off it.  A couple of tashas and a 
                        bottle...

                                 KORNIKOV
                        No, it's just that...  Nothing feels 
                        real yet.  Not you, not the 
                        choppers....  Not Moscow.

           He heads off briskly towards one of the compounds.  Kozlov looks 
           after him in disbelief.

           INT.  CELL ROOM - DAY

           Kornikov is in the small room where he has spent the past 
           months.  Just a mattress on the packed dirt floor and a shelf on 
           the wall.

           He wraps his belongings into his pattu - a few clothes, a couple 
           of black and white photos - one with Abdur and the kids, 
           laughing and posing for the camera.  Stewart slides it inside a 
           notebook.

           From outside, he hears a moan.  He looks out the narrow window.  
           All he can see is a shape, wrapped in a burqua, lying on the 
           ground.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Kornikov walks outside and approaches the woman.  Her burqua and 
           legs are stained in blood.  She's wrapped in a foetal position, 
           whimpering.  It's Zaphira.

           Kornikov pulls out a shirt from his bundle.  He looks around, 
           sees a water jug sitting on a window sill.  He dips the cloth in 
           it, wrings it out and hands it to the girl.
                                 KORNIKOV 
                             (in Pashtu)
                        Here.  You can wash yourself with 
                        this.  Don't move.  I'll be right 
                        back.

           Zaphira grabs the cloth without turning her head, unable to look 
           at him, face streaked by tears.

           Kornikov strides along the narrow alley glancing right and left.  
           At last he sees what he's been looking for:  a woman's salwar 
           kameez and a head scarf drying on a line inside a mud wall.

           He grabs them, then runs round the corner, back to Zaphira.  The 
           girl has cleaned herself.  She can barely stand up.  Kornikov 
           points at her bloodstained burqua.

                                 KORNIKOV (CONT'D)
                             (in Pashtu)
                        Give that to me.  Quick.

           A moment of hesitation. Kornikov turns his head away as a mark 
           of respect, and only then Zaphira takes the burqua off.  She 
           looks like a little girl in her ripped muslin dress, her arms 
           bare, breasts showing beneath the torn cloth.

           Kornikov, head still turned the other way, hands her the salwar 
           kameez and scarf. He rolls the stained burqua in a ball and 
           stuffs it in his bundle.

                                 KORNIKOV (CONT'D)
                             (in Pashtu)
                        I haven’t seen anything.  No one 
                        will know.

           Zaphira quickly slips the shirt on top of what she's wearing, 
           puts on the cotton trousers, and covers her head with the scarf.  
           Without looking at Kornikov, she whispers.

                                 ZAPHIRA
                             (in Pashtu)
                        Thank you.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

           The sun descends behind the cliffs.

           Abdur is still tied, back to back, with Mansur.  He watches the 
           troops frantically trying to load what's left of the weapons 
           into the second chopper.

           The first one readies for take-off.  Its engine starts to 
           MURMUR, the rotors turning, gaining revolutions.
           Engines are REVVING, everyone shouting as dust begins to spray 
           all around.  Kozlov shouts orders to his troops.  It's a scene 
           of chaos, RADIO-TALK all round.

           Abdur notices a figure appearing and disappearing in the 
           distance, moving quickly alongside the village's stone walls.  
           It's Kornikov.  Zaphira follows him, head low.  Kornikov stops 
           in front of Malik Azam's house and knocks at the door.

           The girl stops for a moment and looks over in Abdur's direction.  
           Her gaze meets his.  Mansur notices nothing.  Kornikov motions 
           her to move and also catches Abdur's eyes.

           A moment of suspension as the three of them look at one another, 
           bound by their shared knowledge.

           Abdur makes to get up but is attached to Mansur.  He falls 
           back on him.

                                 MANSUR
                        Hey, what’s up?!

           Mansur tries to turn but Abdur stops him, all the time 
           looking at Zaphira.  

                                 ABDUR
                        Nothing.  Sorry.

           Shirin half-opens the door.  She stares out in horror at Zaphira 
           and Kornikov.  She wraps Zaphira in her arms and bundles her 
           inside.

           Kornikov stares back at Abdur.  An imperceptible nod, just the 
           blink of an eye, to confirm Abdur's suspicion.  Mansur hasn't 
           seen a thing.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Kornikov storms up to Kozlov, pulling him by the sleeve.  Abdur 
           watches them.  They seem to be arguing.

           The increasing ROAR of the engine reaching working speed forces 
           them to yell at each other.  Mansur's watching them as well.

                                 MANSUR
                        Your friend and the Commander are 
                        deciding how to finish us off.

           Abdur doesn't respond.  He looks away.  His honour and Zaphira's 
           have both been lost, to no avail.

                                                                CUT TO:
           Kornikov and Kozlov argue, Kornikov indicating the soldiers 
           loading the second chopper over Kozlov's shoulder.

                                 KORNIKOV
                        They didn’t have to rape her.  Who 
                        did you say were the beasts round 
                        here?

                                 KOZLOV
                        What is your problem, Captain?

                                 KORNIKOV
                        They've ruined her for life.

                                 KOZLOV
                        Oh, fuck this, I've no time for it...

                                 KORNIKOV
                        You’re wrong, Kozlov.  If you want 
                        to win this war, you don’t do that.  
                        Don’t create yourselves enemies for 
                        ever...

           For a second, Kozlov is chastened.  Then:

                                 KOZLOV 
                        I’ve got to get my men outta here 
                        fast.  Spare me your sermons, 
                        Kornikov.  And get out my way.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The soldiers, boxes loaded, wait for orders from Kozlov.  
           Drinking, passing a joint, their faces red with excitement and 
           exertion.

           Kozlov walks over.  Takes a puff from the joint.

                                 KOZLOV (CONT'D)
                        Good work, guys.  Now let's get them.

           Motions at Kornikov, pacing up and down further back in his 
           Afghan clothes, alone.

                                 KOZLOV (CONT'D)
                        We come all this way to save his arse 
                        and all he can say is:
                             (falsetto)
                        "Don't touch them, they were nice to 
                        me!"  What the fuck!

           He takes another gulp of vodka.  Everyone's drunk and high.  
           Suddenly, a wild look in his eyes, Kozlov grabs a hand grenade 
           from one of the boxes.
           He runs to the center of the square and, mimicking a baseball 
           throw, hurls it into the well.  A MUTED EXPLOSION.  Then 
           sizzling acidic fumes and CHEERS from his men.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A group of women look out from behind the window of one of the 
           houses where they've taken shelter.  They stare, aghast, at the 
           water-hole.  It's completely destroyed.

           Kozlov seems possessed, high on destruction.

           He's by the two prisoners, untying Abdur's hands.  He pulls him 
           up.

                                 KOZLOV (CONT'D)
                        Captain!  Come here.  Tell your friend 
                        I'm going to let him go.

           Kornikov translates.

                                 KOZLOV (CONT'D)
                        I'll spare him but first you 
                        (Kornikov) have to dispose of this 
                        little piece of shit for me.

           Kozlov points the gun at Mansur's temple.  Kornikov gives him a 
           cold stare.  Mansur's eyes suddenly horrified.

           Something seems to have broken in Abdur, as if someone had cut 
           the strings holding him together.  He looks at Mansur, at the 
           terror in his eyes.  Then recovers and speaks steadily to 
           Kornikov.

                                 ABDUR
                        Tell that man you'll shoot me instead 
                        of Mansur. My life for his.  I’ve 
                        destroyed everything - I don’t deserve 
                        to live.

           Kornikov nods.  He tries to convey sympathy in his expression.  
           He translates to Kozlov.

                                 KOZLOV
                        So that's what he wants?  Great. Then 
                        you can finish them both off in memory 
                        of Captain Movchan and his men.  It'll 
                        be the perfect farewell to this shit 
                        hole...

           Kozlov hands him the gun.  Kornikov holds his gaze.  He doesn't 
           move to take it.
                                 KORNIKOV
                        You're an asshole, Commander.

           But his words are interrupted by a DEAFENING EXPLOSION.

           The helicopter that has taken off in the background is blown out 
           of the sky by the Stinger missile.

           For an instant everyone is still, paralyzed.

           The helicopter in the sky turns into a ball of fire.

           Panic breaks out.  Soldiers - including a terrified Kornikov - 
           spray the place with MACHINE-GUN FIRE.

           Abdur and Mansur dive for cover.

           Kozlov shouts to his men.

                                 KOZLOV
                        Move it, move it, move it!!!  Let's 
                        get out of here.

           The gunner pilot starts the second chopper's engine.  Blades 
           begin to ROAR.

           The first helicopter drops fast, CRASHES to the bottom of the 
           valley.  Fire, smoke, another DEAFENING SOUND.

           The DOOR-GUNNER signals for the men to hurry, laying out fire at 
           random.  Everyone jumps on board.

           Kornikov is last to board, looking back at what's he's leaving 
           for good.

           The chopper rises swiftly.

           Abdur and Mansur are left on the ground, in shock, their hair 
           swept by the chopper's blades.  They scramble away, scurrying 
           for shelter.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A WHISTLING SOUND comes from the guns mounted on the chopper's 
           sides.  A pair of rockets spiral and then SLAM into the 
           hillside, well above Abdur and Mansur.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A THUNDEROUS ROAR. Then a rain of slag and dust.

           Abdur squeezes his eyes shut, his mouth full of grit.

                                                                CUT TO:
           A WHOOSH from further up.

           The bright trail of shells tracing towards the aircraft 
           accompanied by glowing streaks of automatic weapons' FIRE.  
           Malik's men are striking back but missing.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The chopper swings in a wider arc, then with a burst of speed, 
           it rises and tears across the ridge-line, vanishing from sight.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The sound of the helicopter fades in the distance.  All is quiet 
           save for the CHATTERING of birds and the slow CRACKLING of 
           flames engulfing the crashed helicopter at the bottom of the 
           valley.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Silence is broken by distant GUN SHOTS and CRIES from further up 
           the mountain.  It's the rest of the mujaheddins.  Tumbling down, 
           FIRING in the sky to celebrate the gunning down of the first 
           helicopter.

           EXT.  THE VALLEY - DUSK

           It's almost dark.  The mujaheddins, followed by the children and 
           elders, have gathered at the bottom of the valley to inspect the 
           helicopter wreckage.

           There's lots of smoke and flames still burning.  The men pick 
           through the fragments for any useful remains of weapons.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Abdur's perched on a rock, hugging his knees, some way off.  He 
           keeps his eyes on Malik, surrounded by a few of the older 
           mujaheddins.  Malik is grilling Mansur in front of him.

           Abdur watches Mansur nod, keeping his head low.

           Malik looks over at Abdur, summons him with an imperious 
           gesture.

           Abdur crosses hesitantly to Malik, surrounded by his men.  They 
           look at him with hostility and suspicion.

                                 MALIK
                        None of my men has ever informed.  
                        They burn their arms with red-hot 
                        coals to practice silence under 
                        torture.
           Malik shakes his head with contempt.  As hard as stone.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        Have you nothing to say?

                                 ABDUR
                        But the honour of your daughter, Malik 
                        Azam, I tried -

           Malik Azam spits at his feet.

                                 MALIK
                        Everyone in the district knows there 
                        are no mujahaddins as brave as mine.  
                        Your cowardice has dishonoured us all.

           Abdur looks at Malik, then nods.  There's nothing he can say to 
           defend himself.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        Your weak blood is not worthy of 
                        mixing with mine.  Go away.  We have 
                        no use for you here now.

           Malik turns his back to him.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                             (to his men)
                        We must move fast.  They may be back.

           Everyone quickly collects whatever they've salvaged from the 
           wreckage.  Abdur and Mansur exchange a glance.  Mansur manages 
           to get close to Abdur without Malik seeing.

                                 MANSUR
                        I won't forget what you offered to do.  
                        God willing, I’ll see you again some 
                        day.

           Abdur nods, unable to reply. He's on the verge of tears. Mansur 
           turns his back to him and follows the rest of the men.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE - NIGHT

           The oil lamps lighting the interiors of the houses flicker on 
           the adobe walls.  Women shut the windows.  The village has 
           retired and is going to sleep.

           From the shadows, Zaphira, supported by her mother, creeps 
           through the darkness to the compound gate.  Her face is 
           drawn, haunted.  She takes a last look at...

           ... Abdur, sitting alone on the mound of rubble which was once 
           the well.  
           He's smoking a cigarette, a small duffle bag at his feet.  He 
           senses something and looks round.  But there is nothing but the 
           blank gate of the compound now.

           The square is deserted and silent, save for a dog BARKING to the 
           moon.

           Abdur's gaze now fixes on the shadows of the mujaheddins, 
           climbing the path up the mountainside in a single line.  Malik 
           leading, Mansur further back.

                                 RAZAQ (O.S.)
                        Son.

           Razaq looks distraught.  Abdur has shamed him as well in the 
           village's eyes.  He hands his son a bundle.

                                 RAZAQ (CONT'D)
                        Here.  The golden bracelets.  You may 
                        need to sell them.

           Abdur ignores them.

                                 RAZAQ (CONT'D)
                        Take them.  You think it'll be easy in 
                        Kabul?

           Abdur takes the bundle.  He places a hand on his chest and bows 
           slightly.

                                 RAZAQ (CONT'D)
                        When the time is right, I will speak 
                        again with Malik Azam.  With time, he 
                        may allow you  home.

           Abdur laughs bitterly.  He sees his father's pained reaction, 
           tempers his anger.

                                 RAZAQ (CONT'D)
                        Send me news.  Through uncle Nazim.

           His tone becomes urgent.  This may be the last time he’ll see 
           Abdur.  

                                 RAZAQ (CONT'D)
                        I need to hear from you.

           Abdur nods, suddenly desperate to give back something.

                                 RAZAQ (CONT'D)
                        May Allah protect you.

           Abdur bows his head again and his father touches it with his 
           palm.  Abdur scoops up his bag and goes.
           EXT.  ON THE RIDGE - NIGHT

           Abdur reaches the top of the ridge on the opposite side of the 
           valley.

           He looks across at his village lit by the oil lamps in the 
           distance.  The river shimmering in the moonlight at the bottom 
           of the gorge.

           He looks at the mountain across the valley, just in time to see 
           the last of the mujahaddins walk up in a line, Kalashnikovs over 
           their shoulders.

           He turns his back.  And begins to descend the other side.  A 
           lonely figure, head bowed.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE - DAY

           Traditional Afghan MUSIC is coming from one of the houses at the 
           back of the village.

           The two little girls from the river sit by the remains of the 
           well, playing with their favourite doll.  One paints the doll's 
           feet with red mud, imitating the ceremonial henna patterns women 
           wear at weddings.

           A group of boys cross the square, screaming behind a soccer 
           ball.  They tear through a labyrinth of tiny alleys, finally 
           reaching:

           INT.  MALIK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The source of music screeching from an old transistor radio in 
           Malik Azam's compound.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Zaphira's GRANDMOTHER sits cross-legged on a low cot, in a room.  
           With the help of two small girls, she's giving the final 
           stitches to a richly embroidered gown covered in coins.  It's 
           Zaphira's wedding dress.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The women's room next door is heaving.  All available space is 
           occupied by women's bodies, either dancing or chatting.

           It's the henna ceremony, in preparation for the wedding.  
           Zaphira sits surrounded by chatting and dancing WOMEN.  She is 
           the only one not enjoying herself.  The others, left alone by 
           the men's eyes, display a wild energy.
           They dance for each other, flailing arms and moving their hips 
           like belly dancers.  They're seductive to the point of being 
           provocative.

           The sound of drums and tambourines and women singing.  A 
           procession is approaching the house.  From the window we see a 
           group of women enter the gate of the compound.

           Shirin hurries in from another room.  She crosses to her 
           daughter.  Zaphira looks at her fearfully.

                                 SHIRIN
                        Hurry.  Greet Mansur’s mother in 
                        the other room.

           Zaphira gets up reluctantly.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The procession of women followed by tambourines and drums clap 
           and dance the traditional song while crossing the courtyard.  
           These are the female relatives on Mansur's side, Zaphira's new 
           family.

                                 WOMEN SINGING
                        We're taking this girl from her home 
                        and leading her to our home.  Bride, 
                        do not bow your head and cry bitter 
                        tears.  This is God's wish.  Oh 
                        Mohammed, God's messenger, help make 
                        this difficult moment easy!

                                                                CUT TO:

           On the doorstep, Shirin looks apprehensively at the approaching 
           procession.  She turns back inside to look at her daughter whom 
           she's about to lose.

           Zaphira sits in the center of the room, as if on display, head 
           bowed.

           The women from Mansur's family come through the door of the 
           house.

           They surround Zaphira, circling her, their attitude festive but 
           proprietorial.  Hands touching her, feeling her hair and skin.

           Zaphira keeps her gaze steady on the wall, avoiding anyone's 
           eye.
           EXT.  ON THE MOUNTAIN - CONTINUOUS

           Three mujahaddins move fast along the ridge, descending towards 
           the village, rifles strapped across their shoulders.  The one 
           leading the way is Mansur.

           He looks almost imposing, wrapped in a woollen cloak and a black 
           turban.  It is as if he has aged, with the beginnings of a 
           beard.  Everything about him now exudes confidence and 
           authority.  He has become a fighter.

           EXT.  MANSUR'S COMPOUND - DAY

           Live music plays in the groom's courtyard as well.  Men drum and 
           play traditional instruments.

           All the guests (strictly male) help themselves to food piled 
           high on the oilcloth out in the yard.

           Mansur and his men make their entrance.  Everyone stands to 
           greet him.  Bashir, his father, hugs him, celebrating his 
           return.  Mansur clearly hasn't been home for a while.

           Formal greetings are exchanged and the men sit down on a carpet.  
           Mansur eases from his neck a twenty foot ammunition belt.  It 
           slithers in coils on the carpet like an anaconda.

                                 BASHIR
                        It's good to have you back.  How are 
                        things up there?

                                 MANSUR
                        Quiet.  We're waiting for 
                        instructions.  We could have to move 
                        back up towards the border at any 
                        moment.

                                 BASHIR
                        What about Malik?

                                 MANSUR
                        He will be here tomorrow morning.  
                        He’s coming by night as usual.

                                 BASHIR
                        Good.  Best be careful.  The infidels 
                        were here again about a month ago. 
                        They broke into every house, even 
                        searched the mosque in their boots.

                                 MANSUR
                        We heard.  Apparently they put a 
                        bounty on Malik's head
                                 BASHIR
                             (laughs)
                        No money would be enough to sell Malik 
                        Azam.

           INT.  AMERICAN BASE.  CANTEEN - NIGHT

           Hip-hop music in the background.  A pretty risqué MTV video 
           plays on a giant TV screen.  We are in the canteen of an 
           American military base.

           SOLDIERS queue at the self-service, piling their trays with 
           burgers, chips and cokes.

           Abdur sits at a table, wrapped in his pattu.  He can't help 
           looking round at the young soldiers.

           He's fascinated by the newness of everything: the colourful 
           packaging of American junk food, the music blaring from the 
           speakers, women in uniforms, smoking and drinking at the same 
           tables as men.

                                 MAN (O.S)
                        Cheeseburger and Coke.

           Abdur looks up at the man.  It's Kornikov, now CAPTAIN PEARCE 
           (the same actor), Commander of US Special Forces. 

           He looks tanned, scruffy , in a sleeveless army camouflage 
           jacket.  His hair is long, his chin bearded.  A couple of 
           tattoos show on his forearm.   He holds a plastic tray filled 
           with styrofoam containers.

           He sits down, pushes food and drink across the table towards 
           Abdur.  Raises his Coke in a toast.

           A puzzled Abdur looks at the plastic dispensers on the table.  
           Pearce smiles, opens his own container and shows Abdur how to 
           squeeze mustard onto the burger.  Bites into it with gusto.

                                 PEARCE
                        Our national dish.

           Abdur is about to imitate him when WALGREN, a sturdy woman 
           officer in her forties, dressed in a squeaky clean uniform,  
           approaches the table.

                                 WALGREN
                        Sorry to be late, Captain.  Held up in 
                        a meeting.

           Pearce pulls up a chair.  Abdur shuffles, uncertain.
                                 PEARCE
                        We just got here.  This is my friend, 
                        Abdur Raman.  Major Walgren is in 
                        charge of intelligence operations for 
                        the main army here.

           Walgren shakes Abdur's hand firmly, with a warm smile.

                                 WALGREN
                        Hi Mr Raman, good to meet you.  Glad 
                        you decided to help us.  The Captain 
                        says good things about you.

           Abdur looks at her, taken aback, then puts a hand to his chest 
           and bows his head, muttering a shy hello.

           INT.  MALIK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Zaphira's future sister-in-law, AMARAYN, begins the henna 
           ceremony.

           She undresses Zaphira, till she's left in her underwear, in a 
           tunic and long trousers.

           The green paste is skillfully poured on the soles of her feet 
           and the palms of her hands.

           Amarayn begins to SING the henna song as she draws intricate 
           patterns with a thin wooden stick.

           Zaphira's hands are then rolled in a soft cloth to avoid 
           dirtying her clothes.

           INT.  AMERICAN BASE.  CANTEEN - NIGHT

           Walgren, Pearce and Abdur sit at the table, smoking.  Pearce 
           seems edgy and restless as he tries to conceal his dislike of 
           Walgren.  There isn't much empathy between Special Forces and 
           regular Army personnel.  Abdur hasn't touched his food yet.

                                 PEARCE
                        Abdur got the invitation last week.  
                        He's convinced Malik Azam will attend 
                        his daughter's wedding.  Whatever the 
                        risks.  Other sources confirm he's 
                        heading south -

                                 WALGREN
                             (abrupt)
                        I saw the report.

           She pours coffee, turning to Abdur.  She doesn't wholly trust 
           Pearce.  He's too embedded with the natives for her liking.
                                 WALGREN (CONT'D)
                        Coffee?  No tea, I'm afraid.  Cream?  
                        Sugar?

           Abdur nods without looking her in the eyes. Walgren fumbles with 
           cups and sugar and hands one to Abdur.  Underneath his pattu, we 
           glimpse a colourful T-shirt.  He wears American army boots.  
           He's clearly spent time around the US forces.

           Abdur tastes the coffee, screws up his face.

                                 WALGREN (CONT'D)
                        How's your English, Mr Raman?

           Abdur nods again, still avoiding looking at her.

                                 WALGREN (TO PEARCE) (CONT'D)
                        Does he speak any?

                                 PEARCE
                        A bit. I'll translate if need be.

           Walgren studies the map.  She taps her fingers on the table, 
           thinking.

                                 WALGREN
                        You really think Malik will turn up?  
                        No one has seen him for months.

           No answer from Abdur.  Pearce translates into Pashtu.

                                 ABDUR
                             (broken English)
                        He come.  It's tradition.  A man 
                        always must come to marriage of 
                        family.  His daughter marry.

           Walgren goes back to the map.  Something on her mind.

                                 WALGREN
                             (to Pearce)
                        Why should I trust him?

                                 PEARCE (BLUNT)
                        Because this is the only concrete 
                        piece of information we've had in 
                        months..

                                 WALGREN
                        You know how many guys show up here 
                        every day with concrete information?  
                        It's all part of their personal 
                        vendettas, tribal wars, whatever...  
                                 (MORE)
                                 WALGREN (CONT'D)
                        Plus, they'll invent anything for 
                        money -

                                 PEARCE
                        I wouldn't be wasting my time if-

           But Abdur interrupts vehemently.  He has caught the nature of 
           Walgren's misgivings and it has upset him.

                                 ABDUR
                        Not for money!  That man is bad man!  
                        Now he is Talib Commander, works with 
                        Saudi people.  Very bad.  Me not want 
                        money, I help only.

           He rambles on in pashtu and then stands up, motioning to leave.  
           Pearce grabs his arm and pulls him back onto the chair.

                                 PEARCE
                        Hey! hey! Wait! Sit down!
                             (to Walgren, under his 
                              breath)
                        You keep doing this and we'll lose 
                        him.  Remember Afghans aren't used to 
                        being told what to do by women.

           Walgren doesn't like being told what to do by Pearce either, the 
           two of them now glaring at one another.

                        No point in blowing the operation, 
                        Major.  I'm only taking three men and 
                        one vehicle.  If Malik doesn’t turn up 
                        we'll have wasted a day driving and 
                        eating dust.  No big deal.

           Walgren taps her fingers again, then nods reluctantly.  She 
           turns to Abdur who has missed most of their conversation.

                                 WALGREN 
                        Can he explain why he's so eager to 
                        sell Malik to us?

           Pearce translates, Abdur continues in Pashtu to Pearce.

                                 PEARCE
                             (annoyed)
                        Basically he’s saying he wants the 
                        Talibans finished because they’ve 
                        been destroying his country.  They 
                        haven’t helped ordinary people like 
                        they promised.  He says he hates 
                        the foreigners.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 PEARCE (CONT'D)
                        He means the Saudis and Pakistanis.  
                        Malik works with them now.

           Abdur interrupts him, talks directly to Walgren.

                                 ABDUR
                             (in English)
                        Myself good Muslim but no Talibans.  
                        What they preach not the Quran say.

           He finishes.  Walgren nods.  Abdur fiddles with some 
           difficulty with his cheeseburger.

                                 WALGREN 
                        Do you want some of that?  Here, let 
                        me.

           She grabs his styrofoam box, squeezes condiments on the burger, 
           onion and pickle on top, closes the bun.

                                 WALGREN (CONT'D)
                        Enjoy.

           Abdur looks puzzled at the concoction and tentatively bites into 
           it.

                                 WALGREN (CONT'D)
                        You'll get used to it if you 'll keep 
                        hanging around here.
                             (getting up)
                        I’m sorry.  I have to go.
                             (to Pearce)
                        You’ll leave early tomorrow then, 
                        Captain.  We can discuss details 
                        later in my office.  I want to 
                        clarify a few points with you.

           She holds out her hand for Abdur to shake.

                                 WALGREN (CONT'D)
                        Well, good luck, Mr Raman.  It was a 
                        pleasure meeting you.  We're grateful.  
                        What you're doing will be good for 
                        your country.

           Abdur doesn't offer to shake her hand.  Walgren seems bemused by 
           his lack of etiquette.  She pats Pearce on the shoulder, motions 
           him to escort her to the door.  They walk.

                                 WALGREN (CONT'D)
                        Is that really what it’s about, 
                        Pearce?
                                 PEARCE
                        Fuck knows.  He probably has his 
                        own reasons.  We’ll never know, 
                        though.  I do trust him, though.

                                 WALGREN
                        Wasn't it you who told me when I 
                        arrived, "You can never buy an Afghan, 
                        you can only rent one"?

                                 PEARCE 
                        The trick is to make sure the lease 
                        doesn’t expire, Major.

           Walgren leaves.  Pearce, watches her go, then shakes his head.

           INT.  MALIK'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

           The room is darker and quiet.  The women have eaten and danced 
           till the early hours.  They're beginning to fall asleep on 
           mattresses spread around the room.

           Zaphira curls up next to her mother.  She has been crying.  She 
           grabs Shirin's hand and holds it tight to her chest.

                                 SHIRIN
                        Sleep.

                                 ZAPHIRA
                        I can't.  I'm afraid of what will 
                        happen tomorrow, mother.  What is 
                        Mansur going to do when he finds out?

                                 SHIRIN
                        It's happened in every village during 
                        the war.  You're not the first or the 
                        last.  Try and sleep now.

           But Zaphira doesn't relent.

                                 ZAPHIRA
                        I wish I'd married Abdur and gone to 
                        Kabul with him that day.  He would 
                        have kept me.  Whereas Mansur...  What 
                        will happen if he rejects me?

                                 SHIRIN
                        He won't.  We're going to make sure 
                        your sheet has blood on it.  That's 
                        all it takes.

                                 ZAPHIRA
                        And how will we do that without him 
                        knowing?  I'm scared, mother...
                                 SHIRIN
                        We'll dip a bit of sponge in chicken 
                        blood.  Just before he comes to you, 
                        slide it between your legs.  It'll 
                        make you tighter inside and it'll 
                        bleed.  He'll never know, trust me.

           There's a silence.  Then Zaphira sighs.

                                 ZAPHIRA
                        Abdur would have looked after me.   We 
                        would have helped each other.

           Shirin is immersed in her thoughts for a moment, as if 
           remembering something in her past.  Her voice, unusually soft.

                                 SHIRIN
                        Stop thinking about Abdur.  It'll only 
                        make things worse.

           Zaphira looks at her mother.  She's about to ask more but Shirin 
           silences her, shushing her to sleep.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE - DAWN

           Roosters begin to wake up the sleeping village.   Sparrows 
           gather on window sills.  The first children run out of the 
           houses, ready to begin their games.

           INT.  MALIK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The women wake up in the room where they've spent the night 
           together.  They begin to move around, attending to the tea and 
           fire.

           Amarayn unwraps the cloth around Zaphira's hand.  She scrapes 
           off the henna.  A beautiful orange pattern appears.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE SQUARE - LATER

           A line of mujahaddins descends the steep path leading down into 
           the village.

           It's Malik, preceded and followed by heavily armed bodyguards.  
           All the men from the village are in the square to welcome him.

           Malik's beard is longer and greyer, he's wearing mirrored 
           shades, a grubby military smock, a pistol, and an automatic 
           rifle slung around his neck.  One of his bodyguards carries a 
           radio handset.

           The men look tired.  They've been walking a long time.
           The elaborate Pashtun ritual of greetings is exchanged between 
           the villagers and Malik's group.

           Then Malik's party enters the hujira.

           EXT - OUTSKIRTS OF KABUL - MORNING

           A sand colored Tacoma drives through the outskirts of the city, 
           a motorcycle in the back of the pick up.  The road is busy with 
           traffic.

           Overstuffed trucks laden with animals, timber, fuel, all HONKING 
           their horns.

           Pearce drives, next to him, Abdur.  Three young men from the 
           Special Forces team in the back, in full camouflage gear.  
           GARCIA, DE LILLO and MORRISON.

           Standing out against their outfits is the lapis pendant 
           hanging round Pearce’s neck - clearly a lucky charm.

           The jeep takes a narrow alley, around a bazaar.  Rubble and 
           ruins everywhere.  Walls peppered by bullets.  Women wrapped in 
           their blue burquas scuttle like ghosts along the walls.

           The street widens as it approaches the bazaar.  It's very 
           crowded.  The car has to slow down to negotiate the crowd.

           MEN and CHILDREN with their legs and arms amputated - victims of 
           land mines - wave as they see the jeep.

           They gather around it.  The faces of men and children, staring 
           curiously.

           Abdur watches Pearce look at the hungry faces.  The desperate 
           eyes.  Stumps POUND the jeep's sides.  It's a harrowing 
           spectacle.  Abdur looks tormented.  He hands out some coins to 
           the children.  He hates this.

           EXT.  ON THE WAY TO THE VILLAGE - LATER

           The jeep has left the city behind.  In the pristine morning 
           light, it drives in and out of the shadows of high ridges, 
           leaving a plume of dust in its wake.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The road seems to have disintegrated a long time ago through a 
           combination of being bombed, driven over by tanks, and lack of 
           maintenance.  It's a wasteland.

           Flanking the way on either side stretch miles and miles of 
           ruins.  Burned-out, stripped hulks of tanks litter the verges.  
           Winches and military bulldozers too, their axles twisted by mine 
           blasts.

           In every direction, hilltop structures of baked mud half-
           destroyed in previous battles scar the ground.  And all around, 
           craters, the imprint of fallen shell or mortar-round.

           Inside the jeep, the soldiers in the back chew gum, listening to 
           music on their headphones.

           Abdur can't stop looking out of the window, as if in a trance.  
           He's sinking into a black gloom.

           Pearce checks him from time to time.

                                 PEARCE
                        It'll be alright.  You're doing the 
                        right thing.

           Abdur looks at him blankly, then turns out his window.  More 
           silence as Pearce drives.

                                 PEARCE (CONT'D)
                        We're here for the same reason.  To 
                        help you get rid of people like Malik 
                        Azam.  We'll hunt them down and 
                        destroy their network.  That's the way 
                        your country will have a chance again.

           Still no response.  Pearce doesn't relent.  He wants to ensure 
           Abdur isn't going to pull out.

                                 PEARCE (CONT'D)
                        If we don't get the Taliban out, 
                        they'll come back under another name.  
                        Understand?  This is our job.  To 
                        disrupt them, stop them operating.

           Abdur keeps looking out the window.

                                 PEARCE (CONT'D)
                        Then we can begin to rebuild  - clear 
                        the mines, build bridges, roads to 
                        help you.  You know how many millions 
                        of dollars we - ?

                                 ABDUR
                             (snaps, in Pashtu)
                        Build?  Once you've killed them, 
                        you'll forget us.  You'll go back to 
                        America.  Just like you did when the 
                        Russians left.  You abandoned us.
                                 PEARCE
                        Not this time.  We've learnt a lesson.  
                        We're going to stay, improve the 
                        security and help you rebuild the 
                        country.

           Abdur shrugs.  He gestures at the barren landscape.

                                 ABDUR
                        My father once told me this place was 
                        green and rich.  He said my village 
                        was surrounded by orchards.  Now look.  
                        It's dry.  Dead.  The people have 
                        gone.  Your bridges and buildings 
                        can't put life back in this land.

           He turns away, wrapped in bitter silence.

           Garcia, mid-twenties, Hispanic, senses Abdur's mood.  He takes 
           off his head phones and leans over the passenger seat.

                                 GARCIA
                        Hey, man.  Ever heard of a guy 
                        called Eminem?

           He places his earphones over Abdur's ears.  Abdur is suddenly 
           overwhelmed by THE SOUND OF RAP.

           He can't help an astonished smile.  He's never heard anything 
           like this before.

           The guys in the back, De Lillo and Morrison, get a kick from his 
           reaction.

                                 DE LILLO
                        Pretty cool, huh?

                                 MORRISON
                        Hey, Abdur, listen to this.

           Morrison switches earphones on Abdur.  Suddenly Abdur is carried 
           away by the sound of ROCK MUSIC.

           Morrison takes out a couple of chocolates from his M & M'S 
           packet and hands them to Abdur.

                                 MORRISON (CONT'D)
                        Have these.  The perfect combo.

           The MUSIC blasting in Abdur's ears becomes the unlikely 
           soundtrack to the barren wasteland they're crossing.
           EXT.  ON THE WAY TO THE VILLAGE - DAY

           The plain has closed in, the route flanked by mountain ranges on 
           both sides.  The road has narrowed into a valley carved between 
           steep walls.

           Pearce's jeep passes through a narrow gully, following a dry 
           river course cut deep in the sandstone.

           Inside the jeep, Abdur is back in a pensive mood.  He's gulping 
           down Morrison's M & M'S.

           De Lillo, a stocky Italian kid, early twenties and clearly the 
           youngest in the group, pats Abdur on his shoulder and offers him 
           a Marlboro.  Abdur lights up and turns to Pearce with a smile.

                                 ABDUR
                             (in English)
                        Can you get me to America after this?

           Pearce starts, then laughs in surprise.  Abdur looks intently at 
           him.

                                 PEARCE
                        You're serious?

                                 ABDUR
                        Why not?

           Pearce pretends to think about it, shakes his head.

                                 PEARCE
                        You belong here.

           Abdur grimaces.  Something has clicked in his head.  The  idea 
           of going to live in the United States.

                                 ABDUR
                        I want to go.  You get me a job?  Make 
                        dollars?

                                 PEARCE
                        It's not that simple.  You'd need a 
                        passport...  A visa...

           Abdur shrugs.  He knows Pearce could fix it.

           Pearce, uncomfortable, looks in the mirror.  Taking in the other 
           men he's responsible for aside from Abdur.  They're lost in 
           thought, listening to music, tapping their thighs.

                                 PEARCE (CONT'D)
                        It wouldn't be easy.  American's very 
                        different, Abdur.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 PEARCE (CONT'D)
                        This is your country here.  It'd be 
                        difficult for you...

                                 ABDUR
                             (in Pashtu)
                        More difficult than this?

           Abdur gestures towards the wasteland they're passing through.

           A barefoot child with his flock of sheep runs after the car like 
           a maniac, waving and cheering.

           A frail old man walking along the track holding himself on a 
           stick, his head wrapped in a turban.

           Rusty Soviet tanks, encrusted in the landscape like ancient 
           dinosaurs.

           Abdur and Pearce suddenly see the same thing.

                                 ABDUR (CONT'D)
                        How can this be home any more?  I've 
                        lost my village and my family.  The 
                        rest is rubble.

           He turns his eyes back to the road, looking, stony-faced, ahead.  
           Pearce drives on, torn inside at Abdur's new plan.

           EXT.  ON THE WAY TO THE VILLAGE - LATER

           The jeep has stopped underneath a wide overhang to avoid being 
           seen from above.  It has been covered with netting in order to 
           camouflage it from a distance.  The motorbike has been unloaded.

           Pearce and his men prepare to set off up to the ridge.  They are 
           cross-checking a map on the bonnet of the jeep.

           Pearce traces a trajectory with his fingers on the map.

                                 PEARCE
                        We split right here.  You guys and 
                        I march over this ridge all the way 
                        along here.  We position ourselves 
                        here.  If everything goes to plan, 
                        we reunite in Kabul the day after 
                        tomorrow.  Got that, Abdur?

           Abdur nods. Pearce shows Abdur a small walkie-talkie and a 
           tiny device sitting in the palm of his hand.

                                 PEARCE (CONT'D)
                        Okay, let's run through this one more 
                        time.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 PEARCE (CONT'D)
                        After you've seen him, confirm his 
                        presence on the radio as soon as you 
                        can.

           Abdur looks at the microchip.

                                 PEARCE (CONT'D)
                        Here's the tracker.  Remember, you can 
                        clip it on just about anything.  But 
                        it's got to be something he'll take 
                        with him.  And make sure it's 
                        somewhere he won't find it, okay?  
                        Otherwise you're fucked and so are we.

           Abdur nods.  He keeps looking at the strange black dot, 
           perplexed.

                                 PEARCE (CONT'D)
                        That's it.  All we need is a signal.  
                        Then we can track him back up the 
                        mountain after the wedding.  The rest 
                        is up to us.  Though I suggest you 
                        don't hang around too long afterwards.

                                 ABDUR
                        What will you do with him?

                                 PEARCE
                        Hope he leads us into the caves up 
                        there.  To the main guys.  If not, 
                        we'll just pick him up.

                                 ABDUR
                        And then?

                                 PEARCE
                        Our people will handle it.

           Abdur stares into Pearce's eyes.  He doesn't trust him entirely.

                                 ABDUR
                        You won't come to get him during the 
                        wedding, right?

                                 PEARCE
                        No way.  I said before.  We're not 
                        coming anywhere near the village.  No 
                        civilians involved.  I give you my 
                        word.

           Pearce stretches his hand out.  Abdur hesitates, then takes it.
                                 PEARCE (CONT'D)
                        It's my word of honour, Abdur.  We 
                        have honour too, you know.

           The two men shake hands and give each other a formal Afghan hug.  
           Abdur turns hesitantly to Morrison.

                                 ABDUR
                             (in English)
                        I take chocolate for present to 
                        children in my village?

                                 MORRISON
                        You want some of these?  Sure, we've 
                        got plenty.

           He  pulls out what he has from his multi-pocketed vests.  De 
           Lillo rips open a couple of MRE (Meals ready to Eat) and pulls 
           out lots of chocolates, candy bars, chewing gum.

           Abdur stuffs his pockets.  He and the guys exchange quick hugs.  
           De Lillo gives him a five.

           Abdur wraps himself tightly into his pattu and mounts his 
           motorbike.

           The Americans watch him as he repeatedly turns the ignition key.  
           The engine finally starts, with much spluttering and lots of 
           black smoke and Abdur's off on the bumpy track.

           He turns back, smiling, waves his hand.  The guys wave back, 
           making the V-sign.  Abdur responds with the same gesture.  A 
           hopeful smile on his face.

           INT.  MALIK'S HOUSE - DAY

           Zaphira's hair is rolled around wooden curlers.

           Her eyebrows are plucked.

           A thick layer of light foundation applied to her face.

           Dark red lipstick on her lips and a thick kohl pencil around her 
           eyes.

           INT.  MANSUR'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Mansur sits on a stool in a small room while the village BARBER 
           tidies up his jaw and hair.  His clean white clothes for the 
           wedding ceremony lie on a low bed, along with his sword and gun.

           Malik enters.
                                 MANSUR
                        Salam alekum.

                                 MALIK
                        Alekum salam, my son.

                                 MANSUR
                        God be praised.  You got down safely?

                                 MALIK
                        God be praised, it was all quiet when 
                        we left, and we saw no one on the way.  
                        I've left Rashid and Yaqub up on the 
                        ridge to keep watch.

           Mansur looks at the barber.  The barber leaves, taking Mansur's 
           hint.

                                 MANSUR
                        There's something I want you to know. 
                        I've invited Abdur as my guest and 
                        he's on his way.

           Malik's eyes gleam with irony.

                                 MALIK
                        I was wondering how much longer you 
                        were going to wait before you'd tell 
                        me.

           Mansur lowers his head.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        He betrayed us.

                                 MANSUR
                        I owe him my life.  And he was like a 
                        brother to me.

           Malik doesn't say anything, looks sceptical.

                                 MANSUR (CONT'D)
                        You exiled him from home and family.  
                        Hasn't he suffered enough?

           Malik shrugs.  Mansur insists.

                                 MANSUR (CONT'D)
                        Besides, I thought he could be useful 
                        to us.

                                 MALIK
                        Useful?  How?
                                 MANSUR
                        He knows Kabul now.  I've heard he 
                        speaks some English. He's not just a 
                        villager like us now.  He could relay 
                        important information to us.

           Malik ponders.  He pulls out his naswar from a small bundle and 
           offers it to Mansur.

           EXT.  MOUNTAIN TRACK - DAY

           The light is sharp as crystal.  Mountain summits glow against 
           the deep blue sky.

           Abdur drives his bike along the dirt track. He looks at the 
           mountain, its familiar profile.  Everything - from the ginger 
           coloured trees staining the valley with reds and yellows to the 
           green of the stream and the ridge - brings back memories.

           EXT.  MOUNTAIN TRACK - LATER

           The bike slows down in the proximity of the village.

           A flock of sheep driven by a turbanned white-bearded man flows 
           around the bike like a shoal of fish.

           Abdur drinks in his surroundings:  the farmers burning winter 
           stubble in fields divided by poplars, turbanned men passing on 
           bicycles and donkeys, women washing their clothes in the river.  
           Nothing has changed.

           Abdur stops on a ridge and takes a look at the landscape 
           stretching below him. Something in him gives, as if the hardness 
           he's harbored for so long is thawing and melting.

           EXT.  ON THE RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Pearce sweats heavily as he speaks on his radio.

                                 PEARCE
                        Cobra one...  This is Cobra two...  
                        We're in position...  Our man's on his 
                        way...  Over...

           The radio crackles.  Walgren's voice comes up.  A streak of 
           anxiety

                                 WALGREN (O.S.)
                        Cobra one.  Okay, Cobra two .  As soon 
                        as target is acquired, confirm.  Is 
                        that clear?  Suddenly I've got 
                        everyone on my back.   Bagram, the 
                        Pentagon, the lot.  No fuck-ups, 
                        Captain...  Over...
                                 PEARCE
                        Relax, Major.  Nothing's going to 
                        happen for a while.  Afghan weddings 
                        go on for ever...  Over.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE - DAY

           Abdur's bike is reaching the village.  He can see the mud houses 
           in the distance, right across the valley.  A smile on his face.

           EXT.  ABDUR'S COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS

           A YOUNG GIRL, Abdur's little sister, sweeps the mud floor of the 
           yard.  She hears the sound of the approaching bike. As it turns 
           the corner she recognizes Abdur and runs inside to announce his 
           arrival.

           Children run out of the house, calling his name.  They pull at 
           his clothes, screaming with laughter.

           Family and neighbours emerge and surround him.  It's a 
           commotion.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Razaq has aged and has lost weight.  Abdur's younger brothers 
           and sister look thin and hungry.  The youngest one has lost his 
           leg and is on crutches.

           Abdur bows his head to receive his father's blessing.

                                 RAZAQ
                        May the grace of God be with you.  How 
                        was your journey?

                                 ABDUR
                        Praise God, it was good.  I bring you 
                        Uncle Nazim Ahmed's greetings.  He 
                        sends you this present.

           He pulls out a bundle from his bag.  It's a cheap wristwatch.  
           Razaq opens its case and inspects it with care.  He solemnly 
           puts it around his wrist, as the children crowd around him and 
           try to touch it.

                                 ABDUR (CONT'D)
                        And here.  For you lot.  Presents for 
                        you as well.

           He distributes the colourful candies he collected from the 
           Americans.  The children begin to fight and scream with delight.
           INT. ABDUR'S COMPOUND - DAY

           Abdur sits inside the house with his brothers, Razaq and Razaq’s 
           elderly, white-haired brother, Abdur’s UNCLE.  Abdur strokes the 
           head of his youngest brother, the one missing a leg.  Razaq 
           shakes his head with a pained expression.

                                 RAZAQ
                        They came a month ago.  They searched 
                        everybody. They unveiled the women, 
                        made them lift their veils, touched 
                        them.

           Abdur is momentarily distracted, recalling Zaphira’s rape.  
           He pulls himself together.

                                 ABDUR
                        Americans?

                                 RAZAQ
                        Yes. Everyone was screaming.  They 
                        were saying they’d come to save us.  
                        But you wouldn’t treat an animal 
                        like that.   

                                 ABDUR 
                        Were they males of females soldiers?

                                 RAZAQ
                        Males. They pushed everyone around, 
                        screaming. The cruelty they showed, 
                        you wouldn't treat an animal like 
                        that. Even your uncle was-

           The uncle intervenes.

                                 UNCLE
                        They told me to take off my clothes.  
                        They kicked my legs open with their 
                        boots and they touched me everywhere. 
                        I never felt such humiliation in my 
                        whole life.

                                 ABDUR
                        What did they want?

                                 RAZAQ
                        They said they had a report about 
                        foreigners being here.  They kept on 
                        asking about Malik.

                                 UNCLE
                        They touched us in all our private 
                        parts, they even fingered us...
           Abdur looks deeply disturbed by this account.

                                 RAZAQ 
                        You should come back here, son.  At 
                        least you could help look after the 
                        village.

                                 ABDUR
                        But Malik...

                                 RAZAQ
                        He has asked to see you.

           Razaq smiles, taking him by the arm.

                                 RAZAQ (CONT'D)
                        He told me to bring you to the 
                        hujira as soon as you got here.

           INT.  THE HUJIRA - MOMENTS LATER

           Abdur follows his father inside the hujira.

           They stoop awkwardly through a small door into a smoky room.  
           Abdur is greeted by an array of curious stares.  Malik and his 
           men sit on cushions, drinking tea and passing hookas.

           Malik motions him to sit and join them, according to custom.  
           Abdur and Razaq join the men.  Greetings are exchanged.

           Malik at first pretends to ignore Abdur and talks to his men as 
           if he doesn't exist.  Razaq moves closer to Malik and talks with 
           him, indicating Abdur.

           Malik looks at Abdur.  He notices the American shoes and T-
           shirt.  His attire sticks out amidst the villagers' traditional 
           robes.  Malik clears his voice and talks to Abdur from across 
           the room.

                                 MALIK
                        Abdur!  I hardly recognize you.  Look 
                        at your fancy foreign clothes!  Have 
                        you forgotten us in the village now?  
                        And your religion too?

           The men laugh, unsure whether they should look welcoming or 
           hostile towards Abdur.  Abdur too is uncertain how aggressive 
           Malik is being.

                                 ABDUR
                        No, Malik Azam, I could never forget 
                        my village.  When I sit in the bazaar, 
                        I dream of the valley and the river.
           Malik seems pleased with the answer.  He hands a plate of pilau 
           to one of the young boys to bring to Abdur.  He watches Abdur 
           eat.  Hospitality is another of his means of control.

                                 MALIK
                        Your father says you've been working 
                        with Nazim Ahmed.  He's my cousin too, 
                        you know.

                                 ABDUR
                        He sends his most heartfelt greetings 
                        to you, Malik Azam.  He's in good 
                        health, praise Allah, and so is his 
                        family.

           Malik nods, keeps scanning Abdur, every detail.

                                 MALIK
                        They tell me you speak English now and 
                        deal with the foreigners?

           Abdur hesitates.  Does Malik know or suspect something?

                                 ABDUR
                        Well...  In the bazaar...  I picked up 
                        a few words.  These days the bazaar's 
                        full of foreigners

                                 MALIK
                        The kaffirs come to the bazaar?
                             (laughs)
                        So you talk to them in English?

                                 ABDUR
                             (reddening)
                        Just enough to sell them things, Malik 
                        Azam.
                             (laughs)
                        They pay stupid prices for things they 
                        think are ancient.

                                 MALIK
                        That's very good.  You with Kaffirs...  
                        One day that could be useful to us.

           Abdur's on edge.  He can't make out whether Malik is testing him 
           or is innocent.  Malik turns to his audience who nod in 
           agreement with their chief. 

           Malik offers Abdur a pinch of naswar.  Abdur accepts.  He and 
           his father look at each other.  Razaq smiles.  Things are 
           panning out better than he expected.
           INT.  MALIK'S HOUSE - DAY

           The final preparation of the bride.

           The beautifully embroidered dress is brought by Shirin and her 
           oldest sister.

           Zaphira slips into it and waits for Shirin to bring out the 
           jewellery:  ear-rings and bracelets and anklets.  A golden scarf 
           to cover her hair.

           Zaphira sits like a sphinx in the middle of the room, her gaze 
           still.  With the heavy make-up and stiff curls, she looks like a 
           painted doll.

           EXT.  THE CAVE - CONTINUOUS

           The sun is beginning to descend behind the mountain, bathing the 
           village in a golden glow.

           Abdur has managed to go off by himself.  He heads down the path 
           that leads to the cave entrance.  Making sure nobody sees him, 
           he enters.

           INT.  THE CAVE - CONTINUOUS

           The cave is empty.  Only a few sacks of grain and flour leaning 
           against the walls.

           Abdur pulls out the walkie-talkie.

                                 ABDUR
                             (whispers)
                        Cobra two, cobra two...  Do you 
                        receive me?  Over...

           EXT.  ON THE RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Pearce is on the radio.  Behind him, the soldiers eat rations on 
           the ground.   They leap up as Pearce speaks to Abdur.

                                 PEARCE
                        Be careful now...  Over...

           He sees his men, violently signals them to get down.  He gets 
           out his binoculars.

                                 PEARCE (CONT'D)
                        Target acquired.  They've got two look-
                        outs on the ridges.
                             (spots them through 
                              binoculars)
                        Got them...  Okay, watch them, 
                        Garcia...
           EXT.  THE CAVE - CONTINUOUS

           Abdur emerges from the cave.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Abdur!

           Abdur spins round.  It's Mansur, in his white dress for the 
           wedding, waiting to surprise him as of old.

                                 MANSUR
                             (laughing)
                        So others have to tell me my cousin 
                        has arrived?

           Abdur's face lightens up.  A broad smile, his eyes glinting 
           again.  He walks over and hugs his friend.

           EXT.  THE RIVER - DAY

           Abdur and Mansur sit under one of the poplars at the spot where 
           Captain Stewart's camp once stood.  The two men share the last 
           cigarette from Abdur's Marlboros.

           In the background we make out the rusty remains of the  Soviet 
           helicopter, the reminder of another war.

           Mansur inhales deeply, enjoying the taste.  He nods down at 
           Abdur's shoes.

                                 MANSUR
                        You didn't send any news.

                                 ABDUR
                        Seemed better that way.

           Beat.

                                 MANSUR
                        How's life in the city?

                                 ABDUR
                        Hard.  So many people have come into 
                        Kabul looking for work.  No 
                        electricity, not much to eat.  I work 
                        in Chicken street, selling stuff for 
                        my uncle.  How's life been for you?

                                 MANSUR
                        Nothing has changed.  Most of the time 
                        we’re in the caves.  The Americans 
                        have those planes which film from the 
                        sky.
                             (chuckles)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MANSUR (CONT'D)
                        They haven’t caught any of us yet.  
                        But it’s good to be back down here.  
                        With mother’s cooking.

           He pats his stomach, laughing.  Abdur smiles.  They sit in 
           silence, passing the last of the cigarette.

                                 MANSUR (CONT'D)
                        The life of a mujahad still seems 
                        better to me than being stuck in 
                        Chicken Street.

           Abdur shrugs.

                                 ABDUR
                        We all do the best we can.

                                 MANSUR
                        You could come back and be a mujahad 
                        again. It's up to you.

           Abdur looks out over the landscape and doesn't reply.  Mansur 
           leaves it for now and scrambles up.

                                 MANSUR (CONT'D)
                        Come on, we'd better get back or we'll 
                        miss my wedding!

           He pulls Abdur up by the arm, laughing.

                                 MANSUR (CONT'D)
                        Cheer up!  Or are you mad I got the 
                        beauty in the end?

           Abdur smiles, trying to shrug the comment off.

                                 MANSUR (CONT'D)
                        I can hardly wait for tonight!

           Mansur keeps laughing as he leads the way up the hill.  A sudden 
           despair in Abdur's eyes.  For the rape, for Zaphira, for the 
           life he could have lived and cherished.

           INT.  MALIK'S HOUSE - DAY

           Zaphira is still in the same position, cross legged on her cot, 
           surrounded by her younger sisters who are giving her the last 
           touches:  adjusting her veil, fixing her curls.

           She remains perfectly still under their hands, almost lifeless.  
           Shirin enters the room.  With a wave of her hand she dismisses 
           the girls.
           She kneels next to Zaphira, her face very close to her 
           daughter's.  She opens the palm of her hand and shows Zaphira a 
           small parcel wrapped in plastic. The ingenious trick which will 
           save her life.

           The two women exchange a look.  Shirin nods reassuringly.

           Shirin pushes the tiny wrap into Zaphira's palm and closes her 
           fist, pressing her hand onto hers.

           EXT.  ON THE RIDGE - DAY

           Garcia watches the village and the look-outs.  A faint music 
           travels through the air.  Pearce is on the radio.

                                 PEARCE
                        No, you've got to wait...  Over...

                                 WALGREN (O.S.)
                        If you identify him, we can send in 
                        choppers and pick him up.  Over...

                                 PEARCE
                        That's crazy.  The village is full of 
                        women and children.  No attack.  
                        That's that, Walgren.  Over and out.

           He rolls over next to Garcia.

                                 PEARCE (CONT'D)
                        Fucking nuts.

           Garcia snorts.

                                 GARCIA
                        Big Army people, you know what they're 
                        like.

           Pearce nods.  He relaxes.

                                 PEARCE
                        They come out here for six months max, 
                        don't bother to learn the language or 
                        figure out how things work.  They just 
                        want to do their big operation and go 
                        home with the trophy.  Then it's us 
                        who have to clean up after their mess.

                                 DE LILLO
                        And women are the worst!

           A moment of camaraderie between the men as they lie there.
                                 GARCIA
                        Anyway.  Two months more and De 
                        Lillo and I are headed home.

                                 DE LILLO
                        Pizza on East Fifth.  Heaven.

           Pearce is quiet.

                                 GARCIA
                        You headed home too, Captain?

                                 PEARCE 
                        Nope.  I’m staying on.  Enjoying 
                        the Wild West.

           Garcia nods, humouring him.  Pearce peers through his 
           binoculars.  Garcia rolls his eyes to De Lillo and Morrison:  
           Pearce is more Afghan than American sometimes.

           INT.  MALIK'S HOUSE - DAY

           Zaphira wears her wedding dress.  Someone draws the veil over 
           her face so that she's covered.

           The final moment has come.

           The Imam walks into the room.  He formally asks her three times 
           whether she wants to take Mansur as her husband.

           Zaphira answers with an inaudible yes.

           EXT.  ON THE RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           As seen though the binoculars:

           The Imam walks outside.  A crowd has gathered around the groom.  
           Mansur, in his white dress and a turban, waits for the ritual to 
           be repeated.

           The Imam repeats his three questions and the men cheer.  
           Mansur's face doesn't betray any emotion.

           Garcia and Pearce both watch through binoculars.  De Lillo and 
           Morrison squat behind them with equipment.

                                 GARCIA
                        What’s with all the hugging?  No 
                        women?  No bride?

                                 PEARCE
                        That's the way it works.  The groom 
                        and the bride are kept apart through 
                        the ceremony.
           Pearce's binoculars moves around, searching, sharpening focus.  
           They frame one man, seen from the back.

           The man turns around.  Dark shades, black turban.  Malik.

                                 PEARCE (CONT'D)
                        There he is!  The tall one in 
                        fatigues, shades.  See him?

                                 GARCIA
                        That’s him?

                                 PEARCE 
                        That's Malik Azam.  We're on!

                                 GARCIA
                        Where’s Abdur?

           Pearce nervously scans with his binoculars.

                                 PEARCE
                        Got him!

           As seen through the lens:  Abdur in the midst of the crowd, 
           keeping his eyes on Malik.

                                 PEARCE (CONT'D)
                             (turns behind him)
                        Hey, De Lillo!  Check if we've got a 
                        signal!

           De Lillo checks the receiver connected to a small portable 
           screen.

                                 DE LILLO
                        Still dead.

                                 GARCIA
                             (checks his watch)
                        What’s he waiting for?

                                 PEARCE
                        It's okay.  He's doing the right 
                        thing.  He doesn't need to place the 
                        bug too early.

           Garcia shrugs, slightly sceptical.  He doesn't trust Abdur as 
           much as his captain.

                                 PEARCE (CONT'D)
                        He's doing fine.  It's going to work.
           EXT.  MALIK'S COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS

           Abdur keeps a close watch on Malik's movements.

           Malik and his sons gather around the entrance of their house.  
           It is now time to pick up Zaphira and lead her to the groom's 
           house.

           Women gather in the doorway in preparation for Zaphira's 
           departure from the house.  Abdur cannot bear it and seizes his 
           moment to sneak away.

           Just before entering his house, Malik turns around.  He frowns 
           as he sees Abdur scuttling away from the crowd.

           INT.  MALIK'S COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS

           Zaphira, veiled, sits in her father's house, clutching a Quran 
           in her hands.

           Her male kinsmen, led by Malik, walk into the room.  They lift 
           her and put her on the dolie, the wedding palanquin.

           They carry her out.  Women weep their last tears.

           The scene ressembles a funeral.  The dolie, a coffin.

           EXT.  VILLAGE STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           Forceful warlike DRUMMING greets the dolie outside the Khan's 
           house.

           The palanquin bearing the bride is carried through the streets 
           in a public parade to the groom's house.

           The younger brothers carry Zaphira's possessions behind the 
           palanquin:  quilts, pillows, clothes and utensils.  Everything 
           that she's bringing to the marriage.

           INT.  THE HUJIRA - DAY

           Abdur stoops under the low door into the hujira.  The room is 
           empty.  The bags of Malik's men and some of their guns are 
           scattered around the room.

           EXT.  MANSUR'S COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS

           Bashir and his sons wait for the palanquin outside their 
           compound.  They receive the dolie from Zaphira's kinsmen and 
           carry it inside.

           Bashir and Malik exchange a glance as the girl changes hands.
           The men from Mansur's family lift her out of the dolie and bring 
           her inside the room.  They place her on the cot next to her 
           husband.

           Zaphira and Mansur sit side by side, not looking at each other 
           in any way.

           INT.  THE HUJIRA - CONTINUOUS

           Abdur scours the room, inspecting the men's weapons, bags, their 
           pattus and blankets.

           He finds what he he's been looking for:  Malik's bag.  Next to 
           it, the Chief's embroidered pattu.

           Abdur hesitates a second, then examines the shawl.  He manages 
           to slip the microchip inside behind the label.

           FOOTSTEPS on the wooden staircase.  Abdur drops the pattu as 
           Malik appears.

                                 MALIK
                        There you are.

           Abdur manages an awkward smile.

                                 ABDUR
                        I was looking for a gun.  I wanted to 
                        be ready for the final blessing.

                                 MALIK
                        That's what I came for.  There's no 
                        hurry.  It'll be a while yet.  Sit 
                        down, let's talk.

           Abdur sits, not knowing what to expect.

           EXT.  OUTSIDE MANSUR'S COMPOUND - DAY

           The rest of the village has gathered outside the groom's house, 
           around the two empty chairs where the newly-weds will sit for 
           the final blessing.

           DRUMMING is frenzied.  Everyone is excited.

           INT.  THE HUJIRA - CONTINUOUS

           Malik and Abdur sit alone.

                                 MALIK
                        I've thought about what happened and I 
                        want to give you another chance.  You 
                        were young and I was maybe too harsh.  
                        You've got contact with the enemy.
                                 ABDUR
                        Very rarely.  Only when they come 
                        round the bazaar.

                                 MALIK
                        I know.  But we may be able to get you 
                        into their base.  You could do 
                        something for us.

           Abdur's eyes are lowered.  He's on the verge of cracking.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        What's wrong?  You look hesitant.

           Abdur lifts his head, his voice steady.

                                 ABDUR
                        No, Malik Azam.  Just surprised.

           From outside, the sound of DRUMMING and the CHEERING of the 
           crowd.

                                 MALIK
                        They're coming out.  We'll talk later.

           Malik grabs his gun.  Points at his bag and pattu.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        Give them to me.

           Abdur grabs the bag and hands it to him.  Then the pattu.  Malik 
           smoothes it out with his hands, throws it around himself.

           INT.  MANSUR'S COMPOUND - DAY

           Zaphira and Mansur come out of the house gate, side by side.  
           Husband and wife.  CHEERS.

           They slowly proceed through the crowd and take a seat on the 
           chairs.  The DRUMMING and the MUSIC reaches a frenzy now.

           Abdur stares at Zaphira from the back of the crowd.

           Mansur's oldest sister drapes a blanket over the newly-married 
           couple and holds a mirror in front of them.

           The mullah holds the Quran over their heads and reads a 
           blessing.

           Zaphira lifts her veil and stares into the mirror.  She meets 
           Mansur's eyes.  They look at each other through the mirror.  
           Zaphira is impassive but Mansur's face lights up in delight.

           Abdur sees Mansur's joy.
           EXT.  ON THE RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Pearce and Garcia watch through binoculars.

           Through the lens: men are passing guns to one another.  As if 
           frantically getting ready for something.

           The lens finds Abdur.  Malik has summoned him forward.  Abdur is 
           now by him, holding a gun.  They're talking, Malik smiling at 
           him, Abdur nodding.

                                 PEARCE
                        Hey!  De Lillo, check that signal 
                        again!

           The men scramble up.  De Lillo opens the GPS receiver and taps 
           on the keypads.

                                 PEARCE (CONT'D)
                        He must have him now.

           They crowd around the screen, crouching on their heels.  
           Nothing.

                                 DE LILLO
                        Dead, sir.

                                 GARCIA
                        Could he be double-crossing us, 
                        sir?

           Pearce pats his pocket and pulls out a cigarette.  He doesn't 
           answer, fearing the worst.

                                 PEARCE
                        Keep checking.

           He walks away again, next to the stacked equipment, picks up his 
           binoculars again.  Garcia makes a face.  Pearce comes back, he 
           looks tense.  He hands a small radio to Garcia.

                                 PEARCE (CONT'D)
                        Garcia and Morrison, walk along that 
                        ridge all the way to that round rock 
                        and keep an eye on those sentries.  
                        Radio in if you see any movement.  Be 
                        careful not to leave any trace.  They 
                        mustn't know we were here, okay?

           Garcia and Morrison scuttle down.  De Lillo watches Pearce 
           sceptically.  Pearce puffs on a cigarette, cursing under his 
           breath.
           A faint pulse on the screen comes alive.  It begins to move, its 
           beep gaining strength.

                                 DE LILLO
                             (hushed)
                        Yeaaahh!  Captain!  Awesome.

           Pearce runs to the screen.  Relieved, ecstatic.

                                 PEARCE
                        I knew it.  I knew it, see?!

           De Lillo cheers silently at the screen.

           EXT.  MANSUR'S COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS

           The same feeling of excitement and cheering among the men in the 
           village.

           They gather around the newly-weds and brandish guns, waving them 
           in the air in readiness for Malik's signal to fire.

           Abdur is preparing his gun when Malik hands him his own rifle.  
           It's the British rifle that Abdur won from Stewart.

                                 MALIK
                        This gun has been in our village for 
                        over a hundred years.  Only Khans are 
                        allowed to use it.
                             (laughs)
                        Come on, don't worry, I'm giving you 
                        permission!

           Abdur takes the gun.  He looks into the Khan's eyes.  This time 
           Abdur's smile is sincere.

                                 ABDUR
                        This is a great honour.

                                 MALIK
                        We'll be leaving straight after the 
                        wedding.  Go back to Kabul and wait.  
                        I'll send a message.

           Mansur looks at the crowd.  He notices Abdur and Malik talking 
           together.  Malik hugging and kissing Abdur.

           Mansur and Abdur look at each other.  A broad smile on Abdur's 
           face.  A quick gesture and nod to let Mansur know that 
           everything has been resolved.

           Malik nods at Abdur, giving him permission to shoot the first 
           shot.  Abdur fires into the air.
           He continues, three, four times, increasingly exhilarated, 
           waving his arm and SHOUTING in the name of Allah.  The other men 
           FIRE too.

           As Abdur continues, he meets the gaze of his clan:  Razaq, 
           Malik, Mansur, his brothers, the rest of the men.  Everyone 
           SHOOTING, SHOUTING.  Proud warriors.

           Something deep inside Abdur, finally released.

           He watches Mansur and Zaphira, elated for his old friend’s 
           happiness.  All recrimination and regret dissolved away.  
           They grin at each other.  Even Zaphira smiles to see Abdur 
           back at the hub of the village’s life.

           Abdur fires, moving in unison with the inner rhythm of the 
           village.  He knows that he's part of its indestructible weave.  
           This is where he belongs, who he is.

           A faint BEEP insinuates itself over the soundtrack.

           It's the insistent signal emanating from the pattu that Malik 
           wears around his shoulders.

           EXT.  ON THE RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           The same BEEPING sound, now a pulsating dot, moves around the 
           screen.  De Lillo and Pearce crouch in front of the receiver 
           screen.

                                 PEARCE
                             (about microchip)
                        The little beauty.

           Faint GUNSHOTS from the distance.  They listen.

                                 DE LILLO
                             (alarmed)
                        What the fuck's that?

                                 PEARCE
                             (undisturbed)
                        They shoot at weddings.  To celebrate 
                        the happy couple.  Nothing to worry 
                        about.  Relax.  They eat a whole flock 
                        of sheep now.
                             (getting up)
                        Which reminds me...  How about some 
                        lunch?

           De Lillo grins.  He walks up a  few steps where their rucksacks 
           lie behind a rock.  He pulls out a couple of MRE.
                                 DE LILLO
                             (shouting)
                        Beef teryaki or pork chop?

           No answer.  He walks back to the screen.  Pearce has gone off a 
           little way and is taking a pee.  The sun is getting warmer. De 
           Lillo takes off his vest and rips the MRE with his teeth.

           A gust of wind and the wrapping flies away.

                                 DE LILLO (CONT'D)
                        Damn it!

           EXT.  BELOW THE RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           A couple of miles away, Garcia scans the opposite side of the 
           gorge from behind a rock.  Morrison lies behind him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           As seen through Garcia's binoculars:  two of Malik's men pace up 
           and down on the opposite side, keeping watch.

           Suddenly the sentries raise their guns and fire, joining the 
           festive shots of the village.  But from Garcia's POV, it looks 
           as though the men are pointing their guns at him.

                                 GARCIA
                        Shit!  They’re firing at us.

           Morrison jerks up, in panic.

                                 MORRISON
                        Goddamit!  Get on the radio.  Fast!

           Garcia pulls out the radio.

                                 GARCIA
                             (panicky)
                        Captain, Garcia here, do you read?

           EXT.  ON THE RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Garcia's voice crackles on the radio clipped inside the pocket 
           of De Lillo's which lies on the ground.

           In the background:  De Lillo scrambling down the slope, after 
           the plastic wrap.  Pearce in the distance, zipping up his pants, 
           turning back.
                                 GARCIA (O.S.)
                        They’re shooting in our direction.  
                        Captain!  Do you read?  Over...

           EXT.  BELOW THE RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Garcia, cursing under his breath, decides to switch channel.

                                 GARCIA
                        Cobra one, Cobra three.  Can you 
                        read me?  An emergency here...

           Walgren's voice comes on.

                                 WALGREN (O.S.)
                             (panicking)
                        Cobra three, Cobra two!  What's 
                        happening?

                                 GARCIA
                        Cobra two, Cobra three, we’re not 
                        sure but they seem to be shooting 
                        at us, over...

                                 WALGREN 
                        Are you under attack, over?

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

           The BEEP keeps sounding over the scene.

           More shooting and cheering at the wedding party.

           Smiling faces.  Women throw flower petals over the heads of the 
           newly-weds.

           Zaphira looks out at the crowd.  Sees Abdur for the first time.  
           Their eyes meet for a second.  Then Mansur leans in towards her, 
           taking her attention.

           Abdur looks at Malik's pattu.  He absorbs the enormity of his 
           betrayal.  The burden of his treachery now odious to him.

           He looks up at Pearce's ridge.

           The signal gains strength on the soundtrack.

           EXT.  ON THE RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Pearce returns over the rocks.  He is relaxed, pleased with how 
           things are going.
           Suddenly Pearce hears the radio crackling from the vest.  It's 
           Walgren.

           Pearce leaps to recover the radio, concerned at Walgren's panic.

                                 WALGREN (O.S.) 
                        Cobra one, Cobra two!  Back up is on 
                        the way!  Bravo three, do you read 
                        me?!

           Pearce tries to explain but is drowned out as:

           Two F16 planes SCREAM overhead.  A deafening sound that seems to 
           come from nowhere and everywhere at once.

           Panic on Pearce's face.  De Lillo, just coming up with the 
           plastic wrap in his hand, looks up, stunned.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

           The CHEERING men freeze, the dancing and SINGING women fall 
           silent, heads turned up to the sky.

           The noise of the engines growing to a SCREAM that makes the 
           ground tremble.

           Everyone scatters, seeking shelter.

           Abdur stands, frozen, stares at the ridge.

           EXT.  ON THE RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Garcia and Morrison scramble back up onto the ridge, panic on 
           their faces, guns cocked.

           Pearce screams into the radio.

                                 PEARCE
                        No, no!  Please, no...!

           Walgren's frantic.  Her voice mixed with another's, the PILOT's.  
           Confusion.  No-one can hear what the other's saying.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

           The jets pull up steeply, dropping nothing.  As they ROAR 
           upwards in an almost vertical climb, their wings flash in the 
           last of the sunlight.  They disappear over the ridge.

                                                       CUT TO:
           The village looks deserted.  Only two fallen chairs outside the 
           groom's compound, the remains of the banquet and abandoned 
           musical instruments.  A woman's thin veil flies across the dusty 
           square.

           Men slowly re-emerge from where they were seeking shelter.  A 
           false alarm.

           More men come out from the cave.  Timidly, women follow, 
           clutching children to their chests.

           Abdur, behind a wall, pulls out his walkie-talkie.

           He peers round the wall, sees the newly-weds taking their seats 
           once again, men gathering around them.

           Slowly the celebration recomposes itself and MUSIC tentatively 
           resumes.

           Abdur switches on the walkie-talkie, just as:

           The F16s SCREAM over his head, tearing the sky.

           The first one comes down.  One monstrous beat of DEAFENING 
           SOUND.

           EXT.  ON THE RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Pearce SHOUTS, appalled.

           The planes bank and swoop again, glinting like deadly silver, 
           their shining bellies hurtling low over the ridge.

           Scattering clusters of magnesium flares that trail from their 
           bellies like comets.

                                 PEARCE 
                        Noooo!

           He and the other men, speechless, watch the incandescence of the 
           FLASH.  The village below BURSTING INTO ORANGE FLAME.  It 
           happens in a second.

           The planes roar and dive beyond the village.  They're gone 
           again.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Abdur runs towards the square, SCREAMING.

           He gestures at the opposite side of the valley, towards Pearce, 
           as if to curse him.
           He slows and walks through the wreckage like a dazed visitor 
           from another planet.  It's a massacre.

           Bodies on the ground, homes burning, WAILS.  A child SCREAMING 
           next to the dead body of his mother.  Blood and flower petals 
           stain the ground in crimson.

           Abdur looks up at the ridge as he walks.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Pearce watches Abdur through binoculars.  Their eyes meeting 
           through the lens.  Abdur's eyes raging.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The compound where the wedding was taking place only minutes ago 
           is a mound of rubble.  The fine dust from the ruins is settling, 
           covering everything in a fine powder.

           Malik squats on the ground, holding Zaphira's dead body in his 
           arms.  Shirin HOWLS on her knees, hands upstretched to the sky.

           Razak is dead.  So is Abdur's young brother.  His hands still 
           clutch the bright yellow wrapper of the M & M'S.

           Abdur moves through the carnage, in disbelief.

           He reaches Malik and stares down at Zaphira's body.  Her wedding 
           dress is covered in blood.  Abdur takes in Mansur's corpse, face 
           down in the dust.

           Malik stares at Abdur, an infinite pain in his eyes.

                                 MALIK
                        My daughter...

           Her body is hugged to his chest.  Malik's eyes wander, alight on 
           Mansur's corpse.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        We must bury them...  Together...

           Abdur nods.  Malik becomes aware of the devastation around them.  
           Dazed, he looks up at the mountains.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        They knew...  Knew I was here...

           He looks at Abdur.  Abdur nods, consumed by self-loathing, 
           barely able to contain himself.  Malik nods to himself, making 
           his plan.
                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        They'll return...  I must leave...

           He starts to lay down Zaphira's body.  Abdur crouches down 
           quickly, as if to help, but keeping a respectful distance.

           Malik arranges Zaphira's body carefully, like a child on a bed.  
           Then he stands, staggering slightly.  Looks around, distracted, 
           then back at Abdur.

                                 MALIK (CONT'D)
                        Bury them, for me.

           Abdur nods, stricken.  Malik turns away.

                                 ABDUR
                        Malik Azam...

           Malik looks down at him.  Abdur stretches out a hand, indicating 
           Malik's pattu.

                                 ABDUR (CONT'D)
                        Let me cover her...

           Malik takes off his pattu and hands it to Abdur.  Abdur feels 
           the microchip in the palm of his hand, then drapes the pattu 
           over Zaphira's body like a shroud.  Malik nods at the rightness 
           of the gesture.

           Malik picks his way off, wandering through the carnage.  Abdur 
           watches him go, looks down in torment at Zaphira, then at the 
           blasted village.

           A gust of wind carries the yellow M & M'S wrapper like a 
           butterfly across the scene.  Miraculously intact, its bold 
           colour and print have survived the devastation.

           EXT.  ON THE RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Pearce, still in shock, sits on the ground by the radar screen.  
           The younger men, pale-faced, around him.

           The intermittent BEEP pulses slowly, like a faint heartbeat.  No 
           longer moving across the screen.  In one place now.  Pearce 
           hardly registers it.

           EXT.  THE VILLAGE - DUSK

           Abdur, kneeling, has drawn back the pattu from the two bodies.  
           He looks at their faces, first Zaphira's, then Mansur's.  He 
           covers them again and stands.  Their bodies lie together, like 
           lovers, asleep.  WIND ripples the cloth.
           Abdur reels away, gun in hand, slumps down on the wall of the 
           well.  His fingers absently play over his gun.  It's Stewart's 
           rifle.  The camera fixes on the gun.

           The camera pans down to the wall that Stewart built and begins a 
           journey.  Through the village we've come to know.  Past the 
           well, past the entrance to the caves.  Past the river where the 
           women washed before.  Ending at...

           The tree where they hung their burquas.  Only a single burqua 
           now hangs from the tree.  It flaps in the wind.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
