           EXT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA - DAY  

           A Saturn V rocket stands on the launchpad as numerous NASA 
           technicians prepare it for launch.

           CHYRON: KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, 1973

           INT. MISSION CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The room is bustling with activity as crew-cut, skinny tie-
           wearing TECHNICIANS prepare their stations for launch.  
           Overseeing the operation is MAJOR COLBY STAFFORD, 30's, the 
           clean-cut, hyper-competent mission chief.

                        We are T-minus fourteen minutes, 
                        Chief.  Go for launch.

                        Funny thing about that, Major.  
                        Either he's not there... or he's 
                        dead.

           EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

           MUSIC CUE: "Rubberband Man" by The Spinners

           COLONEL BUFF TAGGART, 30's, the most famous living American 
           astronaut, has just paddled his surfboard out to an imposing 
           20 foot wave.  

                                 BUFF
                        That looks about right.

           As the wave catches him, he mounts his board and rides it in 
           toward shore.  His eye is caught by something gleaming 
           underwater and he leaps from his board into the sea.  He 
           swims several meters down, grabs an oyster from a coral reef 
           and heads back to the surface.  

           EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           BONNIE SWANSON, late-20's, suns herself on a towel.  She is 
           the quintessential 70's TV star, complete with feathered 
           hair, savage tan and generous bosom.  

                                 BUFF (O.S.)
                        Got you another one, baby.

           Buff stands dripping over her.  He tosses a pearl onto a 
           small mound of pearls beside her towel.

                                 BONNIE
                        Oh, Buff.  All these pearls...

                                 BUFF
                        Let's make love.

                                 BONNIE 
                        Shouldn't you be at the launch?

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

                        Hmm.  I guess I should.  Colby 
                        hates when I'm late.

           He bends down and kisses Bonnie.  

                                 BONNIE
                        Be safe up there.

                                 BUFF
                        Honey, I'm just going to space.  
                        What could go wrong?

           He quickly towels off, then picks up a full NASA spacesuit 
           from the sand and steps into it.  

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Now in his spacesuit and holding his helmet, Buff climbs into 
           his gold 1973 Corvette Stingray and peels out.

           Pull back to reveal he is heading toward the nearby rocket.  
           Above him we see a large billboard showing Buff in the 
           driver's seat of a 1973 Corvette Stingray heading toward a 
           nearby rocket.  A caption reads "Corvette: the Car of 
           Astronauts!"

           EXT. STREET - MINUTES LATER

           Buff screeches to a stop at a red light.  A KID in the car 
           next to him does a double-take as he stares at Buff.

                                 KID
                        Buff Taggart!

                                 BUFF
                        That's right, son.

                                 KID
                        You going to the moon, Buff?

                                 BUFF
                        Not this time.  Now, you listen to 
                        your mom and behave.

                                 KID
                        I will, Buff.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

           As the light changes and Buff zooms off, he tosses something 
           to the boy.  It's a pearl.

                                 KID (CONT'D)
                        Gee, thanks!

           The Kid looks at his MOM, confused.  She shrugs.

           EXT. LAUNCHPAD - MOMENTS LATER

           Buff pulls up to the base of the rocket and is immediately 
           surrounded by NASA TECHNICIANS.  He steps out of his car and 
           heads for the elevator leading up to the command module of 
           the rocket.

           INT. MISSION CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Colby watches Buff in the elevator on a monitor. 

                                 COLBY
                               (into his microphone)
                        Cutting it a little close, there, 
                        aren't you Buff?

                                 BUFF
                               (through speakers)
                        Not as bad as on Apollo 16.

           Colby shakes his head, amused in spite of himself.

                                 COLBY
                        Yeah.  You endangered a lot of 
                        lives on that one.

                                 BUFF
                               (jokingly)
                        Talk to my attorney.

                                 COLBY

           The door is shut behind him and Buff moves to take his seat.  

           SFX: A tearing sound

           Buff looks down to see the sleeve of his suit has caught in 
           the door and torn a small hole.

                                 COLBY (O.S.)

                        Uh... roger that.  Just prepping 
                        the cabin for launch.

           He latches his seat harness, then pulls out a tiny photograph 
           from a pocket of his suit.  He kisses it, then places it 
           tenderly above his seat.

           REVERSE ANGLE: We see the photo is of Buff

                        low.  Dangerously low.  Pretty much

           In the cockpit, Buff is holding a cocktail shaker.  The 
           vibrating of the rocket mixes his martini for him.

                        Okay.  Well, let us know.

           Buff takes a martini glass from a compartment and pours 
           himself a nicely shaken cocktail, then plops an olive in.  He 
           removes his helmet and takes a sip.

                        G's.  Stable orbit achieved.  You 
                        can go ahead and remove your helmet 
                        at this time.

           Buff looks up at his helmet, floating above him.

                                 BUFF
                        Uh, roger that.  Let me just...
                               (grunts)
                        Unhook this...
                               (more grunts)
                        Taking off the old helmet... Whew, 
                        feels good getting that thing off.

                                 COLBY
                        Okay.  You can start your zero grav 
                        experiments whenever you're ready.

                                 BUFF
                        Roger that.

           Buff empties a bag containing a stopwatch, a cage of mice and 
           a hammer.  

                                                            CUT TO:

           The command module orbits high above the Earth.

           Buff straps himself into his chair, preparing for sleep.

           INTERCUT with Mission Control where it is the night shift.  
           Colby sits at his station drinking a cup of coffee.

                                 COLBY
                        Okay, Buff.  Great work today.  
                        That mouse-hammer study is really 
                        going to make a difference down 
                        here in a lot of people's lives.

                                 BUFF
                        Thanks, Chief.  

           Colby gazes thoughtfully at the video feed of Buff on his 
           monitor.

           Leaning into the mic, Colby sings.  His voice is surprisingly 
           beautiful.

                        remember who to send it to...

           Buff smiles contentedly and shuts his eyes.

           Tech 1 and Tech 2 exchange a look and join in singing backing 
           vocals on their own mics.

           Buff's eyes open as the entire craft shudders.  An alarm goes 
           off.

           Buff looks out a porthole and sees a small satellite with a 
           TARANTULA EMBLEM spinning off into space.  A stream of gas 
           vents from his module.

                        oxygen gauge.

           Buff floats over to a control panel.

           CLOSE ON an oxygen gauge.  The needle is moving slowly 
           downward.

                        we're going to need you to do an 
                        unscheduled EVA.

           Buff is already putting on his spacesuit.  As he puts his arm

           Buff grabs a crescent wrench.  He then takes a deep breath, 
           lets it out, shuts his eyes, clenches up and pushes the 
           depressurization button.

           Gripping a handle outside the capsule, Buff works his way

                        Buff!  You did it!

                                 BUFF
                        Why do you sound so surprised?

           Buff turns to the camera revealing that both his eyes have 
           bugged out grotesquely.  One seems to be hanging on by the 
           optic nerve.  The NASA Techs abruptly stop clapping.  

                                 COLBY
                        Oh, sweet Jesus.

                                 BUFF
                        What's that?

                                 COLBY
                        Uh, you look great, Buff.  
                        Congratulations.
                               (quietly to the room)
                        Keep clapping.

           INT. BANQUET HALL - CONTINUOUS

           A large AUDIENCE applauds as Vice President SPIRO AGNEW moves 
           to the dais.  Buff, now in a double-knit polyester leisure 
           suit, sits beside Bonnie on the stage.  Colby sits a short 
           distance away.

                                 AGNEW
                        Thank you.  Tonight we honor a true 
                        American hero.  A man who laughs in 
                        the face of fear.  A man who has 
                        been to the moon more times than 
                        any other human.  And he was good 
                        enough to come back down and tell 
                        us what he saw up there.  

                                 BUFF
                        A lot of rocks, Mr. Vice President.  
                        A lot of rocks.

           The crowd busts out laughing.

                        Now, I understand our friends at 
                        NASA have prepared a kind of 
                        highlight reel of Colonel Buff

                        Buff was born in 1943 in the 
                        heartland of America to Jack and 
                        Greta Taggart.  Jack Taggart had 
                        been a World War I flyboy...

           We see a young Jack Taggart standing beside a bi-plane.

                        ...while Greta stayed at home, 
                        growing badly needed corn for the 
                        war effort.

           In a series of photos, Greta squats beside an ear of corn.  
           As it grows larger and larger, she stays in the same 
           position.  

                                 WILLIAM SHATNER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        In 1951, when Buff was only eight, 
                        tragedy struck the Taggart farm.  A 
                        powerful tornado took the life of 
                        his father.  Then, one year later, 
                        the same tornado killed his mother.

           We see a photo of Jack running from a massive tornado.  Then 
           one of Greta running from a tornado which now has a skeleton 
           inside it.

                                 WILLIAM SHATNER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        A devastated Buff was sent to a 
                        government home for wayward boys, 
                        where he developed a fascination 
                        with the heavenly bodies that 
                        floated above his squalid quarters.  

           Ten year old Buff lies on the roof of an orphanage staring up 
           at the night sky.

                                 WILLIAM SHATNER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Five years later, at the age of 
                        fifteen, Buff lied about his age in 
                        order to enlist in the US Air Force 
                        like his father before him.

           We see fifteen year old Buff, wearing a fake beard, standing 
           beside several taller, older pilots and their planes.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

                        Thanks to his fearlessness and 
                        outstanding flying skill, Buff 
                        quickly rose to the top of his 
                        squadron.  And when the conflict in 
                        Vietnam broke out, it was Buff who 
                        led his fellow flyers into combat.

           Twenty-something Buff sits in the cockpit of an F-4 Phantom 
           fighter plane, giving a thumbs-up.

                        After winning the war, Buff 
                        returned stateside.  That's when 
                        NASA came calling.  They were 
                        looking for a few brave men to join 
                        in the race to space.

           On screen we see photos of Buff in his spacesuit, planting a 
           flag on the moon.  Then another, driving a lunar rover.

                        In Apollo missions twelve through 
                        seventeen, Buff became the first 
                        man to drive the lunar rover, the 
                        first man to throw a javelin on the 
                        moon...

           We see Buff in his spacesuit hurling a javelin.

                                 WILLIAM SHATNER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...the first to fire a gun...

           Buff fires a pistol at a beer can on a pile of rocks in the 
           distance.

                        Israel.

           Buff, wearing a yarmulke on top of his space helmet, plants a 
           sapling on the moon.

                        Never satisfied to rest on his 
                        laurels, Buff Taggart continues to 
                        break records.  Leaving behind his 
                        lover, Bonnie Swanson, star of the 
                        top rated television drama, "Lady 
                        Soldier..."

           On screen we see a clip of Bonnie in "Lady Soldier."  She

           rifle at unseen foes.  Her breasts shake violently.

                        ...Buff keeps venturing out into 
                        the unknown.  For that is what 
                        makes a man a hero.  And a hero a 
                        legend.  

           On screen, Buff stands beside an American flag on the moon.  
           At the edge of the photo we see two other astronauts looking 
           resentfully at Buff, hogging the spotlight.

           The crowd rises in a standing ovation as the vice president 
           shakes Buff's hand.  Colby embraces Buff.  Finally, Bonnie 
           gives Buff an inappropriately deep kiss.

                                 BONNIE
                        The vice president himself came all 
                        this way to honor you.

                                 BUFF
                        And how about that plaque?
                               (looks around)

                        No.  I thought you took it.

                        I didn't take it.  Oh no.  We 
                        forgot the plaque.

                                 BONNIE
                        Do you want to go back for it?

                        Was that a piece of moon rock in

                        Damn.  That was an expensive 
                        plaque.

                                 BONNIE
                        We can go back and get it, Buff.

                                 BUFF
                        Nah.  It's late.  No biggie.

                                 BONNIE
                        Are you sure?

                                 BUFF
                        Positive.

           A long beat.  Bonnie looks at Buff.

                                 BONNIE

           EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           The car does a U-turn then stops at a stoplight.  A teenage 
           KID in a 1970 Mercury Cyclone pulls up beside Buff.  The Kid 
           notices Buff, then says something to his companion, a FAT 
           TEEN.  Both boys laugh.  Buff nods to them, uncertainly.

                        You probably don't want me to use a

                                 KID
                        I bet you're too scared to even 
                        race me, spaceman.

                                 BUFF
                        Are you kidding?  I've pulled 
                        twelve G's on reentry.

                                 KID
                        Was that before or after you had 
                        sex with a man?

                                 BUFF
                        Okay.  That's it.  I'll race you to 
                        the Fontainebleau Hotel on Collins 
                        Avenue.  I have to pick up a 
                        plaque.

                                 KID
                        You're on.

                                 BUFF
                               (to Bonnie)
                        I'll pick you up here in a few 
                        minutes.  

                                 BONNIE
                        What?!  You can't be serious.  
                        You're going to leave me out on the 
                        street so you can race some kid?
                               (then, gently)
                        Come on, lover.  You don't need to 
                        prove anything to him.  Just as 
                        long as you believe in yourself.

           Buff looks at her for a beat.

           EXT. ROAD - SECONDS LATER

           Bonnie stands on the side of the road in her elegant evening 
           dress.  The Fat Teen stands beside her.  Buff and the Kid's 
           cars peel out in a puff of burning rubber.

                                 FAT TEEN
                        I love you in "Lady Soldier."

           EXT. ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

           Buff and the Kid zoom down the street, neck and neck.  Buff 
           rolls down his window and calls out to the Kid.

                                 BUFF
                               (yelling over the wind)
                        You need to learn some respect!  
                        And I'm the one who's going to 
                        teach you that respect!

                                 KID
                               (yelling)
                        What?

                                 BUFF
                        I said, you need to learn--

           Buff suddenly spots a possum crossing the road ahead.  His 
           eyes go wide as he swerves to avoid it.  The car slams into a 
           large wooden pole, demolishing the vehicle.  Buff flies 
           through the front windshield and lands on his back, badly 
           injured.

                                 BUFF (CONT’D)
                               (barely conscious)
                        --some respect...

           Buff looks above him and sees the pole he hit was holding up 
           the Corvette Stingray billboard we saw earlier.  The entire 
           thing collapses and falls directly on top of him.  All that's 
           left is Buff's smiling face on the advertisement and the 
           slogan "Corvette: the Car of Astronauts!"

                                 COLBY
                        He's critical.  He lost an arm, an

                        I need to speak to him.

           The door swings open and Oscar enters to find Buff sedated on 
           the operating table.  He is missing his legs, an arm, and has 
           bandages over one eye and his nose.

                                 OSCAR
                        Buff?  Can you hear me?

                        I know.  I'm sorry about that.  
                        You've been in a terrible accident.

                                 BUFF
                        I can't smell.

                                 OSCAR
                        You've lost your nose.

                        I don't like this.

                                 OSCAR
                        Look, Colonel, the government of 
                        this country considers you an 
                        invaluable asset.  And we do not 
                        intend to lose that asset.  We have 
                        the ability to repair you if you'll 
                        agree to undergo an experimental

                                 BUFF
                        What sort of procedure?

                                 OSCAR
                        We call them bionics.  We've never 
                        used them on a human before, but 
                        we've been given an unprecedented 
                        forty thousand dollars to spend on 
                        you, Colonel Taggart.

                        Forty thousand dollars!  That's an 
                        insane amount of money.

                        You're worth it to us, Buff.  And 
                        if you say yes, you'll be the first 
                        bionic man.

                                 OSCAR
                        They're super-strong replacement 
                        parts.  We've had great success in 
                        animal trials.  Our bionic rat was 
                        able to lift three hundred pounds 
                        with one paw.

                                 BUFF
                        That's amazing.

                                 OSCAR
                        Well, that's in rat pounds, of 
                        course.  But still--

                                 BUFF
                        What are they made of?

                                 OSCAR
                        High grade steel and wrought iron.

                                 BUFF
                        Steel and iron...

           Buff moves to extend his arm, but there's only a bandaged 
           stump.  Oscar uncertainly shakes the stump.  Buff recoils in 
           pain as the bandage starts to turn red.

           SURGERY MONTAGE

           INT. SURGERY - LATER

           A team of DOCTORS perform extreme surgery on Buff.  We see 
           one doctor open a steel case and remove a bionic arm.  He 
           hands it to another doctor.

                        rebuild him.  We have the 
                        technology.

           A doctor carefully inserts a bionic eye into Buff's partially 
           opened skull.

                        We have the capability to make the 
                        world's first bionic man.  

           Two doctors attach bionic legs to Buff's pelvis.

                        Buff Taggart will be that man.  
                        Better than he was before.  Better, 
                        stronger, faster.

           A doctor cleans the nostrils of a flesh-toned bionic nose 
           with a Q-tip, then attaches it to Buff's face.  They step 
           back from their patient and shake hands with one another as

                        It'll be some time before you begin 
                        to feel like yourself again.

                                 BUFF
                               (glancing down)
                        Are these the bionics?

                                 OSCAR
                        Yes.  Your legs, your right arm, 
                        your right eye and your nose have 
                        all been... upgraded.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

           Bonnie gently pulls Oscar aside.

                                 BONNIE
                        Mr. Goldman, I know it's the least 
                        of his worries right now, but I'm 
                        wondering, will everything work 
                        properly... down there?

                                 OSCAR
                        Miss Swanson, on that front you 
                        have nothing to worry about.  Buff 
                        is every bit the man he was before 
                        the accident.  Except that his 
                        penis probably won't work anymore. 

                                 BUFF (O.C.)
                        So thirsty.

           Oscar returns to Buff.  Bonnie, looking disturbed, joins him.

                                 OSCAR
                        There's a glass of juice on the 
                        table in front of you, Buff.  Why 
                        don't you see if you can reach for 
                        it?

           Buff reaches for the glass with his good arm.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        No, with your bionic arm.

           Buff slowly extends his bionic right arm toward the glass.  

           SFX:  Bionic sound effect

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        Good, good...

           Buff grasps the glass and immediately shatters it in his 
           hand.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        Okay.  That's to be expected.  
                        Luther, could we have another glass 
                        of juice, please?

           Luther fills a new glass with juice and sets it on the table.  

                                 BUFF
                        I don't know, Oscar--

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                 OSCAR
                        Just try again, Buff.

           Buff again reaches for the glass.  This time he does not 
           break it.  But he hurls it against the wall, shattering it.

                                 BUFF
                        Damn it!

                                 OSCAR
                        Not a problem.  
                               (to Luther)
                        Little more juice?

           Luther fills a new glass and sets it down.  Buff immediately 
           bats it off the table.

                                 BUFF
                        This is ridiculous!

                                 OSCAR
                        You're getting the hang of it.
                               (to Luther)
                        Juice.

           Luther fills another glass but before he can set it down, 
           Buff punches him in the stomach, then hurls the juice glass 
           against the wall.  Bonnie rushes to Buff's side.

                                 BONNIE
                        Buff!

           Buff involuntarily cold cocks Bonnie, knocking her against 
           the wall.

                                 OSCAR
                        Oh dear.

                                 BUFF
                        Bonnie!

                                 BONNIE
                               (checking her nose for 
                                blood)
                        It's fine.  I'm okay.

                                 BUFF
                        I'm so sorry, baby.  It's this arm.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                 OSCAR
                               (to Luther)
                        Can we get another juice, please?

           The now resentful Luther pours another glass of juice, 
           nervously sets it down and backs away.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        Concentrate, Buff.  You can do 
                        this.

           Buff furrows his brow and slowly reaches for the glass.  This 
           time he picks it up, brings it to his mouth and drinks.  
           Bonnie watches raptly.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        Good.  Very good.

                                 BONNIE
                        You're doing it, honey.  You're 
                        doing it.

           Buff finishes the juice.  A beat.  He smashes the glass 
           against his own face then punches Bonnie again.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. RUNNING TRACK - DAYS LATER

           Buff, wearing an orange tracksuit unzipped to his chest hair, 
           sits in a wheelchair.  Oscar is with him.

                                 OSCAR
                        You've made great strides these 
                        last couple days, Buff.  Now it's 
                        time to see what those bionic legs 
                        of yours can do.

           Oscar extends his hand and Buff takes it, hoisting himself 
           out of the wheelchair.

                                 BUFF
                        It feels good to stand again.

                                 OSCAR
                        Imagine how it'll feel to run sixty 
                        miles an hour.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                 OSCAR
                        That's right.  Your bionic legs 
                        were designed to achieve a top 
                        speed of a mile a minute.

                                 BUFF
                        I thought you said sixty miles an 
                        hour.

                                 OSCAR
                        That comes out to a mile a minute.

                                 BUFF
                        I don't think so...

                        It does.  You need to trust me.

                                 BUFF
                               (still doubtful)

           A Technician raises a starter's pistol and fires.

           In SLOW MOTION:

           Buff starts to run down the track.  Oscar stands with Luther 
           who holds a stopwatch.  They grin as it appears Buff's legs 
           are working according to plan.  

           NORMAL SPEED:

           As the image returns to normal motion, we see Buff is not 
           actually running all that fast.

                                 OSCAR
                        How fast is he going, Luther?

                        Slightly faster than a normal man.  
                        Disappointing.

           Oscar picks up a megaphone and calls out to Buff.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)

                        You got it, Oscar.

           Buff waves and tries to slow down but he can't.  

           He continues to run quickly around the track, flailing his 
           arms, clearly not in control of his speed.

                                 LUTHER

                        Can anyone help me?!

           EXT. RUNNING TRACK - ONE HOUR LATER

           Buff cries softly as he continues involuntarily running 
           around the track.  

                                 BUFF

                        These legs are raping me.

           Oscar watches as a pickup truck with Technicians in the bed 
           drives alongside Buff.  Luther reaches out, trying to slow 
           Buff's pace.

                                 LUTHER
                        Almost got you...

           Just as he is about to grab hold of Buff, Buff's bionic arm 
           punches him, sending Luther flying off the pickup onto the 
           track.

                                 BUFF
                        Sorry, Luther!

           As Buff reaches a bend in the track, the truck continues 
           straight towards the cement wall, forcing Buff to go straight 
           as well.  The truck comes to a stop but Buff speeds towards 
           the wall.  

                                 BUFF (CONT’D)
                        Oh no.

           Bam!  Buff slams into the wall and goes down.  His bionic 
           legs continue to run as Buff lies face down, groaning.

           Oscar, watching from a distance, shakes his head with 
           disgust.

                        Okay.

           Buff closes his left eye while squinting with his right.

           From Buff's POV we see the eye chart.

           Suddenly, his view ZOOMS IN dramatically till we see nothing 
           but the black ink of the letters.

                                 BUFF (CONT’D)

                        Can you read the bottom line?

                        All I see is black.

                                 OSCAR
                        Black?  

           Buff looks over at Oscar.  From his POV we see an EXTREME 
           CLOSE-UP of Oscar's lips.  They flap open horribly, saliva 
           droplets clinging to the corner of his mouth as he speaks:

                        What do you mean black?

           Buff jumps back, startled.

                                 BUFF
                        Ahh!

                                 OSCAR
                        What is it?

                                 BUFF
                        I think my eye is overzooming.  

                                 OSCAR
                        Overzooming?

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                 BUFF
                        Everything's too close.  How do I 
                        pull back?

                                 OSCAR
                        Oh.  It only has two settings.  
                        Zoom.  And not zoom.

                                 BUFF
                        That doesn't seem very--

           Buff's POV: we zoom in on Oscar's forehead.  It's a sea of 
           pores and blackheads.

                                 BUFF (CONT’D)
                        Sweet mother!  Your skin, Oscar, 
                        it's... terrible.

                                 OSCAR
                        Stop it, Buff.  

                                 BUFF
                        I'm sorry, it's just--

           CLOSE ON tiny droplets of oil on Oscar's face.

                                 BUFF (CONT’D)
                        Uch!  It's so oily.

                                 OSCAR
                        It's perfectly normal to have a 
                        certain amount of oil on the 
                        skin...

                                 BUFF
                        Certain amount?  It's like the menu 
                        at a diner!

                                 OSCAR
                        Zoom out.  

                                 BUFF
                        It's like the seat of a taxi.

                                 OSCAR
                        I said zoom out.

           Buff does.  His view returns to normal.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

                        I don't get it, Oscar.  What good 
                        is an eye that can only see your 
                        horrible pores and greasy skin?

                                 OSCAR
                        We haven't ironed out all the kinks 
                        yet.
                               (then, testy)
                        Would you rather we had left that 
                        gaping hole you had when we found 
                        you?

                                 BUFF
                        No.

                                 OSCAR
                        All right then.  On to your bionic 
                        nose.  It's been designed to be a 
                        thousand times stronger than the 
                        normal nose.

                                 BUFF
                        I hope it's not as oily as the 
                        normal nose.

                                 OSCAR
                        That's enough!

           Oscar indicates a row of pedestals concealed by small 
           screens.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        Now, behind each of these screens 
                        is an item.  I want you to identify 
                        the items solely by their smell.

                                 BUFF
                        Okay...

           Oscar points to the first screen.

                                 OSCAR
                        Let's start with this one.  Can you 
                        smell what's behind it?

           Buff inhales deeply through his nose, focusing his attention 
           on the first screen.

                               (Buff scrunches his nose)
                        It's kinda earthy.  No, wait, 
                        funky.  Ugh.  It's feces.  You put 
                        poop on that pedestal?

                                 OSCAR
                        What?  No, of course not.

           Oscar lifts up the screen, revealing a lemon.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        It's a lemon.

                                 BUFF
                        Oh.

           Buff squints his eye.

                        Wow, that is one oily lemon.

                                 OSCAR
                        All right, try the next screen.  
                        Smell anything?

           Buff sniffs and nods.

                                 BUFF
                        Uh huh.  Definitely doodie.

                                 OSCAR
                        Buff, this is no time for 
                        horseplay.

                                 BUFF
                        I'm not kidding, Oscar.  All I 
                        smell behind that screen is poop.

           Oscar sighs and lifts the screen to reveal a single rose.

                                 OSCAR
                        You can't smell this rose?

                        smell of turd.  Actually...

           Buff wrinkles his nose and heads toward the doorway.

                                 BUFF (CONT’D)
                        It seems to be coming from outside.

           Buff exits into

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Buff makes his way down the hall, sniffing the air.  Oscar 
           follows.

                                 BUFF
                        Yup.  It's stronger out here.

                        I don't smell anything.

           Buff reaches the door to the men's room.

                                 BUFF
                        It's coming from in here.

           Buff opens the door and enters.

                                 OSCAR
                        Buff, wait.

           INT. MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Buff and Oscar step into the men's room.  Buff immediately 
           crosses over to one of the stalls.

                                 BUFF
                        This is it!  I'm sure of it.

           Buff grabs the handle and using his bionic arm, tears the 
           door off its hinges.  Inside Luther sits on the toilet, his 
           arm in a cast.

                        Well, the good news here is that 
                        your arm seems to be working.

                                 OSCAR
                        And your bionic nose is able to 
                        detect faint odors from a great 
                        distance.

                                 BUFF
                        But the only thing I can smell 
                        really well is shit.

                                 OSCAR
                        At least it's a starting point.

           They consider this for a beat.

                        Right./Sorry, Luther.

           They move away from the stall.

                        It's been two weeks since your 
                        accident.  How are you feeling?  

                                 BUFF
                        A lot better than when that sign 
                        fell on me.

                                 OSCAR
                        I can imagine.  And how are you 
                        adjusting to the bionics?

                                 BUFF
                        Well, it was hard at first.  But 
                        they're really starting to feel 
                        like a part of me.

           He gives Oscar a thumbs-up with his bionic arm.

                        I'm glad to hear it.

           Buff's thumbs-up remains up.  Buff glances at it nervously.  
           He obviously can't put it down.

           SFX:  Bionic sound effect continues over the following

                                 BUFF
                        So, am I ready to go home?  I sure 
                        do miss Bonnie.

                        That's actually what I wanted to 
                        speak to you about.

           Buff casually tries to pull down his right arm with his left.  
           It won't come down.

                                 BUFF

                        I'm great.

           He indicates the thumbs-up to emphasize his point.

                        The thing is, we didn't spend forty

                        just to save a dying astronaut...

           With his good hand, Buff grabs Oscar's nameplate off the desk 
           and tries to hammer down his frozen bionic arm with it.

                                 BUFF

           Buff grunts as he wrestles with his "thumbs-up" arm, finally 
           forcing it down, breaking off the chair's armrest in the 
           process.  He grins sheepishly.

                        agent who could carry out 
                        classified missions that no 
                        ordinary man could.

                                 BUFF
                        What sort of missions?

                        I'm glad you asked.

           Oscar presses a button on his desk.  The lights dim, and a 
           projection screen descends from the ceiling.

                                 BUFF
                        Neat.

           Oscar narrates the images we see on the screen.

                        For the last several years, our 
                        government has been tracking this 
                        man:  Luis Guzman.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

                        Guzman's company is the number one 
                        provider of disco balls and disco-
                        related paraphernalia in the world.  
                        OSI believes that this is merely a 
                        front.

                                 BUFF
                        For what?

                                 OSCAR
                        We raided one of Guzman's 
                        warehouses and found that each of 
                        his disco balls was packed with ten 
                        pounds of pure Columbian cocaine.

                                 BUFF
                        Why not arrest him?

                                 OSCAR
                        We've tried, but Guzman always gets 
                        wind of our plans.  Our hope is 
                        that by sending in one lone agent, 
                        we can capture him before he even 
                        realizes we're there.

                                 BUFF
                        And I'm that agent?

                                 OSCAR
                        If you think you're ready.

                                 BUFF
                        I know I'm ready.

           Buff gives a thumbs-up again with his right hand.  There's a 
           beat as he realizes.

           Bonnie stands at a phone cart, holding the phone in one hand 
           and a rocket launcher in the other.  She wears a sexy, 
           tattered soldier's uniform as a MAKEUP LADY powders her 
           cleavage.

                        What could be more important than 
                        being here with me?  I haven't seen

                        I know.  But Oscar asked me to do 
                        something for him.

                                 BONNIE
                        What?

                        Classified?  Is it something 
                        dangerous?

                                 BUFF
                        I really can't say.  All I can tell 
                        you is I have to capture Luis 
                        Guzman who's smuggling cocaine in 
                        disco balls.  And I don't even know 
                        if I can tell you that.

           Buff slowly makes his way down a hall, sniffing the air as he

                        Okay, okay, he's upstairs in the 
                        VIP area!  Owwwww!

           Buff looks toward the VIP area and squints his bionic eye.

           POV: Buff's view zooms in to where Guzman is sitting but once 
           again zooms too far.  All he can see is a close-up of 
           Guzman's nostril hair.  

                                 BUFF
                        Useless.

           Back to normal view.  Buff turns back to the Bartender.

                                 BUFF (CONT’D)
                        That wasn't so hard, was it?

           He moves to release the man's hand but instead keeps 
           squeezing harder.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Why are you doing this?!  You said 
                        it would be over!

                                 BUFF
                        I'm sorry.  I'm trying to let go 
                        now...

                                 BARTENDER
                        Oh sweet mother!  Someone please 
                        help me!

           Other disco patrons notice them.  The Bartender starts to 
           weep.

                                 BUFF
                        Gosh, this is embarrassing.  I am 
                        really doing some damage.

                                 BARTENDER
                        I don't want to live!

           Finally, Buff wrenches himself free leaving the Bartender 
           with a mangled hand.  A bone juts out from one knuckle.

                                 BUFF
                        Wow.  That is a bone.  I feel 
                        terrible. 

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

           Buff backs away and hurries up the stairs.

           INT. VIP AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           Buff enters to see a group of thuggish MEN and slutty GIRLS 
           lounging on sofas.  In the center of the group sits LUIS 
           GUZMAN.  

                                 OSCAR (V.O.)
                        Once you ID Guzman, you'll need to 
                        lure him outside where he can be 
                        apprehended.

           Everyone turns to look at Buff.

                                 BUFF
                        Hi.  How is everyone?  Stayin' 
                        cool?

                        My name is... Michelangelo.  Okay 
                        if I just...?

           He goes to join them on the sofa.

                                 LUIS
                        No, it's not okay.

                        Get him out of my room.

                                 BUFF
                        Wait.  I think you're going to want 
                        to hear what I have to say, Mr. 
                        Guzman.

                        How do you know my name?

                                 LUIS
                        I'm listening.

                        And be careful, Buff.  If Guzman 
                        suspects you're an agent, he won't

                        I'm talking about a joint venture-- 
                        is it hot in here?  I am parched.

           Buff goes to sip his drink but his hand shakes, sloshing some 
           of the liquid onto his legs.

                                 LUIS
                        Why are you so nervous?

                        come outside with me...

           Buff looks down and notices a puff of smoke rising from his 
           lap.  His legs appear to be shorting out.

                                 LUIS
                        What's happening to you?

                        happening to you?

           He tries to casually pat down his legs but the short circuit 
           only gets worse.

                                 BUFF (CONT’D)
                        So, do we have a deal?

                        I don't think that's--

           Buff's legs are now burning.  He tries to stay calm.

                                 LUIS
                        Your legs are on fire!

                        You know what these legs could use?  
                        Some fresh air.  Come on outside.

           Buff stands.  By now his pants are in tatters.  The fire 
           continues to burn.

                                 LUIS
                        Doesn't that hurt?

                        I'll tell you what would hurt.  You 
                        and I not going outside.  That 
                        would hurt.

                                 BODYGUARD
                        Mr. Guzman, look.

           The Bodyguard points to Buff's leg.  His pants have burned 
           away and the fake skin has seared off revealing a metal part 
           on which "Property of OSI, Made in China" is engraved.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

           Guzman's THUGS surround Buff and move toward him.

                        unpredictable at best.

           Three Thugs charge him.  Buff swings his bionic arm, knocking 
           them all across the room and over the railing.  They fall to 
           the dance floor below.  Other disco patrons scream.

           Buff turns to see Guzman making his escape.

                        Stop!

           Guzman bolts down the hall.  Buff, now in his underwear, 
           turns to chase him.  He fails to notice that his burning 
           pants have ignited a tablecloth.

           INT. STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

           Guzman rushes down the stairs with Buff in hot pursuit.  Buff 
           grabs hold of Guzman's collar with his bionic arm.

                                 BUFF
                        Game over.

           Guzman continues to run and Buff's arm detaches from its 
           socket.  The arm stays attached to Guzman's shirt.

                                 BUFF (CONT’D)
                        That's great.  That's just great.

           Guzman emerges from the club and jumps onto the back of a 
           waiting motorcycle.

           Guzman pulls the arm off and tosses it behind him.  The

           Buff runs after Guzman's motorcycle.

           Without much effort, Buff catches the bike and stays

                        Hey, come on!  Wait!

           The motorcycle turns a corner.  Buff has lost it.  He 
           stumbles on a fire hydrant and rolls to a stop.

           As he brushes himself off with his remaining arm, he notices

           Buff, his arm reattached and legs repaired, sits glumly

                        Well, now that we know they don't

                        I wish it were that simple.  The 
                        hard reality is, we just don't have 
                        any more money.  How can I go to 
                        Congress after this debacle and ask 
                        them for even more funding of the 
                        bionics program?

                        I'm saying we're shutting it down, 
                        Buff.  The bionics program is 
                        finished.  I'm sorry.

                        And what happens to me?  I just go 
                        back to the space program?

                        I wish it were that simple.  NASA 
                        has no use for an astronaut with 
                        faulty arms and legs.  And a nose 
                        that smells nothing but shit.

                        shutting it all down?  What am I 
                        supposed to do?  How am I supposed 
                        to live like this?

                        I'd try and keep your legs dry.

           Buff stands and slumps to the door.

           Buff enters and sees Janice, Bonnie's makeup woman.

                                 MAKEUP LADY
                        Buff.  Hi.  How did it go with your 
                        classified mission?

                                 BUFF
                        Not great, Janice.  

                                 MAKEUP LADY
                        Oh.  Did Luis Guzman get away?

                                 BUFF
                        Yeah.  Don't tell anyone, okay?

                                 MAKEUP LADY
                        Of course not.

                                 BUFF
                        Thanks.

           Buff crosses away as Janice turns to a group of CREW MEMBERS 
           and points at Buff, obviously telling them.

           Buff spots Bonnie, in her sexy soldier uniform, chatting 
           amicably with a young MAN.

                                 BUFF (CONT’D)
                        Bonnie?

           Oblivious, Bonnie and the Man laugh at something, then the 
           Man opens a jewelry box and offers a ring to Bonnie.  Bonnie 
           appears to be surprised but smiles as the Man slides the ring 
           on her finger.

           Buff, stunned, uses his bionic eye to ZOOM IN on the ring, 
           revealing a sparkling diamond.

                                 BUFF (CONT’D)
                        No.

           Without thinking, he bolts across the stage toward them.

           In SLOW MOTION Buff tackles the Man, knocking him to the 
           floor.

           Buff hoists the Man in the air with his bionic arm and hurls 
           him violently into a fake tank which collapses under his 
           weight.

           Back to normal speed.

           Bonnie rushes up and grabs Buff's arm.

                                 BUFF
                        It's his job to propose to my 
                        girlfriend?  I don't like that job.

                        OSI shut down the bionics program.

                                 BUFF
                        That's because that Buff died in a

                        It's okay, Reed.  It was a 
                        misunderstanding.

                                 REED
                        Misunderstanding my balls.  We're

           Two SECURITY GUARDS hurry over.

           As they attempt to subdue Buff, his bionic arm goes on the 
           fritz and begins swinging around madly.

                                 BUFF
                        Oh no.  Look out!

           The Security Guards pile on top of Buff.  Reed and Chuck, the

           to see a devastated Bonnie watching the car pull away.  She

           Buff paces in a holding cell.  From the reception area in the 
           next room he can hear COPS talking.

           Buff grimaces.  He looks down at the bars of his cage, then 
           at his bionic arm.  After a moment, he takes hold of the bar 
           and begins bending it to the side.

                        Okay.  Bail is set at five 
                        thousand.

           Buff sighs and starts to bend the bar of the cage again.

                        Nope, wait, I have it.  Here you

                        government treated you after all

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Colby sets up an 8MM film projector as Buff sits on the bed.

                                 COLBY
                        This was given to me by a friend of 
                        mine at OSI.  You're going to want 
                        to sit down.

                                 BUFF
                        I am sitting down.

                                 COLBY
                        Good.  You're going to want to.

           Colby switches off the light and starts the film.

           ON SCREEN we see a MAN in a tracksuit step onto a treadmill.  
           He begins to run and the speedometer attached to the 
           treadmill climbs: 10 MPH... 20 MPH... 30... 40... 50... 

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

           60 MPH!  Another man steps into frame, smiling.  It's Oscar 
           Goldman.

                                 BUFF
                        What is this?

                                 COLBY
                        Steve Austin.  The astronaut.  Your 
                        successor.  

                                 BUFF
                        What are you talking about?

                                 COLBY
                        Oscar lied to you, Buff.  Not only 
                        didn't they shut down the bionics 
                        program, they put six million 
                        dollars into building a new, better 
                        version.  

                                 BUFF
                        A six million dollar man?!  Oscar 
                        told me they had no more funding.

           ON SCREEN, we see Steve Austin throwing a football an 
           impossible distance, leaping over a brick wall and hoisting 
           an imposing dumbbell.  

           Throughout the film we hear the familiar "Six Million Dollar 
           Man" theme.

                                 COLBY
                        After we pulled our troops out of 
                        Vietnam, there was a sudden 
                        surplus.  OSI got their share.  

                                 BUFF
                        Why didn't they use it to fix me?

                                 COLBY
                        They considered you "damaged 
                        goods."

           Buff takes a moment as this sinks in.  Then,

                                 BUFF
                        What is that music?  Did they give 
                        him a theme song?

                                 COLBY
                        They had some money left over.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                 COLBY
                        No, it's not.  I thought you had a 
                        right to know the truth.

           Buff sits silently watching the screen as his last shred of 
           idealism dissolves.  And we

           CHYRON:  One year later

           CLOSE ON a porthole behind which we see a black field of 
           stars.  A hand reaches out and wipes the window.  PULL BACK 
           to reveal it is Buff.  His hair has grown long, he is 
           unshaven and slightly paunchy.  He takes a spray bottle and a 
           rag and wipes the porthole clean.

           Suddenly, a bald head pops up in the porthole.

                                 MR. NAGOPIAN
                        Taggart!  I told you not to go 
                        inside the exhibits!  

                                 BUFF
                        Oh, sorry, Mr. Nagopian.  I just 
                        thought I would clean in here.

                                 MR. NAGOPIAN
                        No cleaning!  Now get out of there!

           Buff sighs, gathers his cleaning supplies and climbs out the 
           hatch.

           INT. SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL AIR & SPACE MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS

           Buff emerges in a display hall of the museum.  We see the 
           field of stars was just a backdrop.

                                 BUFF
                        You know, I used to work in one of

                        pathetic.  Go clean up the puke in 
                        the Hall of Heroes.

                                 BUFF
                        Yes, sir.

           Buff heads off.

           INT. MUSEUM HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Buff wheels a bucket and mop down a row of displays.  Each 
           one shows a smiling photograph of a different NASA astronaut 
           in front of a backdrop of the Earth. 

           Buff spots the mess and begins to mop it up.  A YOUNG GIRL 
           gazes up at a display that is dedicated to the career of Buff 
           Taggart.  She looks at the photo, then at Buff, then back to 
           the photo.  The girl tugs on her MOTHER'S hand.

                                 GIRL
                        Mommy, isn't that the astronaut?

                                 MOTHER
                        What, the janitor?

                                 GIRL
                        Yes.  It looks just like him.

                                 MOTHER
                        Nancy, don't be ridiculous.  Why 
                        would an astronaut become a 
                        janitor?  Astronauts are heroic, 
                        successful men.  Janitors are 
                        repulsive social outcasts.  

           Having heard every word, Buff sadly continues his mopping.

                                 GIRL
                        Uh oh.

           Buff deposits coins into a Coke machine and selects an item.  
           Nothing comes out.  

                                 BUFF
                        Oh, come on.

           He shakes the machine.  Still nothing.  He shakes it harder.  
           Nothing.  At last, he slams the front of the machine with his 
           bionic arm.  The front panel shatters and dozens of cans roll 
           out onto the floor.  Buff looks around self-consciously, 
           picks up one can and walks off.

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC STREET - A FEW HOURS LATER

           Buff walking home.  With each step we hear a noticeable 
           squeaking noise.  He looks down at his bionic arm and moves 
           his elbow.  The squeak is coming from there.

           He notices a newspaper box.  The front page shows a photo of 
           Steve Austin beneath a headline: "Six Million Dollar Man 
           Defeats Bigfoot."  Buff grimaces and continues walking.

           He goes into a supermarket.

           INT. SUPERMARKET - MINUTES LATER

           Buff pushes a cart down an aisle.  He stops when he sees a 
           shelf of "Six Million Dollar Man" breakfast cereal.  The box 
           says "Now with bionic marshmallows!"

                                 BUFF
                        Bionic marshmallows.

           He continues down the aisle, passing boxes of "Six Million 
           Dollar Man rice," "Bionic Artichoke Hearts,""Six Million 
           Dollar Man Feminine Napkins."

           Buff arrives at the checkout counter and the CHECKOUT GIRL 
           rings him up.  As he waits he notices a People magazine cover 
           with a story about "Steve Austin's Greatest Enemy: Dyslexia."

           Buff continues down the street past a ball field where some

           Buff's feet.

           over a fence and lands on the roof of a distant building.

           There's a beat.  Then,

                                 KID
                        Asshole.

                                 BUFF
                        Sorry.

           He sadly continues on his way.

           EXT. BUFF'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - SHORT TIME LATER

           Buff climbs the stairs of a dilapidated building.  He unlocks 
           and enters one unit.

           INT. BUFF'S APARTMENT - THAT EVENING

           Buff, wearing a ratty bathrobe, crosses into his tiny 
           bathroom.

           INT. BUFF'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Buff stands under the shower.  He has garbage bags wrapped 
           around his legs and arm, secured with rubber bands to keep 
           them dry.  It is a pathetic sight.

           INT. BUFF'S BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Now wrapped in a towel, Buff opens the medicine cabinet which 
           looks more like an auto repair shop: WD-40 cans, hydraulic 
           fluid, bolts and screws, oil, etc.  

           He takes out a bottle of Armor-All and spreads a layer of it 
           over the rubber skin of his legs.  We see the "skin" has 
           cracked and discolored.

           INT. BUFF'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Buff sits in front of the TV, wearing boxers and a T-shirt.  
           He has rolled back the skin on his elbow and is spraying the 
           bionic joint with WD-40.  A half-eaten omelette sits on the 
           coffee table in front of him.

           Buff lifts the can and sprays himself in the right eye.  

           SFX: A knock at the door

           Buff stands, crosses to the door and opens it.

                                 BUFF
                               (eyes narrow)
                        You.

           REVEAL Oscar Goldman standing before him.

                                 OSCAR
                        Hello, Buff.  Can I come in?

                                 BUFF
                        Why would I let you in?

           Oscar holds up a bag from The Palm steakhouse.

                                 OSCAR
                        I brought dinner.

           INT. BUFF'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Oscar watches as Buff devours a steak dinner on the coffee 
           table.

                        You mean when you gave me these 
                        useless metal parts and lied that

                               (re: his bionic parts)
                        Look at this... the rubber skin 
                        turned beige.  I have to oil myself 
                        like the Tin Man.  I can't get a 
                        good job.  My girlfriend left me, 
                        and I can't walk a block without 
                        seeing your precious Steve Austin 
                        and his second generation bionics.  
                        Bet his legs don't catch fire.

                                 OSCAR
                        Steve Austin is the reason I'm 
                        here.

                                 BUFF
                        What do you mean?

                                 OSCAR
                        He's missing, Buff.

                                 BUFF
                        Missing?  He just defeated Bigfoot.

                                 OSCAR
                        That was a cover story.  Two weeks 
                        ago we sent Steve to a remote 
                        island where we believe a notorious 
                        terrorist known only as the 
                        Tarantula has set up operations.  
                        One week ago we received the last 
                        radio contact from Steve.  Since 
                        then, nothing.

                                 BUFF
                        Well, I'm sorry to hear that.  I'd 
                        hate to think you wasted six 
                        million dollars.  Now, if you'll 
                        excuse me, I've got to lube my 
                        ankles.

                        Buff.

                                 BUFF

                        We're prepared to upgrade your 
                        bionics.

                                 BUFF 
                               (excited)
                        You're going to give me six million 
                        dollar bionics?

                                 OSCAR
                        No.  Unfortunately, we spent nearly 
                        everything on Steve.  We do have a 
                        discretionary fund.

                                 BUFF
                        How much are we talking?

                                 OSCAR
                        Five thousand dollars.

                                 BUFF
                        Five thousand?!  That won't even 
                        replace my toe.  My toe fell off, 
                        did I tell you?

                                 OSCAR
                        Fine.  Ten thousand.  But we'll 
                        have to go into petty cash.  
                        There's going to be less coffee 
                        around the office...

                                 BUFF
                        So, you're saying you'd turn me 
                        into a fifty thousand dollar man 
                        just to save Steve Austin?  Why me?  
                        Why not send in an army?

                                 OSCAR
                        The Tarantula's defenses are too 
                        sophisticated.  They'd never make 
                        it onto the island.  And if they 
                        did, Steve would already be dead.

           INT. BUFF'S LIVING ROOM - HOURS LATER

           Buff snores on the sofa as the TV plays.

                        And now we return to "Lady 
                        Soldier."

           Buff snorts and wakes up.  He wipes spittle from his chin and 
           turns to the television.

           ON SCREEN we see:

           EXT. FOXHOLE - DAY

           Bonnie, as Lady Soldier, crouches over a wounded comrade, 
           JIMMY, 20's.  Explosions detonate all around them.

                        Not today, Jimmy.  I know the odds 
                        are bad for us.  Krakauer and his 
                        mercenaries are stronger than we'd 
                        thought and our air support never 
                        arrived, but there's still hope.  
                        There's always hope.  Without hope 
                        there's no hope.

                        But my leg is all shot up.

                                 LADY SOLDIER
                        Just because you've lost a leg 
                        doesn't mean you can't stand up for

                        So am I, Jimmy.  But it's here, 
                        when we're most afraid that we have 
                        to rise to the challenge.  That's 
                        what makes us men.

                        You're right.  

           Jimmy struggles to his feet and grabs his weapon.

           Then they both begin madly SCREAMING and firing their

           entrails are everywhere.

           The show abruptly cuts to a very 70's producer's title card 
           for Kanga Productions.  A cute animated kangaroo hops in and

           BIONIC UPGRADE MONTAGE

           MUSIC CUE: "Hold On" by Santana
            The Forty Thousand Dollar Man

           INT. SURGERY

           Buff lies on an operating table as DOCTORS reattach his newly 
           refurbished legs.  After a moment, the doctors realize they 
           have the legs reversed.  They switch them around.

           INT. OSI BRIEFING ROOM

           Oscar goes over blueprints and schematics with Buff as 
           enormous 1970's computer reels spin behind them.

           A MAN leads Buff up onto a tailoring podium and puts a large-
           lapeled leisure suit jacket on him.  He marks it with chalk.

           EXT. RUNNING TRACK

           Oscar and Technicians watch nervously as Buff runs.  He comes 
           to a stop and they all cheer.  After a second, he 
           involuntarily runs forward again.  The cheers stop.  Buff 
           stops again and gives them a wave: "I'm okay."  They cheer 
           again.

           INT. SURGERY

           Buff sits self-consciously on the examination table clenching 
           a doorknob in his fist as a DOCTOR adjusts cables inside his 
           opened forearm.  Buff's fist unclenches and he drops the 
           doorknob.  He thanks the doctor and tries to exit, but sees 
           the doorknob is missing.

           END OF MONTAGE

           INT. OSCAR GOLDMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

           Oscar is at his desk as Buff enters.  He now wears a handsome 
           leisure suit with a wide collar shirt open to his chest.

                                 OSCAR
                        Come in, Buff.

           Buff enters and sits.

                                 OSCAR (CONT’D)
                        I'm really glad you chose to come 
                        back.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

           CONTINUED:

                                 BUFF
                        Well, as a friend of mine once 
                        said, it's when we're most afraid 
                        that we have to rise to the 
                        challenge.  That's what makes us 
                        men.

                                 OSCAR
                        Your friend sounds like quite a 
                        guy.

                                 BUFF
                        Oh, she is.

           Beat.  Oscar's confused.  Then,

                                 OSCAR
                        Now, we've done all we can to 
                        prepare you for the mission.  I'm 
                        sorry we couldn't improve your 
                        bionic nose, but there is one thing 
                        I want to give you.

           Oscar slides a small box across the desk to Buff.  Buff opens 
           it, revealing a shiny new eyeball.

                                 BUFF
                               (jumps)
                        Ahh!
                               (then)
                        A new eye?

                                 OSCAR
                        This one has a zoom that works.  
                        Try it out.

                                 BUFF
                        Okay.

           Buff sticks his thumb in his bionic eye and plucks it out 
           with a "POP."  It rolls onto the desk.  He takes the new eye 
           and squishes it into his eye socket.

           We see from his POV as the new eye comes into focus.  He 
           zooms in and out effortlessly to different distances.  The 
           center of the view is obstructed by a thick cross-hair.

                                 BUFF (CONT’D)
                        Wow.  This is great.  It really 
                        works.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                 OSCAR
                        I paid for that one myself.  It's 
                        my gift to you.  A small way of 
                        saying I'm sorry.

                                 BUFF
                        Well, thank you, Oscar.  I really 
                        appreciate it.
                               (beat)
                        The cross-hair's pretty thick, huh?

                                 OSCAR
                        That's right.  It will allow you to 
                        zoom in on your target with great 
                        precision.

                                 BUFF
                        Uh huh.  Kind of hard to see around 
                        the cross-hair, though...

                                 OSCAR
                        I'm sure you'll get used to that.

           We again see Buff's POV.  The cross-hair does take up most of 
           his field of vision.

                                 BUFF
                        I guess so. 
                               (beat)
                        So, there's no way they can make 
                        the cross-hair any thinner...?

                                 OSCAR
                        I don't think so.

                                 BUFF
                        Okay, not a problem.  Thanks again.

                                 OSCAR
                        You leave tomorrow, Buff.  You'll 
                        be airdropped onto the island and 
                        you'll have to make your way into 
                        the Tarantula's fortified facility.  
                        We assume that's where he's holding 
                        Steve.  

                                 BUFF
                        Got it.  

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

           Oscar hands Buff an earpiece the size of a naval orange.

                                 BUFF
                        Wow.  These things just keep 
                        getting smaller and smaller.

           The sun rises as Buff, wearing his leisure suit and a 
           parachute, approaches a waiting C-7 transport plane.

           A pilot salutes him as he climbs the stairs.

           INT. TRANSPORT PLANE - CONTINUOUS

           Buff enters the dimly lit aircraft.

                                 COLBY (O.S.)
                        Welcome aboard, Buff.

           Buff squints his eyes and sees Colby, arms outstretched.  
           Buff gives him an awkward hug.

                                 BUFF
                        Colby?  What are you doing here?  
                        Oscar didn't tell me you were 
                        coming.

                                 COLBY
                        That's because I just volunteered 
                        this morning.  I told Oscar there 
                        was no way Buff was going in there 
                        alone.  You and I have been through 
                        too much together.

                        Yes, Buff?

                        I love you so much.

           EXT. SKY - MOMENTS LATER

           Buff and Colby jump from the rear hatch of the plane.  Below 
           them they can see an isolated jungle island with a large, 
           walled complex of buildings in the center.

           Buff points to the complex and Colby nods.

                                 COLBY
                               (yelling over the wind)
                        So, is this what it's like to be in 
                        space?!

                                 BUFF
                               (yelling)
                        No!  

           Colby looks disappointed.  Buff points to his altimeter, then 
           deploys his chute.  Colby does the same.

           EXT. BEACH - MINUTES LATER

           Colby and Buff descend onto a remote beach.  They gather 
           their chutes and remove their harnesses.

           Buff takes out a map.

                                 BUFF
                        OSI thinks the Tarantula is holding 
                        Steve in this central complex.  
                        We'll have to make our way there 
                        over land.

                                 COLBY
                        Okay.  I'll lead the way.

           Buff and Colby struggle to escape from a deep pool of 
           quicksand.

                                 BUFF
                        I think I should be able to slither 
                        out of here...

           Buff attempts to slither toward solid ground.

                        It's working!

           Buff sinks deeper and deeper into the muck.

                                 COLBY
                        Buff, you're sinking!  

                                 BUFF
                        Damn.  So, slithering isn't the 
                        solution.

           Buff spots a tree root nearby and reaches for it but it is 
           too far away.  He has an idea.  He reaches into the quicksand 
           with his left hand and after a moment pulls out his detached 
           bionic arm.  

                                 BUFF (CONT'D)
                        Now, if I can just...

           He extends his bionic arm toward the root.  When the hand 
           touches the root, it grips it tightly.

                                 BUFF (CONT'D)
                        Quick, Colby, grab me around the 
                        waist.  Good and tight. 

           Colby grabs onto him beneath the quicksand.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

                        Okay, fine.  Hold onto that.

           Buff pulls both of them onto dry land.  They flop onto the 
           ground, exhausted.  Buff reattaches his arm.  

                                 BUFF (CONT'D)
                        Good thing I stopped slithering.

           Buff just looks at him.

           Buff pushes through dense growth as a ridiculously sweaty 
           Colby struggles to keep up.

                                 COLBY
                               (panting)

                        We've only been walking for a few 
                        minutes.

                        Okay, sorry.  I can do this.  

           They emerge at the foot of a twelve foot high electric fence.

                                 COLBY (CONT'D)
                        Whoa.  That's pretty high.

                                 BUFF
                        I think I can jump it.

                        Yeah, I think I can too.

                        All right, look, Colby, maybe I 
                        should just go on ahead.  You can 
                        circle around and we'll rendezvous 
                        inside.

           Buff leaps over the fence.

           Colby waves to him from the other side of the fence.  He 
           bends at the knees, prepares to jump but discovers he is 
           ankle deep in another pool of quicksand.

                                 COLBY
                        Oh, hell.  Okay, you know what?

           Buff shakes his head and takes off at a jog.

           EXT. TARANTULA'S COMPOUND - MINUTES LATER

           Buff slowly makes his way toward the buildings.  Suddenly, 
           his leg disturbs a tripwire.

                                 BUFF
                        Uh oh.

           A few feet in front of him, a panel slides open and dozens of 
           tarantulas crawl out, heading towards him.  Buff backs away 
           nervously.  He stomps on a couple of the spiders that get 
           close to him.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

                        why they call him The Tarantula.

           Suddenly, another panel opens and dozens of scorpions creep 
           out in his direction.

                                 BUFF (CONT’D)
                        Scorpions.  Kind of muddies my

           As Buff backs away, a third panel opens and cobras slither 
           out.

           The creatures have backed Buff into a corner.  It looks like 
           he's in real trouble.

           Gradually, the tarantulas, scorpions and cobras begin 
           attacking each other, forgetting all about Buff.

                        Poor little guys.

           He gingerly steps around the seething mass of fighting 
           creatures and continues on his way.

           EXT. TARANTULA'S COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

           Buff spots two guard towers in the distance.  He uses his new 
           bionic eye to zoom in on one.

           Buff's POV: despite the annoyingly thick cross-hair, he 
           manages to zoom in on an armed GUARD in a jumpsuit.  The 
           pocket of the jumpsuit is embroidered with a distinctive 
           tarantula logo.

           Buff reacts.  Why does that look familiar?

           vents from his module.

                        Not yet.  But the logo on the 
                        guard's uniform.  It's the same one 
                        that was on the satellite that hit 
                        my ship last year.

                        That means the Tarantula's reach is 
                        even greater than we thought.  You 
                        need to find out what he's 
                        planning, Buff.

                        this guard.

           Buff quietly approaches the base of the guard tower.  He 
           spots a small rock, picks it up and takes aim at the guard.

           Buff tries throwing the rock again, but it remains stuck in 
           his clenched fist.  

                                 BUFF (CONT’D)
                        Oscar, I thought you said you

           guard and pounds him on the head with the rock that is still

                        Oscar, this place is enormous.  I 
                        don't know how I'll find Steve.

           A walkie-talkie on the unconscious guard's belt crackles to 
           life.

                                 GUARD 2 (OVER WALKIE)
                        I'm taking the prisoner to the 
                        toilet.  Will report in shortly.

                        Never mind, Oscar.  I think I have 
                        a lead.

           Buff sniffs the air with his bionic nose.

           SFX: Bionic sound effect

           Buff leaps from the tower down onto the roof of another 
           building.  He hurries over to a ventilation duct, tears the 
           metal cover off and shimmies inside.

           INT. TARANTULA'S COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS

           A dimly lit hallway.  Suddenly, Buff falls from the ceiling 
           and lands in a heap on the floor.  He picks himself up and 
           sniffs the air again.

                                 BUFF
                        He's close.

           Sniffing as he goes, Buff turns a corner and sees another 
           Guard in a jumpsuit standing outside a bathroom.  The Guard 
           spots him.

                                 GUARD 2
                        Hey, you!  You're not supposed to 
                        be in here.

           The Guard pulls out a billy club and swings at Buff, who 
           blocks it with his bionic arm.  The club bends harmlessly 
           against Buff's arm.  

                                 GUARD 2 (CONT’D)
                        What the...?

           The guard takes off down the hall toward a red button labeled 
           "Alarm."  

                                 BUFF
                        Not so fast.

           Buff takes off after the guard.  

           In SLOW MOTION, we see Buff gradually catch up with the guard 
           and overtake him before he can get to the alarm button.  Buff 
           punches the guard in the chest, causing him to fly into the 
           button, setting it off.

                                 BUFF (CONT’D)
                        Oh, shoot.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

           The guard falls to the ground, unconscious.  Buff hurries 
           back to the bathroom.

           INT. COMPOUND BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Buff bursts into the room to find STEVE AUSTIN flushing the 
           toilet.

           INT. TARANTULA'S COMPOUND - MINUTES LATER

           Steve and Buff stealthily make their way down a hall and into 
           a large control room area.  Buff contacts Oscar.

                                 BUFF
                        Oscar, I've got Steve.

                        What happened to you?

                                 STEVE
                        I was closing in on the Tarantula 
                        and was about to capture him when 
                        everything went black.  Next thing 
                        I knew, I was in a holding cell and 
                        I couldn't get my bionics to work 
                        properly.

                                 BUFF
                        Been there.

                                 STEVE
                        We need to stop the Tarantula.  
                        He's planning something big.  I 
                        just don't know what.

                                 BUFF
                        All right.  Colby should be around 
                        here somewhere.

                        Colby?  Major Colby Stafford?  
                        What's he doing there?

                                 BUFF
                        He told me he cleared it with you.

                                 OSCAR (O.S.)
                        I knew nothing about this.

                                 BUFF
                        Why would Colby come here without 
                        authorization?

                                 COLBY (O.S.)
                        Why indeed?

           Steve and Buff turn to see Colby, now wearing a white lab 
           coat, standing beside some oversized 1970's computer banks.

                                 STEVE

                        Stafford is the Tarantula.

                                 STEVE
                        I've got him.

           Steve moves to grab hold of Colby but before he can, Colby 
           pulls a control box from his pocket, pulls out the antenna 
           and pushes a button.  Steve immediately freezes and stands 
           stiffly immobile.

                                 BUFF
                        What have you done to him?

                                 COLBY
                        Oh, he's fine.  I simply implanted 
                        an RC chip in his bionic neural 
                        core.  With this device, I can 
                        control Steve's every move.

           Steve flails in Colby's direction with his left arm.

                                 COLBY (CONT’D)
                        Well, not his every move.  His left 
                        arm isn't bionic.

                                 BUFF
                        But why?  Why would you do this?

                                 COLBY
                        I needed Steve out of the way.  
                        Just as I needed you out of the 
                        way, Buff.  Your bionics made you 
                        two the only ones capable of 
                        stopping my plan.

                        to bring it down.  And the best

           NEIL ARMSTRONG plants a flag on the moon.

                        I ran those Apollo missions and I 
                        saw to it that every one of those 
                        flags you planted on the surface 
                        contained a powerful nuclear 
                        device.

           The video of Armstrong zooms in and we see a small, blinking 
           light in the flagpole.

           In another video, ALAN SHEPARD plants a flag.

                        I made sure the location of each 
                        flag would align with the moon's 
                        natural fault lines.

           Steve Austin.

           Colby hurries in to the room where another Assistant, VINCE, 
           is waiting.

                        Is everything ready, Vince?

                        Very well.  Let's blow up that damn 
                        rock.

           He turns to a wall on which we see two keyholes set more than 
           arm's length apart.

                        Insert your key.

           Colby takes a key from his pocket and inserts it into one 
           keyhole while Vince does the same at the other keyhole.

           Vince turns his key before Colby.

                        I didn't say "mark."

           Buff gets up and spots a fire extinguisher on the wall.  He 
           grabs it and throws it as hard as he can at Steve.  Steve 
           swats it away effortlessly and starts to cross toward Buff.

                                 BUFF
                        This is so unfair.  

           Buff looks up and notices a large electromagnet hanging from 
           a crane directly above where Steve is walking.

                        the third "pi."  Mississippi.  How

           Buff sprints toward the crane.  Before the Assistant 
           controlling Steve can react, Buff activates the 
           electromagnet.  Steve is hoisted into the air and held fast 
           by the magnet.  Buff jumps out of the crane and walks toward 
           the Assistant, who shrieks and runs away.

                        a kind of "space shuttle."  Lands 
                        like an airplane.  They want me to 
                        captain the first mission.  I told 
                        them I had to clear it with the
