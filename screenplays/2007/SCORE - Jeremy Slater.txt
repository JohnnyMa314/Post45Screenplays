           INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           People scurry out of the way as KAREN storms down the hall. 

           She bursts into Josh’s cubicle and brandishes a Post-It Note 
           like a loaded gun. 

                                 KAREN
                        Are you out of your goddamn mind? 
                        You’re breaking up with me? 

           JOSH fights to keep his voice neutral. He’s 27, perpetually 
           nervous, too smart for his own skull. The type of guy who 
           always double-knots his shoelaces, just in case. 

                                 JOSH
                        Kind of. 

                                 KAREN
                        With a Post-It Note? 

                                 JOSH
                        I didn’t want to cause a scene. 

                                 KAREN
                        Gee, thanks. What the hell, Josh? 

                                 JOSH
                        Chad Hickenlooper.

                                 KAREN
                        What about Chad?

                                 JOSH
                        Well, for starters, you slept with 
                        him. Don’t try to deny it, because--

                                 KAREN
                        Sure I slept with him!

                                 JOSH
                        Oh. Well. Okay, then. 

           In the adjacent cubicles, Josh’s coworkers hang on every 
           word. Heads popping up everywhere like prairie dogs.

                                 KAREN
                        Josh, we didn’t agree to not fuck 
                        other people! I wouldn’t have cared 
                        if you slept with, I don’t know, 
                        Chad Hickenlooper’s sister!
                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                 JOSH
                        Chad has a sister? 

                                 KAREN
                        It was an example. But yeah, her 
                        name’s Sarah, really nice girl. 

                                 JOSH
                        Well, they’re a lucky family, then. 

           Josh winces slightly as Karen sweeps aside some of his 
           meticulously-arranged action figures and sits down. 

                                 KAREN
                        So this is really for real? 

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah. If that’s okay with you. 

                                 KAREN
                        Jesus, Josh, you don’t ask for 
                        permission when you dump someone!

                                 JOSH
                        Sorry. 

                                 KAREN
                        And don’t apologize! God, I cheated 
                        on you! I mean, you’re supposed to 
                        get mad! Yell! Knock shit over! 

           Josh considers this. Then he reaches across the cubicle and 
           brushes a cup full of pens onto the floor.

           A long beat. 

                                 JOSH
                        Sorry. 

           He drops to his knees and starts scooping the pens back up.

                                 KAREN
                        Do you know how embarrassing it is 
                        for a girl my age to be single? 

                                 JOSH
                        You’re 25. 

                                 KAREN
                        I know!

                                 JOSH
                        There’s always Chad Hickenlooper. 
                                                             (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                 KAREN
                        He’s got a girlfriend. Name’s Liz, 
                        really nice girl. 

                                 JOSH
                        She sounds lovely. 

           Karen bites her lip. She’s not used to saying these words: 

                                 KAREN
                        I’m sorry. For how this turned out. 

           He gives her a small, sad smile. 

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah. Me too. 

           INT. BOARDROOM - AFTERNOON

           Josh looks beaten before he even takes his seat.

           Across the table, Josh’s SUPERVISOR clears his throat. 
           Shuffles a stack of papers. Clears his throat again.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        So. Jason.

                                 JOSH
                        Josh, sir.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        Been with the company for, what, a 
                        year now?

                                 JOSH
                        Three years. Sir.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        Ah, I see it right there. Three 
                        years, right you are. Data entry?

                                 JOSH
                        Data Entry Management Specialist.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        Don’t know how you guys do it. Make 
                        me stare at a screen all day long, 
                        think I’d shoot somebody. But hey, 
                        that’s just me. Anyway, Jason...

                                 JOSH
                        ...Josh.

                        ...thanks for all your hard work, 
                        and for being part of the winning 
                        team! And if you ever have any 
                        questions, anything you want to rap 
                        about, well, you know my email!

                                 JOSH
                        Actually, I don’t, sir. 

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        Well, it’s in the directory.

           Still smiling, he closes Josh’s folder. This meeting is over.

           And as Josh stares helplessly at his boss, we CUT TO--

           THE VIDEO GAME GEARS OF WAR. A marine’s head suddenly 
           explodes in a spray of animated gore. It’s awesome. 

           We pull away from the television to reveal--

           INT. JOSH AND TELLY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Josh and TELLY, sprawled on the couch playing Xbox 360. 

           Telly is Josh’s polar opposite: a hefty slob wearing a faded 
           Seaquest DSV shirt and mayonnaise-stained sweatpants. 

                                 TELLY
                        Think heads really blow up like 
                        that in the real world? 

           Josh ignores him. He’s still reeling from the day’s events. 

                                 JOSH
                        You know the worst part? Every time 
                        I go down to Accounting, I’ll have 
                        to see her. ‘Karen, hi! Still 
                        whoring across America? Great!’

                                 TELLY
                        So get another job! One where 
                        you’re not a keyboard monkey. 

                                 JOSH
                        Data Entry Management Specialist.   

                                 TELLY
                        You’re Mr. Bumbles, the monkey who 
                        couldn’t say no. 
                                             (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)           Onscreen, an alien with a chainsaw tears through Josh’s space 
           marine. Josh drops his controller with a sigh. 

                                 TELLY
                        You just got Chad Hickenlooper’d. 

                                 JOSH
                        Don’t try to turn Chad Hickenlooper 
                        into a verb, okay? That’s not cool.  

                                 TELLY
                        You should go kick Chad’s ass, Joe 
                        Don Baker-style. 

                                 JOSH
                        I’m not kicking anyone’s ass. 

                                 TELLY
                        Then you should call up Karen, mess 
                        with her brain. Tell her you always 
                        thought her ass was a little dumpy. 
                        Like a sack of rabbits.  

                                 JOSH
                        Stop! I’m not taking relationship 
                        advice from someone with a Kitty 
                        Pryde poster on his wall, okay?   

                                 TELLY
                        Hey, Kitty’s hot.

                                 JOSH
                        And a comic book character. And 13 
                        years old.

                                 TELLY
                        Only in the Claremont run. In 
                        present-day continuity, there’s 
                        grass all over that field.

           Onscreen, an enemy curb-stomps Telly’s marine to death. 

                                 TELLY
                        OH, YOU FUCKING HICKENLOOPER!

                                 JOSH
                        Okay, I’m done. 

                                 TELLY
                        What, going off to MopeyLand again? 
                        Gonna go ride Mope Mountain? It’s A 
                        Small Mope After All?

                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 JOSH
                        Having dinner with my folks. 

           Telly’s demeanor changes instantly. On his best behavior:

                                 TELLY
                        Oh God, let me come. 

                                 JOSH
                        What? No. Absolutely not. 

                                 TELLY
                        Josh, don’t do this to me!

                                 JOSH
                        I don’t want you hitting on my mom!

                                 TELLY
                        I don’t hit on your mom!

                                 JOSH
                        You do nothing but hit on her!

                                 TELLY
                        Honest to God, I’ll be Saint Telly. 
                        You won’t even know I’m there. 

           EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

           JOSH’S MOM opens the door and beams at her visitors. 

                                 JOSH’S MOM
                        Josh! You didn’t tell me Telly was 
                        coming!

                                 TELLY
                        That’s because we wanted to 
                        surprise your sexy ass. 

           His mother feigns shock, then throws Telly a sly wink. 

           Josh only sighs. 

           INT. KITCHEN

           JOSH’S DAD--a hardnosed military type--has joined them at the 
           dinner table. Everybody digs in.  

                                 JOSH’S DAD
                        Mmm. How’s work going? 
                                                  (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 JOSH
                        It’s okay...

                                 TELLY
                        Didn’t get his raise this year. 

           Josh glares at Telly. Telly is too busy eating to notice. 

                                 JOSH’S MOM
                        Oh, Joshy, that’s too bad. 

                                 JOSH
                        I was thinking about getting out of 
                        data entry anyway. Don’t want to be 
                        a keyboard monkey forever. 

                                 TELLY
                        Mr. Bumbles. 

                                 JOSH
                        Yes, thanks, Telly. That helps. 

           Josh picks up a mustard jar and struggles with the lid.

           His mother watches him strain, then takes the jar and 
           wrenches it open easily. Josh sighs as she hands it back. 

                                 JOSH’S MOM
                        So what are you thinking?

                                 JOSH
                        I don’t know. I mean, I’ve always 
                        wanted to get into game design...

           His father rolls his eyes. Josh instantly becomes flustered. 

                                 JOSH
                        What? What? 

                                 JOSH’S DAD 
                        That’s not a job. 

                                 JOSH
                        Sure it is! And I like video games!

                                 JOSH’S DAD
                        Used to like playing with yourself 
                        in the bathtub, too. Don’t see 
                        anyone paying you to do that. 

                                 JOSH
                        Well, maybe they should! 
                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 JOSH’S MOM
                        Telly, how’s the delivery business?

                                 TELLY
                        I prefer to call myself a Pepperoni 
                        Injection Specialist. 

                                 JOSH’S MOM
                           (ready to rock:)
                        I’ll just bet you do. 

           His father spears a bite of food and waggles it at Josh.

                                 JOSH’S DAD
                        Josh, the only thing we want is--

                                 JOSH
                        --for me to be happy, right.

                                 JOSH’S DAD
                        --for you to not embarrass us! 

                                 JOSH
                        Oh. 

                                 JOSH’S MOM
                        We just wish you’d put down the 
                        video games and try something else 
                        once in a while! Honey, we know 
                        you’re capable of great things. 

                                 TELLY
                        Must be his fine genetic stock. 

                                 JOSH’S MOM
                        Mmm. That’s not the only thing 
                        that’s fine around here...

                                 JOSH
                        What the fuck is wrong with you 
                        people? (cid:13)

                                 JOSH’S DAD
                        Watch the language, Buster Brown!

           Josh slumps against his chair, picking at his food. 

           For a long beat, nobody says anything. Then--

                                 JOSH’S MOM
                        So...how’s Karen? 
                                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)           INT. BLOCKBUSTER - MORNING

           Josh stumbles down the video store aisle, looking like he 
           just rolled out of bed. He turns the corner--

           Just in time to see ROBYN pluck a DVD off the shelf.  

           She’s the burnout chick who spent her high school career 
           smoking behind the 7-11. Black eyeliner, an M65 military 
           jacket, hot in a please-don’t-kick-my-ass sort of way.

           And she’s holding the last copy of Deep Blue Sea. 

                                 JOSH
                        Wow. I was actually thinking about 
                        getting that one. 

                                 ROBYN
                        It’s great, right?

                                 JOSH
                        Just the funniest movie ever. 
                           (as LL Cool J:)
                        “You ate my bird!”

                                 ROBYN
                           (busting a rhyme:)
                        “Deepest, bluest, my hat is like a 
                        shark’s fin!”

           He smiles, maybe a little smitten. She grins back. 

                                 JOSH
                        Holy shit, a patron of the arts. 
                        Well, I don’t want to keep you from 
                        your world of gliding monsters. 

           He watches as she makes her way to the counter. Stealing 
           quick glances at her. Trying to muster his courage. 

           EXT. BLOCKBUSTER PARKING LOT

           Robyn heads for her car. Josh hurries after her. 

                                 JOSH
                        Robyn, right? Like Batman’s friend? 
                           (She hesitates.)
                        Josh? West Valley Vikings, Class of 
                        97? We had P.E. together...?
                                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                 ROBYN
                        Oh, yeah, I remember you. 
                           (beat)
                        Well, great catching up. See ya. 

           She turns and strides off. Josh tries again-- 

                                 JOSH
                        Hey, hold up...

           And he walks right into the path of an oncoming Lexus! 

           Josh bounces off the hood. Goes skipping across the pavement. 

           And the world goes DARK. 

           When Josh finally opens his eyes again, the car’s DRIVER is 
           leaning over him. And he doesn’t look happy. 

                                 DRIVER
                        Goddamn it, you better not be dead.  

                                 JOSH
                        Ugh. Hurt bad. 

           He hauls Josh to his feet, gestures angrily at the car. 

                                 DRIVER
                        Look! Look! See that dent? Fucking 
                        watch where you’re going!

                                 ROBYN
                        That’s kind of funny.  

           They whirl around to find Robyn sitting on the curb, puffing 
           on a Parliament. She blows a wreath of smoke. 

                                 ROBYN
                        I mean, says the guy who was busy 
                        dicking around with his radio 
                        instead of watching the road. 

                                 DRIVER
                        You’re a liar. 

                                 ROBYN
                        And the only witness you’ve got. 
                           (to Josh:)

                        him. Take his kids’ college money.

           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                 DRIVER
                        Whoa, hey, nobody’s suing nobody, 
                        okay? Just a misunderstanding!

                                 ROBYN
                        Up to him, I guess. 

           She stares pointedly at Josh. He nods quickly. 

                                 JOSH
                        Um, right. Yeah. No problem. 

                                 DRIVER
                        Yeah, see? No problem! Okay! You 
                        take care now, buddy!

           He gives Josh a friendly pat on the arm, throws another glare 
           at Robyn, then hops in his car and peels out. 

           Robyn turns away wordlessly. Josh stumbles after her. 

                                 JOSH
                        Hey! Ow. Wait! 

                                 ROBYN
                        You’re wasting your time. I’m not 
                        gonna fuck you. 

                                 JOSH
                        I...I didn’t ask you to!

                                 ROBYN
                        You will, though. Or you’ll pretend 
                        you’re really into giving oral, 
                        thinking I’ll feel obligated 
                        afterwards. I know your type.  

                                 JOSH
                        I don’t have a type!

                                 ROBYN
                        Please. You’re classic Sensitive 
                        Overachiever. I humor you today, 
                        and pretty soon you’re importing 
                        Bolivian coffee beans and throwing 
                        Grey’s Anatomy watch parties.  

                                 JOSH
                        You’re screwing with me, right? 

                                 ROBYN
                        Not now, not ever. 
                                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)           This is too much. Josh shakes his head and turns away--

                                 JOSH
                        Okay, you wanna be psychotic? 
                        Great, fine. See you later.  

           --Then he abruptly changes his mind and wheels back around.   

                                 JOSH
                        No, you know what? You don’t know 
                        anything about me! You don’t!

           Robyn sizes him up through a haze of curling smoke. Smiling 
           ever so slightly. Challenging him. 

                                 ROBYN
                        So tell me. 

           And right then and there, Josh falls for her. 

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - LATE AFTERNOON

           We swoop above the sprawling green of the Hollywood Hills, 
           homing in on the mansion perched above a dizzying drop. 

           EXT. MANSION - LATE AFTERNOON

           The swimming pool is packed with bimbos and VIPs in varying 
           stages of intoxication. Pulsing techno echoes from somewhere.   

           Armed security guards patrol the outskirts of the property, 
           hands near their holsters, murmuring into earpieces.   

           A silent Asian BUTLER glides through the debauchery and 
           approaches a raised platform, where a group of high-rollers 
           are slamming golf balls out into the stratosphere.  

           The butler clears his throat, and the host turns around. 

           With his Sam Elliot moustache, tight-fitting Wranglers, shit-
           kicking boots and 10 gallon hat, KENNY VENICE is about as far 
           from the stereotypical Hollywood producer as you can get. 

           The butler whispers a few words in Venice’s ear. He frowns. 

                                 VENICE
                        ‘Scuse me, fellas.  

           He follows the butler through the party, slapping backs and 
           graciously accepting compliments at every turn.   
                                                  (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                 VENICE
                        Corey! Welcome back, pardner!

           Out in the pool, former child star COREY FELDMAN pries 
           himself away from a naked porn star and raises his mug. 

                                 COREY FELDMAN
                        Hell of a party, Mr. V!

                                 VENICE
                           (to the porn star)
                        And darling, you treat this boy 
                        right tonight, you hear?  

           The girl nods bashfully. Corey gives him a thumbs-up.  

           INT. MANSION - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The walls are littered with gaudy Western paraphernalia. 
           Cowboy portraits. Cattle skulls. Antique six-shooters. 

           And every wall boasts framed posters of Venice’s movies: 
           Throatcutter. The Ghosting of Witch Manor. Best Served Cold. 
           DUCK!! Not a lot of Oscar winners in this bunch. 

           INT. MANSION - SCREENING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ELLIOT--a terrified computer geek--fidgets on the couch, 
           flanked on either side by a pair of unsmiling ENFORCERS. 

                                 ENFORCER #1
                        Got a problem, Mr. Venice. 

                                 VENICE
                        Goddamn right we do! Got titties 
                        that could raise the Titanic in my 
                        pool and you got me in here! 
                           (to Elliot:)
                        The hell did you do now, Elliot? 

                                 ELLIOT
                        Mr. Venice, I’m so, so sorry. Oh 
                        God, I’m so, so, so--

                                 VENICE
                        I’m gonna hit you in the mouth 
                        right now, you don’t shut up.  

           Elliot’s mouth snaps shut. He swallows hard. 
                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 VENICE
                        Now, whenever you reckon you’ve 
                        wasted enough of my time... 

                                 ELLIOT
                        I bought a whore, Mr. Venice. 

                                 VENICE
                        What a charming fucking story.

                                 ELLIOT
                        I thought she was just a regular 
                        whore, you know? But after we did, 
                        you know, what you do with a whore, 
                        I fell asleep and-- 

                                 VENICE
                        Keeps getting better and better... 

                                 ELLIOT
                        When I woke up, my computer was on. 

           This stops Venice is his tracks. His gaze narrows. 

                                 VENICE
                        Elliot. Oh, goddamn you, Elliot, 
                        this better not be about my list. 

           Elliot closes his eyes. Trying not to cry. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        I ch-ch-checked the keystrokes, 
                        sir. She copied the database and--

                                 VENICE
                        FUCK! FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!

           Venice grabs a chair and proceeds to beat the living hell out 
           of a stuffed moose head hanging on the wall. The moose’s 
           snout collapses. An antler snaps off. A glass eye pops out. 

           At last he steps back, sweating, gasping for breath. He kicks 
           the moose eye across the room, making the two enforcers jump. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        Sir, I’m so sorry--

                                 VENICE
                        Shut up! That list gets out and I’m 
                        a goddamn dead man! You understand?

           Elliot nods miserably as Venice kneels before him.

           (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                 VENICE
                        So I’m gonna ask one time and one 
                        time only, you little greaseball 
                        son of a fuck: where’s that whore? 

           INT. PIZZA BONANZA

           Telly--wearing a hideous purple uniform--glances around to 
           make sure nobody is looking, then plucks a pepperoni slice 
           off a fresh-from-the-oven pizza and tosses it in his mouth. 

           Josh hurries into the restaurant, looking vaguely queasy. 

                                 JOSH
                        We have to talk. 

                                 TELLY
                        About what?    

                                 JOSH
                        I need. To get. Some. Stuff. 

                                 TELLY
                        What kind of stuff? 

                                 JOSH
                        Stuff you can’t buy in a store. 

           He glances around, embarrassed, them mimes toking on a joint. 

           Slowly, Telly peels another pepperoni slice off the pizza. He 
           chews thoughtfully, staring at Josh the whole time. 

                                 JOSH
                        Well?

                                 TELLY
                        Well, what? You’re clearly insane. 
                        You don’t even do drugs, so why--
                           (A wonderful idea suddenly 
                            strikes him:)
                        Wait, is this like one of those 
                        Harrison Ford movie where the 
                        terrorists have your family hostage 
                        and won’t let ’em go unless you--

                                 JOSH
                        No. What? Shut up. God. 
                           (A deep breath.)
                        Remember Robyn, from high school?

                        She the cute one who dressed like 
                        Che Guevera or the mongoloid one 
                        with the big droopy eyes?  

                                 JOSH
                        The first one. Anyway, I ran into 
                        her at the store--Deep Blue Sea 
                        fan, by the way--  

                                 TELLY
                        ‘My hat is like a shark’s fin!’

                                 JOSH
                        --and we ended up talking in the 
                        parking lot for...I don’t know how 
                        long. And it turns out she’s a cool 
                        girl, right? And I guess I was 
                        trying to impress her-- 

                                 TELLY
                        Oh God, what’d you say? 

           INSERT: We’re back in the Blockbuster parking lot. 

                                 FLASHBACK JOSH
                        Yeah, I’m totally down with the 
                        whole hip-hop scene. Totally.  

           INSERT: And don’t forget... 

                                 FLASHBACK JOSH
                        My boss was like, you can’t have a 
                        cage fight in the office, are you 
                        crazy? And I was like, maybe I am. 

           INSERT: Robyn offers her cigarette pack, but Josh is too busy 
           rambling; he doesn’t even notice. 

                                 FLASHBACK ROBYN
                        You smoke?

                                 FLASHBACK JOSH
                        Sure! I mean, who doesn’t, right? 
                        Reefer, pot, I’m into all of it.  

                                 FLASHBACK ROBYN
                        I meant...never mind.

           She pockets the pack. Josh doesn’t realize his mistake. 

           BACK IN THE PRESENT--
                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)           Josh bangs his forehead on the wall. THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. 

                                 JOSH
                        And then she was like, we should 
                        hang out sometime! And I was like, 
                        how about tonight? And I don’t even 
                        know how that happened!

                                 TELLY
                        So just call her, make some excuse--

                                 JOSH
                        No! She’d know I was lying!

                                 TELLY
                        And we care about that...why? 

                                 JOSH
                        Telly, listen to me: right now, on 
                        this planet, there’s exactly one 
                        person who thinks I’m cool. One.  

                                 TELLY
                        I think you’re cool. 

                                 JOSH
                        You don’t count. There’s one girl, 
                        okay? And I don’t want her to find 
                        out she was wrong.   

                                 TELLY
                        For the record? This is a bad idea.   

                                 JOSH
                        Of course it’s a bad idea! Are you 
                        going to help me or not? 

           Telly drops to one knee. In his best Viggo Mortensen voice: 

                                 TELLY
                           (as Aragorn:)
                        If by my life or death I can 
                        protect you, I will. You have my 
                        sword.  

                                 JOSH
                        Oh, Jesus Christ--

                                 TELLY
                           (as Legolas:)
                        And you have my bow!

           Josh turns away. Telly shuffles after him on his knees.

                        And my axe!

           INT. TELLY’S CAR

           Telly’s pizza delivery vehicle pulls out of the parking lot.  

                                 TELLY
                        So. Off to buy drugs. That’s new.

                                 JOSH
                        Come on, it’s just pot. It’s barely 
                        even illegal; I’m pretty sure I 
                        read that in a magazine.  

                                 TELLY
                        Was it High Times? Because they 
                        might be biased. 

                                 JOSH
                        Anyway. These guys...they’re cool 
                        about this sort of thing?  

                                 TELLY
                        Kurt Russell cool. Don’t worry, 
                        these guys are my dawgs.

                        --and I needed someone to cover my 
                        shift so I could go to MangaFest 
                        and you said your cat was throwing 
                        up and then Donny told me you don’t 
                        even have a cat so I didn’t get to 
                        go to MangaFest even though I made 
                        my own Aerith costume and--

CRAPPY LIVING ROOM

           DAWG #3 is an enormous black guy with bulging eyeballs.

                        GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY HOUSE!

           EXT. PLAYGROUND - EVENING

           The sun is setting by the time Josh and Telly hurry toward 
           the basketball court where a group of BALLERS are playing. 

                                 JOSH
                        Oh my God, I’m supposed to pick her 
                        up in like five minutes!

                                 TELLY
                        Trust me, dude, Marcus can help. 
                           (yelling)
                        YO, WHAT UP, HOMES? 

           The ballers stop short. Staring at these dorky white guys. 

           MARCUS tosses the ball to his buddy and steps forward. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Telly. Still slinging pizzas? 

                                 TELLY
                        You know how I roll!

           One of the ballers snickers. Telly doesn’t notice. 

                                 MARCUS
                        So what’s up? You come to shoot 
                        some hoops or what? 

                                 TELLY
                        Actually, I was hoping you could do 
                        us a solid. Know what I’s sayin’? 

                                 MARCUS
                        I have no idea what you’re saying. 

           His buddies snort laughter. Forming a circle around them. 

                                 TELLY
                        My boy needs to score some MJ for 
                        his ho. You got the hook-up?

                        Whoa, whoa, whoa, man! I’m on 
                        probation! You can’t come around 
                        asking me for shit like that!

           Josh almost seems relieved. He grabs Telly’s arm. 

                                 JOSH
                        Thanks anyway, sir! Come on, Telly, 
                        let’s get out of here. 

                                 TELLY
                        C’mon, Marcus, hook a brutha up!

                                 BALLER #1
                        Yeah, Marcus, help your brutha!

           Baller #2 drags Marcus aside. Grinning from ear to ear. 

                                 BALLER #2
                        Yo, send ’em to Cezar!

                                 BALLER #1
                        Oh shit, yeah! Cezar! 

                                 MARCUS
                        Naw, man. That’s cruel and unusual. 

           Telly has been eavesdropping, and now he dives in eagerly. 

                                 TELLY
                        Who’s Cezar? Does he have pot?

                                 BALLER #2
                        You kidding me? That Motherfucker 
                        can hook you up, give you an Oompa 
                        Loompa to carry it back home! 

                                 MARCUS
                        Don’t listen to these guys. Your 
                        girl, whoever she is, she ain’t 
                        worth a trip to Cezar’s.  

           Baller #2 slings a friendly arm over Telly’s shoulder. 

                                 BALLER #2
                        You want Mary Jane, big man? You 
                        tell Cezar that Cherokee Pete sent 
                        you. He’ll take care of you.

           NIGHT. We won’t see daylight again for a very long time. 

           Robyn is kicking an aluminum can against the curb when the 
           car pulls up. Josh gallantly holds the door open for her. 

                                 ROBYN
                        Don’t be a dipshit, Josh. 

           She hops in and slams the door behind her. 

           INT. TELLY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Josh clambers into the backseat and the car pulls away. 

                                 ROBYN
                        Hey, Telly. I didn’t know you were 
                        coming. 

                                 TELLY
                        Yeah, me neither. 

                                 JOSH
                        Wait, you two know each other? 

                                 TELLY
                        Sure. We had shop class together 
                        back in school.

                                 ROBYN
                        Hey, yeah! You made those life-size 
                        Tetris blocks. Those were sweet.  

                                 TELLY
                           (His expression darkens.)
                        Until the possums got in ‘em. 

                                 ROBYN
                        Huh. Okay, then. What’s the plan 
                        for tonight, anyhow?

                                 JOSH
                        It’s a surprise. 

                                 ROBYN
                        You guys aren’t, like, some Rape 
                        Shack-owning, I Spit On Your Grave-

                            She shrugs, turns away.)
                        Too bad.

                                 JOSH
                        You’re...you’re screwing with me 
                        again, right? 

           She says nothing. The faintest of smiles. A long beat, then--

                                 TELLY
                        Rape Shack?

           EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX

           Telly’s car rolls to a stop. They stare out at the rundown 
           apartment building looming over them. 

                                 ROBYN
                        Wow. Shittiest surprise ever. 

           INT. APARTMENT STAIRWELL

           The interior of the building is just as grimy and ominous as 
           you’d expect. Cracked and peeling wallpaper, stark pools of 
           shadow, disembodied voices seeping through the walls. 

           Josh hesitates in front of 5-B. He knocks. Here goes nothing. 

           And nothing is exactly what happens.  

                                 TELLY
                        Maybe he’s out hustlin’. 

                                 JOSH
                        Don’t. Don’t say that like you know 
                        what it means. 

           The door bangs open. Everybody jumps. 

           CEZAR RODEN is just about the scariest motherfucker we’ve 
           ever seen. A perpetually strung-out Czech with a drooping 
           potbelly and wild eyes flecked with tiny red veins. 

                                 CEZAR
                        Who are you? 

                                 JOSH
                        Are you Cezar?
                           (Cezar nods slowly.)
                        Um, Cherokee Pete sent us.

                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                 CEZAR
                        Who. The. Fuck. Is. Cherokee. Pete? 

                                 JOSH
                           (long pause)
                        That might have been a fake name. 

           After a moment’s deliberation, Cezar throws the door open. 

                                 CEZAR
                        Get in here. 

                                 ROBYN
                        You know what, maybe we should--

                                 CEZAR
                        NOW!

           He herds them inside. Shuts the door. Slides the deadbolt. 

           INT. CEZAR’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Surprisingly, the apartment is relatively bright and cheery. 
           The walls are plastered with old European carnival posters: 
           the strongman, the mangy dog-boy, the sword-swallower. 

           Josh hesitates in front of an antique poster showing a fierce-
           looking gypsy woman holding a throwing knife in each hand and 
           one between her teeth. Yikes. 

           Cezar leads them into the living room and gestures to a 
           plastic-covered couch. They reluctantly sit. 

           On the far side of the room, GRANDMA stares off into space.

                                 CEZAR
                        Grandmama! We have visitors!

           The old lady doesn’t respond. Doesn’t even blink. 

                                 JOSH
                        Sir, I think we made a mistake--

           He tries to stand, but Cezar waves him back down. 

                                 CEZAR
                        No, stay, comrades, stay!

           He heads into the kitchen, and nearly bumps into...

           ULA. A Czech goddess with an hourglass figure and pouting 
           lips. She regards them with blank disinterest.   
                                      (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                 ULA
                           (in subtitled Slovak)
                        Are they customers?

                                 CEZAR
                           (in subtitled Slovak)
                        Woman, get your ass back in there!   
                           (in English)
                        That is Ula. Does not speak a word 
                        of English, dumb as a fucking 
                        monkey on a skateboard, but is best 
                        whore in town, yes? Hey, you guys 
                        want pink lemonade?

           They all shake their heads violently. Cezar ignores this. 

                                 CEZAR
                        Cosmic. I will be right back.
                           (points to Grandma)
                        And hey, do not let this cunt give 
                        you any attitude! Ha! Am I right?

           Cezar and Ula disappear into the kitchen and start screeching 
           at each other in furious Slovak. Like two cats in a blender. 
           At last Ula goes stomping back to the bedroom, pouting. 

           Josh leans toward Grandma. Trying to break the silence.

                                 JOSH
                        You have a lovely apartment! 
                           (Grandma doesn’t respond.)
                        Ma’am? 

                                 TELLY
                        She’s faking.

                                 JOSH
                        What?

                                 TELLY
                        Look in her eyes. She’s got a...a 
                        glint. A faking glint.  

                                 JOSH
                        Who is she, Ethel Rosenberg? Who 
                        the fuck fakes senile?

                                 TELLY
                        Lots of people, probably.

                                 JOSH
                        Nobody does that. That’s stupid. 
                        You’re stupid. Glint. 
                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                 ROBYN
                        Is this really important? Can we 
                        just get out of here already? 

                                 JOSH
                        Just be cool. Everything’s fine. 

                                 ROBYN
                        Josh, this is not fine. 

           Cezar emerges from the kitchen, carrying a few cups and a 
           large plastic pitcher on a TV dinner tray. Smiling madly. 

                                 CEZAR
                        Is pink lemonade time!

           INT. CEZAR’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           In the adjacent bedroom, Ula lights up a joint. Flings 
           herself onto the bed. In a righteously foul mood. 

           At last the blinking cell phone on the dresser catches her 
           attention. She flips it open and checks the text message. 

           One word, all in capital letters: RUN. 

           And then, in accented but perfectly understandable English: 

                                 ULA
                        Shit. 

           INT. CEZAR’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Cezar sets the tray down and begins arranging the glasses.

                                 CEZAR
                        So tell me again, comrades, what 
                        you are looking for?

           For a beat, nobody answers. At last Josh clears his throat.

                                 JOSH
                        Um, pot? You know, the reefer?

           This catches Robyn by surprise. She turns to face Josh, her 
           expression darkening with disappointment.  

                                 CEZAR
                        And a Cherokee named Peter, he gave 
                        you my name, yes?
                                                   (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                 JOSH
                        Yes, sir. That’s right, sir.

           In one smooth movement, Cezar upends the plastic pitcher...

           And a gleaming black pistol falls into his hand.

                                 CEZAR
                        Well, hey, lookie cookie! 
                           (He leans back.)
                        Now. Who sent you? The piggies? 

                                 ROBYN
                        Sir, you don’t have to--

                                 CEZAR
                        Shut your fuckhole. 
                           (to Telly:)
                        Are you a piggy, comrade? I have 
                        seen them, watching in the trees! 

                                 TELLY
                        I’m...I’m not a cop, mister!

                                 CEZAR
                        Then you will prove it, yes? 

           Cezar raises the coffee table’s lid to reveal a massive 
           stockpile of narcotics. Enough drugs to kill a Clydesdale.  

                                 JOSH
                        Holy crap. 

           Cezar carefully chooses three small white pills. Humming. 

                                 TELLY
                        Oh Jesus, sir, please, I don’t even 
                        do drugs, none of us do! Well, 
                        maybe she does, I think she had a 
                        troubled childhood, but please--

           Cezar leans across the table, shushing him. He uses the gun 
           barrel to gently pry Telly’s mouth open. 

                                 CEZAR
                        If you are not a piggy, then it is 
                        time to party, yes? 

           He places the pills on Telly’s tongue: one, two, three. Then 
           he uses the gun to massage his throat, working them down.
                                                          (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                 CEZAR
                        Thank you, comrade. I believe you. 
                           (beat)
                        Your friends? I am not so sure. 

           He turns to Robyn, leering. The moment he’s been waiting for. 
           The muzzle of his pistol brushes lightly across her chest.

                                 CEZAR
                        You. Miss Piggy. You are wearing a 
                        piggy-wire, yes? Let’s find out. 

           Robyn looks him right in the eye. Unflinching. 

                                 ROBYN
                        Get fucked, Stalin. 

                                 CEZAR
                        What...did you just say? 

                                 ROBYN
                        Did I stutter? Touch me and my 
                        boyfriend here will beat your sperm 
                        retarded. Isn’t that right, Josh? 

                                 JOSH
                        Wait, what? 

           Cezar turns to Josh, who is now squirming helplessly.

                                 CEZAR
                        So. You are a tough guy, yes?

           And at that moment, we hear the theme song to Bubble Bobble. 
           Josh’s eyes widen. His cell phone is ringing.

                                 CEZAR
                        Are you going to answer?

                                 JOSH
                        You...you want me to--?

                                 CEZAR
                        YES, I FUCKING WANT YOU TO, YES!

           Josh flips the cell phone open. Holds it to his ear.

           And Cezar presses the gun’s muzzle against Josh’s crotch.

           For a long beat, Josh doesn’t say anything at all. Then--

                                 JOSH
                        Hi, mom.
                                                       (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                 TELLY
                           (mumbling:)
                        Tell her hi from me. 

           And we INTERCUT between this room and--

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Josh's mom balances the phone on her shoulder while cleaning 
           vegetables in the sink. Her voice is absurdly cheerful. 

                                 JOSH'S MOM
                        Hi, Joshy. Staying out of trouble?

                                 JOSH
                        Sort of.

                                 JOSH'S MOM
                        Are you coming over tonight? I was 
                        thinking about making casserole 
                        tonight and I just remembered we 
                        don’t have any--

           Without warning, Cezar shoves the gun forward. Josh squeaks.

                                 JOSH'S MOM
                        You okay, honey?

                                 JOSH
                        Fine. I’m fine.

                                 JOSH'S MOM
                        You made a weird duck sound.

                                 JOSH
                        It was a...a video game. With 
                        ducks. Duck Hunt.

           He swallows hard, closes his eyes. Now Cezar is tapping the 
           gun sharply against his testicles. Tap, tap, tap.

                                 JOSH'S MOM
                        Oh, never mind, then; I’ll just run 
                        to the store. Are you eating here?

           Josh opens his mouth to respond just as Cezar delivers a 
           particularly nasty rap to the sack. He yelps loudly.

                                 JOSH'S MOM
                        Ow, Josh, that was right in my ear!
                                           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                 JOSH
                        Sorrygottagoloveyoubye!

                                 JOSH'S MOM
                        All right. Say hi to Telly for m--

           But she’s interrupted by a dial tone. She shrugs. Hangs up.

           Slowly, Cezar takes the phone from Josh’s hand. He examines 
           it a moment, then snaps it in half with casual ease. 

                                 CEZAR
                        So how is dear mama? Everything is 
                        good with her, yes? 

                                 JOSH
                        Uh-huh. 

                                 CEZAR
                        Yes? So you can stick around? 

                                 JOSH
                        No. I mean, yeah. We’ve gotta go.

                                 CEZAR
                        Ah, that is too bad. 

           As he speaks, Cezar presses the barrel of the pistol against 
           Josh’s lips. Forcing his mouth open. Sliding the gun inside.

                                 CEZAR
                        There you go. Num, num, num. Now, 
                        the other phones. Hurry, comrades. 

           Robyn hands over her cell. Cezar crushes it underfoot. 

                                 ROBYN
                        Dick. 

           Telly hands over his iPhone like a mother giving up her baby. 

                                 TELLY
                        Hey, how about we just take the 
                        batteries out instead of--
                           (Cezar crushes it.)
                        --or you could break it. That 
                        works, too. 

           At that moment, the bedroom door bangs open. Ula hurries past 
           them, tucking something metallic into her purse.
                                                      (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                 CEZAR
                        Where do you think you’re going?
                           (He blocks her path.)
                        You better get back in--

           But now Ula pulls a pistol of her own from the purse. She 
           shoves the weapon in Cezar’s face, waving it hysterically. 

                                 ULA
                           (in subtitled Slovak)
                        Don’t try to stop me! I mean it!

                                 CEZAR
                        Whoa. Hey. Let’s talk this over. 

           He gingerly places his gun on the floor. Ula kicks it away. 

                                 ULA
                           (in accented English)
                        We talk about nothing.  

           Cezar sits down hard in the recliner. Flabbergasted.  

                                 CEZAR
                        You...speak English? 

                                 ULA
                        You never asked. 

           Cezar thinks this over. Then, in a thoughtful voice: 

                                 CEZAR
                        I hope you know, Ula, I will have 
                        to kill you for this. 

                                 ULA
                        Is good to know. 

           She pulls the trigger. BANG!

           Cezar’s head jerks backward. He doesn’t move again. 

           With a banshee’s wail, Grandma explodes from her seat!

           She claws at Ula’s face. Bats the gun from her hands. Ula 
           pinwheels across the room, landing on Josh’s lap. 

           Still shrieking, Grandma sprints into the bedroom. 

                                 ULA
                        Shit! Where is gun? 
                                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                 JOSH
                        Don’t kill me!

                                 ULA
                        Knives! She has knives!

           Ula spies the pistol and dives for it. She tucks into a 
           controlled combat roll just as the door flies open again. 

           Grandma is wearing a bandolier adorned with dozens of wicked 
           throwing knives. The old broad is a goddamn carny. 

                                 ULA
                        DOWN!

           Ula squeezes off several wild shots. Puffs of plaster blossom 
           on the wall all around Grandma. 

           With a flick of her wrist, Grandma sends a knife whistling 
           through the air. It buries itself in Ula’s shoulder, slamming 
           her back against the wall, pinning her in place. 

           The gun falls from Ula’s hand. She bucks forward, howling. 

           The others dive over the back of the couch, scrambling for 
           cover. The movement catches Grandma’s attention, and she 
           casually whips another blade right past Josh’s head. 

           Ula strains for the gun with her good arm. Gasping. 

           Chanting in Slovak, Grandma draws another knife from her 
           bandolier, cocks her throwing arm...

           With her foot, Ula hooks a TV dinner tray and flips it into 
           her waiting hand. She tilts the tray just as Grandma throws 
           again, and the knife sinks halfway through the aluminum. 

           Grandma takes another step. Eyes blazing. Her wrist a blur of 
           motion as another knife takes flight. 

           Ula swings the tray desperately...and luck is on her side 
           this time. She bats the knife out of the air with a CLANG!

           Now Grandma is only a few feet away. She won’t miss again. 

           On the other side of the couch, Robyn goes crawling forward. 

                                 JOSH
                        What are you doing?

           Robyn reaches around the couch, into the open coffee table 
           filled with drugs. Her hand closes around a bag of coke.

                        Hey!

           Grandma turns just in time to catch the bag square in the 
           kisser. It explodes in a starburst of white powder. She goes 
           reeling backwards, screaming, clawing at her eyes. 

           Ula throws herself forward again, forcing the blade all the 
           way through her shoulder, and she seizes the pistol. 

           This time Ula doesn’t miss. This time she catches Grandma 
           right between the eyes. The old woman spins. Falls. 

           Sobbing, gasping, Ula pulls herself to her feet. Blood 
           running down her useless arm. 

           She stumbles over to Grandma...and kicks the corpse in the 
           ribs as hard as she can. Spits. 

                                 ULA
                           (in subtitled Slovak)
                        I hope Satan’s cock burns, you 
                        vicious gypsy whore. 

           She turns to find Josh, Telly and Robyn staring at her. 
           Wondering if they’re next on her hit list. 

                                 ULA
                        Do you have car? 
                           (Slowly, they nod.)
                        Then you drive. 

           EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX PARKING LOT

           Ula tucks her pistol out of sight and urges them forward.

           As they cross the parking lot, Telly sticks a finger down his 
           throat and begins to hack and gag.

                                 JOSH
                        What the hell, Telly?

                                 TELLY
                        The pills he made me take. I’m 
                        trying to york them up.

           The finger returns to his throat. The night sky fills with 
           the melodious sounds of dry heaving.

                                 ULA
                        Ugh. Stop! Stop now!
                                                            (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)           Telly continues to gag. It’s like a cat being strangled. Ula 
           slaps the back of his head, and he finally gives up.

                                 JOSH
                        You’ll be okay.

                                 TELLY
                        I don’t even know what they were!

                                 JOSH
                        Maybe...maybe it was aspirin. 

           Robyn fixes Josh with a withering look.

                                 ROBYN
                        Yeah, maybe that was where the drug 
                        dealer kept his hidden stash of 
                        illegal drugs, and also aspirin.

           EXT. FREEWAY

           Telly’s car pokes down the freeway at a glacial pace. Horns 
           blare as other vehicles slam on their brakes and swerve past.

           INT. TELLY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Wearing only a sports bra now, Ula wraps strands of her 
           shredded shirt around her mangled shoulder. 

                                 ULA
                        Go faster. 

                                 TELLY
                        I don’t know when this stuff will 
                        kick in! You want me going off to 
                        bat country at 80 miles an hour?

                                 ROBYN
                        God, I don’t believe this.

                                 JOSH
                        We’ll be okay. 

                                 ROBYN
                        Don’t be a dipshit, Josh. 

                                 JOSH
                        Wait, are you mad at me?

           She whirls around, eyes flashing, absolutely livid.

                        You took us to a drug dealer’s 
                        house, you dick!

                                 JOSH
                        But...but you said--

                                 ROBYN
                        I said, hey, let’s hang out! What 
                        part of that sounded like, hey, 
                        please take me to a scary fucking 
                        Die Hard villain’s Den of Death?

           Telly stares off into space, a dreamy expression on his face.

                                 TELLY
                        Heh. Die Hard is so great.

                                 ROBYN
                           (to Telly:)
                        And you! What fucking lane are you 
                        even in?

           The car is now straddling the two center lanes. Telly snaps 
           to attention and corrects their course just in time. 

           An awkward silence descends. At last Josh leans forward. 

                                 JOSH
                        Where are you taking us, anyway? 

           Ula tears off a strip of fabric with her teeth. 

                                 ULA
                        Is called the Nest. Is place to 
                        hide when you are in trouble, yes? 
                        If you have money. 

                                 JOSH
                        But why are we going there?

                                 ULA
                        Is where Gregor will be. 

                                 JOSH

THE NEST

           The Nest turns out to be a rundown tenement building, 
           indistinguishable from the rest of the urban sprawl. 

           Ula leads them to a heavy metallic door. Knocks. 

                                 TELLY
                        It’s like Jabba’s palace. 
                           (as Bib Fortuna:)
                        De wonna wonga! 

                                 JOSH
                        Dude, shut up. 

                                 TELLY
                        De Jabba wonga?

           Josh elbows him sharply, but Telly only giggles, helpless to 
           control himself. The massive dose of ecstasy kicking in. 

           The security slot snaps open and HENRI peers out owlishly. 

                                 HENRI
                        Ula. 

                                 ULA
                        Is Gregor here?

                                 HENRI
                        You know I can’t tell you that. 

                                 ULA
                        Open door. 

                                 HENRI
                        You also know the cover. Fifty per 
                        head, per night, no exceptions. 

           Ula sighs and pulls the pistol from her belt. Jams the muzzle 
           through the slot. Sounding terribly bored by all of this. 

                                 ULA
                        Open fucking door now. 

           INT. THE NEST - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           The interior of the building is filthy. Spiders running along 
           the walls, stagnant water pooling on the floor.
           (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                 GORMAN
                        Ula!

           A bear of a man elbows Henri aside, beaming widely. GORMAN is 
           as loyal as a Saint Bernard, and at least half as smart. 

                                 GORMAN
                        What’s with the arm, love? 

                                 ULA
                        Is long story. Gregor is here? 

                                 GORMAN
                        Yeah, top floor. Want me to--

                                 ULA
                           (points to the others:)
                        You watch them, yes? Do not let go! 

           She races up the stairs without a backwards glance. Josh, 
           Telly and Robyn turn to stare at Gorman. 

                                 GORMAN
                        Guys want a beer or something?

           Still sulking by the door, Henri whips out his cell phone.  

           INT. CEZAR’S LIVING ROOM

           Cezar’s body is slumped in the recliner. Grandma is outlined 
           against a halo of coagulating blood. Silence. 

           Then the phone starts ringing. Once. Twice. Three times. 

           And Cezar’s head jerks upright. 

           His hands move to his forehead. He tugs on his hair and a 
           flap of loose skin flops sideways, exposing glistening bone. 

           Miraculously, it seems the bullet grazed him, tracing the 
           curvature of his skull instead of punching through bone. 

           He stumbles to his feet. Grabs the trilling phone. 

                                 HENRI’S VOICE
                        Cezar? Thought you ought to know 
                        your bitch is down here at the 
                        Nest. And she’s packing heat. 

           Cezar drops the phone. Eyes widening.  

           He just spotted Grandma’s corpse. 
                                      (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)

THE NEST - HALLWAY

           Gorman leads them down the hall, past criminals and junkies, 
           psychopaths and space cadets. Every open doorway is a portal 
           into new worlds of depravity. 

                                 GORMAN
                        Over there’s Dan. We call him the 
                        Puppyfucker cuz of the time 
                        he...well, most people don’t like 
                        that story.  

           From the doorway, a heroin junkie eyeballs them hungrily. 

                                 METH BETH
                        Cute kids. You guys wanna party? 

                                 JOSH
                        No, ma’am. We sure don’t. 

                                 GORMAN
                        And that’s Billy Good-Rape--

                                 ROBYN
                        Why...why Good-Rape? 

                                 GORMAN
                        Cuz Billy’s handsome, of course!

           Billy nods in happy agreement. He is devilishly good-looking. 

                                 GORMAN
                        ...course, I suppose that don’t 
                        matter much when ol’ Billy’s 
                        hammering on your tailpipe...

           INT. GORMAN’S ROOM

           Gorman passes out beers. Josh and Robyn accept the drinks 
           reluctantly; Telly is already halfway through his can. 

                                 TELLY
                        Whoo. It’s fizzing on my tongue!

                        This is bad, Telly, really bad!

                        And would you stop trying to verb 
                        Hickenlooper? 

                                 ROBYN
                        What’s a Hickenlooper?

                                 JOSH
                        It’s nothing. 

                                 TELLY
                        It’s the guy who boned Josh’s 
                        girlfriend. Took her to Boner City, 
                        USA. Mount Bonerious.   

                                 ROBYN
                        Wait, you have a girlfriend? 

                                 JOSH
                        Ex-girlfriend! Ex!

                                 TELLY
                        Thanks to Chad Hickenlooper. 

                                 JOSH
                        Can we stop talking about Chad 
                        Fucks His Mother Hickenlooper? 

           He turns back to Robyn...but she’s already gone. 

           INT. MINIVAN / EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX

           DAD tries to ignore the CHILDREN in the backseat. They’re 
           singing along to an abysmally cheerful children’s CD. 

                                 CHILDREN
                           (singing along to a CD)
                        Being happy makes me happy! Being 
                        sad makes me sad! Being happy makes 
                        me happy! Are you happy? I am glad!

           Dad sighs heavily. His life sucks. 

           And it’s about to get worse. As they approach a familiar 
           apartment building, a ghoulish, bloodstained figure comes 
           striding out of the night, aiming a handgun right at them. 

                                 CEZAR
                        OUT OF THE FUCKING CAR, FUCKO!

           For a long beat, the only sound is Captain Imagination and 
           The Funtime Band. Then the kids start screaming. 
                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)           Cezar wrenches the door open and drags Dad out of the 
           driver’s seat. Still shrieking, the kids pile out the side. 

           The minivan tears off in a screech of burnt rubber, leaving 
           the family standing in the middle of the street. 

           Inside the van, Cezar absently reaches up and peels the flap 
           of torn skin back. It’s like a little fleshy sunroof. 

           He tugs harder and we hear his scalp tearing. At last he 
           gives up and pats the strip of hair and skin back into place. 

           He doesn’t turn off Captain Imagination and The Funtime Band. 

           INT. THE NEST - HALLWAY

           Josh hurries to catch up with Robyn. Spins her around. 

                                 ROBYN
                        What’s your problem?

                        What’s yours? You’re mad because, 
                        what, I used to have a girlfriend?

                        No, Josh, I’m mad because you got 
                        us kidnapped and dragged to a 
                        goddamn crackhouse!
                           (beat)
                        And because you have a girlfriend!

                                 JOSH
                        Okay, A) kidnapping--not part of 
                        the night’s itinerary, and B) had a 
                        girlfriend! Had! Past tense! 

           She slumps against the wall. Avoiding eye contact. 

                                 ROBYN
                        God, you don’t get it.

                        Where’s Telly? 

           INT. THE NEST - ANOTHER HALLWAY

           Telly stumbles down the corridor, grinning widely, following 
           the pulse of heavy bass music deeper into the building. 

           He arrives at the source: a room at the end of the hall, its 
           door thrown open, a screaming wall of music pouring out. 

           INT. THE NEST - JUNKIES’ ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Two JUNKIES are locked in a furious staring match. Tumblers 
           filled with liquor are arranged on the table between them.   

           Junkie #2 blinks...and both men grab for their glasses!

           They suck down the whiskey shots. Junkie #1 finishes a split-
           second faster and slams his tumbler down. 

                                 JUNKIE #1
                        Pay up, fooker!

           Junkie #2 presents his jaw. Junkie #1 hauls back and delivers 
           a haymaker to the chin. Both men bellow laughter. 

                                 JUNKIE #1
                        Not my fault you drink like a 
                        Welshman. Play again? 

                                 JUNKIE #2
                        Bloody fooking right. 

           But at that moment, they notice Telly standing in the hall. 

                                 JUNKIE #1
                        Oi! You!

                        Yeah, I wanna play Wotcher!

           Ula hasn’t even finished knocking before the door flies open, 
           revealing GREGOR. He’s brandishing a pump-action shotgun. 
                                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                 GREGOR
                        Happened to your arm? 

                                 ULA
                        Let me in, Gregor.
                           (She pushes past him.)
                        I got message you sent.  

           Gregor lights a cigarette. His speech is almost totally 
           Americanized, with only faint traces of a Slavic accent. 

                                 GREGOR
                        We’re good and truly fucked, I hope 
                        you realize that. Word on the 
                        street say Kenny Venice is looking 
                        for you. For both of us, probably. 

                                 ULA
                        For the database? 

                                 GREGOR
                        No, to trade Pokemon. Of fucking 
                        course that’s what he wants!

                                 ULA
                        Then...we sell it now, yes? 

           Gregor grabs a plastic USB flash drive off the desk and waves 
           it in her face. She flinches away. 

                                 GREGOR
                        Yeah, great plan! ‘Scuse me, sir, 
                        we stole this blackmail list from 
                        the most crooked motherfucker in 
                        Hollywood, and now he’s looking to 
                        kill whoever’s got a copy! Feel 
                        like making an offer? Anyone? 

                                 ULA
                        But the money...you promised! I am 
                        needing it now!

           Gregor sighs. Takes a drag on his cigarette.

                                 GREGOR
                        You don’t understand: Kenny Venice 
                        knows the people you don’t want to 
                        know. Those movies he made--the 
                        girl with the vampire boobs, the 
                        one with the flying shark--where do 
                        you think that money came from? 
                                      (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 ULA
                        I do not care. 

                                 GREGOR
                        You need to start caring! Because 
                        those people you don’t want to 
                        know, they’re out there looking for 
                        us right now! And you know why we 
                        don’t want them to find us? 

                                 ULA
                        Why? 

                                 GREGOR
                        BECAUSE THEY’RE THE PEOPLE YOU 
                        DON’T FUCKING WANT TO KNOW!

           Ula has heard enough. She whips out her pistol, aims at his 
           chest. Her hands are shaking...but just barely. 

                                 ULA
                        Then give me database! I sell it 
                        myself!

                                 GREGOR
                        Put that down, dummy.  

                                 ULA
                        GIVE IT! NOW!

           Gregor snorts and stuffs the flash drive into his pocket. 

                                 GREGOR
                        Christ’s sake, Ula. You forgetting 
                        I’m your goddamned brother? 

                                 ULA
                        Are you forgetting I was never 
                        liking you very much? 

           Gregor suddenly frowns. 

           And Ula pulls the trigger. BLAM! 

           Gregor’s lit cigarette lands on the ratty old mattress. 

           Ula retrieves the flash drive from her brother’s pocket. 

           She doesn’t notice the sliver of smoke already rising from 
           the mattress as the fire begins to spread.

THE NEST - JUNKIES’ ROOM

           Telly and the junkies grab their tumblers and begin chugging 
           whiskey. They’re neck-and-neck...it’s too close to 
           call...they slam their glasses down on the table...

           And it’s a dead three-way tie. They stare at each other, 
           confused, wondering who just won. The beat drags out. 

           Telly reaches across the table and slugs Junkie #1. 

           The junkies stare at him, dumbfounded...then they erupt with 
           laughter. Telly joins in happily. Having a grand old time.

           A second later, Josh comes barging into the room.

                                 JOSH
                        I FOUND HIM!

                                 TELLY
                        Josh! Wanna play Wotcher?

                                 JOSH
                        What? No! God! Get up!

           He drags Telly to his feet. Telly immediately begins rubbing 
           Josh’s jaw, seemingly hypnotized by the texture of his skin.

                                 JOSH
                        Okay, not helping. You need to get--
                        stop touching me!--get a hold of 
                        yourself! Telly! 

                                 TELLY
                        Dude, I’m feeling really weird 
                        right now. I think I need to go to 
                        a hospital. Or a dance club.

                                 JOSH
                        We’re getting you out of here.

           Telly waves to his buddies as Josh drags him out of the room. 
           The junkies shrug. Refill their glasses.

           INT. THE NEST - LOBBY

           In the corner of the lobby, Telly lovingly caresses the 
           wallpaper. Josh and Robyn exchange a helpless glance.  

           Ula comes bouncing down the stairs, tucking the flash drive 
           into her back pocket. She smiles sweetly at Gorman. 
                                         (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                 ULA
                        We go now. Thank you.

                                 GORMAN
                        C’mon, stay for a drink!

           Ula throws open the heavy security door...

           And Cezar is standing right there. Aiming a handgun the size 
           of God’s dick at her forehead.

           Ula ducks just as the gun roars. The bullet opens a staring 
           hole where Gorman’s nose used to be. Right behind him, Telly 
           and Josh are splattered with globs of red stuff.

           Ula slams the door shut. Bullets ping off the metal plating.

           Josh and Robyn are frozen. Telly screams like a tea kettle.

           At that moment, we hear footsteps pounding against the 
           stairs. Voices screaming. Something about a fire. Panic.

           And people come pouring down the stairwell.

           Ula tries to hold them back, but the crowd surges past her, 
           wrenching open the door and stumbling out into the night.

           Cezar forces his way through, struggling against the tide.

           Ula aims her pistol, but she can’t get a clean shot off. She 
           gives up and races back up the stairs instead.

           Cezar locks eyes with Josh. A snarl of horrible recognition.

                                 ROBYN
                        Oh, fuck this.

           All three of them sprint up the stairs after Ula.

           INT. THE NEST - STAIRWELL / CORRIDOR

           A wretched hive of scum and villainy comes streaming down the 
           stairs past them: crackheads, naked women, mob bosses, 
           leather daddies, and goons of every shape and size.

           Cezar is only a few flights below them now. The flap of torn 
           skin atop his head flops and dances like an angler’s lure.

           The crowd begins to thin out, just as Ula turns the corner...

           ...coming face-to-face with a raging inferno!
                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                 ULA
                        Back down! Back down!

           Robyn glances down. Cezar is only one flight beneath them.

           Ula charges down the nearest hallway. The others follow.

           Tongues of flame crawl across the ceiling as the fire burns 
           down through the floor above them. They fight their way 
           through curtains of smoke and drifting embers.

           Ula reaches the window at the end of the hall and kicks out 
           the glass. She dives through, out into the night beyond...

           ...landing on the building’s wrought iron fire escape.

           Cezar comes stumbling out of the smoky stairwell, coughing 
           and wheezing. He fires off a volley of wild shots.

           The bullets whine past as Robyn deftly slips through the 
           window. Josh lunges after her. Then it’s Telly’s turn. 

           EXT. THE NEST - FIRE ESCAPE - CONTINUOUS

           Except Telly doesn’t fit.

           He gets halfway through the opening before sticking fast. His 
           eyes bugging out of his head. Totally Winnie The Pooh’d.

           Josh and Robyn grab his hands and tug, just as a pair of 
           bullet holes punch through the wall on either side of them.

                                 JOSH
                        Suck it in! Suck it in!

           Telly sucks it in. He pops free, tumbles to the platform. 

           The momentum carries Josh halfway over the railing before he 
           catches himself. The ground spinning fifty feet below. 

           Robyn grabs his shoulder and drags him down the staircase. 

                                 ROBYN
                        Come on!

           Far below them, Ula has almost reached the ground level.

           Cezar slithers through the burning window. His clothes are on 
           fire. He doesn’t seem to care.  

                                 CEZAR
                        UUUUUUUUUUUUUULA!
                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)           Twenty feet lower, they glance up at the sound of his voice 
           and see the pistol pointing straight down at them. 

                                 JOSH
                        Look out!

           He slams Robyn and Telly against the building just as Cezar 
           fires. Bullets scream past, ricocheting off the steel bars. 

           Beneath them, Ula is also pressed flat against the concrete 
           wall. She aims her pistol. 

                                 JOSH
                        Wait, we’re up here--!

           Ula ignores him. She squeezes the trigger just as they 
           scramble to the opposite side of the platform. 

           Ula matches their movements, using them as unwilling shields 
           between Cezar and herself. Sparks flaring all around her.   

                                 JOSH
                        LEFT! LEFT!

           They throw themselves to the left just as Ula launches a 
           second volley skyward. Another narrow miss.  

           Right above them, Cezar is reloading. He clicks the clip into 
           place and aims between the steel mesh, squinting furiously. 

                                 JOSH
                        NO, RIGHT! RIGHT!

           A mad dash in the opposite direction. Cezar’s bullets raining 
           down around them. But this time we notice something: as they 
           throw their bodies around, the fire escape is moving. 

           And now we see the reason. The fire escape’s upper moorings 
           have torn completely free from the imploding building. 

           Cezar finally realizes he’s on fire. He calmly pats out the 
           flames. Shakes his scalded hand. Terribly inconvenienced. 

           FIZZZ! At that moment, one of Ula’s bullets catches his 
           outstretched hand, cleaving through all four fingers. 

           The severed digits go bouncing down through the fire escape. 
           Telly bats an index finger away, shrieking. 

           Cezar snarls. Spitting bullets with reckless abandon now. 

           Telly flings himself against the outer railing, and the 
           entire fire escape lurches several feet in response. 
                                                            (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)           Josh and Robyn glance up in surprise. See the top of the fire 
           escape swinging freely. Realize what they have to do. 

           They throw themselves against the railing. Again and again.

           And with a torturous squeal, the last mooring gives way and 
           the fire escape pitches sideways. It’s not quite a freefall, 
           but they’re still dropping at an alarming rate. 

           Everyone threads their arms and legs through the bars of the 
           collapsing structure. Trying to hold on tight. 

           Cezar hooks his legs through the railing and swings free. 
           With his uninjured hand, he takes careful aim--

           At the same time, Ula draws a bead on Cezar--  

                                 JOSH
                        WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU 
                        PEOPLE?

           Ula and Cezar fire simultaneously. Twin thunderclaps. 

           Josh nearly loses his grip as the bullets tear past. He 
           swings wildly, holding on with only one hand now. 

           SPLAT! Cezar’s left ear blows away, leaving only a ruined red 
           nubbin behind. This only pisses him off more.  

           Robyn reaches for Josh’s hand. Just misses it. 

           The top of the fire escape connects with the neighboring 
           building. With a shriek of steel, the structure twists around 
           and jackknifes sharply, folding in on itself. 

           The violent motion flings Josh and Robyn to the ground.  

           Cezar comes slithering down the structure, his face a rictus 
           mask of hatred. He reaches for Telly’s leg.

           Telly kicks wildly, trying to wriggle over the side. 

                                 ROBYN
                        Jump! 

                                 JOSH
                        Karate-chop him!

           Cezar’s hand closes around Telly’s throat. Choking him. 

           Ula pushes past Josh and Robyn, raises her gun, and fires a 
           single shot. At this range, there’s no way to miss. 
           (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)           The bullet cuts horizontally across Cezar’s throat, opening a 
           bright red line. He topples over backwards. 

           Telly plummets to the ground. Josh and Robyn help him up...

           ...only to find that Ula’s pistol is now pointing at them!

                                 ULA
                        Is time to go. 

                                 JOSH
                        What? You were just shooting at us! 
                        We’re not going anywhere with you! 

           She thumbs the hammer back. Aims at his crotch. 

                                 JOSH
                           (instantly)
                        Where are we going? 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           The parking lot is pure pandemonium, teeming with shaken 
           residents and curious onlookers drawn by the inferno. 

           Drifting through the crowd are four GOONS wearing suits and 
           earpieces. They’re scanning faces. Searching for someone.

           One of the Goons spots Ula and murmurs into his earpiece. All 
           four of them begin to converge on their position. 

           Ula keeps walking, faster now. Trying to play it cool. 

                                 JOSH
                        Hey, are those guys following--?

                                 ULA
                        Yes. Run.

                                 JOSH
                        You mean run like really run?

                                 ULA
                        RUN!

           They sprint for Telly’s car.

           Telly hops behind the wheel, while Josh and Robyn dive into 
           the backseat. Ula locks the doors.

           Now the goons surround the car. Banging on the windows.
                                                      (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 GOON #1
                        Open the door, lady!

                                 ULA
                        Drive! Drive now!

           But Telly is busy flipping through radio stations. He finds a 
           pulsing techno song and sighs happily. That’s more like it.

           Frantic now, Ula checks her pistol clip. Empty. 

                                 GOON #2
                        C’mon, lady, Mr. Venice just wants 
                        to talk! That’s all!

           In the backseat, Josh notices something stuck in Robyn’s 
           hair. While she’s distracted, he carefully plucks it out.

           It’s one of Cezar’s severed fingers. With a shudder, Josh 
           sticks the bloody digit in the ashtray. 

                                 ULA
                        Drive goddamned car!

                                 TELLY
                        I can’t! I’ll run over these guys!

                                 ULA
                        Yes! Is point!

                                 GOON #2
                        Kid, if you don’t unlock this door--

           But as the Goon speaks, a pair of blazing headlights appear 
           in the darkness behind him. And they’re getting bigger.

           The white minivan plows into the side of Telly’s car. 

           The inside of the car is pure chaos. Glass flies everywhere. 
           Ula’s forehead bounces off the dashboard, knocking her out 
           cold. Goon #1 goes rolling across the hood of the vehicle.

           Telly straightens back up...

                                 TELLY
                        I think that shit just kicked in! 

           ...and finds himself face-to-face with Goon #2, who has been 
           wedged between the two vehicles. He’s dead as disco. 

           The minivan tears free from the car with a shriek of twisted 
           metal. And behind the wheel we see--
                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)           CEZAR. Driving with his stump hand while using his remaining 
           fingers to pinch his severed throat shut.

                                 ROBYN
                        No fucking way.

                                 JOSH
                        GO! GO!

           Telly floors the accelerator just as the minivan lurches 
           forward for another strike. One of the Goons is still 
           clinging to the hood of Telly’s car, while another Goon leaps 
           onto their rear bumper to avoid the speeding van. 

           The minivan misses them by inches. It whips around with a 
           squeal of burning rubber.

           As the two vehicles roar into the distance, the remaining 
           Goon pulls a cell phone from his pocket. Punches a button. 

                                 GOON #4
                        Mr. Venice? We got a problem. 

           INT. MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           As Kenny Venice listens, his expression slowly darkens. 

                                 VENICE
                        I’ll call the boys. 

           EXT. CITY STREETS

           The minivan gains ground quickly against Telly’s crappy 
           little car. The van surges forward, striking the rear bumper 
           that Goon #3 is balancing atop. Telly’s car jolts forward. 

           The bumper tears free, clips the minivan’s grille a dozen 
           yards back, and goes spinning away in a shower of sparks.

           Now Goon #3 is hanging onto the trunk by his fingernails, his 
           feet skidding against the pavement. He loses his grip--

           Cezar doesn’t even attempt to swerve out of the way. The 
           minivan THUMPS over the tumbling body without slowing down.

           Now we INTERCUT between the street and--
           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)           INT. TELLY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Telly has turned around in his seat to watch the dude get 
           creamed. The Goon on the hood bangs on the windshield.

                                 GOON #1
                        WATCH THE ROAD! WATCH THE ROAD!

           They’re seconds away from plowing into a garbage truck. Telly 
           yanks on the wheel and they shear past the truck with inches 
           to spare. 

           On the hood, Goon #1 howls miserably as he whips back and 
           forth like a pendulum.

           Keeping his eyes on the road, Telly reaches forward and turns 
           up the music. Bobbing his head ever so slightly.

           The minivan accelerates around the opposite side of the 
           garbage truck, picking up speed. It veers toward them, 
           angling to ram the smaller car into the nearest wall.

           Telly gooses the brakes and slides in the opposite direction, 
           narrowly darting behind the minivan. The van skews back 
           toward them, braking hard, chasing them right into...

           ONCOMING TRAFFIC. Now they’re driving on the wrong side of 
           the road, swerving and weaving through the vehicles streaking 
           toward them.

           sideswipes them, knocking them back into the danger zone.

           The Goon on the hood rolls onto his side, pulls a pistol from 
           his shoulder holster, and squeezes off a pair of shots in 
           Cezar’s general direction. Both shots go wide.

           Cezar grins, takes his hand from his throat--a fresh spurt of 
           blood splatters the windshield--and flips him the bird.

           Meanwhile, Telly’s car has been forced into the path of a 
           school bus. A short school bus, to be precise. 

           Telly cranks the wheel. The car swerves sideways...

           ...but the Goon continues onward, his momentum carrying him 
           forward through the air, his arms pinwheeling helplessly...

           ...right into the path of the school bus! CRUNCH.

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS

           Inside the short bus, two dozen Special Olympians shriek at 
           the bloodstained corpse embedded in their windshield. 

           EXT. CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           Telly’s car blasts past a black sedan headed in the opposite 
           direction. The sedan brakes sharply, skidding in a tight 
           circle, then accelerates after them. Joining the chase. 

           The minivan roars across the center divider and smashes into 
           them again. Telly fights for control as they plow through a 
           series of parking meters. Quarters plink off the windshield. 

           Suddenly he mashes on the brakes. Twists the wheel sharply to 
           the left. And the car barrels into an...

           EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           They speed down the narrow corridor, scattering trash in 
           their wake. The minivan rockets into the alley right behind 
           them, followed by the dark sedan.

                        Alleys are always shortcuts.

           The glare of the headlights suddenly reveals a brick wall 
           approaching at an alarming speed. Telly slams on the brakes, 
           but there’s not enough stopping room. 

           They plow into the wall.

           A second later, the van hits them. Another bracing impact.

           Cezar--obviously no fan of seat belts--is flung through his 
           windshield. He sails over their car, slaps against the brick 
           wall like a sack of wet meat, and tumbles onto the hood.

           Everyone inside the car is groaning, stirring, but nobody 
           seems seriously hurt. Even Ula is starting to come around.

           On the hood, Cezar’s body spasms. He sits bolt upright.

                                 JOSH
                        OH, COME ON!

           Slowly, Cezar’s head rotates to face them. He has become a 
           grinning ghoul, bloodstained and absolutely mad. 

           Josh grabs Ula’s shoulder, shakes her desperately.

                                 JOSH
                        Where’s the gun?

           On his hands and knees now, Cezar begins crawling toward the 
           shattered windshield. Wheezing blood. 

           A flashlight beam hits Cezar. He squints into the light. 

           Then a starburst of blood opens on his shoulder, followed by 
           the crack of a pistol. Cezar collapses in a sitting position 
           against the wall, his whole body shuddering. 

           The shooter lowers his gun. 

           TUCK is a walking spastic tic, overstimulated and dangerous. 
           His partner BERRY looks carved out of goddamn granite. 

           Together the two men advance on the ruined vehicles.

           Tuck leans toward his partner. Lowers his voice.

                                 TUCK
                        That’s gotta be her, right?

                        Make the call, I’ll do clean-up.

           Berry whips out a cell phone and turns away. 

           On the hood, Cezar’s eyes open. Still wheezing softly.

           Tuck comes closer. Prods the wound on the drug dealer’s 
           throat with his finger, watches the blood bubble up. 

                                 TUCK
                        Jeez, you look like a friggin’ Pez

                        like that? What do you think? Maybe 
                        an hour?

           Cezar just stares at him dully. Tuck smiles.

           Then Tuck hooks his fingers into the wound and tears. Cezar’s 
           throat opens like a drawstring purse. Blood goes everywhere.

                        Chad Hickenlooper is stupid. I was 
                        stupid. You know what I mean. The 
                        drugs. The pretending to be cool. 

                                 ROBYN
                        Yeah, well, I wouldn’t have hung 
                        out with you if you were cool. 

           She meets his gaze for a moment longer, then looks away. 

           EXT. MANSION DRIVEWAY

           The sedan rolls to a stop in front of Venice’s estate. Tuck 
           opens the door and motions them across the driveway.

           INT. MANSION FOYER

           Venice’s butler leads them past Corey Feldman, stoned beyond 
           belief and playing Halo. The porn star is asleep beside him. 

                                 JOSH
                        Hey, it’s whatshisname! From The 
                        Goonies! Hey, Mr. Goonie! Help us!

           Corey turns and fixes him with a withering glare.

                                 COREY FELDMAN
                        My name is Corey. Dick.

           And without warning, we CUT AWAY TO--

           EXT. A BEAUTIFUL FOREST - DAY

           Big fluffy clouds hover above an expanse of pristine, 
           untouched wilderness. Untouched until now, that is. 

           A group of swarthy-looking LOGGERS are preparing to cut into 
           the tallest pine tree, their saw blades held at the ready.

                                 MANLY VOICE
                        I wouldn’t do that, hombre.

           The loggers whirl around to reveal...

           JACK LUMBER. He has the hangdog look of a former action star 
           gone to seed, puffy and swollen in all the wrong places.

                        Jack Lumber. Park Ranger around 
                        these parts. And unless I see a 
                        logging permit, you boys just 
                        stepped in it deep.

                                 LOGGER #2
                        Ooh, a Park Ranger! Watch out, 
                        guys, he’s gonna issue a citation!

                                 JACK LUMBER
                        I’ve got your citation right here.

           One of the loggers steps forward and tries to shove Jack’s 
           chest. With a clumsy flip of the wrist, Jack sends his 
           attacker flying across the clearing.

                                 JACK LUMBER
                        Your kind will never understand. 
                        True power doesn’t come from tools. 
                        It comes from the land.

           The loggers rush him, and so begins one of the slowest and 
           least-convincing fight scenes ever committed to celluloid. 

           Jack Lumber stomps and flails around like a drunken grizzly 
           bear, and the loggers do their best to throw themselves in 
           the path of his pudgy aikido justice.

           We pull back to reveal that we’re actually watching a movie 
           being projected on the wall of...

           INT. SCREENING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kenny Venice and a meek-looking EDITOR sit behind an editing 
           desk, watching Jack Lumber bitchslap his way to victory.

           Venice doesn’t notice the prisoners. He scowls at the screen.

                                 VENICE
                        Whoa, back up a tick. Look, that 
                        punch ain’t even coming near him! 
                        And what the hell is that?

           Onscreen, a visibly sweaty Jack has his arms around a logger.

                                 EDITOR
                        Um, a bearhug?

                        It’s a goddamn hug all right. It’s 
                        just about the most tender, pecker-
                        pullingest thing I ever seen.

           Telly peers up at the ruined moose head on the wall. 

                                 TELLY
                        What the fuck happened to your 
                        moose? 

           Venice wheels around. His eyes narrow. 

                                 VENICE
                        You must be Ula.

           EXT. MANSION BALCONY

           The crescent-shaped balcony overlooks Venice’s Olympic-sized 
           swimming pool. The water sparkles darkly beneath them. 

           Smiling pleasantly, Venice runs his hands across Ula’s body, 
           turning out her pockets, lingering on all the best spots.  

                                 VENICE
                        So. I know you and your commie 
                        brother are the ones who stole my 
                        golden goose. You came outta that 
                        burning building and he didn’t. Far 
                        as I’m concerned, that makes you 
                        the fucking prom queen. 

                                 JOSH
                        Wait...who’s got a goose? 

           Venice gives Ula an encouraging nod. She grudgingly explains. 

                                 ULA
                        Is a database. Of criminals. 

                                 VENICE
                        Oh, it’s more’n that. It’s dirt on 
                        everyone who ever fucked with me.   
                        And it don’t belong to you.   

           His hand rests on Ula’s breast just a second too long, and 
           she shoves him away. Venice only laughs. 

                                 VENICE
                        You are one mean squirt of 
                        sarsaparilla, that’s for sure.

                        Course, I heard the only thing you 
                        got in the triple-digits is your 
                        titties, so I’m thinking maybe you 
                        ain’t the ringleader here.
                           (His gaze falls on Josh.)
                        And I’m thinking maybe you are.

                                 JOSH
                        Whoa, hey, we don’t even know this 
                        crazy bitch! Honest!

           Venice holds up his hand for silence. His expression grim.

                                 VENICE
                        You know much about ranching, son?

                                 JOSH
                        No, sir.

                                 VENICE
                        That’s where I made my money, ‘fore 
                        I came out here. You’d think it’d 
                        be different, cows and movies, but 
                        it ain’t, not really. It’s all 
                        about keeping the herd pointing in 
                        the right direction. See, every now 
                        ’n then, you’ll run across some 
                        fussy cuss of a cow that just don’t 
                        wanna cooperate. You herd her left, 
                        she goes right. You stop for the 
                        night, she turns into the Marco 
                        Fucking Polo of bovines. And 
                        problem is, cows ain’t got a 
                        fiddler’s fart worth of common 
                        sense. They see one of their own 
                        heading into a ravine or bumbling 
                        into some river, they’ll follow 
                        right along. And before you know 
                        it, half your herd’s dead ’n gone. 
                        So what do you think you do?

                                 JOSH
                        I guess I don’t know. Sir. 

                                 VENICE
                        I’m gonna tell you. You take that 
                        troublemaker over the next ridge, 
                        away from where the others can see, 
                        and you put a bullet right between 
                        them big old brown eyes. Even if it 
                        kills you to do it.

                        Even if she’s one fine piece of 
                        jerky. Cuz once she’s gone, them 
                        other cows’ll just...fall in line. 

                                 JOSH
                        Sir, Mr. Venice, if I had your 
                        database, you have to believe me, 
                        I’d give it to you! I would! 

           Venice exhales in disgust. He gestures to Tuck and Berry. 

                                 VENICE
                        Oh well. Kill ’em.

                        What? 

                                 TUCK
                        Um, seriously, sir? 

                                 VENICE
                        I said kill these sonsabitches!

           The four prisoners start protesting. Backing away. 

           Tuck draws his pistol, aims at Josh. Then Telly. Then Robyn. 

           They’re all talking over each other. Begging for their lives. 

           Venice ambles back inside. He’s already lost interest. 

           Tuck hesitates, his gun still see-sawing between targets. He 
           glances at his partner. Ever so slightly, Berry shrugs. 

           And Tuck pulls the trigger. 

           The back of Ula’s head vanishes in a puff of red vapor. She 
           tumbles lifelessly over the railing.  

           INT. MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Outside the window, the body lands in the swimming pool, 
           sending a geyser of water skyward. 

           Corey Feldman pauses his video game and goes to the window. 
           Sees the dead woman floating in a halo of darkening water. 

                                 COREY FELDMAN
                        Whoa. 
                                                       (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)           EXT. MANSION BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

           Sighing, Tuck takes careful aim at Josh’s forehead...

           The door flies open and Venice comes storming back out. 

                                 VENICE
                        THE HELL YOU THINK YOU’RE DOING?

                                 TUCK
                        But...but...you said...

                                 VENICE
                        I didn’t say kill ’em here, you 
                        goddamn dipshit! I got neighbors 
                        right up the road!

           He leans over the railing. Winces at the body in the pool. 

                                 VENICE
                        Aw Christ, she went in the pool! 
                        Look at that! Every time I clean 
                        that filter, I’m gonna be picking 
                        out bits of that bitch’s brains!  

                                 TUCK
                        I’m sorry, sir, I thought you--

                                 VENICE
                        Thought I what, got tired of lawn 
                        gnomes, figured I’d decorate the 
                        place with dead fucking bitches 
                        instead? That what you thought? 

           Tuck hangs his head and doesn’t say anything at all. 

                                 VENICE
                        You get them off my property, do 
                        ’em somewhere else! And take the 
                        fucking Floating Wonder with you!

           He starts back inside when he notices Josh’s cold expression. 

                                 VENICE
                        What? You got something to say? 
                           (Nope.)
                        Didn’t think so. 

           He slams the sliding door hard enough to make everybody jump. 
                                            (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)           EXT. MANSION DRIVEWAY

           Tuck and Berry lead Robyn down the driveway at gunpoint. 

           Behind them, Josh and Telly are struggling to carry Ula’s 
           soggy corpse. The body keeps sliding loose, flopping around. 

                                 TELLY
                        I think some brain just fell out. 

                                 JOSH
                        What? Where?  

                                 TELLY
                        I kinda stepped on it. 

                                 JOSH
                        Oh, goddamn it, Telly. 

           Berry sticks Robyn in the backseat of the sedan, slams the 
           door, then comes around and unlocks the trunk. 

           They heave the body into the trunk. Ula’s legs are akimbo, 
           her miniskirt hiking up. Josh attempts to close her legs. 

                                 JOSH
                           (saying a few words:)
                        Sorry, Miss Ula. We didn’t really 
                        get to know you, but you sure--

                                 TUCK
                        Get the fuck in, Ghost Whisperer. 

                                 JOSH
                        What, in there? Are you serious? 

           Tuck raises his pistol. That’s how serious he is. 

           Without warning, Josh slaps the gun aside and shoves Tuck. 
           The mercenary stutters backward, and Josh throws a punch...

           But Tuck grabs his wrist. Twists him around easily. Throws 
           him to the ground. He kicks Josh savagely. 

           Inside the car, Robyn bangs on the window. 

                                 ROBYN
                        LEAVE HIM ALONE!

           With a roar of anger, Telly lumbers toward Tuck... 
                                 (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)           Tuck steps aside neatly, and Telly goes rolling down the 
           driveway with a squawk. 

           Tuck hauls Josh to his feet, gives him one last slap, then 
           shoves him into the trunk with Ula. He points to Telly. 

                                 TUCK
                        You too, Big and Beefy. 

           Telly miserably climbs into the trunk beside Josh. Shoving 
           the corpse aside. Shifting and jockeying for position. 

                                 JOSH
                        Wait, we’re not--!

           Tuck slams the trunk door, and we hear their muffled howls. 

           EXT. FREEWAY - LATER

           The mercs burn down the freeway. Neither of them saying 
           anything. In the back, Robyn looks practically catatonic. 

           And for the first and only time, Berry speaks up. 

                                 BERRY
                        Think Mr. Vincent would mind if we 
                        fuck her a little bit first? 

           Tuck shrugs. Bored. Like he’s discussing the weather. 

                                 TUCK
                        Who’s gonna tell him?

           Behind them, Robyn slowly blinks. Comes to life. 

                                 ROBYN
                        Wait, what?

           INT. TRUNK

           The trunk is about as pleasant as a packed asshole. Ula’s 
           corpse keeps sliding over to rest on Josh’s face. 

                                 TELLY
                        Josh! 

                                 JOSH
                        What?
           (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                 TELLY
                        Can you feel those vibrations in 
                        the road? Those ba-bumps? We can 
                        figure out where they’re taking us! 

                                 JOSH
                        You’re wasted. And you totally got 
                        that idea from Sneakers. 

                                 TELLY
                           (dreamily)
                        Oh, yeah. Hey, we should watch 
                        Sneakers after this is over. 

           This surprises Josh. He twists around to peer at his friend.

                                 JOSH
                        You really think we’re going to get 
                        out of this okay? 

                                 TELLY
                        Sure we will. 

                                 JOSH
                        Why?

                                 TELLY
                           (no hesitation)
                        Because we’re with you. And you’re 
                        like the smartest guy I know. 
                        You’ll think of something. 

           Josh doesn’t know what to say to this. His voice is quiet.

                                 JOSH
                        I’m not thinking of anything yet.

           EXT. CIRCE FOODS 

           Circe Foods is a meat processing plant, a squat monstrosity 
           belching smoke into the night sky. A cartoon pig on the 
           billboard is holding a knife and fork and licking his lips.

           The black sedan pulls around to the back of the plant and 
           honks twice. A loading door rumbles open. 

           GIDEON strolls out of the plant, hands in his pockets. 

                                 GIDEON
                        Tuck and Berry! You niggas here for 
                        pay or play?
                                              (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                 TUCK
                        Bit of both. You got another Puppy 
                        Run tonight? 

                                 GIDEON
                        It’s Friday, ain’t it? You bring me 
                        any puppies?

           Tuck pops the trunk. Gideon sneers down at Josh and Telly. 

                                 GIDEON
                        Yeah, they’ll work. Everyone likes 
                        the fat ones...knick ’em just right 
                        and they’re lawn sprinklers, go all 
                        night long, just wicka wicka wicka. 
                           (He prods Ula’s corpse.)
                        See you got some Kibble, too. 

                                 TUCK
                        You know how it goes. So...?

           Gideon pretends to think for a moment. 

                                 GIDEON
                        Hundred for the pair. And I’ll 
                        mulch the bitch for free.

                                 TUCK
                        Come on, a couple of young dudes, 
                        tons of stamina, they’re worth a 
                        hundred apiece, easy. How about a 
                        buck-fifty for the pair?

                                 GIDEON
                        How about fuck yourself? You don’t 
                        Jew the only game in town, man!

           Tuck exhales angrily. Exchanges a look with his partner. 

                                 TUCK
                        Okay, okay, tell you what: hundred 
                        for the boys...if you get rid of 
                        the bitch in the back, too. We’ll 
                        be done with her in two, three 
                        hours tops. Whaddya say?

           Gideon peers through the window at Robyn. Waves to her. 

                                 GIDEON
                        That’s a cute one. Okay, listen, 
                        bring her back alive, I’ll do $150.
                                      (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                 TUCK
                        You’re a man of class and taste. 

           Gideon peels three fifties from a roll of bills. 

                                 GIDEON
                        I’m a nigga with needs. Seriously, 
                        I want that pussy in one piece. 

           Tuck pockets the money and climbs back into the sedan. Gideon 
           pulls a pistol from his belt and motions to Josh. 

                                 GIDEON
                        Get that bitch outta the trunk. 

           Josh and Telly clamber out. They awkwardly lift Ula’s body. 

           Gideon slams the trunk, and the sedan pulls away. Robyn’s 
           pale face appears briefly in the rear window. 

                                 JOSH
                        Robyn!

           But she’s already gone. 

           INT. PROCESSING FLOOR

           The inside of the plant is a nightmarish tangle of conveyor 
           belts, dicing machines, and vats of bloody broth. Gutted pig 
           carcasses swing freely from hooks on the ceiling. 

                                 TELLY
                        Poor piggies. 

           Gideon closes the door. Points to a nearby conveyor belt. 

                                 GIDEON
                        Right up there, pups. 

           They hoist the corpse onto the belt and step back. 

                                 GIDEON
                        I’m impressed. Y’all are handling 
                        this like men, straight up. 

                                 JOSH
                        Handling what? What’s going on? 

           Gideon realizes they’re clueless. He flashes a wide grin. 
                                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 GIDEON
                        Well. That makes things easier. 
                        C’mon, let’s get y’all ready. 

           He leads them down a darkened corridor, deeper into the 
           plant. Until they’re swallowed by the shadows. 

           EXT. STOP-N-SLEEP MOTEL

           The Stop-N-Sleep is the sort of crummy little joint that 
           charges by the hour. Just the way Tuck and Berry like it. 

           Berry opens the backseat. Robyn comes flying out like a 
           banshee, scratching and clawing. With a chuckle, Berry shoves 
           her to the ground. Grabs the scruff of her jacket.

           Together, the two men drag her inside the motel room. 

           INT. GRIMY HALLWAY

           Gideon leads them down a flight of stairs. The walls down 
           here are cracked, dripping condensation. Dungeon-like. 

                                 GIDEON
                        What size feet you got?
                           (They don’t understand.)
                        Your feet, homes! You a 10? 11? 

           The boys nod helplessly. Gideon reaches into a supply closet, 
           then thrusts two pairs of roller skates into their hands. 

           Josh and Telly stare at the skates. Uncomprehending. 

                                 GIDEON
                        The Puppy Run, we kinda got themes. 
                        This week’s disco. Can y’all skate?

           Telly nods eagerly. Josh is frowning at his skates. They’ve 
           been modified with locking metal ankle braces. 

                                 JOSH
                        Why are they, um, scary?

                                 GIDEON
                        My man...we can do this the easy 
                        way or the other way. How about you 
                        just put them things on your feet? 

           Gideon is still tapping the pistol against his thigh, so Josh 
           reluctantly sits down and exchanges his sneakers for the 
           bizarre skates. Beside him, Telly does the same. 
                                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)           Gideon kneels and clamps the skates shut. 

                                 GIDEON
                        Now the thing y’all gotta remember 
                        out there is to put on a good show. 
                        Get the crowd into it, you know? 

                                 JOSH
                        Crowd? 

           Instead of answering, Gideon hauls them to their feet. 
           Unlocks a sliding metal gate. Shoves them through. 

           Wobbling, fighting for balance, they roll into the darkness. 

           And Gideon slams the gate behind them. 

           INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS

           As their eyes adjust to the gloom, the boys realize they’re 
           not alone. There are at least ten other PRISONERS in this 
           filthy little room, hobos and thugs and greaseballs. Their 
           expressions are hollow, hopeless, terrified. 

           And they all have roller skates clamped to their feet. 

                                 JOSH
                        Um. Hi. 
                           (Nobody responds.)
                        So...what’s the deal here? 

           The darkness shifts, and an absolute mountain of a man 
           emerges, scarred and bulging with muscle. THE MEXICAN.

                                 THE MEXICAN
                        The deal, pendejo, is that we are 
                        all going to fucking die. 

                                 JOSH
                        ...oh. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM 

           Robyn is motionless atop a grimy, heart-shaped vibrating bed, 
           handcuffed to the bedposts, a ball gag stuffed in her mouth. 

           Berry enters the room, humming brightly, carrying a silver 
           briefcase. He sets it down, snaps it open...

           ...exposing every sex toy ever invented. 
                                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)           Robyn sees the contents of the case. Her eyes widen. 

           Berry drops a quarter into the bed’s coin slot. The vibrating 
           mattress lurches to life, and a speaker begins to play that 
           staple of wedding receptions everywhere: THE CHICKEN DANCE. 

           As the song continues to play, we cut between this room and--

           INT. PROCESSING FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Stifling a yawn, Gideon turns a knob on the control panel. 
           Beneath him, the machinery rumbles to life. Giant mixers 
           start turning. Dicing blades beat out a furious rhythm. 

           And the conveyor belt carries Ula’s body forward. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A barechested Tuck runs his hand across the row of dildos 
           lovingly arranged on the table. Picking just the right one. 

           On the bed, Robyn whimpers. Straining against her restraints. 

           INT. PROCESSING FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           High-pressure hoses blast Ula’s body. She reaches the top of 
           the ramp and tumbles onto a second belt. Just ahead is the 
           dicing machine, with its rows of whirring blades. 

           As she enters the machine, splotches of blood and clumps of 
           hair are tossed against the plastic spray-guard. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Berry emerges from the bathroom, naked, his entire body 
           glistening under what looks like several coats of baby oil.

           He flashes Robyn a toothy smile.

           INT. PROCESSING FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           We follow Ula’s severed hand along the conveyor belt. It tips 
           over the edge, tumbling into an industrial-sized funnel. 

           At the bottom of the funnel is another set of spinning 
           blades, like a giant garbage disposal. And as the hand slowly 
           tumbles toward the steel teeth, we CUT BACK TO--
                                                              (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)
           (cid:13)           INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Tuck moves to Berry’s side. Runs a finger along his gleaming 
           pectorals. Then he reaches down, out of the frame, and gives 
           a few gentle tugs on Berry’s other gun. And of course, these 
           tugs sync up perfectly with The Chicken Dance. 

           Berry never takes his eyes off Robyn. 

           INT. PROCESSING FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           The only feature recognizable amidst the red pulp is a tiny 
           bit of finger, no more than the first knuckle. It jitters 
           along another conveyor belt, until it’s dumped into--

           A giant mixing vat, slowly churning the sludgy pink broth. A 
           cartoon pig on the side of the vat gives us a thumbs-up. 

           Goodbye, Ula. Hello, future sausage links. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Berry approaches the bed, twanging his offscreen hard-on. 

           He crawls toward Robyn on his hands and knees. Grinning like 
           a jackal. At last he straightens up, towering over her. 

           And Robyn draws back her leg and kicks as hard as she can. 

           Berry’s eyes go very, very wide. 

           We see the heel of her foot pressed flat against Berry’s 
           crotch. There’s no boner visible. 

           Which means the kick drove it all the way inside his body. 

           Berry still hasn’t blinked. The tendons in his neck standing 
           out. As The Chicken Dance finally ends, he topples sideways. 

           With a roar of fury, Tuck rushes her. 

           Robyn jackknifes her hips, wrapping her legs around his neck, 
           slamming him sideways across the bed. Squeezing. 

           Tuck’s eyes are bugging out. He beats against her legs, 
           flopping, unable to catch a decent breath. 

           On the floor, Berry’s eyes are glazed over. Stone cold dead. 
                                                         (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)           At last Tuck digs in his pocket and pulls out the handcuff 
           key. He holds it up to the light with trembling fingers. 

           INT. PLANT HALLWAY

           A tuxedo-clad usher leads a group of high rollers down the 
           hallway. He flings open the door to reveal--

           INT. THE ARENA - CONTINUOUS

           The circular room is packed with well-dressed socialites. In 
           the center of the room is THE PIT, fifteen feet deep and at 
           least twice as long, bordered on all sides by safety rails. 

           A server glides toward them with a tray of champagne glasses. 
           The high rollers accept their drinks and approach the pit.  

           The Puppy Run is about to begin. 

           INT. HOLDING CELL

           Directly below the arena, the faint thump of bass is audible 
           through the walls. Telly bops his head along to the beat, 
           eyes closed, just feeling the groove. 

                                 JOSH
                        Telly! Knock it off! 

           Telly ignores him. Annoyed, Josh struggles to his feet and 
           skates over to where The Mexican is slumped against the wall. 

                                 JOSH
                        Can we get these skates off? 
                           (No answer.)
                        Hey! What’s your problem?

           The Mexican finally looks up. His expression is terrible. 

                                 THE MEXICAN
                        My problem? My problem is the 
                        malparidos who came for me while I 
                        was sleeping, my wife beside me. 
                        They said come or she dies, so I 
                        let them bind my hands. The man put 
                        a gun to Elena’s head. No, I said, 
                        she carries my child! And the man, 
                        he smiled and put the gun to her 
                        belly instead and he pulled the 
                        trigger. That is my problem. 
                                                                  (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)
                                 (cid:13)                                 JOSH
                           (long beat)
                        Okay. Sorry to bother you. Sir.  

           Josh turns and wobbles away. Patting his pockets absently.

           He suddenly stops. Pulls a small plastic rectangle from his 
           back pocket. It’s the flash drive containing Ula’s database. 

           He holds it up to the light. Putting two and two together. 

                                 JOSH
                        Whoa. 

           INT. SEDAN 

           The sedan tears down the empty street. Behind the wheel, Tuck 
           is blubbering like a baby. Robyn keeps the pistol trained on 
           him as she punches 9-1-1 into his cell phone. 

                                 TUCK
                        Can’t believe you just left him 
                        there to rot! Poor old bastard! 

                                 ROBYN
                           (into the phone:)
                        Hello? I’d like to report, um, a 
                        whole lot of stuff, I guess. My 
                        friends are being held in some 
                        slaughterhouse and there’s this 
                        movie producer shooting people, and 
                        also some gay rapers and Corey 
                        Feldman was there and...what?

                                 TUCK
                           (crying harder now)
                        Smartest man I ever met! Get him 
                        started on Proust, maybe Chaucer, 
                        he could talk your ear right off! 

                                 ROBYN
                           (into the phone:)
                        No, this isn’t a crank call, you 
                        dipshit! No, you watch your 
                        language! And you better not--
                           (A stunned beat. She slams 
                            the phone shut.)
                        Bitch hung up on me. 

           Tuck is lost in his grief. She nudges him with the pistol. 
                                                     (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                 TUCK
                        And God, if you’d heard him on the 
                        violin, the way he could make that 
                        bow dance--

                                 ROBYN
                        Shut up. What’s this Puppy Run? 

                                 TUCK
                        It’s just this...thing. Cuz there’s 
                        no place to get rid of bodies, not 
                        in L.A., not unless you want to 
                        drive four hours to the fucking 
                        desert with all the podunk speed 
                        traps along the way. Plus, you 
                        know, it’s something to do on a 
                        Friday, so that’s always good.

           Robyn glares at him for a beat longer. Then: 

                                 ROBYN
                        Drive faster. 

           INT. THE ARENA

           The viewing area is now teeming with spectators. Gideon 
           pushes his way through the crowd and grabs a microphone. 

                                 GIDEON
                        LADIES AND GODDAMN GENTLEMEN, ARE 
                        YOU READY FOR A PUPPY RUN?

           And the crowd goes wild. 

           INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS

           The prisoners can hear the cheering, the chanting. 

           Josh hauls Telly to his feet.  

                                 JOSH
                        Hey! You know that database 
                        everyone’s looking for? I’ve got 
                        it! Ula must have put it--hey!

           He shakes Telly, but his friend is lost in a drug-fueled 
           trance, concentrating only on the heavy thump of bass. 
                                                   (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 JOSH
                        Damn it. Just...just stick with me, 
                        okay? I don’t know, try to stay 
                        behind me or something! Okay? 

           On the far side of the cell, a metal gate slowly rises, and 
           the roar of the crowd comes crashing in. 

           Nobody moves toward the exit. Why would they? 

           That question is answered when the opposite gate swings open 
           and an ARMORED GUARD emerges, carrying a flamethrower. He 
           sprays a gout of liquid fire skyward. 

                                 ARMORED GUARD
                        MOVE OUT!

           He advances on the prisoners, his weapon belching orange 
           fire, driving them through the gate and out into the light. 

           INT. THE ARENA - CONTINUOUS

           Josh and Telly emerge together, holding each other like 
           drowning men, blinking under the harsh spotlights. 

           They’re standing in a large cylindrical pit. Smooth walls 
           rise toward the platform where at least sixty people are 
           gathered to watch. Everyone is hooting and cheering. 

           Gideon leaps onto a table and bellows into his microphone. 

                                 GIDEON
                        OKAY, PUPPIES--TIME TO START 
                        RUNNING! GO! GO! GO!

           The music shifts to a cheesy disco beat. A large mirror ball 
           on the ceiling starts spinning. 

           And the prisoners begin to skate. 

           They go around and around in a tight circle, helpless, 
           terrified, hugging the walls. Only The Mexican refuses to 
           participate. He stands in the center of the room, glowering. 

           It quickly becomes apparent that Josh sucks at skating. He 
           wobbles desperately, careening off the walls. 

           Telly, on the other hand, is in his element. He rockets 
           along, head down like a speed skater, bobbing slightly to the 
           beat as he weaves between prisoners. 
                                                   (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)
           (cid:13)           He flashes Josh a goofy smile as he zooms past again. Too 
           blasted on ecstacy to even be frightened. 

                                 JOSH
                        Telly, get back here!

                                 GIDEON
                        LOOK AT ALL THOSE FINE PUPPIES, 
                        LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BOPPING TO 
                        THE SOULFUL GROOVES OF THE 70s!

           Gideon chooses an item from behind the table and holds it up 
           for the crowd to see. It’s a wicked-looking steel crossbow. 

                                 GIDEON
                        FIRST ITEM UP FOR GRABS IS A BOLT-
                        ACTION, SINGLE-SHOT CROSSBOW! AND I 
                        DON’T NEED TO REMIND YOU THAT FIRST 
                        SHOT MEANS PUPPY OF YOUR CHOICE!

           Immediately people start bidding, holding wads of cash aloft. 
           “One hundred!” “Two-fifty!” “Four hundred!” “Eight hundred!”

                                 GIDEON
                        SOLD FOR EIGHT HUNDRED TO THE 
                        GENTLEMAN RIGHT OVER THERE!

           His assistants transfer the loaded crossbow to the WINNING 
           BIDDER, who hefts it and pretends to aim...then laughs and 
           passes the weapon to his TROPHY WIFE instead. 

           In the pit below, the prisoners scramble to get out of the 
           way. Pressing up against the walls, tripping over each other. 

                                 WINNING BIDDER
                           (pointing at The Mexican)
                        That big fella ain’t moving. 

                                 TROPHY WIFE
                        Well, where’s the fun in that? 

           The trophy wife has her eye on Telly. She tries to track him 
           as he zooms around the ring, but he’s just too fast. 

                                 JOSH
                        TELLY! GET OVER HERE!

           Telly flashes past again, grinning like a madman. 

                                 TELLY
                        Hi, Josh!
                                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                 GIDEON
                        TAKE THE SHOT! TAKE THE SHOT!

           The crowd picks up the chant, repeating it, egging her on. 

           The trophy wife squints down the sights. Trying to anticipate 
           Telly’s position. She squeezes the trigger slightly--

           TWANG! The bolt buries itself in the ear of the prisoner 
           behind Telly. Blood shoots skyward. Telly doesn’t notice. 

           An appreciative roar goes up from the crowd. A solid kill. 

           Pouting, the trophy wife returns the crossbow. 

                                 TROPHY WIFE
                        I wanted the fat one!

           Meanwhile, Gideon displays a steel ball covered with spikes. 

                                 GIDEON
                        WE CALL THIS GLORIOUS FUCKER THE 
                        COCONUT! BIDDING STARTS AT $200!

           The crowd cheers. A dozen different hands go up. 

           EXT. CIRCE FOODS PARKING LOT

           Robyn opens the sedan’s trunk. Gestures impatiently. 

                                 TUCK
                        Come on, it’s bloody as shit in 
                        there! Look, brains and everything!

           She aims the pistol a little lower.

                                 ROBYN
                        Option two is joining your buddy in 
                        “Hey, Where’s My Dick?” Land. 

           Snarling, Tuck crawls into the trunk. She slams it. 

           INT. THE ARENA

           The Coconut comes whistling down and lodges itself in a 
           prisoner’s face. He’s dead before he hits the floor. 

           The crowd bursts into spontaneous applause. 
                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)           Someone slams into Josh, knocking him to the floor. He crawls 
           forward, slithering through pools of blood, trying to avoid 
           the panicked prisoners as they pinball off each other. 

           INT. CIRCE FOODS OFFICE

           Robyn kicks out an office window. Crawls through the opening. 

           She pauses inside the darkened room, listening intently. 

           Faint music pulses in the distance. She moves toward it. 

           INT. THE ARENA

           A winning bidder exchanges a fat roll of bills for a sleek 
           curved hatchet. He hefts the weapon, scanning for a target. 

           In the middle of the pit, Josh’s back is turned, his arms 
           pinwheeling as he tries to stay on his feet. 

           Mr. Choppy takes aim and lets the hatchet fly--

           But at that exact moment, Josh hits a patch of something 
           slippery and goes ass-over-teakettle again-- 

           THWACK! The hatchet whizzes over Josh’s head and buries 
           itself in the stomach of another prisoner. 

           Josh slithers forward, grabs the hatchet, and manages to tug 
           it free. The injured prisoner howls. 

                                 JOSH
                        Sorry! Sorry!

           Up on the observation deck, Gideon hoists a Molotov cocktail. 

                                 GIDEON
                        IT IS A SCIENTIFIC FACT THAT 
                        PUPPIES! LOVE! FIRE!

           The crowd thrusts money at him. Desperate for a chance. 

           Josh rolls over and begins banging on his ankle-braces with 
           the hatchet’s blade. He snaps one of the braces free and 
           slides the first skate off. One down, one to go. 

           Telly races past him, humming under his breath, expertly 
           weaving through the carnage littering the pit floor. 
                                   (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)           He veers sharply to one side as the Molotov cocktail explodes 
           against another prisoner, instantly engulfing the man in 
           flames. The Human Torch stumbles forward, clawing the air. 

                                 GIDEON
                        WE GOT OURSELVES A HOT DOG! AROOOO! 
                        AROOOO! SMELL THAT PUPPY SIZZLE!

           Telly ducks under the burning man’s arms. Apart from The 
           Mexican--who still hasn’t moved an inch--he’s the only 
           prisoner still standing. And the crowd knows it. 

           EXT. CIRCE FOODS PARKING LOT

           The sedan rocks back and forth. We hear metal straining, 
           groaning. Then the trunk pops open. 

           Tuck tosses the fully-extended car jack aside and climbs out. 

           INT. THE ARENA

           Robyn pushes through the swinging doors and stops short at 
           the sight of the arena. The blood-splattered pit. The crowd, 
           whipped into a savage frenzy. Gideon, holding a medieval-
           looking mace aloft. She takes it all in. 

           Gideon passes the mace to the winning bidder, who strides 
           over to the railing. Lifts the weapon above his head. 

           He’s aiming at Josh, who is currently working the other skate 
           off his foot. Completely oblivious to what’s about to happen. 

           Robyn has no time to think. She raises Tuck’s pistol. Fires. 

           The shot catches Mace Boy in the shoulder, spinning him in a 
           violent circle, the mace clutched in his outstretched hands. 

           THUMP! The mace’s arc inadvertently catches the two women 
           nearest him, sending them both toppling over the railing. 

           One of the women hits the ground face-first and crumples. The 
           other manages to snag the railing and hangs there, screaming. 

           Josh tosses the skate aside and looks up. Sees the woman 
           hanging there, legs scissoring ten feet above the ground. 

                                 JOSH
                        TELLY! BOOST!

           Telly understands at once. They both race toward the woman. 
                                      (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)           Telly reaches the wall first, dropping to a hands-and-knees 
           skid. Josh is only a second behind, propelling himself off 
           Telly’s back and leaping straight up--

           He snags the woman’s ankles, and the two men pulling her back 
           up are nearly dragged over the side. 

           Josh scrambles up her back like a monkey and tumbles over the 
           railing, landing in a clumsy roll.  

           Meanwhile, armed guards are closing in on Robyn. 

           She fires wildly, and the crowd panics. They surge away, 
           carrying the guards with them. 

           Gideon sees what’s happening. Turns to his weapon stockpile. 

                                 GIDEON
                        Fuck this. 

           He grabs the crossbow. Loads another bolt and cocks it back. 

           A guard opens fire, peppering the wall with bullet holes. 

           Robyn stumbles, covering her face, returning fire blindly. 

                                 ROBYN
                        Ohshitohshitohshit!

           Gideon leaps atop the nearest table. Aims at Robyn. 

           Josh sprints toward Robyn. Grabs her by the waist. Drags her 
           aside just as the crossbow bolt goes screaming past. 

           They duck behind the nearest table. Gasping for breath. 

                                 JOSH
                        Hi.

                                 ROBYN
                        Hi. 

                                 JOSH
                        Wanna help me push this table? 

                                 ROBYN
                        Yeah, okay. 

           They throw their shoulders against the table and drive it 
           forward through the crowd, knocking guests and guards aside. 

           The table hits the railing and pitches over the edge...but 
           its back legs catch and the table hangs there, suspended. 
                                                 (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)           Which is exactly the opening The Mexican has been waiting 
           for. He skates forward, leaps, grabs the bottom of the table. 

           A guard swings a spiked bat at Josh’s head. Robyn sees him 
           coming and shoves Josh. He falls right on his ass, and the 
           bat whiffs through the air harmlessly. 

           The guard’s momentum carries him right over the railing. He 
           hangs there a second, then begins to haul himself back up. 

                                 JOSH
                        Quick, give me the gun! 

                                 ROBYN
                        It’s out of bullets!

                                 JOSH
                        GIVE ME THE GUN!

           She hands it over. Josh spins around and cracks the pistol’s 
           butt against the guard’s forehead. The man falls. 

                                 ROBYN
                        Oh. 

           A clanking noise makes Josh whirl around. 

           It’s the armored guard. The fucker with the flamethrower. 

                                 JOSH
                        Not good.

           The guard whips his flamethrower in a tight arc, sending a 
           crackling tongue of orange flame in their direction. 

           Josh and Robyn scuttle backwards, crab-walking, even as the 
           guard continues to advance. A rolling wall of fire bears down 
           on them, blinding, suffocating, inescapable--

           The tips of Robyn’s sneakers ignite. It’s almost upon them--

           The Mexican vaults over the railing. He catches the armored 
           guard and twists his helmet around backwards--the man’s spine 
           popping like a party favor--without even slowing down. 

           The other guards aren’t getting paid enough for this shit. 
           They panic, fleeing toward the processing floor. 

           The Mexican roars after them like a runaway train. 
                                                                      (cid:13)

HALLWAY / PROCESSING FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           The guards and the last remaining guests sprint down the 
           hallway, with The Mexican hot on their heels. 

           The machinery is still chugging along on the processing 
           floor, mixing and grinding and dicing. The guests slam into 
           each other, lost, confused. Total sensory overload. 

           And then The Mexican is upon them. 

           He flings a guest face-first into a mixing vat, hard enough 
           to leave a facial indentation in the steel. Then he rockets 
           toward a guard who is still fumbling with his gun. 

           He grabs the guard’s arm, whipping him through the air like a 
           propeller, before launching him into space--

           With a mournful yelp, the guard sails right into the dicing 
           blades! He breaks apart in a spray of little red pieces. 

           INT. THE ARENA

           Josh and Robyn help Telly clamber up the table and onto the 
           platform. He’s panting, grinning from ear to ear. 

                                 TELLY
                        Did you guys see how awesome I was 
                        at skating? 

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, yeah, great. We gotta go. 

           With one smooth motion, Josh ejects the pistol’s clip and 
           slaps in a fresh one taken from the body of a nearby guard. 

           A second later, the arena doors fly open. Another guard 
           bursts in, brandishing an automatic weapon. 

           Josh raises his pistol. Fires a single shot. No hesitation. 

           The thug howls, clutching his injured hand, as his gun goes 
           spinning across the floor. 

           The guard takes one look at the gun still trained on him and 
           makes a wise career choice: he flees back down the corridor. 

           Telly and Robyn stare at Josh. Stunned.

                        Holy fucking crap, Batman. Who 
                        taught you how to shoot?

                                 TELLY
                        Know what this means? Video games 
                        do turn kids into killers. 

                                 JOSH
                           (having the same thought)
                        We can’t tell anyone about this. 

           INT. PROCESSING FLOOR

           They race onto the processing floor and stop short. 

           The Mexican has left a trail of destruction in his wake. 
           Blood and bullet casings everywhere. We can hear him in the 
           distance somewhere, laughing like a madman. 

                                 ROBYN
                        One guy did all this? 

           A body passes them on the conveyor belt, a fire extinguisher 
           protruding from the red hole where his face used to be. 

           They watch the body until it’s out of sight. Dumbstruck. 

                                 JOSH
                        It’s time to go. 

           They start forward again--

           Gideon turns the corner and swings a katana at them! 

           Josh ducks and the blade sparks off a nearby pipe. 

                                 JOSH
                        Get Telly out of here!

           Robyn doesn’t argue. She grabs Telly’s shirt and starts 
           rolling him toward the exit, ignoring his feeble protests. 

           Josh stutters backwards, raising his pistol, but Gideon 
           swings again, knocking the gun from his hands. 

           Josh dives onto the conveyor belt after the weapon, but it 
           slips into a groove and vanishes. He rolls to find Gideon 
           standing over him, sword raised triumphantly. 
                                             (cid:13)

           over. He rolls over, starts crawling along the belt. 

                                 GIDEON
                        Fucker!

           Now Josh is on his feet, running atop the belt, knocking 
           swinging pig carcasses aside. He risks a backwards glance--

           --and runs right into a slab of dead hog! He loses his 
           balance, but the hook snags his shirt, dragging him along. 

           Gideon is gaining on him. Knocking pigs aside. Raving mad. 

           Josh kicks helplessly, trying to free himself from the hook. 

           Gideon lunges forward, stabbing with the katana--

           Josh spins around, and the blade punches through the carcass 
           instead, emerging on the other side inches from his head. 

           Josh throws his weight backwards, slamming the carcass into 
           Gideon, knocking him flat on his ass. 

           The conveyor belt ends without warning, and the hook carries 
           Josh above a fat of churning pink pig broth. 

           Gideon isn’t so lucky. He tumbles into the broth. Emerges 
           coughing and spluttering, caked with gore. 

           Gideon realizes he’s being sucked toward the center of the 
           vat, where the giant mixer blades are steadily turning. 

           He dog-paddles frantically, but it’s no use. One of the 
           blades hooks his foot and he goes under.  

           And the swirling broth gets just a little bit redder. 

           On the other side of the vat, Josh frees himself from the 
           hook and drops to the ground.  

           He spies an abandoned pistol and pockets the weapon. 

                                 JOSH
                        Telly? Robyn? 

           He turns the nearest corner...and stops cold.

           Telly is lying facedown. Blood streaming from his forehead.

                                 JOSH
                        TELLY!

           shoulder. Telly groans, comes to life.

                                 JOSH
                        What happened? Where’s Robyn?

                                 TELLY
                        Ugh. Took her.

                                 JOSH
                        Who? Who took her?

           INT. SEDAN

           Tuck’s sedan goes screaming out of the parking lot. 

           Behind the wheel, Tuck has a crazed look in his eyes. 
           Clutching the wheel so hard his knuckles have gone white.

           Robyn lies in the backseat, barely conscious.

           Ahead of them, the sedan’s headlights illuminate--

           THE MEXICAN. Skating down the sidewalk, caked with gore from 
           head to toe. Finally enjoying himself.

                                 THE MEXICAN
                        HAHAHAHAHA!

           Tuck shakes his head as they pass the madman.

                                 TUCK
                        One fuck of a weird night.

           INT. PROCESSING FLOOR

           Josh checks the parking lot door, then rejoins Telly.

                                 JOSH
                        They’re gone.

                        We have to call the cops, right?

                        Telly, you’re on ecstacy. Also,

                        I know, I know! Just let me think!

           The room spins around him, a cacophony of noise and motion. 
           It’s deafening. Overwhelming. Hopeless.

           At last Josh looks up. And he’s got the Clint Eastwood stare.

                                 JOSH
                        Follow me.

           A pair of legs are poking out of the nearest mixing vat, 
           rotating in a lazy circle. Josh fishes through the corpse’s 
           pockets as it passes and pulls out a fat keyring.

           EXT. CIRCE FOODS PARKING LOT

           Josh races across the parking lot, pressing the panic button 
           on the keyring’s fob, searching for the right vehicle. Telly 
           rolls after him, holding his bleeding forehead.

           In the distance, police sirens are quickly approaching.

                                 TELLY
                        Josh! Cops!

           Josh ignores him. Hitting the panic button every few feet.

           Suddenly the headlights of a nearby Beamer start flashing. 
           WOOP. WOOP. WOOP. Josh veers toward the vehicle. 

                                 JOSH
                        Get in!

           The Beamer screeches out of the parking lot, seconds before 
           the first police cruiser comes tearing around the corner.

           INT. BEAMER - CONTINUOUS

           Josh throws the Beamer around another sharp turn without ever 
           touching the brakes. Telly hangs on for dear life.

                                 TELLY
                        Where are we going?

                                 JOSH
                        I’ll know when I see it.
                                                      (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)           EXT. SIDE STREET / CULVERT

           Tuck parks the sedan next to an empty drainage culvert.

           He drags Robyn out of the backseat and marches her toward the 
           culvert, gun pressed against the small of her back.

           EXT. THUNDERCUPS

           Thundercups is an all-night coffee lounge, filled with 
           overpriced drinks, droning adult contemporary music, and java 
           addicts pecking away on their laptops.

           The Beamer skids into the parking lot and slams to a stop, 
           knocking a garbage can end over end. Josh bolts out.

           INT. THUNDERCUPS - CONTINUOUS

           The CASHIER stares in disbelief at his newest customers.

                                 CASHIER
                        Um, are you guys okay?

           Josh is barefoot, one eye swollen shut. Telly is still 
           wearing roller skates and nursing a serious head wound. 

                                 TELLY
                        Yeah. Why?

                                 CASHIER
                        We, um, don’t serve guys who 
                        are...shoeless.

           Josh strides across the room and grabs a wireless laptop out 
           of the hands of a preppy-looking CUSTOMER.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        Hey! What the hell, bro?

           Without looking up, Josh aims his pistol at the guy.

                                 JOSH
                        Shut up. I’m just borrowing this.

                                 CASHIER
                        Is this, like, a robbery?

                                 TELLY
                           (brightly)
                        Yeah!

                        No! Is this thing online?

           Without waiting for an answer, Josh pulls up a website: 
           CELEBRITY SNOOPHOUND. Clicking links faster than we can read 
           them, he accesses a seemingly endless list of phone numbers. 

           Josh scrolls down until he finds the entry for VENICE, K.

                                 JOSH
                        Gotcha. Hey, I need a phone!

           He looks pointedly at the laptop’s owner. 

                                 CUSTOMER
                        What, are you serious? 

                                 JOSH
                           (reminding him)
                        Gun. 

           The customer grudgingly hands over his phone. Josh punches in 
           Venice’s number, and we INTERCUT with--

           INT. MANSION - STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           Venice answers the phone on its first ring.

                                 VENICE
                        Who is this?

                                 JOSH
                        The guy you tried to have killed.

                                 VENICE
                        Be more specific. 

                                 JOSH
                        Um, the one from tonight. 

                                 VENICE
                        The nerd?

                                 JOSH
                           (slightly offended)
                        The geek.

                                 VENICE
                        How’d you get this number?

                        Here’s a better question: what else 
                        do I have that belongs to you? 

           Venice exhales sharply. Sinks into his desk chair.

                                 VENICE
                        Well, Mister Geek, you got my full 
                        fucking attention, that’s for sure. 
                        You mind telling me how you--

                                 JOSH
                        Shut up and listen. The little guy 
                        took my friend. She dies and this 
                        list will be the top headline on 
                        tomorrow’s Variety. Venice Menace 
                        Gets Penance, something cute like 
                        that. We clear?

                                 VENICE
                        Crystal.

                                 JOSH
                        Then you’ve got a call to make.

           Josh slams the phone shut.

           EXT. CULVERT

           Tuck shoves Robyn to her knees. She tries to fight back, but 
           he steps on her calf, pinning her in place.

           He aims the pistol at the back of her head. Tenses.

           And his phone rings.

           With his free hand, Tuck flips the phone open. 

                                 TUCK
                        Hello? Mr. Venice! I was just--
                           (long pause)
                        But sir, this girl, she killed--
                           (another pause)
                        Yes, sir. Understood. 

           He hangs up the phone. Raises his face to the heavens. And 
           screams. As long and as loud as he possibly can. 
                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)           INT. THUNDERCUPS

           Josh slides Ula’s flash drive into the laptop and clicks a 
           few icons. The database’s interface fills the screen. Names. 
           Numbers. Addresses. And a whole lot of dollar signs.  

                                 JOSH
                        Holy crap, there’s a lot of names 
                        on here. Oh, hey, here’s Harvey 
                        Weinstein’s Social Security Number!

           Telly leans against the display case, humming softly, leaving 
           little droplets of blood all over the place.

                                 TELLY
                        Could I get one of these cinnamon 
                        rolls? The big one there. 

           The cashier hands over the pastry. Clears his throat.

                                 CASHIER
                        Um...that’s $3.95.

                                 TELLY
                        Dude, I told you, we’re totally 
                        robbing you here.

           Josh clicks and drags a few more icons, then he closes the 
           laptop and pockets the cell phone.  

                                 JOSH
                        We’re leaving.

                        Hey! What happened to borrowing? 

                                 JOSH
                        I lied.

           EXT. THUNDERCUPS

           The Beamer tears ass out of the parking lot. 

           INT. BEAMER - CONTINUOUS

           Behind the wheel, Telly blinks slowly at the road. 

                                 TELLY
                        What’s that thing called where you 
                        see two of everything?
                             (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                 JOSH

                                 TELLY
                        Yeah. Maybe I shouldn’t be driving.

                                 JOSH
                        You’re doing fine. Just don’t hit 
                        that guy on the bike.
                           (He flinches.)
                        God, you almost hit him.

                                 TELLY
                        I didn’t see any goddamn guy.

                                 JOSH
                        Just get back on the freeway and--

           He breaks off, staring out the window, eyes widening.

                                 JOSH
                        Stop the car!

                                 TELLY
                        But I thought--

                                 JOSH
                        Stop the car! STOP THE CAR!

           EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

           The Beamer slides to a stop. Josh hops out and hurries toward 
           a line of people waiting to get inside a trendy nightclub.

           As he walks, Josh pulls the pistol from his back pocket.

                                 JOSH
                        Hey!

           The HANDSOME JOCK at the end of the line turns, smiling.

           Josh flips the gun around with one smooth movement, then 
           cracks the handle against the Jock’s nose! It’s the pistol-
           whip to end all pistol-whips. The Jock drops with a howl.

           Josh turns away wordlessly. Stalks back over to the Beamer.

           INT. BEAMER - CONTINUOUS

           They keep driving. Telly’s eyes are very wide, but he doesn’t 
           say anything. At last Josh looks up.

           INT. MANSION - STUDY

           Tuck drags Robyn into Venice’s study and practically flings 
           her at the producer’s feet. 

                                 VENICE
                        Goddamn. It was a sour fucking day 
                        in Mudville when you showed up on 
                        my porch, I’ll tell you what. 

                                 TUCK
                        She killed Mr. Berry, sir! Kicked 
                        his cock clean off! 

           Venice couldn’t care less. He kneels in front of Robyn. 

                                 VENICE
                        You better hope your little nerd’s 
                        on his way here right now. 

           Robyn meets his gaze calmly. 

                                 ROBYN
                        And you’d better hope he’s not. 

           INT. BEAMER

           Josh finishes speaking to someone and hangs up the phone.  

                                 TELLY
                        Really think this’ll work? 

                                 JOSH
                        Definitely not. 

                                 TELLY
                        Good, because I didn’t want to be 
                        the one to say anything. 

           Josh manages a weak smile. Then, quietly:

                                 JOSH
                        Thanks. 

                                 TELLY
                        For? 
                                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                 JOSH
                        For sticking with me. 

                                 TELLY
                        Best friend. It’s kind of in the 
                        job description.

                                 JOSH
                        You’re on the wrong side of the 
                        road, by the way. 

           Telly hurriedly veers back into the right lane. 

                                 TELLY
                        Whoo, good eyes. Sure you don’t 
                        want me to go in with you?

                                 JOSH
                        Not this time. I need you to stay 
                        out here, be the Millennium Falcon. 

           Telly nods at once. As if this makes perfect sense. 

           EXT. MANSION DRIVEWAY

           The electric gate slides open, and Josh trudges up the path 
           leading to Venice’s mansion. He’s alone. Unarmed.

           Venice’s butler waits for him, flanked by two armed guards.

           INT. MANSION - STUDY

           The rough cut of Venice’s latest movie is being silently 
           projected on the wall of his darkened study. 

           The image shows Jack Lumber wearing a kimono, folded into an 
           awkward lotus position. A geisha hands him a sandwich.

           Venice studies the film thoughtfully. In the corner, Tuck 
           keeps a careful eye on Robyn.

                                 ROBYN
                        Your movie fucking sucks.
                           (No response.)
                        Seriously. This is worse than The 
                        Village. 

           Venice gestures to Tuck. The mercenary backhands Robyn. Hard.

           Onscreen, Jack Lumber wolfs down his ham sandwich, a blissful 
           expression on his face. The best acting we’ve seen him do.
                                      (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)           The butler shows Josh into the room. Venice stands.

                                 JOSH
                        Howdy, pardner.

                                 VENICE
                        Howdy yourself. Got my database?

                                 JOSH
                        Sure don’t.

           Venice tries to hide his surprise. Turns to the butler. 

                                 VENICE
                        You check his pockets?
                           (The butler nods.)
                        Well, okay, Why’d you come?

                                 JOSH
                        To kick the shit out of you, 
                        mostly.

           And Venice snaps. Pulls a pistol from his desk, strides 
           across the room, presses the barrel against Josh’s forehead.

           Josh’s voice is just loud enough for everyone to overhear.

                                 JOSH
                        Come on. I thought you were 
                        supposed to be a cowboy.

           He’s got him there. Venice exhales sharply. Tosses the gun 
           aside. Begins to unbutton his dress shirt. 

                                 VENICE
                        You wanna die with a belly full of 
                        teeth, ain’t my business.  

           He gestures for his flunkies to leave the room. As Tuck drags 
           Robyn past, she leans in close.

                                 ROBYN
                        Do you even know how to fight?

                                 JOSH
                        Course.
                           (after she’s gone:)
                        In theory.

           Onscreen, a group of ninjas have surrounded Jack Lumber. But 
           if you think he’s worried...you don’t know Jack.

           rancher’s physique. He cracks his knuckles eagerly.

                                 VENICE
                        See, trouble with you little 
                        fuckersnappers these days is you’re 
                        all so soft ’n squishy. You got no 
                        idea what it’s like to fight ‘n 
                        claw for what you want.

           Venice looms over him. But Josh merely grins. 

                                 VENICE
                        Hell you smiling for? 

                                 JOSH
                        I had a database with the names and 
                        numbers of every major shitball and 
                        scumfuck in this city. You really 
                        think you’re the only one I called?

           And Venice stops short.

           INT. BEAMER  - FLASHBACK

           A quick MONTAGE of Josh making phone calls in the Beamer--

                                 JOSH
                        Is this Mr. Suki? Listen, I’ve been 
                        going over your business ledger and 
                        I was just wondering...who the fuck 
                        is buying surface-to-air missiles 
                        in Orange County?

           FLASH: MR. SUKI is frantically signaling to his associates.

                                 JOSH
                        Mr. Carter! That money sitting in 
                        Nassau, that’s all declared, right?

           FLASH: MR. CARTER is clutching his phone. Enraged.

                                 JOSH
                        Mr. Pizzoli? Hey, quick question: 
                        your meth lab on Oceanfront, is 
                        that open to the public, or do I 
                        have to make an appointment?

           FLASH: MR. PIZZOLI just sits there, stunned.
                                                            (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                 JOSH
                        I work for Kenny Venice, douchebag, 
                        that’s all you need to know! 
                           (another conversation:)
                        ...compliments of Kenny Venice!
                           (and another:)
                        I said Kenny Venice! Open your 
                        goddamn goomba ears! 

           Venice just got real unpopular. Start spreading the news. 

           INT. MANSION - STUDY

           Back in the present, Venice throws his hands up. Laughs. 

                                 VENICE
                        Well, you got me! You’re the man! 
                        Go ahead, name your price!

                                 JOSH
                        Price?

                                 VENICE
                        For the database. What do you want? 
                        Money? Movie star pussy? Hey, you 
                        wanna be in a movie, get your pussy 
                        that way? 

                                 JOSH
                        You don’t get it...I posted your 
                        stupid database on the internet an 
                        hour ago. You’re already finished.   

           Venice grips his desk for support. Eyes bugging out. 

                                 VENICE
                        You...did what? 

                                 JOSH
                        I just came to tell you personally. 
                        That I’m the one who did this to 
                        you. That this is what happens when 
                        you fuck with my friends. 

           With a roar of hatred, Venice charges him. He seizes Josh and 
           flings him across the room.

           EXT. MANSION PERIMETER

           A luxury sedan with tinted windows rolls to a stop in front 
           of the mansion. Carter’s boys.
                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)           Twenty yards further down the road, an empty Hummer idles 
           next to the security fence. The Pizzoli family.

           On the opposite side of the mansion, shadows cross the 
           perimeter, moving low and fast. Mr. Suki’s associates.

           Things are about to get noisy.

           INT. MANSION - STUDY

           Josh sits up, coughing, stunned--

           --and he sees the movie being projected on the wall.

           Onscreen, a thug has Jack Lumber in a crushing hug. Jack 
           slams a forearm upwards, catching the guy square on the nose.

           Venice jerks Josh to his feet. Arms wrapping around him.

           Josh duplicates the forearm slam...and it works! Venice 
           releases his grip, snarling, and Josh scrambles away.

           EXT. MANSION PERIMETER

           A SNIPER dressed in camo gear lies prone on a tree branch, 
           aiming a high-powered rifle at the mansion.

           Through the rifle’s scope, we see Venice and Josh fighting in 
           the study. The crosshairs move from one target to the other.

           EXT. MANSION DRIVEWAY

           Carter’s thugs come strolling up the driveway. One of 
           VENICE’S GUARDS waits on the porch, arms crossed impassively.

                                 VENICE’S GUARD
                        Mr. Venice isn’t seeing any--

           PAP! PAP! A row of small red holes appear in the goon’s 
           shirt. He tumbles lifelessly to the ground.

           INT. MANSION - BEDROOM

           On the second floor, Tuck is startled by the gunfire. He goes 
           to the bedroom window and peers down.

           Seizing the opportunity, Robyn grabs a Golden Razzie trophy 
           off the mantle and flings it across the room. 
                                                         (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)           It catches Tuck in the throat, staggering him. Gasping, 
           gagging, he raises his pistol--

           But Robyn is already sprinting for the window--

           EXT. MANSION AWNING / PERIMETER - CONTINUOUS

           Robyn dives headfirst through the window, lands on the sloped 
           awning, and goes skidding down the incline.

           Her momentum carries her right over the edge of the awning. 
           She manages to snag the gutter and hangs there, kicking.

           On the lawn beneath her are a half-dozen ceramic garden 
           gnomes. Their pointed hats look ferociously sharp. 

           Out in the tree, the sniper can’t resist such as easy shot. 
           His crosshairs center on Robyn’s back. 

           Inside the mansion, a goon passes the window. Stops. Steps 
           back into view. Locks eyes with Robyn.

           The goon fumbles with his weapon. Raises it--

           The gutter suddenly gives way. Robyn plunges out of sight--

           A second later, the sniper’s shot blows the goon backwards!

           Robyn hits the ground hard, flat on her back, with a garden 
           gnome on either side of her head and one between her legs. 

           The crotch gnome is smiling at her. Talk about a close call. 

           INT. MANSION - STUDY

           Venice hits Josh like a Honda Civic. A jolting impact. 

           On the opposite wall, Jack Lumber delivers twin karate-chops 
           to his foe’s neck, one after the other. 

           Josh copies the move, slamming the sides of his palms against 
           Venice’s neck. Venice howls, flings him aside.

           Josh grabs for the closest weapon--a lamp on the desk--

           And a sniper bullet blows the lamp right out of his hand! 
           Except for the glow of the projector, the room goes dark.

           Josh and Venice suddenly realize someone is shooting at them. 
           They glance at each other. Then they hit the floor. 
                                                         (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)           Keeping his body low, Venice scuttles toward him. 

           Josh glances at the screen just in time to see Jack Lumber 
           crush an enemy’s skull with a heavy ceremonial gong.

           Josh grabs a coffee mug off the desk and mimics the movement 
           exactly. The mug shatters and Venice stumbles back.

           Josh is learning how to fight--in the middle of a fight--by 
           watching a Jack Lumber movie.

           Jack throws a punch. From his crouched position, Josh throws 
           the same punch.

           Jack knees a ninja in the balls. Josh does the same.

           Jack bitchslaps a dude into next week. Josh’s bitchslap isn’t 
           quite as hard, but his form is excellent.

           Onscreen, the fight is finally over. Jack Lumber’s ninja 
           opponents lie dead or unconscious at his feet.

           Kenny Venice, on the other hand, is still very much awake.

                                 JOSH
                        Damn.

           Venice grabs him.

           INT. MANSION - BATHROOM

           Corey Feldman finishes doing a line and straightens up, 
           sniffing, rubbing his nose. Blissfully blitzed. 

           He notices the crackle of gunfire and moves to the window--

           Just in time to see armed silhouettes sprint across the lawn!

           INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM

           Corey searches frantically, tossing pillows and cushions 
           aside. He finds an automatic pistol beneath a skin mag.

           He creeps toward the window, weapon held at the ready.

           Outside, another shadow flashes past. Corey sprays bullets 
           and is rewarded with a scream of pain.

                                 COREY FELDMAN
                        Fucking with the wrong Goonie...
                                                             (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)           Behind him, some of Carter’s goons kick the door open. Corey 
           spins around, but he’s too slow. They open fire. 

           And the top of Corey Feldman’s head blows apart.

           The goons sweep the room, checking doors, securing windows. 
           The LEADER nudges the corpse with his toe, impressed.

                                 GOON LEADER
                        Holy shit. I think you just killed 
                        Corey Haim.

           INT. MANSION - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Venice’s butler opens a display case and extracts a pair of 
           wicked-looking ceremonial blades.

           He approaches the railing overlooking the lobby. Without 
           warning, he flings himself over the side--

           INT. MANSION - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           --landing with catlike grace behind one of Carter’s thugs!

           The thug turns just as the blade whickers through the air, 
           cleanly passing through his neck.

           The thug blinks, surprised, then a fountain of arterial blood 
           sends his severed head skyward like a bottle rocket.

           The other Carter thugs whirl around. Bullets fly. 

           The butler darts forward, Matrix-fast, flipping over the 
           couch, spinning around the ottoman, blades flashing.

           EXT. MANSION PERIMETER

           In the tree, the sniper slaps another clip into his rifle.

           Through the scope, we can only see Josh and Venice when they 
           are silhouetted against the movie screen.

           INT. MANSION - STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           Venice has definitely gained the upper hand. He’s beating the 
           living tar out of Josh. 

           Onscreen, a blonde in a bathrobe runs her fingers across Jack 
           Lumber’s stubbly cheek. A tender moment. 
                                                          (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)           Venice grabs Josh and hurls him against the screen. They roll 
           to the right...and a bullet hole appears just behind them!

           They roll back to the left...and another bullet strikes the 
           spot they just vacated! Now the fighters tumble out of sight.

           Onscreen, the blonde turns and drops her bathrobe. She’s 
           topless, but the twin bullet holes cover her nipples exactly.

           INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM

           Robyn crawls through the living room on her hands and knees. 

           On either side of her, the Suki mobsters are locked in a 
           furious firefight with the Pizzolis. Bullets shatter lamps 
           and mirrors, tear through furniture, fill the air with smoke 
           and drifting bits of fabric and paper.

           One of the Suki gangsters spots her, swivels around--

           --and stray bullet clips his shoulder, spinning him around. 
           He blows the chandelier apart instead, and glass rains down. 

           Robyn scuttles backwards. Wincing as a dead body thumps over 
           the top of the recliner and lands right beside her.

           The Suki thugs are badly outgunned, and one by one, they’re 
           all cut down. Until only two Pizzolis are left standing.

           That’s when the butler comes sweeping into the room. He 
           drives a blade right into the nearest Pizzoli’s mouth.

           The last remaining PIZZOLI GOON is fumbling with a grenade 
           clipped to his belt. He pops the pin. Cocks his arm.

           The butler is faster. His blade flashes, and the goon’s hand 
           sails through the air, still clutching the live grenade--

           Robyn dives forward, catches the severed hand in midair, and 
           whips it back toward its former owner--

           She hits the ground. Rolls behind the nearest sofa--

           In slow motion, the very literal hand grenade floats past the 
           butler and the injured goon. They stare at it.

                                 INJURED GOON
                        Heeeeeeeey.
                                                                     (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)           EXT. MANSION PERIMETER - CONTINUOUS

           A rolling orange fireball blows out the side of the mansion.

           INT. MANSION - STUDY

           Just outside the projector’s spotlight, Venice has lost his 
           cool. His voice has become nasal, hysterical, with just the 
           faintest hint of an upper-class accent peeking through.  

                                 VENICE
                        Did something just blow up? This is 
                        unbelievable! I haven’t even 
                        finished paying this place off yet!

                                 JOSH
                        What happened to your accent?  
                           (suddenly understanding:)
                        Oh, you fucking poser. 

           Venice collides with him. Slams him to the floor, just below 
           the projector’s beam. Slowly choking the life out of him. 

           Josh’s eyes roll back. On the verge of passing out. From this 
           vantage point, he can just barely see--

           THE MOVIE. Onscreen, Jack Lumber unleashes his full blubbery 
           fury. A maelstrom of clumsily-timed punches and karate chops.

           And it’s like a can of spinach in Popeye’s belly. 

           Josh’s eyes suddenly snap into focus. His fist connects with 
           Venice’s jaw. Venice rears back, stunned.

           Josh hits him again and again and again. Each impact driving 
           Venice’s head a bit higher.

           Venice is now directly in the path of the projector. A 
           perfect outline of his head is illuminated on the wall.

           He cocks his head, doglike, and the silhouette does the same. 

                                 VENICE
                        Oh, goddamn it.

           And the wall is splashed with brains.

           The silhouette of Venice’s head has gone from a neat oval to 
           a messy crescent. Slowly, the shadow topples sideways.
                                              (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)           EXT. MANSION PERIMETER

           The sniper slips out of the tree and vanishes. In the 
           distance, the remaining gangsters are also retreating. 

           INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM

           Josh picks his way through the demolished living room. He’s 
           bleeding, dazed, a mess. 

           But none of that matters when he sees Robyn. 

           She comes limping out of the smoke. It’s hard to tell who 
           looks worse..but she still manages an enormous grin. 

                                 ROBYN
                        So. This kind of raises the bar for 
                        Date Number Two, huh? 

                                 JOSH
                        The pressure’s on. We might have to 
                        go running with the bulls, maybe 
                        start a fight club.  

                                 ROBYN
                        Or at least watch Deep Blue Sea and 
                        have some awesome sex. 

           His smile falters. Trying to figure out if she’s serious. 

                                 JOSH
                        You screwing with me again? 

                                 ROBYN
                        Just wait. 

           She kisses him. 

           After a beat, he kisses her back. And he’s really good at it. 

           EXT. MANSION DRIVEWAY

           The door handle turns. Jiggles slightly. Then the entire door 
           topples over, torn completely free from its hinges. 

           Josh and Robyn step over the door and stumble out into the 
           night, practically holding each other up.

           That’s when Tuck comes out of the shadows behind them. 
                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 TUCK
                        Don’t know about you, but my night 
                        just got a whole lot better. 

           Josh stares at Tuck’s gun for a long beat. Then--

                                 JOSH
                        KAW! KAW!

                                 ROBYN
                        Um, Josh?

                                 TUCK
                        What are you, retarded?

                                 JOSH
                           (desperate now)
                        KAW! KAW! KAW!

           Tuck frowns at him a beat longer. Genuinely baffled.  

           Then he shoots Josh. 

           Josh reels, eyes widening, clutching his bloody shoulder. 
           Robyn tries to catch him, and together they fall. 

                                 ROBYN
                        YOU ASSHOLE!

           Tuck shrugs. Guilty as charged. He raises the gun again. 

           And the Beamer hits him at full speed!

           The car crumples against the wall, flattening Tuck into red 
           paste before coming to a shuddering halt. 

           The airbags deflate, revealing a barely-conscious Telly. 

                                 TELLY
                           (mumbling:)
                        You’re all clear, kid! Now let’s 
                        blow this thing and go home!

           Robyn drags Josh over to the Beamer. Wrenches open the back 
           door and shoves him inside.

           INT. BEAMER - CONTINUOUS

                                 ROBYN
                        You okay? 
                                                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                 TELLY
                        Bleeding. Head kinda hurts. 

                                 ROBYN
                        Okay to drive, I mean. 

                                 TELLY
                        Oh, yeah, totally. 

           Robyn cradles Josh’s head. His eyes are closed. 

                                 ROBYN
                        You’re gonna be okay. You’re gonna 
                        be okay. 

           Telly pats the airbag down. Adjusts his rear-view mirror. 

                                 TELLY
                        We’re all gonna be just fine. Next 
                        stop, Mr. Hospital. 

           He throws the car in reverse and floors it--

           --and they promptly slam into the police cruiser that just 
           pulled into the driveway behind them. Whoops. 

           As the cops pile out of the wrecked cruiser and advance on 
           them, Telly notices the flashing lights in the mirror. 

                                 TELLY
                        Oh good, we’re there. 

           Then he passes out. 

           A second later, the flashlight beams hit Robyn’s face. She 
           squints into the light, and we FADE TO WHITE--

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           We FADE BACK IN on Josh’s hospital room. He’s lying in bed, 
           heavily bandaged and nicely doped up. 

           At the foot of his bed, his father is ranting and raving. In 
           the corner, his mother looks distinctly uncomfortable. 

                                 JOSH’S DAD 
                        --only thing worse than stupid is 
                        stupid and inconsiderate, which is--

                                 JOSH
                           (without opening his eyes)
                        Hey, dad?
           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 JOSH'S DAD
                        What? 

                                 JOSH
                        Give it a fucking rest. 

           Josh's dad begins to sputter angrily. His wife takes his arm. 

                                 JOSH'S MOM
                        You heard him. Give it a fucking 
                        rest. Dear. 

           On her way out, she flashes Josh a wink. He smiles at her. 

                                 JOSH’S MOM
                           (whispering:)
                        Say hi to Telly for me! 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM

           We INTERCUT between Telly and Robyn, who are being questioned 
           in separate police interrogation rooms. 

                                 ROBYN
                        Do you know what it’s like to have 
                        a gun pointed at your head? Like, 
                        six times in one night? It sucks. 

                                 TELLY
                        And see, the point of the game was, 
                        you weren’t supposed to blink. But 
                        if you did blink, you had to drink! 

                                 ROBYN
                        Oh, excuse me, Officer Donut! Maybe 
                        if you guys had done your goddamn 
                        job and arrested some of those guys 
                        in the first place, it wouldn’t 
                        have turned into a Peckinpah blood 
                        orgy! Ever think of that?

                                 TELLY
                        And the music was like ungh ungh 
                        ungh ungh. You know, fast like 
                        that. But a mean kind of fast. 

                                 ROBYN
                        You should be giving Josh, like, a 
                        presidential medal for what he did! 
                        Or at least a jetski or something. 
                                             (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)

                        If you’ve got any whiskey here, I 
                        can totally show you how to play. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           The DETECTIVE finishes taking Josh’s statement and snaps his 
           notebook shut. Leans back in his chair. 

                                 DETECTIVE
                        You know this one’ll be a bitch to 
                        write up, right? I got witnesses 
                        out the ass and I still don’t 
                        believe half of what you said. 

           Josh just shrugs. As the detective prepares to leave--

                                 JOSH
                        So. Gonna arrest me now or later? 

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Now why would we do that?

                                 JOSH
                        I dunno, because it’s your job?

           The detective checks to make sure nobody is listening in. 

                                 DETECTIVE
                        I still don’t know how it happened, 
                        but your bumblefucking knocked out 
                        half the organized crime on the 
                        west coast. We’re talking frozen 
                        bank accounts, a dozen arrests 
                        already, the works. So for once, 
                        just this once, I think we’ll look 
                        the other way.   

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Outside the room, the detective nods to Robyn and Telly, who 
           are waiting for their chance to visit Josh. 

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Y’all take care of him. 

                                 ROBYN AND TELLY
                        Course. 
                                                      (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)

           TITLE CARD: THREE WEEKS LATER

           Josh hurries down the sidewalk. Except for the sling around 
           his arm, he’s looking pretty sharp in a new business suit. 

           A slick Hollywood type jogs after him. This is MARTY. 

                                 MARTY
                        Hey! Hey, Josh! Got a sec? 

           Josh gives him an appraising look. He doesn’t slow down. 

                                 JOSH
                        Sorry. Job interview. 

                                 MARTY
                        Fuck it, I’ll walk, I need the 
                        exercise anyway. So your story, 
                        man...it’s shit-crazy! 

                                 JOSH
                        You with the press?

                                 MARTY
                        Come on, I look like a keyboard 
                        monkey to you? I’m industry, baby! 
                        And the guy I work for, let’s just 
                        say he wasn’t in the Kenny Venice 
                        Fan Club. I dunno, Venice stole his 
                        Social Security Number or some shit 
                        like that. And now Venice is dead--
                        okay, great--but we’d still like to 
                        piss on the grave a little bit, you 
                        know what I mean? 

                                 JOSH
                        I have no idea what you mean. 

                                 MARTY
                        Means we want to make a movie, show 
                        the world what a babyfucking sack 
                        of douche the guy was! See, we do 
                        that without you, it’s libel. We do 
                        that with you, it’s a biopic! 

           Josh finally stops. Holds his hands up. 

                                 JOSH
                        Listen, what happened to me, my 
                        friends, it’s not a movie, okay?
                              (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 MARTY
                        Why not?

                                 JOSH
                        It’s too violent, the rape stuff 
                        wouldn’t play in the Red States...
                           (He catches himself.)
                        Look, that doesn’t matter. Nobody’s 
                        gonna believe any of this happened! 

                                 MARTY
                        So we’ll make ‘em believe. That’s 
                        kind of what we do. 

                                 JOSH
                        You’re wasting your time. Sorry. 

           Josh starts forward again. But Marty isn’t giving up. 

                                 MARTY
                        Okay, movie, bad idea! What about 
                        an HBO miniseries? Or a video game?

           Josh stops. Turns. Comes back. 

                                 JOSH
                        You know, I have always wanted to 
                        get into game design...

           INT. JOSH AND TELLY’S APARTMENT - MUCH LATER

           Josh sits between Robyn and Telly on a very new, very 
           expensive leather couch. He’s holding an Xbox controller. 

           All three of them are staring at the screen, mouths agape. 

           Onscreen, DIGITAL JOSH dives through the air in slow-motion. 
           He’s built like Adonis. Firing his pistols John Woo-style. 

           Josh hammers on the attack button. In the video game, a dozen 
           armed Corey Feldmans are cut down in a hail of bullets. 

           Digital Josh stands. Hoists his smoking pistols. 

           And when he speaks, he sounds just like Samuel L. Jackson. 

                                 DIGITAL JOSH
                        I think it’s time to pay Kenny 
                        Venice a little visit. 
                               (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)           DIGITAL ROBYN leaps through the skylight and lands beside 
           him. Her breasts are bigger than her head, and her pink 
           fingernails have been sharpened into lethal claws. 

                                 DIGITAL ROBYN
                        He’s going down! Right, Telly?

           A GIANT ANTHROPOMORPHIC HIPPO carrying a Gatling gun comes 
           bounding into the room. He pumps his hoof in the air. 

                                 DIGITAL TELLY
                        AW, HELL YEAH!

           On the couch, the real Telly covers his face. 

                                 TELLY
                        I’m gonna go be sick. 

           He stumbles out of the room. 

           Onscreen, the three heroes have just come face-to-face with--

           DIGITAL KENNY VENICE. A cross between Yosemite Sam and a 
           crazy mountain prospector. He brandishes his six-shooters. 

                                 DIGITAL VENICE
                        Y’all dadgum varmints done messed 
                        with my plans fer the last time! 
                        YEEEEE-HAAAAAW!

           Firing wildly at the ground, Digital Venice propels himself 
           into the air and goes flying around the room. 

           Digital Josh cocks his pistols and strikes a heroic pose. 

                                 DIGITAL JOSH
                        I just came to tell you personally. 
                        That this is what happens WHEN YOU 
                        FUCK WITH MY MOTHERFUCKING FRIENDS!

           On the couch, Josh drops the controller. Turns to Robyn. 

                                 JOSH
                        Hey. Wanna go do something else?

                                 ROBYN
                        Uh-huh. 

           Josh aims the remote right at us and pushes a button. 

           CLICK. 

                                      THE END
