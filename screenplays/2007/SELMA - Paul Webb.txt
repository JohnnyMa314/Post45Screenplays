           ALABAMA, 1965

           EXT TOWN SQUARE - DAY

           An Alabama small-town square. A road frames a central area of 
           grass and trees. It’s hot and quiet. On a corner of the 
           grassy area stands a group of PEOPLE, about twenty men and 
           women. Many of them are nervous. They seem uncertain what to 
           do next.

           EXT STORE - DAY

           We’re still in the square, now looking from street-level, up 
           some steps, at the front of a run-down general store.

           INT STORE - DAY

           The store is empty except for a middle-aged white MAN in 
           jeans and check shirt behind the counter. On the counter is a 
           pump-action shotgun. He squats briefly to reach something and 
           comes up with a small cardboard box. He pulls it open and 
           spills some cartridges onto the counter. He starts loading 
           the shotgun. As he pushes home each cartridge he glances at 
           the front door. Through the half-glazed door he can see the 
           PEOPLE on the grass at the other side of the square.

           EXT SQUARE - DAY

           There’s some discussion going on amongst the uneasy group of 
           PEOPLE.

           INT STORE - DAY

           The MAN in the store is now sitting in a chair a little way 
           back from the front door cradling the shotgun in his arms. He 
           looks relaxed as he watches the PEOPLE on the other side of 
           the square.

           EXT SQUARE - DAY

           A young black man, CARL, leaves the group of PEOPLE and 
           starts walking purposefully across the grass, heading in the 
           general direction of the store.

           INT STORE - DAY

           The MAN watches CARL’s approach every step of the way. As 
           CARL starts across the road in front of the store, the MAN 
           gets to his feet and steps towards the door.

           EXT STORE FRONT - DAY

           CARL sees the MAN with the shotgun on the other side of the 
           glass-fronted door and for a moment their eyes meet.

           INT STORE - DAY

           The MAN with the shotgun watches CARL turn along the front of 
           the store and disappear from view.

           EXT STORE FRONT - DAY

           CARL walks towards a public phone.

           INT STORE - DAY

           The MAN returns to the chair and resumes watching the PEOPLE 
           across the square.

           EXT PUBLIC PHONE - DAY

           CARL finishes dialling, raises the handset and waits for 
           someone to answer.

           INT STORE - DAY

           The MAN goes on watching the PEOPLE across the square.

           EXT SQUARE - DAY

           Two white men and two black GIRLS leave the group and head 
           towards the store.

           The men, both about thirty, are wearing ecclesiastical 
           collars. They’re PRIESTS.

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
           EXT PUBLIC PHONE - DAY

           CARL has the phone to his ear.

                                 CARL
                        It’s Carl. Yeah... They just 
                        released us bout ten minutes ago. 
                        No.... they left. Just left us on 
                        the street. Ya'll need to send us 
                        some help... Like yesterday.

           EXT STORE FRONT - DAY

           The PRIESTS and the GIRLS keep walking towards the store.

           INT STORE - DAY

           The MAN with the shotgun stands up.

           EXT PUBLIC PHONE - DAY

           CARL is now waiting on the phone for confirmation of a ride. 
           He sees something out of the corner of his eye and looks 
           round. He sees:

           EXT STORE FRONT - DAY

           the PRIESTS and the GIRLS approach the storefront steps.

           INT STORE - DAY

           The MAN pumps the shotgun.

           EXT PUBLIC PHONE - DAY

           Just as CARL’s  eyes begin to widen in alarm someone comes 
           back on the phone.

                                 CARL
                        Twenty minutes? No now..NOW!

           He lets the phone drop from his hand and steps forward.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Hey!!

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
           EXT STORE FRONT - DAY

           The leading GIRL has half-opened the door into the store when 
           she and the young PRIEST, two steps behind her, turn towards 
           the urgent shout, the GIRL letting go of the door handle as 
           she does so. The door slowly swings open.

           EXT PUBLIC PHONE - DAY

           CARL thrusts out his hand in a ‘stop’ gesture.

                                 CARL
                        Don’t go in there!

           EXT STORE FRONT - DAY

           The PRIEST  turns away from Carl, back towards the GIRL 
           standing in front of the door — as it completes its arc to 
           reveal the MAN with the raised shotgun. The angle reverses to 
           show:

           INT STORE - DAY

           From the back of the store, the MAN holding the gun is statue-
           still, calmly aiming at the GIRL framed in the doorway.

           EXT STORE FRONT - DAY

           The PRIEST pulls the girl away from the door. She stumbles 
           onto one knee. The PRIEST starts to raise his hand in appeal 
           or reassurance — and is blown ten feet off the top step and 
           into the road.

           INT STORE - DAY

           The MAN pumps the shotgun and with the same calm  — walks 
           towards the door, and the GIRL.

           EXT STORE FRONT - DAY

           The GIRL breaks out of shock and runs, along the front of the 
           buildings. The second PRIEST grabs the GIRL next to him and 
           they start running. The MAN takes aim and fires. The second 
           PRIEST is hit in the back and sprawls forward onto the 
           ground. 

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
           The GIRL stops running, paralysed with fear stares like a 
           deer in the headlight. She wets herself. The MAN lowers the 
           shotgun, turns and strolls back into the store.

           EXT PUBLIC PHONE - DAY

           CARL stares in disbelief.

           EXT SQUARE - DAY

           The PEOPLE across the square stare in disbelief.

           EXT PUBLIC PHONE - DAY

           CARL turns and grabs the phone.

           EXT SQUARE - DAY

           A few PEOPLE start to move across the grass towards the 
           store.

           EXT STORE FRONT - DAY

           A car has stopped in front of the store. The DRIVER stares at 
           the body in the road.

                                 MAN (OOV)
                        This is Deputy Sheriff Tom Coleman.

           INT STORE - DAY

           The MAN is speaking into a phone on the counter.

                                 MAN
                        I want to speak to Jim Clark. 
                        (waits) Sheriff, those two white-
                        nigger preachers. I just shot ‘em.

           INT WAITING ROOM - DAY

           A tall, imposing middle-aged black woman — ANNIE Lee Cooper - 
           sits in silence in the spotlessly clean room. On the opposite 
           side of the room is CARL. 

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
           He watches ANNIE: she has a bag of books with her and she’s 
           studying a volume, memorizing a section. CARL looks across 
           the room at a partially-open door, labelled ‘Registrars’.

           ENTER LILA-MAE MAYHEW, a sweet middle aged white woman. From 
           the looks of it, the women are friends. Lila-Mae approaches 
           Annie with concern. 

                                 LILA MAE
                        Annie? ...Annie Lee, what are you 
                        doing here? 
                            (whispers)
                        You know you shouldn't be in here. 
                        This ain't no place for a decent 
                        colored lady. Why are you looking 
                        for trouble?

                                 ANNIE
                        I got to do what I gotta do Miss 
                        Lila Mae.

           Lila Mae GLARES at Carl accusatory.

                                 LILA MAE
                        You put her up to this?!

           Carl STARES straight ahead. Lila Mae snarls.

                                 LILA MAE (CONT’D)
                        A dis-damn-grace. You both should 
                        be shamed.

           EXT WHITE HOUSE/STREET - DAY

           A taxi approaches the White House.

           INT TAXI - DAY

           In the taxi are Martin Luther KING - 36, and looking even 
           younger - and Andrew YOUNG - King’s Chief Assistant. YOUNG is 
           of similar age to King, handsome, with a certain style to his 
           dress.

                                 YOUNG
                        You going to tell him about Selma?

                                 KING
                        Not unless he tells me what he did 
                        to your momma?

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
                                 YOUNG
                            (a beat... smiles...)
                        Sick. You’re very ill, Reverend.

           King laughs.

           INT COURTHOUSE/WAITING ROOM - DAY

           A large, sauntering, early middle-aged white man opens a 
           door. He’s wearing sports-jacket and ties, and two badges: 
           one stating ‘Sheriff’ and a cheap, circular lapel badge which 
           simply states ‘Never!’. The man is Sheriff Jim CLARK. He’s 
           accompanied by a DEPUTY in uniform.

                                 CLARK
                        (mocking) Two this month!

                                 DEPUTY
                        (nodding at the Registrars’ Office) 
                        Those boys must need the overtime, 
                        Sheriff.

           CLARK guffaws and turns to go — then stops, something 
           registering. He turns and, yes, there’s a chewing-gum wrapper 
           on the floor near ANNIE’s feet. CLARK walks over to ANNIE. 
           She looks up at him.

                                 CLARK
                        You drop that there?

                                 ANNIE
                        No.

                                 CLARK
                        This my courthouse and I like it 
                        clean. Please pick it up.

           ANNIE stares at CLARK.

                                 ANNIE
                        Sheriff Clark . . .

           A moment between them.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        . . . I didn’t drop it there.

                                 CLARK
                        Did I ask who dropped it? Pick it 
                        up. 

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
           A fierce stare from ANNIE. A moment between ANNIE and CLARK — 
           broken when CARL gets up, walks over and picks up the 
           wrapper. A moment between CARL and CLARK. Suddenly CLARK 
           grins.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        That’s obligin’ of you Boy.

           CLARK turns and goes, followed by the DEPUTY. CARL returns to 
           his place and silence returns to the room. ANNIE looks at 
           CARL — who avoids her gaze - then goes back to her book.

           INT WHITE HOUSE/OUTER OFFICE - DAY

           KING waits alone in the outer office of the President.

           INT COURTHOUSE/WAITING ROOM - DAY

           A loud, aggressive voice from the Registrars’ Office:

                                 REGISTRAR (OOV)
                        Annie Lee Cooper!

           As ANNIE gets to her feet, she looks at CARL as if he might 
           wish her luck. He merely looks back, without expression.

           INT WHITE HOUSE/OUTER OFFICE - DAY

           KING gets to his feet as a presidential aide — Dick GOODWIN — 
           36, dark, strong face -  eyes filled with admiration, 
           approaches KING and offers his hand.

                                 GOODWIN
                        Doctor King. Congratulations!

           INT COURTHOUSE/REGISTRAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           ANNIE Lee Cooper stands in front of three desks, the middle 
           one displaying a plaque which states ‘ELECTORAL REGISTRATION 
           PANEL’. A white REGISTRAR sits behind each desk. They’re 
           formally dressed but their manner suggests a casual, even 
           dismissive, approach to their task. They stare smugly at 
           ANNIE as she recites from memory.

           Silence. It’s the right answer.

           INT WHITE HOUSE/OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           PRESIDENT LYNDON JOHNSON strides across the WHITE HOUSE/OVAL 
           OFFICE, beaming, hand held out to KING — now being shown into 
           the room by Dick GOODWIN, who withdraws as  JOHNSON pumps 
           KING’s hand, putting a long arm round his shoulder, drawing 
           him into the room.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Martin, you just won the Nobel 
                        Prize and I just won the biggest 
                        landslide in American presidential 
                        history. This...

           JOHNSON taps a photograph on the wall.

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        ...is only the beginning.

           JOHNSON gazes proudly at the photo. It shows JOHNSON and KING 
           beaming at one another as they shake hands, surrounded by 
           smiling senators. Its caption reads: ‘Martin Luther King 
           congratulates President Lyndon Baines Johnson at the signing 
           of the Civil Rights Act 1964’.

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Ending a hundred years of 
                        segregation was my proudest moment. 
                        If I had only one photograph on the 
                        wall that would be it.

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
                                 KING
                        Your secretary put it there five 
                        minutes ago, Mr. President.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Three! 

           Talking all the while, JOHNSON guides KING to a chair by a 
           small table ready-laden with coffee and cups. JOHNSON sits 
           opposite and pours. KING’s youth is even more striking seen 
           against Johnson’s maturity.

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Civil rights is an enormous 
                        priority. We don’t meet that 
                        challenge this nation’s storing up 
                        a heap of trouble. I feel damn 
                        fortunate having such a 
                        statesmanlike negra like yourself 
                        leading that movement and I want 
                        you to go on, no-one else. So, I 
                        wanna help you all I can. Tell me 
                        how.

                                 KING
                        NEGROS, Mister President. We are 
                        called NEGROS, Sir. I want Federal 
                        legislation to help us to register 
                        to vote. I want local registrars 
                        replaced with Federal registrars in 
                        every town. And if necessary, 
                        Federal marshals to escort NEGROS 
                        to those registrars.

           JOHNSON is unfased — in fact was anticipating King’s every 
           word. While respectful and admiring, JOHNSON is confident of 
           his sway over the younger, far less powerful man.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Don’t go starting another battle 
                        ‘fore you done won the first! Most 
                        the South still not desegregatin’.

                        the tail wagging the dog! What use 
                        is the vote if you can’t buy decent 
                        food for your kids, keep ‘em warm 
                        at night, put shoes on their feet? 
                        People ain't gonna vote when 
                        they’re living like dogs. Folks say 
                        money is the root of all evil.

                        They’re wrong. Poverty is the root 
                        of all evil. Poverty is public

           JOHNSON grins excitedly at KING — who doesn’t look as 
           impressed as he might.

           INT COURTHOUSE/REGISTRAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           CLOSE-UP of the REGISTRARS: smugly hostile. Annie still 
           stands  before them. REGISTRAR 2 thrusts a book at her.

                                 REGISTRAR 2 
                        Now open this and read.

           Annie takes the book and starts turning the pages, searching.

                                 REGISTRAR 1
                        You not familiar with the works of 
                        Shakespeare... 

           She leafs through the pages; REGISTRAR 1 inks the ‘Denied’ 
           stamp and raises it above the application form. Annie starts 
           reading.

                                 ANNIE

           A brief CLOSE-UP of the REGISTRARS, stilled by the power of 
           the language and of Annie’s reading.

                        General knowledge.

           Brief pause for smirks all round.

                        How many bubbles in a soap bar?

           Annie stares at the gloating REGISTRARS for a moment — and 
           continues reading.

                                 ANNIE

                        Enough of that!

           REGISTRAR 1 slams the ‘Denied’ stamp onto her form.

                                 ANNIE
                        And if you wrong us shall we not

                        rest, we will resemble you in that.

           Silence. Then REGISTRAR snatches open a drawer and produces 
           an automatic pistol. He levels it at Annie. A moment.

                                 REGISTRAR 1
                        You threatening us, you black 
                        bitch?

           Annie contemplates the gun — for a frighteningly long time.

           Another long moment.

           INT WHITE HOUSE/OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           JOHNSON is on his feet, returning from his desk with a bundle 
           of briefing papers in his hands. He drops them on the table 
           in front of KING.

                                 JOHNSON
                        That’s a lot of legislation and 
                        there’s gonna be lot of resistance. 
                        Now I want you to come work with me 
                        on this - get these reforms through 
                        Congress! ...I’ll give you whatever 
                        you need.

           A moment between them. Is this a bribe? KING stares 
           regretfully at JOHNSON for several seconds.

                                 KING
                        Mr.. President, you ever heard of 
                        Deputy Sheriff Tom Coleman?

                                 JOHNSON
                        No.

                                 KING
                        He murdered two civil rights 
                        workers in public in broad 
                        daylight. He was charged with 
                        manslaughter. Yesterday a court in 
                        Montgomery acquitted him.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Look, I know we got a lot more work 
                        to do down there —

                                 KING
                        Coleman was just the latest one. 
                        They’re killing us like flies. And 
                        no one is ever convicted cause 
                        they’re protected by white legal 
                        officials, elected by an all-white 
                        electorate, and freed by all-white 
                        juries - all-white cause you can’t 
                        serve on a jury unless you’re on 
                        the electoral register! We need the 
                        vote in the South. It isn’t a 
                        matter of priorities - it’s a 
                        matter of life and death!

           Brief cold silence. JOHNSON looks into KING’s eyes. He’s 
           underestimated him and this day is lost. JOHNSON smiles 
           resignedly. He sits down.

                                 JOHNSON

           JOHNSON looks at the photograph on the wall. We see it in 
           CLOSE-UP as a hand lifts the photo off the wall and replaces 
           it with a photo of Johnson with Governor George Wallace. We 
           PULL BACK to see a SECRETARY disappear with the King photo. 
           JOHNSON looks at GOODWIN and grins.

           King is hearing Brown’s funk and Coretta’s classical as he 
           smokes a cigarette. He starts to tap his feet to James Brown.

           Coretta turns to the bedroom with an annoyed stare banging

           Coretta enters the bedroom doorway. She’s attractive and has 
           a certain dignity - while he is in his element. King and the

           start dancing again. The doorbell rings. CORETTA returns to 
           the bedroom. The kids cower behind their dad. 

                                 CORETTA 
                        Martin!

           She laughs — then a serious edge with sadness enters her

           A CLOSE-UP of KING, smiling sheepishly. CORETTA glances 
           towards the living room.

           passenger seat. The driver is Andrew YOUNG. In the back seat 
           is Ralph ABERNATHY, formally dressed like the others. 
           ABERNATHY looks more than his 46 years. 

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
           He’s King’s deputy as well as his oldest friend and 
           colleague. But his mood is far from collegiate.

           casually dressed, wearing a denim jacket and a beanie-cap on 
           his balding head — raises his hand and smiles as the car 
           slows.

           Governor George WALLACE - short, dark, intense, stocky - 
           stands in his office, smoking hard.

           WALLACE turns from the window to face two men: Colonel Al 
           LINGO, the commander of the Alabama State Troopers, and his 
           deputy, Major John CLOUD. They’re both in uniform, both in 
           their forties. CLOUD looks rather bookish. LINGO is stubby 
           looking. They betray a flicker of amusement as WALLACE goes 
           into a rant.

           WALLACE walks to the ashtray on his desk and obliterates his 
           cigarette.

           inside the hotel lobby, waiting to witness the passing of an

                            (smiles)
                        Yes, oh course.

           KING steps towards him, holding out his hand. The YOUNG WHITE 
           MAN attacks KING, landing punches to the head - and a kick in 
           the groin as KING goes down.

           INT HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           KING sits on the bed, sweating, cigarette in one hand, can of 
           beer in the other. ABERNATHY, YOUNG, BEVEL and police chief 
           Wilson BAKER are with him.

                                 BAKER
                        You want to file charges?

           KING seems not to have heard Baker.

                                 BAKER (CONT’D)
                        Doctor King?

                                 KING
                        No.

                                 BAKER
                        Alright.

           BAKER goes. ABERNATHY looks at KING, who looks glassy-eyed.

                                 ABERNATHY
                            (to Young and Bevel)
                        I want this understood. I’m number 
                        two in this organization and I say 
                        Doc’s got a concussion and he’s in 
                        no fit condition. We get him to a 
                        hospital and the hell out of this 
                        town!

                                 KING
                        Ralph... stop sounding like a lady 
                        and get yourself a beer. 

           ABERNATHY looks at the others. He is angry with them and 
           himself. KING gets to his feet and starts taking his shirt 
           off.

           INT HOTEL ROOM/SHOWER - DAY

           KING stands - head back, arms outspread - in the soothing 
           waters of a shower, BLOOD trickling down his face. He looks 
           at SCAR on his chest, shaped like a cross.

           INT HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           KING, smartly dressed now, studies himself in the mirror for 
           a moment, feeling a slight swelling on one side of his face. 
           There’s a knock at the door. At the sound, a change begins to 
           come over KING as he stares at himself in the mirror: he 
           straightens up, seems to grow an inch or two; an ironic 
           smile, tinged with relief, spreads across his face; suddenly 
           the smile becomes a grin.

                                 KING
                        Lord said, “Martin Luther, stand up 
                        for Justice. Stand up for Truth. 
                        And I will be with you, even until 
                        the end of the world.”
                            (a beat, smile)
                        Showtime!

           CLOSE-UP of KING speaking from the pulpit of a large church 
           packed with a MEETING of 700 people. We catch him in mid-
           flow, mid-throttle.

                                 KING
                        Now how is it that more than half 
                        the population of this city is 
                        black — and less than two percent 
                        of voting-age Negroes have the 
                        vote! How is it that not one Negro 
                        has been given the vote in Selma in 
                        the last ten years! One reason is 
                        those Registrars down there at the 
                        courthouse open their doors just 
                        two days a month! Now, at their 
                        present rate of business — and 
                        assuming those registrars approve 
                        every application! — to get 
                        everyone registered who should be 
                        registered would take a hundred and 
                        three years! 

           The crowd yells “That’s right!” And “Naw sir we surely 
           don’t!” Etc.

                                 KING (CONT’D)
                        But we don’t have that long to 
                        wait!!

           JIMMIE Lee Jackson, a young man of radiant good nature, 
           laughs and puts his arm round a white-haired old man, 83 year-
           old CAGER Lee.

                                 JIMMIE
                        No! My grandpappy waited over sixty 
                        years already!

           Laughter. Cries of, ‘Too long! That’s too long!’ Behind CAGER 
           is ANNIE, gazing at KING with fierce approval. Alongside 
           CAGER are his middle-aged daughter VIOLA, Jimmie’s mother. 
           Sitting next to JIMMIE is his friend CARL. Voices from the 
           MEETING: ‘Tell the story!’, ‘Make it plain!’, ‘Speak on it!

                                 KING
                        Now we can change this! But we got 
                        to be prepared to march! And we got 
                        to be prepared to go to jail! For 
                        one night, two nights — we got good 
                        lawyers! — but no-one’s telling you 
                        going to jail even for one night is 
                        fun. And we have to go to jail by 
                        the thousands! Again and again. But 
                        if we do that then the whole of 
                        America will hear our cry: Give us

           The MEETING bursts into ‘Eyes On the Prize’ -  linking arms 
           as they sing.  JIMMIE links his arm with CARL. JIMMIE is 
           inspired. He looks up at KING. CLOSE-UP of KING: we catch him 
           dispassionately assessing the mood of the Meeting.

           INT BROWN’S CHAPEL/BACK ROOM - DAY

           With the sound of the MEETING singing ‘Eyes On The Prize’ 
           (”Well, the one thing we did RIGHT was the day we started to 
           FIGHT! Keep your EYES on the PRIZE, hold on...” in the 
           background, KING, ABERNATHY, YOUNG and BEVEL enter the room.

                                 KING
                        (to Abernathy) How was I?

                        Yeah? Well listen to that! They’re 
                        ready.

           The MEETING walks out into the darkening streets, talking 
           excitedly, many looking inspired. But there’s a small group 
           of young men and women, STUDENT ACTIVISTS, standing to one 
           side, watching, with doubt and concern. Their leaders are 
           James FORMAN and John LEWIS — two men in their late twenties, 
           leaders of a student civil rights organization (Student Non-
           Violent Coordination Committee) which regards King’s 
           organization as a conservative personality-cult. CARL is with 
           them.

           INT BROWN’S CHAPEL/BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           CLOSE-UP of KING: tired and depressed. KING and his TEAM - 
           twenty-odd people - are having a strategy meeting in a room 
           at the back of the church. 

           In addition to ABERNATHY, YOUNG and BEVEL there’s an 
           aggressive new face, Hoseah WILLIAMS — middle-aged, a senior 
           figure in the movement. 

           There are white LAWYERS and ADVISORS, and some STUDENT 
           ACTIVISTS, including James FORMAN, John LEWIS and CARL. 
           FORMAN is hot-headed; LEWIS is more measured. CARL stays in 
           the background, keenly observant, his own man. Though he 
           remains silent, CARL is a strong presence throughout this 
           scene.

                                 FORMAN
                        Yes, we wanna help... We’ll bring 
                        our people in - from all over the 
                        South if necessary - we’re just 
                        asking for some kind of commitment.

                                 LEWIS
                        All we’re saying is our 
                        organization has had people working 
                        on voter registration in Alabama 
                        for two years . . .

                                 WILLIAMS
                        You ain’t got very far have you?

                                 LEWIS
                        We’re still here, ain’t we?!

                                 WILLIAMS
                        Meaning what?

                                 FORMAN
                        Meaning this time next month you 
                        might not be! ‘Meaning’ like you 
                        did up there in Albany, right? You 
                        left em! You know what? You need to 
                        take that little Nobel Peace prize 
                        and step. 

                                 WILLIAMS
                        This is fuckin nuts!

                                 ABERNATHY
                        You know what? I think we should 
                        step. 
                                 (MORE)

                                 ABERNATHY (CONT'D)
                        I think we should leave these 
                        mothefuckahs right here. Now...  
                        come back in two years and see what 
                        they got going on.

           ABERNATHY’s double-edged attack is the last straw for KING. 
           He erupts with sudden powerful anger.

                                 KING
                        Shut up! That’s enough!

           The room is instantly silent. ABERNATHY is particularly 
           shocked. KING stares at ABERNATHY for a moment then gets to 
           his feet. He paces up and down as he talks - ostensibly to 
           FORMAN and LEWIS. But he’s also talking to himself, talking 
           his self-doubt away, as well as putting Abernathy back in 
           check.

                                 KING (CONT’D)
                        John. James. The way our 
                        organization works is simple: we 
                        set up a confrontation - and wait 
                        for our adversary to make a 
                        mistake. We were in Albany for nine 
                        months! But Sheriff Laurie 
                        Pritchett never made a mistake! He 
                        kept his cool, kept arresting us in 
                        a humane way; carried people in the 
                        jail-wagons on stretchers. Day in - 
                        day out. There was no drama.

                                 FORMAN
                            (disparagingly)
                        You mean there was no cameras.

                                 KING
                        Exactly! What we gotta do is raise 
                        white consciousness. Especially the 
                        consciousness in the Oval Office. 
                        Kennedy ignored us in Albany — 
                        because the newspapers and TV 
                        ignored us. And right now Johnson 
                        fryin other fish and he’ll ignore 
                        us too - if he can. We’ll get his 
                        attention all right... if we’re on 
                        the front page of every newspaper 
                        in every state and if we’re on the 
                        TV on every news channel every 
                        morning and every night. And 
                        that... requires drama! 

           A brief, intense silence. Now, finally, CARL looks at KING 
           with respect and some measure of approval.

           KING, ABERNATHY and BEVEL lead MARCHERS through the streets. 
           FORMAN, LEWIS and other STUDENT ACTIVISTS, including CARL, 
           are just behind them.

                        Clark doesn’t control the streets.

                        Clark controls in Selma is the 
                        County Courthouse.

           There are POLICEMEN along the route, most of them hostile and 
           resentful - but disciplined. A police car slows alongside 
           KING. BAKER leans out of the window.

                        doubt he is a card-carrying 
                        segregationist he’s also a 
                        dedicated by-the-book lawman.

                        Doctor King, I suggest you walk in 
                        pairs, clearly separated.

                                 KING
                        Why is that, Chief?

                                 BAKER
                        Otherwise I will enforce the 
                        injunction against street-
                        gatherings of three people or more.

           BAKER’s car moves off.

           EXT SELMA/STREET - DAY

           The MARCHERS are now walking in widely spaced pairs.

           From KING’S POV we pick out a BUILDING in the distance.

                                 KING (VO) 
                        So that’s the difference. In Albany 
                        we were fighting all over the place 
                        and it was a mess. Here, the County 
                        Courthouse is where we focus our 
                        war cause that’s where the voter 
                        registration is...

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
           EXT COURTHOUSE - DAY

           We see in big CLOSE-UP the single word ‘NEVER!’ on a lapel 
           badge.

                                 KING (VO)
                        ...But remember, there’s some 
                        crazies in there.

           We PULL BACK to see the lapel badge is worn by someone 
           impersonating General Patton. In fact the large man in the 
           white combat helmet, tight-fitting military-style uniform, 
           wearing a six-shooter and carrying a club, is Sheriff Jim 
           CLARK - dressed for war. CLARK is standing at the top of the 
           courthouse steps. Below him, at the foot of the steps, is a 
           line of DEPUTIES, carrying guns and clubs.

                                 KING (VO) (CONT’D)
                        Selma County Courthouse is the 
                        perfect stage-set.

           Across the street stands a group of POSSEMEN, licensed 
           vigilantes - a frighteningly crazy bunch. The possemen’s 
           dress ranges from blue-collar working clothes to cowboy 
           outfits, bearing crudely made pin-badges stating ‘Sheriff’s 
           Posse’. They are even more heavily-armed than the DEPUTIES 
           and carry a strikingly varied assortment of side-arms, home-
           made clubs and electric cattle-prods. 

           To jeers and abuse from RACIST ONLOOKERS, KING and the 
           MARCHERS line up at the foot of the courthouse steps. KING 
           looks up at CLARK.

                                 KING (VO) (CONT’D)
                        And trust me, Jim Clark will give 
                        us the perfect drama.

           CLOSE-UP of CLARK: a mask of outrage and aggression. The 
           POSSEMEN eye with fierce hostility a group of JOURNALISTS, 
           slowly walking around in a circle in single file, watched and 
           protected, reluctantly, by four of Baker’s POLICEMEN.

                                 JOURNALIST 1
                        Mr. Baker how do you justify this?

           BAKER turns, deadpan.

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
                                 BAKER
                        I’m enforcing the law against 
                        loitering, walking on the grass, 
                        blocking the sidewalk and illegal 
                        assembly. And you’re observing it. 
                        Thank-you gentlemen.

           From a bunch of jeering, white RACIST ONLOOKERS across the 
           street, two YOUNG REDNECKS walk across the road, stop in 
           front of a tall elegant woman, AMELIA Boynton, spits on her 
           face, and march off. 

           AMELIA takes out a handkerchief and wipes the saliva from her 
           throat.

                                 KING
                        Sheriff! That was a disgraceful and 
                        illegal act!

                                 CLARK
                        You’re right!

           CLARK turns to the DEPUTIES.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        I want you to keep an eye out for 
                        those boys! Next thing you know 
                        they’ll be spitting on the 
                        sidewalk!

           The DEPUTIES guffaw. CLARK turns back and sees AMELIA Boynton 
           staring at him with fearless contempt. There’s a long 
           eyeballing moment between them.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        You all deliberately causing an 
                        obstruction! If you don’t disperse 
                        you’ll be arrested!

                                 KING
                        Sheriff Clark, all we’re trying to 
                        do is gain access to the 
                        registration office. Which is our 
                        legal right.

                                 CLARK
                        There’s too many of you and you 
                        know damn well there’s too many of 
                        you! You’re going to have to wait 
                        at the rear.

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
                                 KING
                        No, Sheriff. We’re going in the 
                        front way, and we’re going to wait 
                        right here.

           CLARK comes down the steps and starts pushing and prodding a 
           few of the leading MARCHERS — and, in particular, AMELIA 
           Boynton - along the sidewalk.

                                 CLARK
                        You wanna wait, you wait in the 
                        yard!

           He’s a big man and for a few moments he has the small group 
           of MARCHERS stumbling towards a side-alley. AMELIA breaks out 
           of the group and heads back the other way. CLARK holds out 
           his club, checking her.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Where in hell you think you’re 
                        going? Ain’t you heard me?

           AMELIA gives CLARK a look of utter disdain, steps around the 
           club, and walks back towards the main group. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Okay lady, I’ma show you where 
                        you’re goin!

           CLARK seizes AMELIA her by the collar of her coat. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        You’re under arrest! 
                            (whispers in her ear)
                        Ape-bitch!

           CLARK starts marching AMELIA, stumbling and twisting 
           helplessly in his powerful grip, up the courthouse steps. As 
           the JOURNALISTS and PHOTOGRAPHERS surge forward, the  
           POSSEMEN move in quickly to hold them in check. CLARK thrusts 
           AMELIA inside the courthouse, then turns and yells from the 
           top of the steps.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Clear the sidewalk!!

           The DEPUTIES move in on the MARCHERS, clubs raised, hoping 
           for resistance, but are confounded by an orderly process.

           The majority of MARCHERS move quickly away while two hundred 
           VOLUNTEER-ARRESTEES, including BEVEL, sit on the ground with 
           their hands over their heads.

           INT WALLACE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Governor WALLACE sits at his desk, hands buried in his face.

                                 WALLACE
                        They just jailed two hundred nigra 
                        agitators in Selma.

                                 LINGO (OFF-CAMERA)
                        Two hundred and some.

           AL LINGO and JOHN CLOUD sit opposite him. HATTIE PEARL - 
           Wallace’s black maid, is cleaning the blinds.

                                 WALLACE 
                        I have a fuckin nightmare. You know 
                        what it is?

                                 LINGO
                        No, Governor. What is your 
                        nightmare?

                                 WALLACE
                        My nightmare is: I’m standing at 
                        this very window, watching 
                        thousands of nigras, right out 
                        there, demonstrating in the state 
                        capital - and listening to King 
                        demandin that we give dem damn 
                        nigras the vote. And then I go home 
                        and it’s on national goddamn TV 
                        that night!

           WALLACE walks to the ashtray on his desk and obliterates his 
           cigarette.

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        Selma’s too close to Montgomery. 
                        That King and his filthy Commie 
                        agitators are just a few miles down 
                        Route 80. My nightmare could come 
                        true. Goddamn, niggas.

           Hattie Pearl slaps Wallace’s shoulder with her duster and 
           gives him a look. Wallace rolls his eyes.

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        Hattie Pearl! Go fetch me a 
                        lemonade.

           Hattie leaves. WALLACE calms, shrewdness entering his 
           expression.

                        I want the Selma authorities to 
                        treat King like they’re a bunch of 
                        purty Homecoming Queens. 

           WALLACE fails to notice LINGO and CLOUD glance at each other, 
           sharing an amused scepticism. There’s something sinister and 
           conspiratorial about these two. 

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        That black faggot makes one move in 
                        this direction and we’ll give him 
                        some dick. 

           INT COURTHOUSE - NIGHT

           CLARK is holding a press conference.

                                 REPORTER
                        How many people you arrest today, 
                        Sheriff?

                                 CLARK
                        Two hundred and three.

                                 REPORTER
                        Sheriff what’s the name of the 
                        woman you personally arrested?

                                 CLARK
                        A well-known local agitator. Amelia 
                        Boynton.

                                 REPORTER
                        Is she a Miss or a Mrs?

                                 CLARK
                        She’s a nigger woman.

           The REPORTER raises his eyebrows at a BLACK JOURNALIST, with 
           amused incredulity.

                                 BLACK JOURNALIST
                        Sheriff. Why do you hate black 
                        people?

           Absolute silence. A long moment between CLARK and the BLACK 
           JOURNALIST.

                        Tom Coleman shot those men because 
                        he believed they were gonna attack 
                        him and rob his Daddy’s store.

                                 JOURNALIST
                        You believe that, Sheriff?

           AMELIA Boynton stands shivering, bunched together against the 
           cold with a group of women MARCHERS in a large cell, next to 
           a door deliberately left open to the cold night air. A 
           MARCHER, deeply embarrassed, close to tears, suddenly hitches 
           up her skirt and squats down.

                                 MARCHER

           INT CELL - NIGHT

           Two DEPUTIES haul a fire-hose through a door — and towards 
           the cell containing BEVEL, naked, shivering. He shows no fear 
           but he’s grim. He knows what’s coming.

                                 BEVEL
                        I got weak lungs and I got asthma. 
                        You do that I could die tonight.

                                 DEPUTY
                        Well! That a fact?

           Water explodes from the hose. It takes both DEPUTIES to 
           control it as BEVEL is battered into the corner of the cell. 
           After a few seconds, the DEPUTIES shut the hose off and go, 
           leaving BEVEL curled in a corner, racked with cold.

           EXT WASHINGTON/STREET - NIGHT

           Rain and darkness. Coming towards us is an enormous black 
           car.

           INT PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE/MOVING - NIGHT

           JOHNSON and a couple of AIDES — one of them Dick GOODWIN - 
           are in the back of a presidential limousine being driven 
           through Washington.

                                 JOHNSON
                        I’m beginning to lose sleep over 
                        some raggedy-ass little country in 
                        south-east Asia I don’t know 
                        nothin’ about and could care fuckin 
                        less about. Now King... Trying to 
                        raise a shit-storm on the home 
                        front.

           JOHNSON looks out of the window.

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        I offered him money, influence and 
                        prestige. He didn’t bat a fuckin 
                        eyelid.

                                 GOODWIN
                        Isn’t that called integrity, Mr.. 
                        President?

           JOHNSON grins at GOODWIN.

                        Integrity my ass. He just don’t 
                        want to be retired into 
                        statesmanship just yet. He’s got 
                        his Nobel Peace Prize but that 
                        ain’t what King’s looking for. His 
                        glory days are almost over. That’s 
                        hard for a young man. He’s gonna 
                        fail in Selma. This whole thing 
                        could backfire and fuck up my War

           INT CELL - DAY

           Early morning. A cell full of male MARCHERS in various 
           postures of shivering stupor, utterly silent, each locked in 
           his own suffering and endurance.

           INT CELL - DAY

           Early morning. AMELIA and the other women MARCHERS are 
           huddled close together, arms around each other, comforting 
           one another.

           INT CELL - DAY

           Morning. BEVEL is curled in the corner of the cell. A JAILER 
           approaches, carrying Bevel’s clothes. He pushes them through 
           the bars.

                                 JAILER
                        You must have a good white-nigger 
                        lawyer, boy. You’re outta here.

           He whacks the bars with his night stick. 

                                 JAILER (CONT’D)
                        Get up!

           BEVEL doesn’t stir.

           INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           BEVEL is regaining consciousness, breathing with difficulty. 
           The first thing he registers is KING, standing by the bed 
           looking down at him. BEVEL smiles, tries to move - and 
           becomes aware that he’s shackled.

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
                                 BEVEL
                        Doc, you’ve been praying over me?

           KING smiles.

                                 BEVEL (CONT’D)
                        We got a movement?

                                 KING
                        Not yet.

           DOCTOR TYSON comes in. He holds out his hand to KING. They 
           shake.

                                 DOCTOR TYSON
                        It’s an honour. I’m Doctor Tyson.

           The DOCTOR starts to examine BEVEL. He nods reassuringly.

                                 DOCTOR TYSON (CONT’D)
                        Good. We’re doing good. 

                                 KING
                        You registered to vote, doctor?

                                 DOCTOR TYSON
                        No, Dr. King.

                                 KING
                        You gonna march with us?

           The DOCTOR says nothing, just continues his examination.

                                 KING (CONT’D)
                        We just announced another Freedom 
                        Day. Next week.

                                 DOCTOR TYSON
                        That ‘freedom’ day or ‘lose your 
                        job’ day’?

                                 KING
                        No, Doctor Tyson. The second 
                        Freedom Day is ‘make or break’ day. 
                        And we need your support.

           DOCTOR finishes his examination, then turns to King, smiling.

                                 DOCTOR TYSON
                        C’mon Doctor King. Negro in the

           The BLACK JOURNALIST rams his foot against the door and 
           shouts gleefully at the POSSEMEN and into the phone at the 
           same time.

           The POSSEMEN force the door open enough for POSSEMAN 2 to 
           punch the BLACK JOURNALIST in the mouth, knocking him to the 
           floor - and some teeth out. The POSSEMEN grab his legs and 
           start pulling him out of the booth. The bloodied BLACK 
           JOURNALIST, still triumphant, turns his head and yells into 
           the dangling handset.

           CLOSE-UP of LURLEEN WALLACE, attractive, well-groomed, bored, 
           flicking through a magazine, irritated by her husband’s 
           preoccupation. CLOSE-UP of WALLACE: depression. WALLACE is 
           standing in a large, expensive kitchen, holding a freshly-
           poured whisky on ice, staring at MRS WALLACE, his somewhat 
           trophy-ish wife.

                                 LURLEEN WALLACE
                        George what is the matter with you? 
                        I don’t get it. A few teachers been 
                        arrested. So what?

           WALLACE closes his eyes and shakes his head.

                                 WALLACE

           A packed MEETING sings with enormous power and joy. KING, 
           ABERNATHY, YOUNG and BEVEL are on the platform, singing with 
           gusto. The camera moves through the MEETING, picking out 
           familiar faces like CAGER, VIOLA, JIMMIE, ANNIE and CARL, 
           everyone euphoric with fellowship and achievement. In CLOSE-
           UP: ABERNATHY turns to KING. A moment between them. ABERNATHY 
           smiles.

                                 ABERNATHY
                        Congratulations, Doc.

           KING gives one of his million megawatt smiles, gives 
           ABERNATHY’s arm a little squeeze of gratitude, then turns 
           back towards the MEETING, ripping into ‘Aint Gonna Let No-one

           Distantly, the sound of singing. A CLEANING LADY pauses as 
           she walks across a deserted office towards a half-opened 
           door. She’s intrigued by the sound coming from the other side 
           of the door: the Meeting singing ‘Aint Gonna Let No-One Turn 
           Me Round’. She walks forward and opens the door, to reveal 
           CLARK and a DEPUTY sitting in a little room, listening to a 
           speaker which is relaying voices from Brown’s Chapel. CLARK 
           turns, sees the CLEANING LADY and quickly switches off the 
           speaker.

                                 DEPUTY

                        I’m missing you.

                        You’re supposed to say you’re

                        maybe there’s enough momentum here 
                        now I could sneak home for a couple 
                        of days.

           Silence. KING waits.

                        No, Martin. Not yet. We’re fine.

           he needs to hear — and he accepts it gratefully if guiltily. 
           CLOSE-UP of CORETTA: she knows exactly what’s going on in her

           She buzzes Johnson.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           Johnson is at his desk staring out the window. Dick Goodwin 
           sits on the couch going through the daily de-brief. The 
           intercom rings.

                                 SECRETARY (V.O.)
                        Mr. President, Mr. Hoover is here.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Send him in.

           Johnson and Dick look up with deliberately neutral 
           expressions as the door opens and in walks J EDGAR HOOVER, an 
           aging reptile.

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Hello J. Edgar.

                                 HOOVER
                        Hello Mister President. Mister 
                        Goodwin.

           Before Johnson can speak again Hoover rants.

                                 HOOVER (CONT’D)
                        Mister President over a year ago, 
                        you directed my FBI to increase our 
                        crusade against spies, saboteurs 
                        and subversives. 

           Johnson and Goodwin share a glance. Hoover continues:

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
                                 HOOVER (CONT’D)
                        This responsibility was gladly 
                        accepted as the American people 
                        continue to take their liberty for 
                        granted and have ceased to think 
                        seriously about it. But the foes of 
                        America are thinking about it and 
                        have penetrated every realm of 
                        decency. 

           Suddenly, it seems Hoover is done. He stands silent waiting 
           for approval. Goodwin and Johnson exchange a private glance. 
           Goodwin hides a smirk. Johnson smiles at Hoover, stands up to 
           shake his hand, Hoover abruptly continues.

                                 HOOVER (CONT’D)
                        These subversive forces are in our 
                        schools, our churches, and civic 
                        organizations. This is because the 
                        majority of the American people are 
                        pinheads. Stupid like truck drivers 
                        and unable to think straight or 
                        speak the truth. Truth. We must 
                        force America to realize these 
                        legions of subversives are making 
                        tremendous sacrifices for an ideal. 
                        An ideal which aims to destroy 
                        everything which we hold dear. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        Good. Good. I sleep a lot easier 
                        knowing the FBI is looking out for 
                        the country.

           Hoover nods.

                                 HOOVER
                        Is that all, Mr. President...?

                                 JOHNSON
                        Yes. Thank-you, Mister Director.

           HOOVER goes.

                                   DAY

           CLOSE-UP of a smiling SCHOOLKID, about 13. The SCHOOLKID 
           holds up a handwritten sign: ‘JIM CLARK IS A PUSSY’. CUT TO a 
           CLOSE-UP of CLARK, angered by the sign - but somehow smug. 
           He’s watching over a hundred feisty SCHOOLCHILDREN parade in 
           front of the courthouse steps, singing ‘Aint Gonna Let Nobody 
           Turn Me Round’. Several of them are holding up signs: ‘Jim 
           Clark Is A Cracker’, ‘Wallace Must Go’, ‘Nobody’s Gonna Turn 
           Us Round’, ‘Give my Ma and Pa the Vote!’  There’s a line of 
           POSSEMEN at the foot of the steps. A car pulls up across the 
           road and KING gets out.

                                 JOURNALIST (OOV)
                        Doctor King! Doctor King! This  
                        your decision?!

           The JOURNALISTS have paused in a circle watched over by a 
           couple of Baker’s POLICEMEN. KING says nothing, just watches 
           the SCHOOLCHILDREN. Then a Police Car pulls up and BAKER gets 
           out.

                                 JOURNALIST 1
                        Hey, Chief! What do you think of 
                        this putting schoolchildren in the 
                        front line?

                                 BAKER
                        (thinly-veiled disgust) No comment!

                                 JOURNALIST 2
                        Doctor King, Governor Wallace says 
                        your approval of demonstrations by 
                        schoolchildren is cowardly and 
                        cynical. What do you say?

           He says nothing. But BAKER gives KING a look which tells us 
           he agrees with Wallace. The view of the SCHOOLCHILDREN is 
           abruptly obscured by the arrival of three school buses 
           outside the courthouse. CLARK descends a few steps so he, 
           too, is out of sight. CUT TO the other side of the buses, 
           where the POSSEMEN split into two menacing groups, one at 
           each end of the group of SCHOOLCHILDREN. The singing dies 
           away as their sense of enclosure increases. CLARK is grinning

                        Sheriff, you gonna let us march or 
                        you gonna arrest us?

           CLARK and several of his DEPUTIES and POSSEMEN laugh.

                                 CLARK
                        We gonna let you march your little 
                        hearts out. 

           The buses start up. The POSSEMEN, shielded from view by the 
           buses,  start shoving the SCHOOLCHILDREN along the pavement.  
           BAKER and the JOURNALISTS can see little more than three 
           buses, nose-to-tail, moving at walking pace. PHOTOGRAPHERS 
           raise their cameras, wait for a shot to reveal itself, then 
           lower them again, frustrated.

                        What’s happening? The kids on the 
                        buses?

           The reflection on the windows obscures the buses’ interiors. 
           BAKER and the JOURNALISTS stare in amusement as the 
           demonstration simply disappears along the street and around 
           the corner. CLOSE-UP of KING: deep unease.

           The SCHOOLCHILDREN are herded across a wooden bridge on the 
           edge of town.

                                      DAY

           The SCHOOLCHILDREN run and stagger along a dirt road, being 
           driven like cattle by the POSSEMEN: on horseback, cracking a 
           whip; leaning out of cars and jolting kids with electric 
           cattle prods; running alongside like military trainers, 
           yelling: ‘You wanted to march, so march! Go ‘head! March!’ 
           The POSSEMEN are having the time of their lives.

           Sheriff’s Department cars have blocked off the road at the 
           narrow bridge. CLARK and some DEPUTIES lean against the cars, 
           grinning as three car-loads of JOURNALISTS, BAKER and KING 
           arrive almost simultaneously. They can see and hear the 
           POSSEMEN and the SCHOOLCHILDREN in the distance.

                        I believe your jurisdiction ends 
                        right here - Mister Baker.

           BAKER steps angrily up to CLARK, who gets to his feet. For a 
           moment they look ready to fight.

                                 BAKER
                        Sheriff. You are a disgrace to your 
                        office. 
                            (turning away from Clark 
                             and walking towards King)
                        And you are worse! You know how 
                        irresponsible and dangerous these 
                        men are and you good as handed 
                        those children over to them!

           BAKER gets closer to KING and sees the pain and guilt in his 
           eyes. A moment between them — before BAKER strides on towards 
           his car. KING turns and sees ABERNATHY staring at him. He’s 
           angry. KING looks wounded.

                                      DAY

           The POSSEMEN stand around, passing beer to one another, weak 
           with laughter. SCHOOLCHILDREN are lying in ditches, vomiting, 
           weeping, staring into space, struggling for breath. Some, 
           having broken away, lie in surrounding fields. Others are 
           hiding, in a state of terror. CLARK arrives in a car, driven 
           by the CHIEF DEPUTY. CLARK gets out and surveys the scene — 
           with great satisfaction.

                                 CLARK
                        Yeah. So Jim Clark’s a pussy, huh?

           Clark notices a 13 YEAR OLD SCHOOLKID, he does a double-take, 
           goes over to him and realizes its CALVIN, Maybelle’s son. 
           Calvin has an eye missing from his socket. He is convulsing. 
           Clark puts the eye back in its socket.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                            (pain and disgusted)
                        Calvin, why do you make me do this? 
                        Your momma’s been lookin for you. 
                        Why do you do this to her, Calvin?

           Clark slumps.

                        him to a doctor then get him to his 
                        momma.

           KING is alone with ABERNATHY. They’re silent. KING is tense, 
           grim. The door opens. It’s BAKER. KING looks at him, fearing 
           the worst.

                                 BAKER
                        The children are all back. All 
                        home. Wasn’t no deaths. 

           KING sags back in his chair. He looks at BAKER.

                                 KING
                        Thank-you.

           A moment between them.

                                 BAKER
                        Do that again and I will arrest you 
                        for endangering the lives of 
                        minors.

           King lights a cigarette, swigs his beer.

                                 KING
                        You gonna arrest that mob that beat 
                        those defenseless children, Officer 
                        Baker?

           Confused and sad, BAKER shakes his head and goes. Abernathy 
           stares at King and rolls his eyes in disgust. KING stares at 
           ABERNATHY for a moment. 

                                 KING (CONT’D)
                        I can’t do this on my own. 

           KING’s look hardens.

                                 KING (CONT’D)
                        You think we should have shared 
                        that Nobel Prize. Don’t you?

           ABERNATHY stares at him.

                                 KING (CONT’D)
                        You wanted that Nobel Prize, didn’t 
                        you? Ralphy, what did you want me 
                        to do? 

           Abernathy looks away.

                                 KING (CONT’D)
                        Look at me, man. You been with me 
                        every step of the way. I couldn’t 
                        do nothin about that. 

           CLOSE-UP - KING:

                        I need you, man.  

           After a pause that seems like an eternity. Abernathy smiles 
           ironically, and laughs

                                 ABERNATHY
                        Nigga, you’re mad...

           There’s a moment. Baker throws a punch which doesn’t quite 
           connect. Through guilt and frustration, Clark goes at Baker 
           and they are quickly dragged apart.

                        People hear what they want to hear. 
                        I already told him why. I was only 
                        a caretaker President back then but 
                        in six months I ended Segregation 
                        in the United States of America 
                        forever!!! You were there when I 
                        signed the ‘64 Civil Rights Act.

           King is touched by the words of the President.

                                 KING
                        No one else could have done it, Mr. 
                        President.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Getting that Bill through Congress 
                        without a single compromise was the 
                        crowning achievement of my 
                        political life. That was a cattle 
                        drive, Martin and lots of folks 
                        ‘round here are just gettin’ up and 
                        dustin’ my hoof tracks off their 
                        asses. Now if I show up at the 
                        Rodeo again hollerin’ for more 
                        Civil Rights when the ink ain’t 
                        even dry of the ‘64 Act yet, 
                        Congress’ll dig in its heels. 
                        They’ll say “to hell with Martin 
                        Luther King. To hell with Johnson 
                        and his Great Society Program. To 
                        hell with his War on Poverty!!! 
                        Let’s just cut taxes and we all 
                        gonna be richer!!!” You and I, 
                        could lose everything.

           King doesn’t move for a few moments then offers a few 
           concessionary nods. Johnson think he has his Man. Who could 
           resist? Johnson reaches across and puts a hand on King’s arm, 
           like a father to a son.

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Now, what I’m proposin’ is this. I 
                        announce a Special Commission to 
                        investigate electoral abuses in the 
                        South. I’ll state it’s specifically 
                        set up in response to your Selma 
                        campaign. You respond by declarin' 
                        the Selma campaign a major victory 
                        which is what it would be, and 
                        announce its conclusion. Then I 
                        want you to come to Washington, use 
                        your prestige and influence to the 
                        fullest in a place of power and 
                        decision making. You’ve done your 
                        time on the streets, Martin.

           King smiles gratefully. Johnson grins hugely. King grins 
           back.

                                 KING
                        Mr. President, I’m grateful.

           Johnson gets up to shake on it.

                                 KING (CONT’D)
                        But I can’t.

           Johnson is deeply disappointed, a little hurt, then angry.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Why not?

                                 KING
                        Because I promised my people in 
                        Selma I’d help them get the vote. 
                        And I’m not going to leave there 
                        ‘till they got it.

           Johnson knows its final.

           INT KING HOUSE: BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Martin lies on bed with the newspapers. We hear Coretta in 
           the next room.

                                 CORETTA
                            (o/s)
                        Yolanda, stop opening and closing 
                        that icebox. Stop it.

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
                                 KING
                        Why don’t you stop and come rub my 
                        feet, woman.

           King grins. Coretta enters bedroom with a stack of laundry. 
           She sits on King and starts rubbing his feet, her back to 
           him.

                                 CORETTA
                        Three days after the teachers march 
                        and ya’ll might as well be 
                        invisible again.
                            (pause)
                        You should announce another freedom 
                        day.

           KING’s eyes rest on a front page — and the headline ‘JOHNSON 
           INAUGURATION BREAKS DOWN COLOR BAR’.

                                 KING 
                        One week from now.

                                 CORETTA
                        No. One week from now we’re at the 
                        Inauguration.

                                 KING
                        You think the papers would like the 
                        headline, ‘King Snubs President - 
                        To Lead March In Selma’?

           Coretta stops rubbing.

                                 CORETTA
                        You can’t do that. Johnson’s only 
                        human, Martin. You can’t risk 
                        permanently alienating the 
                        President of the United States.

           INT WHITE HOUSE/OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           CLOSE-UP an outraged JOHNSON slams a newspaper onto his desk.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Fuck that ungrateful black 
                        motherfucker!

           The front-page headline on the newspaper is ‘King Snubs 
           President’. JOHNSON glares at GOODWIN — who grins.

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
                                 GOODWIN
                        Mr. President, you’re talking about 
                        the grandest moral figure of our 
                        age.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Oh yeah? I bust my balls to make my 
                        inauguration the most integrated 
                        event in Washington history! And 
                        King’s grand moral gesture is 
                        this?! You should be his fuckin’ 
                        speechwriter! I have underestimated 
                        him. Under that saintly exterior is 
                        a bare-knuckle prize-fighter!

           EXT COURTHOUSE - DAY

           CLOSE-UP of KING: the hard stare of a prize-fighter. 

           CLOSE-UP of CLARK: his anger and frustration at a new pitch. 

           Clark and KING stare at each other for a long moment. Then 
           CLARK starts moving along a line of MARCHERS outside the 
           courthouse, jabbing people with his stick, elbowing and 
           shoving them against the wall. He comes to old CAGER, his 
           daughter VIOLA, grandson JIMMIE and Jimmie’s friend CARL and 
           Annie.

                                 CLARK
                        Keep the sidewalk clear! Get over 
                        there! You! Over against the wall! 
                        No... Get flat against that wall! 
                        Closer!

                                 JIMMIE
                        Sheriff you asking him to walk 
                        through walls! He can’t do that!

                                 CLARK
                        Then he better learn!

           CLARK shoves CAGER, hard, and he falls against ANNIE. She 
           stumbles and her head hits the wall — CLOSE-UP of ANNIE, hurt 
           and angry - but CLARK doesn’t register this; he’s now focused 
           on JIMMIE who has stepped between CLARK and CAGER. CLARK 
           pushes his stick into JIMMIE’s chest.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        I don’t believe it. A nigger with 
                        balls?

           JIMMIE stares at CLARK.

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
                                 CAGER
                            (whispers)
                        He ain't worth it, Jimmie.

                                 CARL
                        He’s right.

           CLARK jabs JIMMIE.

                                 CLARK 
                        So what do you think, boy? Come on, 
                        bitch. I’m worth it.

           JIMMIE stops. He’s trembling. He looks at CLARK, who grins 
           encouragingly.

                                 JIMMIE
                        So Dr. King says I’m supposed to 
                        pray for him?

                                 CAGER
                        That’s what God said. Go git’ back 
                        in line.

           Jimmie wavers, walks back in line.

                                 CARL
                        Sometimes I wonder if God can love 
                        a man as evil as your ass.

           For a moment, CLARK is stunned by Carl’s words. Jaw-dropped. 
           Then comes blind rage. He raises his club to strike CARL, 
           when — bang! — CLARK is knocked sideways. ANNIE has stepped 
           off the wall and punched him.  

           The punch connects with surprising force, catching CLARK 
           under the eye and knocking him down, his helmet clattering 
           loose onto the road. 

           KING, the JOURNALISTS, BAKER, the DEPUTIES and MARCHERS 
           alike, all watch in amazed silence as CLARK gets to his knees 
           — and ANNIE steps forward and cracks him again. 

           CLARK falls onto his side and ANNIE moves in for another 
           blow, but two DEPUTIES are behind her now, dragging her off. 
           ANNIE stamps on a foot, rams her elbow into a stomach and 
           breaks loose. 

           CLARK looks up in disbelief, too late to avoid ANNIE’s fist 
           as she hits him a third time. 

           The two DEPUTIES, supported by a third, grab ANNIE and 
           wrestle her to the ground. 

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
           CLARK, still on his knees, strikes at her head with his club. 
           ANNIE takes the blow but grabs hold of the stick. 

           The DEPUTIES struggle to hold ANNIE down while she and CLARK 
           struggle over the club. 

           CLARK straddles ANNIE, wrenches the club free and brings it 
           down on ANNIE’s head. The image FREEZES momentarily in a 
           camera-flash. Then there’s a fusillade of flash-bulbs as 
           PHOTOGRAPHERS surge forward.

           CLOSE-UP of KING: disgust rapidly becoming calculation as 
           CLARK and the DEPUTIES handcuff  ANNIE, drag her to her feet 
           and haul her away, photographed every inch of the way. He 
           turns to FORMAN and LEWIS.

                                 KING
                        I think our adversary just made a 
                        mistake.

           JOHNSON is eating breakfast, alone. GOODWIN enters, carrying 
           several newspapers.

                                 GOODWIN
                        Good morning, Mr. President!

                        Thanks, Dick.

           Goodwin places the newspapers on the table. JOHNSON picks up 
           ‘The New York Times’. On the front page is the sensational 
           photograph: CLARK astride ANNIE, holding his club in both 
           hands and driving it down onto her head. JOHNSON gives a 
           groan of frustration — and picks up the phone.

                        No, Governor. I’m telling you if 
                        the Jesus Christ and Elvis Presley 
                        came visiting and they said, ‘Jim, 
                        we want you to treat them niggers 
                        nice’, Jim Clark would beat the

                        Clark don’t hate the coloreds that

                        buckin’ his authority. What he 
                        don’t understand, this ain’t about 
                        authority, its about dominance over 
                        the nigger. We got ‘em conditioned 
                        to “fear” the White Man.

                        proof in the fear department 
                        because he got Wilson Baker

           INT WHITE HOUSE/OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           Lyndon JOHNSON and Martin Luther KING are face-to-face across 
           a small coffee-table in the WHITE HOUSE/OVAL OFFICE.

                                 JOHNSON
                        I’ve instructed the Attorney 
                        General to draw up voting rights 
                        legislation. He’s working on it as 
                        we speak. You have my word it’ll 
                        include everything you asked for. 
                        I’ll make a formal announcement: 
                        that I will send a voting rights 
                        bill to Congress - within a year.

           Silence.

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        You’ve waited a couple hundred 
                        years, Martin - a hundred since the 
                        Emancipation. Give me just one more 
                        year! Then I’ll get you the vote.

           KING stares at him unflinchingly.

                                 KING
                        Mr. President... the ‘64 Act gave 
                        us some dignity. But while we’re 
                        excluded from the democracy in 
                        which we live we have dignity 
                        without influence. Dignity without 
                        power.

                                 JOHNSON
                        (weary) Ohhh Martin! You’re talking 
                        to an ex-Vice President! I know: 
                        there ain't no such thing as 
                        dignity without power!  (pause) But 
                        I’m offerin’ you power! I’m 
                        guaranteein’ you power! All I ask 
                        in return is a little patience. And 
                        a little trust!

           KING glances at the wall. The photo of Johnson with King 
           isn’t there.

                                 KING
                        The problem is most of an entire 
                        people have put their trust in me.  
                        They want the vote; they want it 
                        now. I can’t make decisions that 
                        deny their deepest wishes.

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
                                 JOHNSON
                        Sometimes that’s exactly what a 
                        leader does!

           Brief silence. JOHNSON senses an advantage.

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Martin, you know as well as I do: 
                        you try and push this through now 
                        on the streets of Selma, and people 
                        could die. For what? You ask those 
                        people: ‘You wanna die so other 
                        people can have the vote now? Or do 
                        you wanna live and vote alongside 
                        those other people a year from 
                        now?’ Come on! (pause) Look I know 
                        you’re willing to take that risk. 
                        But that’s what you want to do, 
                        Martin? Get other people killed?

           JOHNSON looms over KING. There’s a sense that JOHNSON - the 
           master of the eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation — has KING in 
           a moral arm-lock. KING stares back at him.

                                 KING
                        Isn’t that what leaders always do?

           Colonel LINGO and Major CLOUD get into a two-tone blue and 
           grey Ford, marked ‘Alabama State Troopers’. Behind it are 19 
           more State Trooper cars. Four heavily-armed TROOPERS are 
           getting into each one.

           The STATE TROOPER CONVOY splits up, the cars turning off down 
           different streets. 

           EXT SELMA/STREET - NIGHT

           STATE TROOPER CARS, engines throbbing at low revs, nose 
           through various streets like gathering sharks; STATE TROOPER 
           CAR engines shut down as the cars park up at strategic points 
           - blocking off passageways, sealing off roads.

           INT LINGO’S CAR - NIGHT

           LINGO and CLOUD are parked up and waiting.

           EXT MAIN STREET - NIGHT

           Hoseah WILLIAMS leads MARCHERS from the church. It’s a quiet 
           affair, watched over by a few POLICEMEN and attended by a few 
           JOURNALISTS and PHOTOGRAPHERS.

           The MARCHERS are confronted by State TROOPERS lined up in 
           front of three cars blocking the end of the street. The 
           TROOPERS are like identical statues, perfectly spaced, clubs 
           at the ready — far more formidable than Clark’s Deputies and 
           Possemen. We pick out CARL, JIMMIE, VIOLA AND CAGER.

                                 VIOLA
                        Oh Lord. 

                                 JIMMIE
                        Poppa, stay close.

           WILLIAMS hesitates but keeps walking to them with increasing 
           unease. He realizes the street is deserted and must have been 
           cleared. No witnesses. The MARCHERS look around and Trooper 
           CARS are moving into position behind them to block any chance 
           of retreat. They’re surrounded. Fear grips the marchers. 
           Silence. Then the troopers advance slowly.

                                 VIOLA
                        Ya’all just stay calm!

           The Marchers walk quickly to the side streets. A Trooper 
           grins at another Trooper who takes out a brass knuckles and 
           slips it onto his fist. 

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
           The TROOPERS follow the fast walking Marchers at a steady, 
           disciplined jog: they’re herding. Another group of CARS roll 
           forward and follow the jogging TROOPERS, closing the distance 
           on the Marchers. The Reporters and Photographers have been 
           cut off by another set of cars. TROOPERS jump out of the 
           CARS, silently beating the JOURNALISTS, seizing cameras and 
           smashing them to bits.

           EXT  MARION STREET - NIGHT

           The MARCHERS, moving faster now, enter a wide street and find 
           themselves blocked by more Cars and TROOPERS. They stall. 
           Shots are fired, shattering the street lights. Darkness. 
           Suddenly the Trooper Car headlights come on, blinding the 
           MARCHERS and making the TROOPERS invisible. Then a strange, 
           rhythmic sound, getting louder and louder. 

           The other side of the wall of light: the TROOPERS have taken 
           off their helmets and are using them as drums, beating them 
           with their clubs. 

           The MARCHERS, in an agony of apprehension, the terrible noise 
           of the helmets becoming unbearable. Suddenly the TROOPERS 
           come charging out of the wall of light. Marchers flee. 
           Pandemonium.

           EXT LINGO’S CAR - NIGHT

           LINGO and CLOUD have got out of the car and stand watching 
           the attack taking place in the floodlit arena. They’re 
           relaxed and impassive.

           EXT MARION STREET - NIGHT

           The TROOPERS have traveled into an orgy of violence. A brass 
           knuckle fist smashes into a WOMAN’s face. She drops 
           unconscious where a MAN is on the ground is being stomped by 
           two TROOPERS. A club takes out several teeth; a boot goes 
           into a groin. 

           Annie’s frail HUSBAND is bowled over and ANNIE throws herself 
           across him as he falls to the ground. JIMMIE LEE pulls CAGER 
           and VIOLA towards a gap in the chaos. CAGER is struck in the 
           back of his head and wounded. JIMMIE turns to help him.

                                 JIMMIE
                        Poppa... This way!

           CARL gets up, turning to face two TROOPERS about to attack 
           him. He covers his head with his arms as they wade into him.

           INT  MACK’S CAFÉ - NIGHT

           A quiet little soul-food café. A few black CUSTOMERS talk, 
           eat and drink coffee in a subdued atmosphere. There’s a 
           jukebox playing.

           The CUSTOMERS look up as JIMMIE and VIOLA burst in dragging a 
           wounded CAGER. For a moment the CUSTOMERS stare at the wild-
           eyed intruders. THREE TROOPERS kick the door in, guns drawn, 
           clubs swinging.

           Patrons scatter. Viola and Jimmie flee to one corner, Cager 
           to the kitchen. Two Troopers pursue the elderly Cager into 
           the kitchen.

           The Troopers begin beating the wounded Old man in sight of 
           Jimmie Lee - who moves towards the kitchen. TROOPER JAMES 
           BONARD FOWLER intercepts Jimmie Lee. 

                                 TROOPER FOWLER
                        Where you goin?

                                 JIMMIE
                        Please! I gotta get him to a 
                        doctor!

           Fowler and others fling Jimmy to the floor, subdue him and 
           beat him. Viola crashes a bottle over a Trooper’s head. A 
           Trooper knocks her unconscious. They pick Jimmie Lee up and 
           prop him against a Cigarette Machine. Fowler fires two 
           bullets into Jimmie’s stomach. 

           Jimmie Lee, wounded, bounds for the front door, chased and 
           assaulted by Fowler and the other two Troopers. Jimmie Lee 
           falls out the front door. 

           EXT. MACK’S CAFE - NIGHT

           Jimmie Lee flees out the cafe as more Troopers form a Soul 
           Train line and beat him as he stumbles. He falls to the 
           ground as Fowler and others kick at his bleeding, wounded 
           body. Black people watch horrified, not moving.

           The Troopers hop into their cars and roar off. The Black 
           people stare transfixed, frightened. Cager drops to his knees 
           at the crushing sight that greets him.

                                 CAGER

           It’s late night. King is dead asleep. Fetal position. He’s at 
           peace. He looks like a boy. Phone rings. Coretta gentle 
           nudges him. 

                                 KING
                        Baby, let it ring.

                        It’ll wake up the kids.

           She picks up the phone

                        Yes, it is.

           Coretta hands him the phone. He listens for a moment then 
           sags forward with a deep groan.

                                 KING

           KING and YOUNG sit in an empty airport lounge, sleepless, 
           silent. KING is smoking a cigarette. He looks drained.

           INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Next morning, early. JIMMIE is lying on a bed, unconscious, 
           plugged into several I.U.V.’s. CAGER and VIOLA are half-
           asleep around the bed, bruises still visible on their faces. 
           The door opens and KING enters quietly. He’s unshaven; a 
           little unkempt; he hasn’t slept all night. He looks at Jimmie

                        Let us pray.

           INT BROWN CHAPEL - NIGHT

           CLOSE - KING

           KING: exhausted to the point of stupefaction. He’s about to 
           address a silent, deeply demoralized MEETING, many of them 
           bearing the wounds and dressings from the night before.

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
                                 KING
                        At a time like this we look for 
                        something to hold on to. When the 
                        world seems so senseless... and so 
                        cruel... when injustice reigns 
                        supreme... for so long... and... 
                        and... sometimes... sometimes...

           BEVEL and ABERNATHY, on the platform looking at KING with 
           mounting concern. 

           CLOSE - KING

           He’s desperately exhausted and disoriented, staring at 
           something at the back of the church and tries to focus on the 
           faces in front of him. 

           ANGLE - PULPIT

           ABERNATHY suddenly gets up and goes to the pulpit. He takes 
           hold of King’s arm.

                                 ABERNATHY
                        I got this, Doctor.

           KING stares at ABERNATHY for a moment, nods and walks slowly 
           to a chair as ABERNATHY enters the pulpit. ABERNATHY looks 
           out into the Congregation with a shrewd, knowing expression. 
           He looks down into the third row and meets the eyes of the 
           CLEANING LADY - who stumbled on the bugging device in the 
           Sheriff’s Office. ABERNATHY winks at her.

                                 ABERNATHY (CONT’D)
                        I just been told something. 
                        Something of a scandalous nature! 
                        Oh yeah.

           A few responses: ‘Tell it, Reverend!’, ‘Yes, what is it? We 
           want to know!’ ABERNATHY smiles and pauses, drawing them in.

                                 ABERNATHY (CONT’D)
                        Well now... I just been told... we 
                        got a doohickey in this church! 
                            (a scandalized pause)
                        I’m serious! That’s right! Jim 
                        Clark and the Sheriff’s Department 
                        has had the downright audacity to 
                        bug the house of the Lawd! Now, we 
                        got to find that doohickey! 

           Abernathy stares and points at the four microphones in front 
           of him.

                        Now which one do you think it is? 
                        Hmmm. Eeeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch 
                        a doohickey by his toe! ...This 
                        one! Naw! I bet you that Jim Clark 
                        is so dumb he ain't connected his 
                        doohickey to those loudspeakers up 
                        there - just to the Sheriff’s 
                        Department. 

           He covers three microphones and speaks into the fourth.

                                 ABERNATHY (CONT’D)
                        Hello-o-o doohickey, that you baby?

           The sound comes loud and clear through the church 
           loudspeakers.

                                 ABERNATHY (CONT’D)
                        Hmmmm. Doohickey that you, 
                        sweetheart?

           The sound comes through loud and clear. 

           INT SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

           Two DEPUTIES are looking at each other, frozen.

                                 ABERNATHY (ON SPEAKER)
                        Doohickey darlin’ that you? (pause) 
                        Well. Now.

           INT BROWN’S CHAPEL - NIGHT

           ABERNATHY covers three microphones and speaks into a fourth.

                                 ABERNATHY
                        So is this you my sweet Doohickey?

           Loud and clear.

                                 ABERNATHY (CONT’D)
                        Aaaha!

           He points at the last mike, bends and speaks into it.

                                 ABERNATHY (CONT’D)
                        You my Doohickey! Aint you, baby?

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
           Hardly a sound is heard beyond the first row. ABERNATHY grins 
           at the MEETING, many of whom are now smiling broadly, and 
           takes his hands from the microphones.

                                 ABERNATHY (CONT’D)
                        Well now I got something to say to 
                        you, Doohickey. Are you listening? 
                        Are you listening, Doohickey?

           ABERNATHY raps the microphone with his knuckles.

           INT SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

           DEPUTY GORDON winces at the booming sound of Abernathy’s 
           knuckles. The door is open -the other DEPUTY has gone to 
           fetch CLARK.

           INT BROWN’S CHAPEL - NIGHT

           The MEETING is increasingly amazed and delighted by 
           Abernathy’s performance.

                                 ABERNATHY
                        ‘Cos I got something important to 
                        tell you! I got a message . . .

           INT SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

           Sheriff CLARK is in the room now, listening with the CLERK 
           and the DEPUTY.

                                 ABERNATHY (ON SPEAKER)
                        ...for Sheriff Jim Clark! Now 
                        Sheriff you listening to me?

           Laughter comes over the speaker.

           INT BROWN’S CHAPEL - NIGHT

           The MEETING is laughing loudly.

                                 ABERNATHY
                        ‘Cos I got two very important 
                        things to tell you. First is this: 
                        Sheriff... we love you! Yes! We 
                        love you! Yes we do, Sheriff...

           CLARK looks as though someone has made him an indecent 
           proposal.

                                 ABERNATHY (ON SPEAKER)
                        ...we love you!

           Voices in the background: ‘We love you! We love you, 
           Sheriff!’ CUT TO:

           CLOSE-UP of KING, smiling with affection and admiration.

                                 ABERNATHY
                        And the other thing... is this!:

           ABERNATHY pauses and looks at the MEETING. He has them in the 
           palm of his hand now.

                                 ABERNATHY (CONT’D)
                        We are not afraid!

           A few cries of ‘No!’ and ‘We are not afraid!’ from the 
           MEETING.

                                 ABERNATHY (CONT’D)

           KING, moved, watches with an expression of intense 
           admiration.

           INT SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

           Amidst the anger in CLARK’s eyes is the shadow of a doubt.

                        WE ARE NOT AFRAID!!!

           A sudden crunching sound and silence.

           INT BROWN’S CHAPEL - NIGHT

           ABERNATHY holds the disconnected microphone aloft as the 
           response becomes a sustained chant: ‘WE ARE NOT AFRAID! WE 
           ARE NOT AFRAID! WE ARE NOT AFRAID!’ To a roar of acclaim, 
           ABERNATHY throws the microphone onto the floor, leaves the 
           pulpit and sits down next to KING. 

                                 KING
                            (weak whisper)
                        I’m ready to march.
                            (mustering strength, a 
                             little louder)
                        Ya’ll ready to march?

           Shouts of ‘YEAH!’, ‘LET’S MARCH!’, ‘I’M READY!’ A brief 
           silence — then someone starts singing the fourth verse of ‘We 
           Shall Overcome’. Soon the whole place is singing it — 
           passionately.

           KING turns to ABERNATHY and smiles.

           INT SELMA HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           JIMMIE is propped up in bed connected to I.U.V.’s. He’s 
           barely conscious. VIOLA and CAGER sit on either side of the 
           bed. CAGER is holding JIMMIE’s hand. CAGER and VIOLA weep. 
           They sense Jimmie is slipping away. Cager reads aloud from 
           the Bible.

                                 CAGER
                        ...And many people shall go and 
                        say, Come ye, and let us go up to 
                        the mountain of the Lord...

           Cager closes the Bible. He can’t go on. He leans over the 
           bed, takes JIMMIE’s face in his hands and kisses him softly, 
           repeatedly.

                        Its okay baby, its okay.

           The door bursts open. LINGO and CLOUD step into the room, 
           CLOUD quickly closing the door behind them. The threat of 
           violence is intense. VIOLA leans over JIMMIE in an attempt to 
           shield him. CLOUD thrusts VIOLA aside and she falls in a 
           heap. CLOUD takes out his gun.

                                 CLOUD
                        Coons, you wanna end up like this 
                        boy in the bed here, be my guest.

           LINGO takes a piece of paper from his pocket.

                        Are you Jimmie Lee Jackson?

           Surreally, LINGO is addressing JIMMIE in formal tones. JIMMIE 
           even seems to register the man’s presence.

                                 LINGO (CONT’D)

                        Yes! He is.

                        with a warrant for your arrest. The 
                        charge is assault and battery - 
                        with intent to murder one of my 
                        officers.

           LINGO tosses the warrant onto the bed. A momentary pause, 
           then LINGO jabs the gun barrel in Jimmie Lee’s chest.

                                 LINGO (CONT’D)
                        Threaten one of my officers again, 
                        heah? 

           CAGER holds VIOLA in his arms as she wails, nearly hysterical 
           with the unbearable intensity of her misery. LINGO turns and 
           goes out the door. CLOUD follows but pauses in the doorway as 
           he holsters his gun.

                                 CLOUD 
                        Y’all get well soon.

           CLOUD follows LINGO out the door.

           CLOSE-UP of KING, speaking with an intensity of anger no-one 
           has seen before. There are no responses from the MEETING — 
           they’re too awed by King’s rage.

           MOURNERS. In the front pew CAGER and VIOLA sit shell-shocked.

                        that state trooper was acting under 
                        the orders of George Wallace and Al

                            (pause)
                        And every black man and woman who 
                        stands by without protest as their 
                        neighbors, their brothers, their 
                        sisters are humiliated, brutalized 
                        and murdered!!

           A CLOSE-UP of DOCTOR TYSON, staring at KING. 

           KING pauses, as if to restrain himself — then his anger 
           breaks loose again.

                                 KING (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to Washington! I’m going 
                        to demand see the President! And 
                        I’m going to tell him: Jimmie was 
                        murdered by an administration that 
                        is ready to spend millions of 
                        dollars every day, to sacrifice 
                        life in the name of liberty, in 
                        Vietnam! ...but lacks the moral 
                        will and the moral courage to 
                        defend the lives of its own 
                        defenceless people!

           A deep, powerful sound rises from the MEETING in response - a 
           low roar of passionate support. A group of JOURNALISTS 
           scribble furiously. One or two hurry to get out to a phone.

           INT BROWN’S CHAPEL/BACK ROOM - DAY

           KING enters fresh from the memorial service, still angry but 
           very preoccupied, followed by BEVEL, Forman, Abernathy, SCLC 
           and SNCC leaders. Bevel’s even more than usually intense, 
           inspired by the fire of King’s speech.

                                 BEVEL
                        Doc! They’re ready to do something 
                        extraordinary. Something far out! 
                        Heroic!

           KING, still preoccupied, doesn’t even look at BEVEL — who 
           takes hold of KING’s arm.

                                 BEVEL (CONT’D)
                        A march, from Selma to Montgomery! 
                        In memory of Jimmie Lee Jackson!

                        We’ll carry Jimmie Lee’s body and

                        State Capital.

                                 KING
                        Have you checked with this young 
                        Man’s mother about your plan to 
                        drive a Hearse bearing her son’s 
                        body to Montgomery? The SCLC will 
                        have no part in making a mockery 
                        out of this young man’s life. This 
                        is a non-violent Movement, not a 
                        Circus. Jimmie Lee will be laid to 
                        rest here.

                        to the boy’s Mama?

           Forman silently fumes.

                                 ABERNATHY
                        I take that as a NO!

                        Who appointed you head Nigger in 
                        Charge?

           Forman leaves.

                                 KING
                        I’m being squeezed here between the 
                        SNCC Turks and the Feds.

           INT WHITE HOUSE/OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           Next morning. CLOSE-UP of JOHNSON washing his hands in the 
           sink of a small bathroom adjacent to the Oval Office, as he 
           listens to GOODWIN reading the newspaper.

                                 GOODWIN
                        King also says here that Mr. 
                        Jackson was murdered by an 
                        administration ready to spend 
                        millions of dollars every day in 
                        Vietnam...!’

           JOHNSON comes out of the bathroom and throws his hand towel 
           on the floor. He’s enraged.

                                 JOHNSON 
                        No-one invites themselves to the 
                        fuckin White House!

                        Well, let him come! I ain't seeing 
                        him! I’m done talking with King!

           CLOSE-UP of JOHNSON: hunted.

           INT WHITE HOUSE/WAITING ROOM - DAY

           KING and YOUNG wait in a small room. They’re silent. They’ve 
           been waiting for some time. GOODWIN, deeply uncomfortable, 
           enters the room.

                                 GOODWIN
                        Dr King, I’m sorry. The President 
                        regrets he won’t be able to see you 
                        today. 
                            (apologetic, hopeful)
                        If you can stay over another day...

           INT WHITE HOUSE/CORRIDOR - DAY

           JOHNSON leaves a crisis meeting, with several AIDES scurrying 
           alongside carrying papers.

                                 JOHNSON
                            (as much to himself as to 
                             the Aide next to him)
                        I didn’t get us in there but I sure 
                        as hell can’t get us out. The 
                        American people never forgive a 
                        quitter. I can’t run where Kennedy 
                        stood. That little brother of his 
                        will see me crucified. But I can’t 
                        finish it with what I got. So what 
                        the hell can I do?

           JOHNSON marches round a corner and there’s KING, coat on, hat 
           in hand - on the way out with YOUNG, accompanied by GOODWIN. 
           JOHNSON considers an escape route, but KING turns and sees 
           him. A powerful moment between them.

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Holy fuck what a day...!

           INT WHITE HOUSE/WAITING ROOM - DAY

           JOHNSON and KING are alone in a small room. KING still has 
           his coat on. JOHNSON is in a state of barely-controlled 
           anger. They’re both standing.

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
                                 JOHNSON
                        So what’s your next move?

           KING hesitates for a brief, intense moment.

                                 KING
                        A march to commemorate Jimmie Lee 
                        Jackson.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Yeah?

           Another moment of hesitation from KING. Then . . .

                                 KING
                        From Selma to Montgomery.

           JOHNSON’s jaw drops.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Selma to Montgomery?!

                                 KING
                        Those people have been beaten, 
                        terrorized and murdered. Only 
                        something that big and that 
                        symbolic will encompass their anger 
                        and their grief.

           JOHNSON steps closer to KING — an intense eyeballing moment.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Selma to Montgomery must be fifty 
                        miles. You march those people out 
                        into rural Alabama unprotected and 
                        it’ll be open season. It’s too 
                        fuckin far and too fuckin 
                        dangerous!

                                 KING
                        Not if you send in federal law 
                        enforcement!

                                 JOHNSON
                        I won’t do that! I already got one 
                        war! I’m damned if I’ll start 
                        another over States’ rights! You 
                        want George Wallace to be the next 
                        President of the United States?!

                                 KING
                        Jimmie Lee Jackson was murdered by 
                        George Wallace’s State Troopers.

                        You have to stop him from killing 
                        us.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Grabbing headlines by getting 
                        people killed in Selma is your 
                        decision! ‘That’s what leaders do’ -  
                        remember?

           Silence.

                                 KING
                        We need your help. We deserve your  
                        help. If you won’t offer it I’m 
                        going to have to demand it. 
                        Publicly. 

           JOHNSON moves closer to KING, intimidatingly so, staring down 
           at him, his anger turning hard and cold.

                                 JOHNSON
                        I read what you said at that boy’s 
                        funeral Martin. Attacking my 
                        Vietnam policy is not your job! Is 
                        not what you do! I’m in a tight 
                        spot with this Vietnam thing and I 
                        need your support! You think I want 
                        to spend my War on Poverty budget 
                        propping up some pissant little 
                        jungle dictatorship? We been in 
                        Vietnam five fuckin years, Martin! 
                        Eisenhower first, then John 
                        Kennedy. The US has made a 
                        commitment out there! Now it’s 
                        getting’ serious I can’t just cut 
                        and run! 
                            (almost snarling)
                        Now! You want any more support from 
                        me on this voting for nigros thing 
                        I need some quid pro quos from you! 
                        I want you to promise me: you’ll 
                        take your foot off the gas in Selma 
                        - and you’ll keep off Vietnam!

           KING stares at JOHNSON, with ‘nigros’ - used calculatedly and 
           aggressively — ringing in his ears. Now it’s KING who’s 
           angry. Their eyes lock for a few moments.

                                 JOHNSON (CONT’D)
                        Don’t make an enemy of me. 

           JOHNSON leans forward, threatening, his face almost touching 
           KING’s. Neither of them blinks for a long moment.

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
                                 KING
                        Mr. President. Don’t you see? You 
                        don’t scare those yellow people - 
                        and you don’t scare this ‘nigro’.

           KING turns to go. JOHNSON groans with exasperation - and 
           regret.

           INT WHITE HOUSE/LOBBY - DAY

           CLOSE-UP of KING: deeply uncertain, deeply concerned. He 
           approaches a throng of press and television REPORTERS waiting 
           in a lobby area. KING slows, closes his eyes and puts a hand 
           to his face for a moment. When he removes it, he’s smiling 
           broadly. He strides into the midst of the REPORTERS, beaming.

                                 REPORTER
                        Did you see the President, Dr.

                        What exactly was the purpose of 
                        your visit?

           KING holds up his hands to quieten them. He smiles, looking 
           at the last questioner.

                                 KING
                        From time to time I feel the 
                        necessity of exchanging views with 
                        the President on vital issues 
                        facing the nation. We talked about 
                        several today.

           That night: JOHNSON is standing at the foot of his bed, in 
           pyjamas and bathrobe, brushing his teeth, looking at three 
           televisions showing ABC, NBC and CBS News. They all show King 
           facing reporters earlier that day. Johnson watches intently.

                        The President is faced with a 
                        complex problem in Vietnam. He 
                        needs time and the support of the 
                        American people while he tries to 
                        find a solution.

           as far as they can see. This is a far bigger gathering than 
           anything so far, moving with a sense of quiet purpose. Many 
           are carrying food and extra clothing. Annie is impressed - 
           but feels skeptical.

           TITLE - MARCH 7, 1965

           BAKER, helpless, resigned, as he watches a silent regiment of 
           MARCHERS — not in spaced pairs this time but close-ranked — 
           moving rapidly — as if anxious for commencement of battle, or 
           simply building momentum — towards the crest of the bridge. 
           The loudest noise is the cold wind in the ironwork of the 
           empty bridge. The road surface of the bridge rises in a 
           gentle arch, obscuring the far side. 

           EXT PETTUS BRIDGE/MONTGOMERY SIDE - DAY

           The reverse view. We’re looking at the backs of a small squad 
           of silent TROOPERS in the foreground. Beyond them, we can see 
           the empty bridge. Given the as-yet-unseen numbers approaching 
           the TROOPERS, they seem insignificant and inadequate.

           EXT PETUS BRIDGE - DAY

           The MARCHERS approach the crest of the bridge. They are led 
           by WILLIAMS and LEWIS. They see, with dawning alarm:

           EXT PETTUS BRIDGE/MONTGOMERY SIDE - DAY

           An army: behind the small front-line force of TROOPERS are 
           nearly 200 mingled TROOPERS, DEPUTIES and POSSEMEN, many of 
           them on horseback. 

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
           On either side in business parking lots and burger joints are 
           scores of white SPECTATORS, parked up in cars, standing 
           around in groups, some standing on car roofs or the backs of 
           pick-ups waving big Confederate flags, brandishing clubs, 
           holding banners saying ‘Who Needs Niggers?’ and ‘Doctor 
           Martin Luther Koon — Welcome to Selma’.

           A low growl of aggression and excitement rises from the white 
           SPECTATORS as they see the heads of the first rank of 
           MARCHERS. A small group of BLACK SPECTATORS, curiosity 
           overcoming fear, stands quietly behind an old school bus. A 
           small crowd of JOURNALISTS are penned some way from the road 
           by TROOPERS. Near them, a handful of American Nazis, 
           including James ROBINSON (who assaulted King in the hotel) 
           eyes the Journalists with intense hostility. Beyond all this 
           can be seen dozens of TROOPER CARS blocking off all four 
           lanes of Route 80. LINGO leans on the bonnet of one them, 
           arms folded. Next to him, on horseback, is Sheriff CLARK. 
           CLARK raises a pair of binoculars to his eyes.

                                 CLARK
                        Where’s King? He ain't there.

                                 LINGO
                        You sure?

                                 CLARK
                        Yeah.

           LINGO nods to himself, understanding the strategy.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Where is he?

                                 LINGO
                        They’re holding him in reserve for 
                        the second attempt.

           LINGO draws himself erect, looking around.

                                 LINGO (CONT’D)
                        But there ain't gonna be no second 
                        attempt.

           CLARK grins.

                                 CLARK
                        See you later, Al.

           CLARK urges his horse forward to join the mounted POSSEMEN. 
           He gives a cheery ‘Well isn’t this great!’ grin to the 
           POSSEMEN around him. One of them is REGISTRAR 1 (called 
           Eugene). 

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
           Alongside him is Deputy Tom COLEMAN, the double-murderer seen 
           in the opening scenes. CLARK slaps COLEMAN on the back.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Good to see you back in harness, 
                        Tom!

                                 COLEMAN
                        Thank-you, Sheriff.

                                 CLARK
                        Hey, Eugene! How you doin’? I hear 
                        your momma’s feelin’ better.

                                 REGISTRAR 1
                        Yes, thank-you, Sheriff. She’s 
                        doing pretty good now.

                                 CLARK
                        Excellent! That’s good. That’s 
                        good.

           REGISTRAR 1 tightens the barbed wire wound around his club. 

           WILLIAMS, FORMAN and the front rank of MARCHERS take in the 
           extent of the forces confronting them. WILLIAMS looks 
           nervously down into the muddy waters of the Alabama River, 
           choppy in the wind. Struck by a thought, he turns to LEWIS.

                                 WILLIAMS
                        Can you swim?

                                 LEWIS
                        No nigga, can you? 

           The MARCHERS descend the slope towards the small army.

           TROOPERS, DEPUTIES and POSSEMEN form into ranks. A TROOPER 
           comes through from the rear and hands the officer-in-charge, 
           Major CLOUD, a bullhorn. We see the TROOPERS have gas-masks 
           and tear-gas grenades hanging from their belts.

           WILLIAMS and the MARCHERS halt a few yards from CLOUD. 
           Everything goes quiet. CLOUD raises his bullhorn.

                                 CLOUD
                        This is an unlawful assembly. You 
                        have one minute to disperse.

           Brief silence. WILLIAMS is not surprised by the ultimatum.

                                 WILLIAMS
                            (mutters to self)

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
           TROOPERS put on their gas-masks, becoming strikingly alien 
           and sinister. WILLIAMS takes a step forward towards CLOUD.

                                 WILLIAMS (CONT’D)
                        May we have a word with the Major?

                                 CLOUD
                        There is no word to be had.

           The camera picks out AMELIA, ANNIE, CAGER, VIOLA and other 
           familiar faces — including the DOCTOR TYSON this time - all 
           waiting for the next move with mounting apprehension.

                                 WILLIAMS
                        Major Cloud...

                                 CLOUD
                        Troopers! Advance!

           The TROOPERS advance at a disciplined run, smashing into the 
           front rank of MARCHERS, immediately creating a grotesque rag-
           doll domino-effect deep into the crowd. The TROOPERS begin to 
           throw tear-gas grenades.

           Two gun-shots: cut to CLARK on horseback, pistol raised in 
           the air. CLARK and his POSSEMEN urge their horses forward 
           with rebel yells. They ride into a low-lying fog of tear gas 
           in which the gas-masked TROOPERS rear and strike like 
           monsters from the deep.

           MARCHERS at the rear see the tear-gas clouds and hear the

           MARCHERS flee from the bridge back into Selma, pursued by 
           TROOPERS, DEPUTIES and POSSEMEN. The air is full of rebel 
           yells, clattering hooves, screams of pain and fear.

           EXT PETTUS BRIDGE/MONTGOMERY SIDE - DAY

           The far side of the bridge looks like a battlefield. Dr. 
           Tyson moves amongst the wounded to help the injured and 
           bloody, while others limp back towards Selma. A few cars 
           arriving driven by friends and relatives, to help carry away 
           the injured.

           The Spectators have mostly gone in pursuit. Those that remain 
           are in holiday mood and watch and jeer except for a few Nazis 
           and Rednecks who menace the young ABC TV CREW as they take 
           the film from the Camera. Suddenly, two of the Crew make a 
           run to a Car. While the remaining Crew and their equipment 
           are attacked, the Car drives off at breakneck speed.

           It’s gripped by the White Crew Member in the passenger seat 
           as if his life depended on it.

           INT KING HOME - ATLANTA GEORGIA - NIGHT

           We PULL OUT of a brief CLOSE-UP of a blank TELEVISION SCREEN 
           into the room - where KING, YOUNG, ABERNATHY and a few others 
           sit or stand around, no-one making a move to pick up the 
           phone ringing in the background. Finally, YOUNG snaps out of 
           it and picks up the phone.

                                 YOUNG
                        Yes... Now? Ok.

           YOUNG, still on the phone, turns to the others.

                                 YOUNG (CONT’D)
                        Put the TV on! ABC! Now!

           KING turns on the TV — which remains blank as it warms up. 
           YOUNG listens to the person on the phone.

                                 YOUNG (CONT’D)
                        How many? Seventy?! ...Thanks.

                                 ABERNATHY
                        What is it?

           YOUNG is so excited he doesn’t reply, just stares at the 
           screen. Gradually a picture comes on. It’s Spenser Tracy 
           talking to a middle-aged couple in ‘Judgement at Nuremberg’.

                                 CORETTA
                            (to King)
                        Honey, didn’t you take me to that 
                        movie? What was it called...?

           Before King can answer the picture changes abruptly to an 
           ANNOUNCER.

                        pictures of astonishing events 
                        earlier today - in Selma, Alabama.

           Original television footage of the Pettus Bridge attack.

           KING stares at the television screen, staggered and appalled 
           — he’s been told what happened, but now he’s seeing it.

                                 YOUNG
                        Marty. Seventy million people are 
                        watching this...

           KING looks up.

                        We got our hands around their

                                 JOHNSON
                        Yeah, a fucking volcano.

           Johnson picks up the phone.

                        Dick? Federal Judge, what’s his

                        injunction on King from Marchin’ 
                        and slow them fools down. Now, I 
                        ain’t telling him that. I’m telling 
                        you that. You understand?

           INT BROWN’S CHAPEL - DAY

           Next day. KING addresses a packed but still demoralized 
           MEETING. There a whole row of JOURNALISTS and three 
           TELEVISION CAMERAS.

                                 KING
                        We have to go back to the Edmund 
                        Pettus bridge. We cannot turn back 
                        now. We’ve come too far, sacrificed 
                        too much. We’ve asked a federal 
                        judge in Montgomery to forbid 
                        Wallace and his officials from 
                        repeating Sunday’s incident. And I 
                        assure you, the Federal Government 
                        will hear us. Because America is 
                        hearing us. We been getting calls. 
                        A lot of Northern friends are 
                        coming. Don’t be afraid. 

           KING gives a long pause, looking around the rapt MEETING.

                                 KING (CONT’D)
                        You see... if a man is thirty-six 
                        years old, as I happen to be and 
                        some great truth stands before the 
                        door of his life and he refuses to 
                        stand up because he wants to live a 
                        little longer... even if he lives 
                        to be ninety-six, that man has 
                        already been dead for sixty years! 
                        We must go back! We must cross that 
                        bridge and march! To dignity and to 
                        freedom! To Montgomery!

           Crowd moves out and Young and Abernathy corral King.

                                 ABERNATHY
                        You getting ‘em stoked up to do 
                        nuthin.

                                 KING
                        Court didn’t go well?

                                 YOUNG
                        That ain’t the half of it. Instead 
                        of siding with us, he went the 
                        other way. He’s prohibiting any 
                        march from Selma until further 
                        notice.

                                 KING
                        Johnson crossed us. He’s trying to 
                        slow us.

                                 ABERNATHY
                        What now?

                                 KING
                        We keep it hot. See who can stand 
                        it. Andy, gather our lawyers up and 
                        go at it again. If Johnson can go 
                        cahoots with the Federal Judge to 
                        hold us up... We’ll hold the 
                        contest before 70 million viewers. 

           EXT SELMA/BUS STATION - DAY

           Mostly white SUPPORTERS exit a Greyhound Bus from the North.

           EXT BROWN’S CHAPEL - DAY

           A hired bus unloads mainly white CLERGY and NUNS. We see 
           VIOLA LIUZZO, among them, helping and laughing with the nuns.  

           In the background rises the sound of a semi-rhythmic tread. 
           This is not like the sound of the teachers marching. This 
           sound is bigger, deeper, the SOUND OF A MULTITUDE ON THE 
           MARCH.

           Seen from the Montgomery side, the heads of a multitude begin 
           to appear over the brow of the bridge. 

           REVERSE ANGLE reveals CLOUD and a large force of State 
           Troopers, waiting. But this time they’re virtually alone - no 
           spectators, no Deputies or Possemen — except for a much 
           greater number of JOURNALISTS and TV CREWS. It’s very quiet. 

           CLOSE-UP of CLARK.

                                 CLARK
                        Good god!

           We slowly ZOOM IN to reveal that this time the MARCHERS’ 
           ranks are swollen by scores of white men and women: NUNS, 
           PRIESTS, STUDENTS, WORKERS, PROFESSIONALS.  

           Amongst the marchers is VIOLA LIUZZO. This time the march is 
           led by KING.

           INT CAR DEALERSHIP - DAY

           CLARK stands in the car showroom window with a pair of 
           binoculars. LINGO sits, feet up on a desk with a phone held 
           to his ear.

                                 LINGO
                        They just coming over the bridge 
                        now.

           WALLACE’s pacing and smoking-rate increases.

           EXT PETTUS BRIDGE - DAY

           KING and the MARCHERS are a few yards from CLOUD and his 
           TROOPERS. CLOUD raises his bullhorn.

                                 CLOUD
                        You are ordered to stop and stand 
                        where you are.

           KING halts the march. The MARCHERS are uneasy. Many looking 
           nervously at the blue-helmeted TROOPERS who surround them on 
           three sides, expecting them to charge at any moment. KING 
           slowly goes down on his knees as Abernathy leads them in a 
           prayer. Slowly, behind King, rank after rank, the MARCHERS go 
           down on their knees. They pray in silence. Then KING looks up 
           and meets CLOUD’s watchful, assessing gaze. Suddenly CLOUD 
           raises the bullhorn.

                                 CLOUD (CONT’D)
                        Troopers!!

           There’s a pause as he briefly turns back and resumes the 
           mutual stare with KING.

                                 CLOUD (CONT’D)
                        Withdraw!!

           The TROOPERS behind CLOUD divide and move aside — leaving the 
           road to Montgomery wide open. KING and the MARCHERS get 
           slowly to their feet.

           KING stares at the road ahead, leading into rural Alabama. A 
           deep silence takes hold of everyone — MARCHERS, TROOPERS, 
           JOURNALISTS, onlookers in general. 

           The man next to him - is CAGER. He stares at KING, mystified, 
           like everyone else, by his silence and stillness.

           King sniffs the air almost like a hound-dog. Closes his eyes. 
           Prays.

           CLOSE-UP of KING: fear — he turns to CAGER.

                                 KING
                        It’s a trap.

           INT CAR DEALERSHIP - DAY

           Inside the car dealership, CLARK and LINGO watch KING with 
           mounting suspense.

                                 LINGO
                        C’mon... c’mon... 

           EXT PETTUS BRIDGE - DAY

           KING stares into the distance. Then he turns his back to 
           CLOUD and faces the MARCHERS.

           CLARK, beside himself with frustration, whacks a table with 
           his club.

                        Al, King must be some kinda evil 
                        fuckin genius. How the fuck did he 
                        figure that one out?

           EXT PETTUS BRIDGE - DAY

           KING is leading the MARCHERS back towards Selma, the column 
           peeling back on itself on both sides. KING puts his arms 
           round CAGER and VIOLA. LEWIS and FORMAN are alongside — 
           FORMAN becoming volcanic with frustration.

                                 KING
                        They would’ve sealed off that road 
                        behind us. No food, water, any kind 
                        of support allowed through. We 
                        wouldn’t have made twenty miles let 
                        alone fifty and god knows what 
                        would’ve happened out there. I was 
                        walking everybody right into a 
                        trap.

           FORMAN erupts.

                                 FORMAN
                        That was no trap! You know why they 
                        opened the road to us! Because all 
                        them nice respectable white folks 
                        was with us! That’s why! And we

                        this ain't their motherfuckin 
                        movement!!

           The MARCHERS slow almost to a halt as they hear FORMAN’s 
           voice carrying back through the silent ranks — where we pick 
           out James REEB. He exchanges self-conscious glances with two 
           white male COMPANIONS. We pick out ANNIE — who reaches out to 
           the nearest white person: VIOLA LIUZZO.

                                 ANNIE
                        Don’t pay no mind to that boy and 
                        them words of his. He just likes to 
                        keep things going. Dr. King knows 
                        what’s right. I’m grateful you’re 
                        here. 

                                 VIOLA LIUZZO
                        Its ok. I got five kids. And 
                        they’ve all heard worse.

                                 ANNIE
                        Five kids? Viola, why didn’t you 
                        ever tell me that? What you 
                        planning on doing tonight?

                        Leroy and I are supposed to be 
                        driving people back to Selma after 
                        the march.

                                 ANNIE
                        Your kids’ll be proud of you 
                        someday. Where you say you from

                        Like Motown Detroit?

                                 VIOLA LIUZZO
                        Yeah missy... I’m the white Diana 
                        Ross.

                                 ANNIE

           They both laugh.

           EXT  JUST OUTSIDE SELMA: HIGHWAY/CAR/MOVING - NIGHT

           Dark country section of highway. The sweet sound of THE 
           SUPREMES singing “I Hear A Symphony” plays on the radio. 
           VIOLA LIUZZO is laughing with a PASSENGER, a young black man, 
           LEROY MOTON, in the front seat.

                                 VIOLA LIUZZO
                        I’m tired. That was rough back 
                        there.

                                 LEROY
                        Thank you, Miss Viola for dropping 
                        all them people off. Can I ask you 
                        something? Why...

           Viola looks up in her rear view mirror and sees HIGH BEAMS of 
           a car coming up and pulls side by side with her car. She 
           looks into the other car. She sees:

           The other car contains a group of KLANSMEN. The KLANSMAN in 
           the back is holding the shotgun. 

                                 KLANSMAN
                        Hey!

           He fires. VIOLA LIUZZO’s face disintegrates. 

           Her car starts running off the road as the KLANSMEN’s car 
           accelerates away.

                        Now that bitch knows what its like 
                        to be a real nigger.

           INT WHITE HOUSE/BREAKFAST NOOK - DAWN

           JOHNSON is standing by a window. Behind him on the table is a 
           half-eaten breakfast and the usual selection of newspapers. 
           There’s singing in the background.

                        hand in hand...

           EXT WHITE HOUSE - DAWN

           A group of young, black and white PROTESTORS — holding an all-
           night vigil - stand in a group around some candles, holding 
           hands and singing.

           INT WHITE HOUSE/BREAKFAST NOOK - DAWN

           JOHNSON turns from the window and looks down at a newspaper — 
           at a picture of VIOLA LIUZZO smiling. Every front page is 
           about Selma and the killings. A New York Times headline below 
           the main story is ‘Thousands More Head For Selma’. JOHNSON 
           stares at the pictures and the headline.

                                 PROTESTORS (VO)
                        Here in my heart, I do believe, 
                        we’ll walk hand in hand someday... 

           JOHNSON sits down. He’s very still, deep in thought. Then he 
           gives a long, deep sigh. 

                                 GOODWIN
                        Mister President?

           Johnson snaps out of it, sees Goodwin, who is holding up two 
           glasses of scotch. 

           INT WHITE HOUSE HALLWAY - DAWN

           JOHNSON walks down the hall with Goodwin drinking the scotch, 
           and they pass the famous portrait of LINCOLN on the wall. 

           CLOSE-UP of LINCOLN — gazing down at Johnson. JOHNSON turns 
           to GOODWIN.

                                 JOHNSON
                        You know Lincoln was always a 
                        gradualist on the slavery issue. 
                        Just thought it was so obviously so 
                        wrong it would die of natural 
                        causes. Then one day right out the 
                        blue he freed the slaves. Just 
                        turned up in cabinet one morning 
                        with the Emancipation Proclamation 
                        in his hand.

                                 GOODWIN
                        Yes.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Because suddenly he knew; felt some 
                        tremor, some shift, in the grass 
                        roots; he knew: the country was 
                        ready.

           by a smiling GOODWIN.

                                 JOHNSON

           INT HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - NIGHT

           CLOSE-UP of JOHNSON: gazing up at us. We slowly PULL BACK as 
           the noise of a large formal, expectant gathering increases. 
           We continue to PULL BACK — until we can see JOHNSON is 
           standing at a lectern composing himself while staring into a 
           television camera a little distance away. The expectant buzz 
           dies away. We PULL BACK further to reveal a majestic 
           spectacle and a momentous event: a joint session of Congress - 
           rank upon rank of SENATORS and CONGRESSMEN. CLOSE-UP of 
           JOHNSON: tense.

           KING is not paying close attention, as he watches JOHNSON on 
           the black-and-white television in the corner of the room.

                                 JOHNSON (ON TELEVISION)

           AMELIA.

           INT HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - NIGHT

           JOHNSON is gathering a little momentum now and more 
           conviction.

                                 JOHNSON
                        But rarely in any time does an 
                        issue lay bare the secret heart of 
                        America itself. Rarely are we met 
                        with a challenge, not to our growth 
                        or abundance, our welfare or our 
                        security, but rather to the values 
                        and the purposes and the meaning of 
                        our beloved nation. The issue of 
                        equal rights for American Negroes 
                        is such an issue.

           A CLOSE-UP of KING - suddenly intrigued- staring into 
           JOHNSON’s eyes. It seems deeply personal, between just the 
           two of them.

                        should we double our wealth and 
                        conquer the stars, and still be 
                        unequal to this issue, then we will 
                        have failed as a people and as a

           JOHNSON is finding his stride now.

                                 JOHNSON
                        For with a country as with a 
                        person, ‘What is a man profited, if 
                        he shall gain the whole world, and 
                        lose his own soul?’

           KING and the others  glance at each other with looks which

           A CLOSE-UP of JOHNSON, eyes more certain now, steadier, 
           warmer — as if he senses KING and the nation are listening 
           with complete attention.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Every American citizen must have an 
                        equal right to vote. There is no 
                        reason which can excuse the denial 
                        of that right. There is no duty 
                        which weighs more heavily on us 
                        than the duty we have to ensure 
                        that right. Yet the harsh fact is 
                        that in many places in this country 
                        men and women are kept from voting 
                        simply because they are Negroes.

           where a group of poor blacks — including CAGER and VIOLA -

                        Every device of which human 
                        ingenuity is capable has been used 
                        to deny this right. The Negro 
                        citizen may go to register only to

           We visit a home in L.A. with a wealthy WHITE FAMILY having 
           dinner and watching the speech on TV.

                                 JOHNSON
                        - the most complex provisions of 
                        the state law. And even a college 
                        degree cannot be used to prove that 
                        he can read and write. For the fact 
                        is the only way to pass these 
                        barriers is to show a white skin.

           INT BAR - NIGHT

           DEPUTIES and various POSSEMEN stare in shock and dismay at 
           the television.

                                 JOHNSON (ON TV)
                        Wednesday I will send to Congress a 
                        law designed to eliminate illegal 
                        barriers to the right to vote... 
                        This bill will strike down 
                        restrictions to voting in all 
                        elections — Federal, State and 
                        local — which have been used to 
                        deny Negroes the right to vote.

                                 DEPUTY
                        Next time you come down here we 
                        gonna give you what Kennedy got!

           INT CLARK’S HOME - NIGHT

           CLARK and his WIFE are watching the Johnson speech. She’s 
           crying bitter tears - Clark is wearing his firearm. They’ve 
           both been drinking.

                                 WIFE
                        How could they do this to us? We’re 
                        Americans, too!

           She turns on CLARK.

                                 WIFE (CONT’D)
                        And it’s your fault! All this!

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
           Clark’s hits his Wife on her head, she falls to the floor. 
           Maybelle appears.

                                 MAYBELLE
                        Don't put your hands on her, Mister 
                        Jim. You hear me? 

           His wife cries as Maybelle helps her stand.

                                 MAYBELLE (CONT’D)
                            (her back to Clark)
                        I’m leavin. I can’t take this no 
                        more. I breast fed you like you was 
                        my own. I didn’t raise you to be 
                        like this. You see what you did to 
                        my Calvin? Why you like this, 
                        Mister Jim? Why come you be like 
                        this? 

           Maybelle pushes past Clark to leave.

                                 CLARK
                            (fury)
                        Maybelle! Don’t you dare! Don’t 
                        leave!
                            (then, desperately)
                        ...Please.

           Clark pleads with his eyes. Maybelle grabs her coat and 
           leaves. 

           Clark turns, pulls his gun and SHOOTS JOHNSON TALKING ON THE 
           TV.

           INT HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - NIGHT

           JOHNSON continues his speech.

                                 JOHNSON
                        But even if we pass this bill, the 
                        battle will not be over. What 
                        happened in Selma is part of a far 
                        larger movement which reaches into 
                        every section and State of America. 
                        It is the effort of American 
                        Negroes to secure for themselves 
                        the full blessings of American 
                        life. Their cause must be our 
                        cause, too. It is all of us -

           INT BAKER HOME - NIGHT

           Wilson BAKER and FAMILY watch JOHNSON on TV. They’re 
           absolutely silent.

           JOHNSON ON TV

                                 JOHNSON
                        ...it is all of us who must 
                        overcome the crippling legacy of 
                        bigotry and injustice.

           Barely perceptibly, BAKER nods in agreement.

           INT WALLACE HOME - NIGHT

           WALLACE stares at his television — he’s silent, still, 
           expressionless, eviscerated. MRS WALLACE looks at him with 
           deep concern.

           INT HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - NIGHT

           JOHNSON is staring into camera in the midst of a long, 
           weighty pause.

                                 JOHNSON
                        And — we — shall — overcome.

           CLOSE-UP of JOHNSON as he continues to stare into camera.

           INT BOYNTON HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           CLOSE-KING of KING: staring into JOHNSON’s eyes on the 
           television — as KING and his companions sit in amazed silence 
           for several moments.

                                 YOUNG
                            (smiling, proudly)
                        We did it ya’ll.

           INT HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - NIGHT

           SENATORS and CONGRESSMEN display a spectrum of emotion. Most 
           are on their feet applauding passionately, others are slumped 
           in their seats in dismay, even despair, some are bitterly 
           angry, a few are too moved even to applaud and sit there 
           smiling, with tears running down their faces. A CLOSE-UP of 
           JOHNSON, smiling at camera.

           INT BOYNTON HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           CLOSE-UP of KING, tears in his eyes, smiling at JOHNSON on 
           the television.

                                 KING
                            (sotto)
                        They’re gonna try to kill me.

           EXT WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

           GOODWIN meets JOHNSON’s car as it pulls up outside the White 
           House. He opens the door.

                                 GOODWIN
                        Congratulations, Mr. President! 
                        We’re swamped with calls already.

           JOHNSON gets out.

                                 JOHNSON
                        There’s only one call I want to get 
                        tonight.

           INT WHITE HOUSE/OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

           JOHNSON is in the WHITE HOUSE/OVAL OFFICE, fielding 
           congratulatory phone calls. GOODWIN, LADY BIRD and several 
           AIDES talk quietly but excitedly in the background. JOHNSON 
           puts a hand over the phone.

                                 JOHNSON
                            (mouths gleefully at the 
                             others)
                        Dick Russell! 
                            (removing hand from the 
                             phone)
                        Well, Dick, that’s mighty generous 
                        of you, but I don’t deserve it ‘cos 
                        you’re the man who taught me 
                        everything I know!  
                            (pause)
                        Well, Dick, I wouldn’t say - 
                            (loud, with a showman’s 
                             grin, at the whole room)
                        - ‘it was the finest political 
                        speech of the twentieth century!’ — 
                        but it damn sure’s the best one I 
                        ever gave!

           INT WHITE HOUSE/OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

           Later. JOHNSON is alone in the WHITE HOUSE/OVAL OFFICE except 
           for LADY BIRD, who’s just leaving. JOHNSON now looks 
           depressed.

                                 LADY BIRD
                        Don’t be long, honey.

                                 JOHNSON
                        I won’t.

           LADY BIRD leaves. JOHNSON stares outside of his window at 
           nothing in particular. Silence is suddenly broken when his 
           secretary Janet opens the door.

                                 JANET
                        Doctor King. Line two.

           JOHNSON waits a moment, then picks up the phone.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Martin.

           We INTERCUT to follow the conversation:

           INT BOYNTON HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           KING is alone.

                                 KING
                        Sorry to call so late, Mr. 
                        President.

                                 JOHNSON
                        That’s okay. So. You watch me on TV 
                        tonight?

                                 KING
                        Yes, Mr. President. I did.

           KING falls silent, smiling to himself a little — he knows 
           he’s in control of this conversation.

                                 JOHNSON
                        How’d I do? What you think?

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
                                 KING
                            (a beat)
                        I thought you were magnificent 
                        tonight. You stood alongside 
                        Lincoln.

           JOHNSON is suddenly and powerfully moved. It takes him by 
           surprise — and takes him a few moments to recover.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Well I don’t know about that, 
                        but... for a moment or two back 
                        there, I was on the mountain-top. 
                        (pause) I have a feeling I ain't 
                        never gonna be there again. But 
                        least I been there. And fact is... 
                        I never would have, without you 
                        driving me up there. (pause) I’m 
                        grateful for that.

                                 KING
                        You called that joint session, Mr. 
                        President. You gave that speech. No-
                        one else.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Thank-you, Martin. 

           INT WHITE HOUSE/OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           JOHNSON talking to Hoover, watched by GOODWIN and an AIDE. 
           The TV is in the background with the NEWS of KING looking 
           direct at camera - MARCHING.

                                 JOHNSON
                        I want you to put a fifteen-foot 
                        steel wall round Martin Luther 
                        King.

                                 HOOVER
                        We’ll do everything we can, Mr. 
                        President. But...

                                 JOHNSON
                        ...you can’t guarantee his safety.

                                 HOOVER
                        No.

           Brief silence.

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
                                 JOHNSON
                        Any news on the killings?

                                 HOOVER
                        I’m still waiting news for news on 
                        one, but we know who killed the 
                        woman.

                                 JOHNSON
                        ‘The woman’. You mean Viola Liuzzo.

                                 HOOVER
                        Yes. Viola Liuzzo. 
                            (involuntary repugnant)
                        The woman alone in a car with a 
                        young Negro in the front seat.

           An incredulous, angry silence.

                                 GOODWIN
                        He was a civil rights worker 
                        needing transport to Montgomery.

           HOOVER ignores this, keeping his focus on JOHNSON.

                                 HOOVER
                            (trying to retrieve 
                             ground)
                        We have very good information in 
                        the Liuzzo case.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Really?

                                 HOOVER
                        Yes, Mr. President. We had an agent 
                        in the killer’s car.

           HOOVER has produced this like some kind of trump card. After 
           momentary surprise, JOHNSON fixes HOOVER in a cold stare of 
           power.

                                 JOHNSON
                            (slowly)
                        You’re telling me the FBI cannot 
                        protect the life of one of the most 
                        important men in America but is 
                        able take part in racist murders. 
                        Seems to me you’re presiding over 
                        an organization designed to know 
                        everything and do... nothing.

                                         Selma Draft 12-5 DO NOT PUBLISH
           HOOVER is rocked to the core. He takes a few moments to 
           recover.

                                 HOOVER
                        That is not how I would 
                        characterize our operations, Mr. 
                        President.

           Silence.

                                 JOHNSON
                        Mister Director. If something were 
                        to happen to Martin Luther King on 
                        the road to Montgomery I would be 
                        very, very... disappointed. (pause) 
                        That’s all.

           No-one has threatened J Edgar Hoover’s position for decades. 
           He’s speechless. Utterly humiliated. He turns and walks 
           towards the door. 

           CLOSE-UP of HOOVER: anger and hatred.

           Johnson stares at the TV and watches MARTIN LUTHER KING, and 
           CORETTA, Abernathy, Young, and posse as they march over the 
           Pettus Bridge. MARCHERS sing ‘Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!’

           Johnson smiles. ZOOM INTO TV:

           Our God is marching on.

           Glory, hallelujah! Glory, hallelujah!

           Glory, hallelujah! Glory, hallelujah!

           FREEZE on CLOSE-UP of KING.

           END
