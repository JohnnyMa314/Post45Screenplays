COLLEGE PARK, MARYLAND - MORNING

           The home of the University of Maryland, College Park is a 
           pleasant town centering around the campus: Bookstores. Cafes. 
           Restaurants. Everywhere you look, attractive students mill 
           about. Many of them will be the leaders of tomorrow...   

           ...While others will graduate and get jobs at SPINNAKER 
           RECORD SHOP. 

           INT. SPINNAKER RECORD SHOP - SAME TIME

           A too-hip-to-be-profitable record shop located near campus.  

           Posters of good bands cover the wall: Radiohead, Johnny Cash, 
           The Modern Lovers, and so on. However, the most well-
           represented band in the store is The Beatles. Their album 
           posters are everywhere -  Abbey Road, Revolver,  etc.  

           Two clerks are working the store today. The first is a husky 
           Peruvian named PIERO CHACON (late 20s). Piero is sifting 
           through a number of USED ALBUMS. A male CUSTOMER stands 
           nearby, trying to unload some of his collection.  

           Piero stops on an album. He picks it up. It is the first 
           Velvet Underground album with the BANANA cover.  

                                 PIERO
                        This looks like a first pressing. 

                                 CUSTOMER
                        It was part of my dad’s collection.

           CLOSE ON: The famous PEEL SLOWLY AND SEE command in the upper 
           right hand corner of the album.  

                                 PIERO
                    (awed)
                        He didn’t even peel the banana. 

           The other clerk TED ARCHER (late 20s) eavesdrops on the 
           conversation. Ted looks a bit worn down. 

           Piero slides his hand into the sleeve, which makes the 
           customer nervous. 

                                 CUSTOMER
                        I already made sure it didn’t have 
                        any scratches. 

                                 PIERO
                        I always have to check.

                                 CUSTOMER
                    (nervous)
                        You should at least be wearing 
                        gloves  or something.

                    (dead serious)
                        I cut my nails. I moisturize. I’ve 
                        handled thousands of records and 
                        the only one I scratched was Bon 
                        Jovi’s  New Jersey  album, which I 
                        scratched with a baseball bat. Your 
                        record will be fine.  

           Piero slides the record out of its jacket. He looks at it and 
           RECOILS. He stares at the customer. 

                                 PIERO
                        Terrorist.

           The customer looks ashamed of himself. Piero hands the record 
           to Ted, who looks at the label and sees that it is REO 
           SPEEDWAGON: GREATEST HITS. 

                                 TED
                        You were going to pass REO 
                        Speedwagon off as the Velvet 
                        Underground?

                                 CUSTOMER
                        I didn’t know that was in there. 

           Piero scrapes at the album sleeve. Specks of white paint come 
           off on his finger. He holds up his finger to Ted. 

                                 PIERO
                        It’s a counterfeit sleeve. 
                    (remorseful)
                        I should have noticed it the first 
                        time around. 

                                 CUSTOMER
                        Look, I didn’t- 

                                 PIERO
                        Get out. 

                                 CUSTOMER
                        Can I have my records back? 

                                 PIERO
                        No. Whatever is inside these 
                        records...

           Piero pats the stacks of the customer’s used records. 

                                 PIERO
                        ...Has already infected the rest of 
                        our inventory. We’re going to have 
                        to quarantine the store. 

           The customer appeals to Ted.

                        It’s true. You should probably go. 

                                 CUSTOMER
                        This is- 

                                 PIERO
                        What number is the song? 

                                 CUSTOMER
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about. 

                                 PIERO
                        Dude. What. Number. Is the song. 

                                 CUSTOMER
                    (beat)
                        Three.

                                 PIERO
                        That’s good. That’s a first step 
                        towards an honest life. 

           Piero puts the REO Speedwagon record on a turntable and drops 
           the needle on the third groove. The synthesizer-drenched 
           power ballad “Can’t Fight This Feeling [Anymore]” erupts from 
           the speakers. 

           The other shoppers in the store look up with concern. 

                                 PIERO
                    (to shoppers)
                        Don’t worry. Everything is going to 
                        be fine.

           gone, Piero pulls the needle off the record.

                        It’s actually not a bad song, you 
                        know. For eighties power ballads. 

           Piero stares at Ted.

                        my ears are full of blood. 

           EXT. SANDWICH SHOP - AFTERNOON

           Lunchtime. Ted and his girlfriend JESSICA (30) eat sandwiches 
           near the campus. Despite the hot day, Jessica wears heavy 
           makeup, competing with the college girls. She sucks.

                                        1970’S

           A wake-and-bake ROADIE sits on a ratty couch watching 
           television, drinking a BEER with his CEREAL. 

                                 TED (O.C.)
                        The legend is, when the band had 
                        money problems, its equipment 
                        somehow wound up in the garage of a 
                        roadie from Suitland who lived with 
                        his mom. 

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL: the Roadie is living in the GARAGE. Next 
           to his makeshift apartment is the MOTHERSHIP - the space 
           chariot of George Clinton and his band Parliament/Funkadelic. 
           The Mothership is huge, cone-shaped and covered in lights.

           The garage door OPENS. The Roadie covers his eyes from the 
           sun. His MOM is stands in front of him. 

                                 TED (O.C.)
                        When the roadie’s mom saw how much 
                        space the equipment was taking up, 
                        she told her son to get rid of 
                        it...   

           LATER - The Roadie drives a pickup truck, hauling a FLATBED 
           behind him. The Mothership sits on the flatbed. A couple of 
           the ROADIE’S FRIENDS ride on top of it. 

                                 TED (O.C.)
                        The roadie took the band’s famous 
                        stage prop the “Mothership,” which 
                        landed at the beginning of their 
                        shows, and dumped it in the woods 
                        somewhere in Suitland...

           The Roadie pulls the truck down a dirt road leading into the 
           woods.

                                 TED
                        Three: The Rolling Stones 
                        continuing to record after 1972. If 
                        they quit after  Exile on Main 
                        Street , they’d be remembered as the 
                        second-best band of all time, as 
                        opposed to just somewhere in the 
                        top twenty. 

                                 PIERO
                        I think the idea that the Stones 
                        would be considered second-best is 
                        high, but I see where you’re going 
                        with that. 

                                 TED

                        schizophrenia, which meant no more 
                        albums like  Pet Sounds  and kept him 
                        from completing  Smile  when he was 
                        at the height of his powers. 

           Ted and Piero climb over a huge rock.

                        But mental illness is not something 
                        that could have been prevented.

                        You said atrocities. A man’s brain 
                        giving up on him is an atrocity. 

                                 PIERO

                        One: John Lennon meeting Yoko Ono 
                        in 1966 - a moment that led 
                        directly to the end of the Beatles.

                                 PIERO
                        There was tension in the band 
                        before Yoko Ono came along. 

                                 TED
                        Yoko Ono broke up the Beatles. An 
                        international tribunal should have 
                        put her on trial for crimes against 
                        humanity. She should have been 
                        locked in a special room in hell 
                        and forced to listen to her own 
                        records for eternity.    

           Piero yawns. He’s heard all this before. 

                                 PIERO
                        Dude. You weren’t there. You don’t 
                        know what really happened. 

                                 TED
                        That’s right. I wasn’t there. 
                        Because if I  was  I would have made 
                        sure that Yoko Ono never got her 
                        claws into John Lennon. The Beatles 
                        would have stayed together. 

           Piero shakes his head. He looks off into the woods. Nothing 
           but thickets and brushwood ahead of them. 

                                 PIERO
                        I don’t think we’re going to find 
                        the Mothership today. 

           INT. APPLEBEE’S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The restaurant is packed with fat families and college 
           drinkers watching the Terrapins basketball game at the bar.  

           The place is loud and nobody is listening to Ted, who is 
           sitting on a stool in the corner of the restaurant, near the 
           kitchen. He holds an acoustic guitar. 

           He leans into the microphone in front of him. 

                                 TED

He taps on the microphone. 
           Nothing. The Applebee’s MANAGER sees what is happening and 
           walks over. 

                                 TED
                        It’s not working. 

                                 MANAGER
                        Yeah. I didn’t realize the 
                        basketball game was on tonight, so 
                        we had to kill your mike.

           Ted looks at the microphone cord. It’s unplugged. 

                                 MANAGER
                        You know how it is. But you’re 
                        still more than welcome to play. 

                                 TED
                        Thanks. 

                                 MANAGER
                        Just looking out for you. 

           The manager is signalled over by a waitress. 

                                 MANAGER
                        Excuse me. 

           Jessica sits at the bar, not paying any attention to Ted. She 
           is flirting with a COLLEGE STUDENT. 

           Ted gets off his stool and picks up the microphone cord. He 
           is about to plug it in, but decides against it. No point. 

           He drops the cord and leaves the restaurant with his guitar. 
           Nobody sees him go. 

           INT. SPINNAKER RECORD SHOP, BATHROOM - MORNING

           Ted brushes his teeth in the record shop bathroom. Next to 
           the mirror is a photo of John Lennon. He looks at the picture 
           while he brushes. 

           There is a KNOCK at the door.

                        Tell me there’s a bottle of aspirin 
                        in there. 

           Ted looks at an aspirin bottle on the sink.

                        Yep.

                        Good. When you come out, I want you 
                        to shove the bottle of aspirin down 
                        my throat so that I choke to death. 
                        I won’t fight you.

           INT. SPINNAKER RECORD SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Ted and Piero sit across from each other behind the record 
           shop counter. They drink tea from paper cups. 

                                 PIERO
                        I wasn’t made for these times. I

           INT. CRAB SHACK - THE NIGHT BEFORE

           Piero sits across from a pretty SPANISH GIRL. A crab dinner 
           sits on the plate in front of him. He is wearing a bib. 

           The Spanish Girl fiddles with a handheld smartphone-like 
           device, not even paying attention to Piero. A plate of crabs 
           sits in front of her too.  

                                 PIERO (V.O.)
                        The entire time she was fiddling 
                        with this chrome phone thing. 
                        Typing and talking... 

                                 PIERO
                        Is everything okay?

                                 SPANISH GIRL
                        I was just looking up what kind of 
                        crabs these are.   

                                 PIERO
                        We could ask the waiter.

                        Oh. So, do you not want to-

                                 SPANISH GIRL
                        -No no  no.  I’m sure these will be 
                        fine. 

           The Spanish Girl pokes at her crabs, disheartened. Piero 
           cracks open his crab, unsure about himself. Crab juice 
           squirts on his bib.

                        Because some gadget said her food 
                        wasn’t good, she was bummed for the 
                        entire dinner. She barely made eye 
                        contact with me. I hate the modern 
                        world.

                        That’s just so I can carry my music 
                        around. I tell the iPod what to do, 
                        not the other way around.

           Piero points to a PATRON with thinning blonde hair holding a 
           stack of LPs. The customer looks at them and then nervously 
           glances away.

                        Didn’t even get the chance to play 
                        it. But I’m sure they wouldn’t have 
                        cared either way.  

                                 PIERO
                        That’s not true. Some of the new 
                        songs are decent. 

           Ted looks at Piero, who has apparently just betrayed his true 
           opinion of Ted’s  songwriting.  

                                 TED
                        Just, ‘decent?’ Not, ‘good?’

                                 PIERO
                        ‘Decent’ and ‘good’ mean the same 
                        thing. If somebody is a decent 
                        person, it means they’re good. The 
                        words are interchangeable. 

                                 TED
                        I’m not sure that’s true.

                        I was born in the wrong decade, 
                        Ted. I should have been around in 
                        the sixties. I would have counted 
                        as exotic.  

           Ted nods. He was born in the wrong decade too.

           splattered work shirt. This is POP (late 60s). Pop is an 
           Englishman. He has the rheumy eyes of a drug addict.

                        to Sibylla’s nightclub and passed 
                        you off as Harry Belafonte.

           goes back to looking through the stacks of records.   

           Behind Ted, Piero POUNDS his fist on the store computer 
           keyboard. He unplugs the keyboard, throws it in the TRASH, 
           and stomps on it until it breaks.

                        ... Screw  that . You’re not working 
                        real estate. Jessica doesn’t get 
                        the idea of being passionate about 
                        something. I honestly  do not  
                        understand how you’ve been with her

                        ‘We’ve been together forever’ is a

                        That’s right - never date a 
                        Jessica. I  challenge  you to find a 
                        man who has had a good experience 
                        with a Jessica. My high school

                        Billy’s Jessica stabbed him with a 
                        nail file. And now this Jessica is

                        That’s right. You know damn well 
                        there’s nothing wrong with working

           Ted and Piero slide through a tight grove of trees. Abruptly, 
           they both stop in their tracks. They stare at something in 
           front of them, in awe.

           MOTHERSHIP. A beam of sunlight shines down on it through the 
           forest canopy. 

           The Mothership is dirty from years of exposure to the 
           elements, but aside from a bit of rust it’s structurally 
           intact.

           open. 

           INT. PARLIAMENT/FUNKADELIC MOTHERSHIP - CONTINUOUS

           Ted and Piero peer into the Mothership. From where they’re 
           standing they can see a dashboard of multi-colored buttons 
           and lights. There are a few passenger seats.

                        Jesus.  P-Funk  spared no expense. 

           Ted cautiously steps into the Mothership. The floor holds his 
           weight. He ducks so he doesn’t hit his head on the ceiling.  

                                 TED
                        It seems to all be in one piece. 

           Piero follows him inside. The Mothership is barely big enough 
           for the two of them. Ted sits down. He scrutinizes the 
           console - lots of meters and different types of gauges.

                        here for twenty-five years. There’s 
                        no way it could work.

                        Worth a shot. 

           Ted locates a red SWITCH. He flicks it. Bit by bit, the 
           Mothership begins to BUZZ AND  WHIRR  TO LIFE. Things light up. 
           Meters pop on.

           the noise.

           Piero leans over Ted’s shoulder. They look down at three 
           ELECTRONIC READOUTS - one marked PRESENT TIME, one marked 
           DESTINATION COORDINATES and one marked DESTINATION TIME.

           Ted plays with a keyboard underneath the “Destination Time” 
           readout. He punches in various dates - 11-22-1963... 7-4-

                        This is a strange request. But if 
                        you will come with us for a couple 
                        of hours, I will give you whatever

           INT. TED’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Ted sits on his bed in his small room. An acoustic guitar 
           rests on a stand in the corner. 

           A few PAINTINGS hang on the wall - original work by Ted. 
           They’re good. An unfinished canvas rests on an easel. 

           He picks up the telephone and dials a number. He gets 
           Jessica’s voicemail. 
                                              (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 JESSICA
                    (on phone; perky)
                        You’ve reached Jessica! If I’m not 
                        picking up it probably means I’m 
                        out selling  selling  selling...

           Ted hangs up the phone. He scans his bookcase, passing over 
           ART BOOKS (notably one titled THE HAIRY WHO GROUP: A 
           RETROSPECTIVE) until he finds what he’s been looking for: 

           THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC ATLAS OF THE WORLD. He checks the 
           index and finds the page for LONDON. 

           CLOSE ON: The coordinates for London - 51’30 N/07’00 W. Ted 
           dog-ears the page. 

           He plucks another book from the case. It’s about the Beatles. 
           The pages inside are heavily marked - this book has been well-
           loved. 

           He flips through the chapters until he reaches his target 
           paragraph: 

                 ...The first encounter between John Lennon and 
                 Yoko Ono took place on November 9, 1966 at the 
                 Indica Art Gallery in London, when Ono handed
                 Lennon a card that said “Breathe”... 

           Ted circles the date.  

           He puts a RECORD on a turntable and hits play. It’s “Can’t 
           Fight This Feeling [Anymore]” by REO Speedwagon. 

           He moves along to the song. He likes it. 

           EXT. SPINNAKER RECORD SHOP - THE NEXT MORNING 

           There is a CLOSED sign in the Spinnaker Record Shop window. A 
           pale RECORD COLLECTOR looks at the sign and walks sadly away. 

           EXT. SUITLAND PARKWAY WOODS - SAME TIME

           Ted, Piero and Pop stand in front of the Mothership. Ted 
           holds the Atlas. Pop holds a toolbox.

           EXT. PARLIAMENT/FUNKADELIC MOTHERSHIP - LATER 

           Pop stands on the side of the Mothership. He uses an electric 
           drill to unscrew an exterior panel. 

           Ted and Piero watch him.

           Pop undoes the last of the exterior screws and lifts up the 
           PANEL. It’s heavy. He hands it down to Ted and Piero, who 
           place it carefully on the ground. 

           Pop stares down into the ENGINE. 

                                 POP

           Ted and Pop inspect the dashboard, paying particular 
           attention to the “Destination Time” and “Destination 
           Coordinates” electronic readouts.

                        Who knows? It might work. There 
                        wouldn’t be a reason for a band to 
                        build something this elaborate if 
                        they didn’t plan to put it to use.

                        I wonder how they came up with the 
                        design.  

                                 POP
                        The band was from Motown. They were 
                        probably taking LSD and knew guys 
                        who built cars. Combine the two... 
                        bang. Time machine.

           Piero pops his head through the door. He holds up the 
           replacement FAN BELT.

           the power comes back on - but this time, the engine PURRS.

                        Give it a listen. 

           Piero cautiously sticks his head inside the Mothership. He 
           puts his ear against the cylinder. It’s making a LOW 
           THROBBING SOUND.

                        It sounds like a bassline.

                        Gentlemen, I’m willing to bet that

                                          (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 PIERO
                        We’re synchronized.  

           Ted punches the date and “10:20” into the dashboard. The 
           Mothership continues to buzz and whirr with electricity. 

                                 TED
                        Alright. I’m setting it for a 
                        couple of minutes into the future.

                                 POP
                        Are you sure about this? 

                                 TED
                        Not a bit.

                                 PIERO
                        You know, if you die it’s going to 
                        put me in a bad spot, because I’ll 
                        have to pick up your shifts at the 
                        store. 

                                 TED
                        I’ll keep that in mind. Shut the 
                        door. 

           Piero closes the door. Ted checks the readouts and waits for 
           a moment. Nothing happens, though the Mothership is SHAKING 
           like it wants to do something.  

           He looks around and spots a LEVER on the floor that seems to 
           have some potential.

                                 TED
                        Ah. Emergency brake. 

           Ted pushes DOWN on the lever. All at once, the Mothership 
           begins to RAPIDLY VIBRATE and make ominous CREAKING NOISES.   

           EXT. PARLIAMENT/FUNKADELIC MOTHERSHIP - SAME TIME

           The Mothership is QUAKING ferociously. Rivers of blue 
           ELECTRICITY are running over its outer shell. The energy is 
           knocking branches off nearby TREES.   

           Piero and Pop back away from the Mothership. They watch as it 
           LIFTS several feet off the ground.  

                                 POP
                        Dear God. 

           INSIDE THE MOTHERSHIP: 

           Thunderous TREMORS run through the Mothership. Ted shuts his 
           eyes. 
                                             (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)           OUTSIDE THE MOTHERSHIP: 

           Piero and Pop have taken refuge behind a group of ROCKS. They 
           stare at the trembling Mothership. 

           And then, the Mothership comes to a complete STOP. No 
           movement, no noises, no anything at all - it just calmly 
           HOVERS above the ground. 

           Piero and Pop wait for whatever is next... 

           INSIDE THE MOTHERSHIP: 

           ...And so does Ted. He opens his eyes, confused by the sudden 
           stillness. 

           Then, the calm is followed by a tremendous SURGE OF 
           ACCELERATION. Ted is THROWN from his seat and FLATTENED 
           against the floor.  

           OUTSIDE THE MOTHERSHIP: 

           Piero and Pop watch the Mothership BURST VERTICALLY INTO THE 
           SKY and DISAPPEAR IN A FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT. 

           A charred and smoking ELECTRIC DRILL clunks to the ground in 
           front of them.  

           Piero comes out from behind the rock and stands in the middle 
           of the SCORCHED EARTH from where the Mothership launched. 

                                 PIERO
                    (shocked)
                        Where is he?  

           Pop checks his watch. FIVE SECONDS until 10:20. There is a 
           CRACKLING of electricity in the air.  

                                 POP
                        Piero!

           Pop darts out from behind the rock and TACKLES PIERO... 

           ...At the same moment the MOTHERSHIP REAPPEARS ABOVE THEM and 
           CRASHES right where Piero would have been standing.    

                                 PIERO
                        I’ll pay for gas on the way home. 

           The Mothership door OPENS and Ted CRAWLS OUT. He is bruised 
           from the trip. He lumbers to Piero and points to his WATCH. 

                                 TED
                    (mumbling)
                        Time.

Ted compares their WATCHES. The 
           times don’t match. 

                                 TED
                        It works. 

           Ted slumps to the ground. 

           EXT. SUITLAND PARKWAY WOODS - LATER 

           Ted sits on top of a boulder near the Mothership eating a 
           sandwich. Pop continues to tinker with the ship’s engine.

           Piero laboriously climbs up the rock and sits next to Ted. He 
           catches his breath. 

                                 PIERO
                        Tell me what you’re thinking. 

                                 TED
                        I’m thinking we should play with it 
                        before we sell it to the Rock and 
                        Roll Hall of Fame.  

                                 PIERO
                        Forget the ‘we’ part of that 
                        sentence. 

                                 TED
                        You’re coming. 

                                 PIERO
                        No way. I saw what you looked like 
                        when you crawled out of there, and 
                        I bruise easier than you. 

                                 TED
                        Come on. Aren’t you curious? 
                        Anywhere in the world, anywhere in 
                        time... 

           Piero is thinking hard. 

                                 PIERO
                        It’s just a lot of responsibility.  

                                 TED
                        What do you mean?

                                 PIERO
                        We could change history with that 
                        thing. Keep JFK from being shot, 
                        stop Bill Gates from inventing the 
                        computer... 

                                 TED
                        Bill Gates didn’t invent the

                        The only way I’m climbing inside 
                        the Mothership is if it’s for a 
                        really  important  reason. I mean, 
                        we’d have go back and kill Hitler 
                        or something.

                        Fine. Done. We’ll kill Hitler. 
                        Nobody would disagree with that.

                        Good. Then I’ll come with you. 
                        We’re killing Hitler. 

           Pause. 

                                 TED
                        Of course, that will probably be  
                        pretty dangerous... 

                                 PIERO
                        It wouldn’t be dangerous if we 
                        killed baby Hitler or something... 

                                 TED
                        I don’t know. Even sneaking into 
                        Baby Hitler’s house... You know 
                        that any father who could raise a 
                        kid like that is going to  at least  
                        have a shotgun... Probably a few 
                        shotguns...  

           This makes Piero nervous. 

                                 TED
                        And you wouldn’t want to be lying 
                        there on the floor all shot up by 
                        Hitler’s dad, thinking about how 
                        you should have maybe had a little 
                        bit of fun  before  you tried 
                        something so risky, honorable 
                        though it may be...

                        Would you, Harry Belafonte? 

           Piero looks at Ted, understanding the subtext. 

                                 PIERO
                        I could get girls if we went 
                        somewhere else.  

                                 TED
                        Exotic. 

           Piero nods, thinking about this.

PARLIAMENT/FUNKADELIC MOTHERSHIP - LATER 

           Ted and Piero are strapped into their seats inside the 
           Mothership. 

                                 PIERO
                        Are you taking anything with you?  

           Ted shows Piero a small brown BOOK. 

                                 TED
                        I have my journal. 

                                 PIERO

                        How about you? 

                                 PIERO
                        I have my iPod.

                        I’m not sure that’s such a good 
                        idea. 

                                 PIERO
                        I can’t sleep without it. 

           Ted punches a series of numbers into the “Destination Time” 
           readout - 11-9-66. 

           He puts a set of coordinates into the “Destination 
           Coordinates” readout - 51’30 N/07’00 W. London. 

           Pop pokes his head through the door.

                                 PIERO
                        Wait, what?

           Pop nods. He takes a scrap of paper from his pocket and 
           scribbles something on it. He hands it to Ted. 

                                 POP
                        That’s the address of where I lived 
                        in London. You’ll need a home base 
                        for such a noble pursuit. 

                                 PIERO
                    (to Ted)
                        Hold on... You said we were just 
                        going to London to get girls... 

                                 TED
                        I said  you  were going to get girls. 
                        And in the meantime, I’ll be saving 
                        rock and roll. 

                                 PIERO
                        This is ridiculous. Let me out.  

           Piero fiddles with his seatbelt, trying to loosen it. It’s 
           stuck good. Rust. 

                                 TED
                    (to Pop)
                        What should we tell the younger you 
                        when we show up?

                                 TED

                        Yes. Dylan. 

           Ted and Piero are silent. Piero momentarily stops fiddling 
           with the seatbelt.  

                                 PIERO
                        Who  were  you in 1966? 

                                 POP
                        One more thing - if you see me back 
                        there, tell me to lay off the reds. 
                        They’re bad for you.

                        Good luck, lads. 

           Pop waves and SLAMS the door shut. Piero finally has his 
           seatbelt off, and is holding it in his hand.

           Ted power ups the Mothership. Piero buckles up. Ted wraps his 
           fingers around the emergency brake. 

                                        SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. ST. JAMES PARK, LONDON - LATE AFTERNOON

           St. James Park. Regal. A pair of ducks swim on the lake. An 
           old man walks across a small bridge. Buckingham Palace is 
           visible in the distance.  

           The peace is shattered by a CRACKLING OF ELECTRICITY in the 
           air, followed by the BOOM of the Mothership reappearing. It 
           HITS A TREE as it PLUMMETS to the ground, which FLIPS it 
           over. It lands upside down.  

           The DOOR swings open. Ted and Piero crawl out and collapse on 
           the ground. Ted’s lip is cut. Piero is covered in bruises.

           Piero crawls over to Ted and starts HITTING him. 

                                 PIERO

           Ted WRESTLES Piero to the ground. They scuffle while shouting 
           at each other. 

                                 TED

                        have any idea what the consequences 
                        of something like-

                        -I know  exactly  what the 
                        consequences are! If Yoko and John 
                        don’t meet, the Beatles don’t break 
                        up. If they don’t break up, they 
                        cut more albums. And if they cut 
                        more albums, there’s more to make 
                        me feel good when I feel worthless.

Aha, so that’s the reason. Piero coughs. 

                                 PIERO
                    (beat)
                        I think I swallowed some of your 
                        blood.  

           Ted rolls off Piero. 

                                 TED
                        Lets check to see if there’s any 
                        damage. 

           Piero and Ted limp around the upside-down Mothership, 
           inspecting it.   

                                 TED
                        Shit. 

           Ted is standing in front of a wide-open exterior PANEL. Piero 
           walks over. They stare down at the ENGINE. 

                                 TED
                        Look. 

           Ted points to the CENTERPIECE on top of the engine. All the 
           pink GOO is gone. 

                                 PIERO
                        We’re out of funk. 

                                 TED

                        I don’t want to leave it here.

                        It’s too heavy to move. Pick up 
                        some sticks and we’ll hide it.  

           Piero picks up some sticks. They start covering the 
           Mothership with dirt and leaves. 

           EXT. HORSE GUARDS ROAD - LATER 

           Ted and Piero CLIMB over a wall and out of the park, onto a 
           wide road near Parliament Square. A group of female PASSERSBY 
           stare at Piero.

                        at the gallery, I run interference, 
                        and John and Yoko never meet.  

           Piero shakes his head and walks over to a female PASSERBY.  

           EXT. SOHO - LATE AFTERNOON

           Ted and Piero have clearly been walking around for awhile. In 
           Soho, they’re starting to see hints of “Swinging London” - 
           girls in short MOD dresses. Men dressed in velvet DANDY 
           suits. Boutique SHOPS. 

           But Ted and Piero look too tired to be enjoying it.

           The Mod Girl looks like a young Mia Farrow. Ted temporarily 
           loses the ability to speak.

                        Yes?

           Ted continues to look at her, not saying anything. Piero 
           walks over to help.

           EXT. INDICA GALLERY - NIGHT

           A mid-sized gallery in an expensive area. 

           A MINI COOPER is parked outside the gallery, next to which 
           the car’s CHAUFFEUR smokes a cigarette.

           Ted and Piero stand across the street. Intimidated. 

                                 TED

           Ted and Piero walk cautiously across the street. Ted takes 
           the gallery’s doorknob in his hand. He TURNS IT.  

           The door OPENS.

He looks like he 
           might pass out. 

                                                20s ) 
           At the opposite end of the room stands JOHN LENNON (late 
           - circle glasses, well tailored clothing and a bit stoned.  

                                 PIERO
                        Holy shit. 

           Lennon is standing across from a thirty-something Asian woman 
           - YOKO ONO. Yoko is dressed in a black leotard. 

           Ted and Piero watch as Yoko solemnly hands Lennon a piece of 
           paper. 

           CLOSE ON PAPER: There is a single word on the note - BREATHE.

           Ted and Piero are witnessing John and Yoko’s first meeting. 

                                 TED
                        We’re too late.  

                                   £200 . Lennon laughs.    
           Lennon gives Yoko a smile, and walks over to a small table. A 
           title card reading APPLE is propped up in front of a piece of 
           fruit, next to which is a price tag - 

                                 PIERO
                        If you’re thinking about doing 
                        something, you should probably get 
                        going.   

           But Ted can’t move. 

           Yoko points Lennon to a LADDER that leads to a BLANK CANVAS 
           stuck to the ceiling. A chain with a SPYGLASS hangs from the 
           canvas.  

           Lennon climbs the ladder and uses the spyglass to read a 
           single microscopic word on the canvas. Lennon smiles. 

                                 TED
                        Yes. 

           POV Lennon - The word says  YES . 

           Lennon climbs down from the ladder. 

                                 LENNON
                    (to Yoko)
                        Can I see more?

           Yoko leads Lennon to a table with a piece of PLASTERBOARD and 
           a bucket of NAILS. A label attached to a HAMMER reads - 
           “Instructions: Put Nails in Wood.” Nobody has done so yet. 

                                 LENNON
                        May I be the first?   

           Yoko shakes her head. 
                                                                   (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)

                        Tomorrow is only a few hours away. 

           Yoko thinks about this. 

                                 YOKO
                        I’ll let you hammer a nail into it

                        imaginary nail. 

           Yoko breaks a smile. She and Lennon are on the same 
           wavelength.  

           EXT. LONDON SIDEWALK - MOMENTS LATER 

           Ted sits on the curb, his head buried in his hands. Piero 
           sits next to him.

                        told us to meet the younger him.

           EXT. CARNABY STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Ted and Piero turn onto Carnaby Street - the heart of 
           Swinging London. It’s like a different city. 

           Hip-looking young men wear colorful suits made of exotic 
           materials. Young model-types in miniskirts zip about on 
           scooters. Jazz and pop music pour out of cafes and boutiques.

           The electric atmosphere is doing nothing to make Ted feel 
           better. But Piero is loving it. 

           Piero makes eye contact with a POSH YOUNG WOMAN - the 
           spitting image of Twiggy.

           The woman smiles and walks past. Another WOMAN approaches.

                                 PIERO
                        Not one. 

           Ted checks the note Pop gave him.

                        Thirty-nine Carnaby Street. Let’s 
                        find it.  

           MOMENTS LATER - Ted and Piero stand outside 39 Carnaby 
           Street. The first floor is a boutique featuring trousers and 
           jackets. 

           ...But the SECOND FLOOR is hosting what appears to be quite 
           the happening party. A song by the Small Faces blasts out of 
           the windows. Laughter bursts out into the night.  

                                 PIERO
                        Do you think Pop will recognize us? 

                                 TED
                        Really  think  about the logic of 
                        what you just said.  

           A COUPLE walks out the door and Ted and Piero slide inside. 

           INT. CARNABY STREET APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Ted and Piero walk up a stairwell populated by stylish Boho-
           types. They reach the top of the stairs and get their first 
           look at the apartment, which looks like a mod ballroom.

           Colorful lights hang from the ceiling. Young SOPHISTICATES 
           dance with each other or are otherwise occupied smoking 
           hookahs and talking and being seen. 

                                 PIERO
                        Look at these women. Let’s go have 
                        some sex.

                        I’ve got a girlfriend back home. 

                                 PIERO
                        Your girlfriend back home won’t be 
                        born for a decade. If you slept 
                        with one of these girls, there’s no 
                        way it could count as cheating. 

           Ted thinks about this.

                        sense.

                        in London. 

           Ted takes another pull on the hookah. It all makes sense now.  

           Across from Ted, a PARTY GUEST is plucking at an acoustic 
           GUITAR. 

                                 TED
                        Can I see that? 

           The Party Guest hands Ted the guitar. Ted begins to play the 
           opening notes of “Purple Haze.” He’s great. 

           Everybody around him watches, including JIMI HENDRIX, who is 
           standing against a wall talking to another VISITOR.   

                                 JIMI HENDRIX
                        Man. That’s all I’ve ever wanted to 
                        do. 

           Ted continues to play, getting into it. He’s stoned. Jimi 
           watches him, defeated. 

                                 JIMI HENDRIX
                        Fuck it. I quit. 

           Jimi exits the party. 

           INT. CARNABY STREET APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING 

           Ted and Piero sit with Pop at the kitchen table drinking tea. 
           Between their dirty clothing and their hangovers, they look 
           like shit.     
                                               (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                 POP
                        If you boys are going to be staying 
                        here, let me at least offer you 
                        some clothing. I can’t be seen with 
                        you if you’re dressed like that. 

                                 PIERO
                        Is anything going to fit me? 

                                 POP
                        No, but tight is in.

           MOMENTS LATER - Ted sits on Pop’s bed wearing VELVET TROUSERS 
           and a PIRATE SHIRT. He looks ridiculous. 

           Piero comes out of the bathroom wearing tight DANDY SUIT. He 
           has a gauze SCARF tied around his neck. 

                                 TED
                        That’s the one. 

                                 PIERO
                        Why?

                                 TED
                        It makes me look less gay. 

                                 PIERO
                        I think we should check on the 
                        Mothership. 

                                 TED
                        You go. I’ll meet up with you 
                        later.  

                                 PIERO
                        What are you going to do? 

                                 TED
                    (beat)
                        I’m going to cockblock John Lennon.  

                                 PIERO
                        Ted. It’s over. You already failed. 

                                 TED
                        I’m going to take another approach. 

           Piero stares at Ted. 

                                 PIERO
                        Holy shit. I know what you’re going 
                        to do. 

                                 TED
                        If I have to. 

                                 PIERO
                        You’re out of your mind.

                        This is too important for me to 
                        fail. 

                                 PIERO
                    (awed)
                        It’s the ultimate take-one-for-the-
                        team. 

           EXT. INDICA GALLERY - LATER 

           Ted sits on the curb outside the Indica Gallery. He writes 
           something on a piece of PAPER he is holding in his hand. 

           CLOSE ON PAPER: It is titled THINGS I KNOW YOKO ONO LIKES, 
           under which he has written:  

                                ART 
                                NUMBERS 
                                FAME
                                RUINING BEST BAND EVER
                                LEOTARDS

           Ted stares at his list. 

           INT. INDICA GALLERY - MOMENTS LATER

           Ted pushes open the door to the gallery and steps inside. A 
           few ART STUDENTS are walking around looking at the exhibit. 

           ...And in the corner of the room, Yoko Ono is adjusting what 
           appears to be some sort of white sculpture. She is wearing a 
           big sweater and a leotard, with tights. 

           Ted walks towards her. Here goes nothing. 

           Ted sees that the sculpture is actually a COMPLETELY WHITE 
           CHECKERBOARD. All the CHECKERS have also been painted white. 

                                 TED
                        I’ll play you. 

           Yoko looks at him. Her eyes are big and dark - pretty. Ted is 
           intimidated. 

                                 TED
                        Just so you can see if it works. 

                                 YOKO
                    (beat)
                        Sure.  

           MOMENTS LATER - Ted and Yoko sit across from each other over 
           the all-white checkerboard. 
                                             (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 YOKO
                        The point is to play until you 
                        forget whose checkers are whose.  

           Ted moves one of his checkers. 

                                 TED
                        How did you come up with the idea? 

           Yoko smiles.

                                 YOKO
                        My niece kept beating me at 
                        checkers. 

                                 TED
                        Aw.  That’s cute. 

           Ted is trying to come across as a great guy. Yoko seems to 
           detect this. She moves one of her pieces. 

                                 TED
                        It’s nice to see another American 
                        artist over here.

                        No. This is a vacation. But I do 
                        show back in the states.

                        group out of Chicago. 

           Yoko makes eye contact with Ted. She knows exactly what he is 
           talking about.

           Ted reaches across the board to move one of the checkers.

           Yoko lifts her leg onto the table. She’s right - even through 
           her tights, her calf muscle looks strange.

ST. JAMES PARK - SAME TIME

           Piero searches for clues. He notices muddy TIRE TRACKS 
           leading away from the site. 

                                 POLICEMAN (O.C.)
                        Is there something I can help you 
                        with? 

           Piero looks up to see a bobby-capped POLICEMAN standing in 
           front of him. The Policeman scrutinizes Piero’s mod/dandy 
           clothing. 

                                 PIERO
                        There used to be a... sculpture out 
                        here.  

                                 POLICEMAN
                        Perhaps you mean the sculpture that 
                        men were using as a hiding spot to 
                        fornicate with each other.   

                                 PIERO
                    (beat)
                        That’s the one. 

                                 POLICEMAN
                        It’s been taken to the scrap heap. 

           EXT. INDICA GALLERY - LATER 

           Ted walks Yoko down the sidewalk, back to the Indica Gallery. 

                                 TED
                        Do you know what your next project 
                        will be? 

                                 YOKO
                        I’m deciding between traveling to 
                        India to record the sound of 
                        falling snow, or making a film 
                        montage of the navels of 365 
                        people. 

           Ted laughs. He seems genuinely entertained. 

                                 TED
                        Well, I’d like to volunteer my 
                        belly button if that’s what you 
                        decide on. 
                    (beat)
                        I have an outie. 

                                 YOKO
                        That’s good.  Outies  are rare.

                        Ah, conceptual art. 

                                 YOKO
                        Every artist is a conceptual 
                        artist. I’m a con artist. But it’s 
                        the only job that allows me to act 
                        like I’m in kindergarten all day, 
                        and get paid for it. 

                                 TED

                        Sometimes. 

           They reach the door to the gallery. 

                                 TED
                        Could I maybe see you tonight? 

                                 YOKO
                        That’s a lot of me for one day. 

                                 TED
                        I don’t think so. 

                                 YOKO
                        I’ve already made plans with a 
                        friend. 

                                 TED
                        Is it okay if I stop by tomorrow? 

                                 YOKO
                        I hope you do. 

           Yoko opens the gallery door. 

                                 YOKO
                        It was nice meeting you, Ted. 

           Yoko disappears inside the gallery. 

           EXT. CARNABY STREET APARTMENT - LATER 

           Ted stands on the street outside Pop’s apartment. Above him, 
           Piero is sitting on the fire escape smoking a CIGARETTE. 

                                 TED
                        I didn’t know you smoked. 

                                 PIERO
                        Smoking isn’t bad for you in 1966. 

           Piero drops the apartment keys down to Ted.

CARNABY STREET APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Ted and Piero sit across from each other on overstuffed 
           beanbag chairs.  

                                 TED
                        ...Gone?  

                                 PIERO
                        The policeman told me it was taken 
                        to the scrap heap. It was being 
                        used as a gay bathhouse.    

                                 TED
                        We have to sit in there on the way 
                        home. 

                                 PIERO
                        We’re not  going  home Ted. The 
                        Mothership is  gone .

                                 TED
                        I wouldn’t worry. Nobody is going 
                        to just dismantle a thing like 
                        that. I’m sure it’s still around. 

           Piero stares at Ted. Suspicious. 

                                 PIERO
                        Why are you acting so optimistic 
                        right now? 

                                 TED
                        I’m not acting optimistic. I just 
                        think we’ll get it back. 

                                 PIERO
                        You seem lighthearted and content. 

                                 TED
                        I’m not lighthearted and content. 

           Pause. 

                                 PIERO
                        Ted. What happened when you went to 
                        see Yoko? 

           No response.

           Ted and Piero hear the sound of a key in the doorknob. The 
           door opens and Pop enters. They silently look at him. 

                                 POP

                        Pop, do you know where London’s 
                        scrap heap is located? 

                                 POP
                        Of course. The Scrap Heap is an 
                        after-hours club. It’s quite a

           EXT. INDICA GALLERY - NIGHT

           Ted sits incognito across the street from the Indica Gallery. 

           Yoko emerges from the gallery. She walks across the street 
           and - to Ted’s surprise - quietly ducks into a BAR. 

           Ted looks at the name of the bar - THE SCOTCH OF ST. JAMES.  

           He tries to follow her inside, but is stopped by a DOORMAN.  

                                 DOORMAN
                        I’m sorry, sir.

                                 TED
                        I just saw my friend Yoko walk 
                        inside. 

                                 DOORMAN
                        This is a private club. Ms. Ono was 
                        invited here by a member. 

           EXT. ALLEY BEHIND THE SCOTCH OF ST. JAMES - MOMENTS LATER

           Ted walks towards a group of WAITERS gathered behind the bar, 
           smoking cigarettes on their break. 

                                 TED

           INT. THE SCOTCH OF ST. JAMES, UPSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

           The upstairs interior of The Scotch of St. James looks like a 
           crowded speakeasy. Everybody is stylish. An exclusive place.   

           Ted stands against a wall, BAREFOOT. He sees that the truly 
           hip-looking people are walking DOWNSTAIRS into the basement.  

           INT. THE SCOTCH OF ST. JAMES, DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

           Lots of PRETTY GIRLS in miniskirts and YOUNG MEN who resemble 
           Victorian poets. A BAND plays on a small stage in the corner 
           of the room in front of which is a DANCE FLOOR. 

           The ELITE of Swinging London crowd into booths along the 
           perimeter of the room. Musicians. Artists. Fashion Models.

           Ted walks among the booths. He steals a HIGHBALL GLASS from a 
           table. Holding a glass makes it look more like he belongs.   

           In the final booth, he spots Yoko. Sitting across from her - 
           of course - is John Lennon. 

           Yoko sees Ted and waves him over. He approaches the booth. 

                                 YOKO
                        I can’t believe you’re here!

                        You must be Mama Cass.   

           Ted is suddenly immensely aware that John Lennon is talking 
           to him.

                        my dear. On to the topic of art at 
                        once.

           EXT. SCRAP HEAP NIGHTCLUB - LATER 

           Pop and Piero step out of a chauffeured vehicle in front of 
           an innocuous looking building. Dozens of people are queued 
           out front. 

           Pop and Piero walk to the front of the line. The doorman lets 
           them in.  

           INT. SCRAP HEAP NIGHTCLUB - CONTINUOUS

           This is the most typical example of “Swinging” London we’ve 
           yet seen - lots of swirling colors and Go-Go-ish dancers.   

           Pop and Piero are led by a HOST to a balcony overlooking the 
           room. A SERVER follows behind carrying a bucket of Champagne. 

           The Host seats them at a private table where two comely YOUNG 
           WOMEN - dressed in skirts and Nancy Sinatra boots - are 
           waiting for them.

           INT. THE SCOTCH OF ST. JAMES - SAME TIME

           Ted, Yoko and John Lennon are scrunched together in the 
           booth, laughing. Empty cocktail glasses are spread out in 
           front of them.  

                                 LENNON
                        ...And I was out of my skull going 
                        ‘round talking to the people 
                        outside the concert hall, so I 
                        introduce myself as Jesus Christ to 
                        a square-looking stranger.  
                    (beat; laughing)
                        And this stranger looks me in the 
                        eye and says, “Oh really, well-

                                     I loved your last 
           Buzzed, Ted mouths along with the quote: 
           record . Lennon doesn’t notice. 

                                 LENNON
                        “-I loved your last record.” 

           Ted and Yoko laugh. Lennon stands up from the table. 

                                 LENNON
                        Excuse me. I’ll be right back. Just 
                        need to say hello to some people.  

           Lennon gets up and walks over to a group of other musician-
           types - Keith Richards, etc. People stare at him as he makes 
           his way through the room. 

           Ted and Yoko are alone.

                        I like him. A little cynical, and 
                        before you got here he kept asking 
                        me to call him Dr. Winston 
                        O’Boogie. But I like him.

                        I do think I could help him with 
                        his music, though.

                        Did your voice change? 

           The girls wait for an explanation. Pop is clearly trying to 
           silently will Piero to come up with something clever. 

           And then, silence. Piero just stares at the girls, breathing 
           heavily. Panicking. Sweating.  

           Robin and Charlene seem perplexed by Piero’s complete lack of

                        go dance. 

           The girls head down the stairs towards the dance floor. From 
           the balcony, Piero watches them go. 

                                 POP
                        You are shockingly bad with women.

           Piero sees the POLICEMAN from the park dancing below on the 
           floor. 

                                 PIERO

                                 POP
                        Of course. 

           Piero gets up from his seat. Pop takes a bag of RED PILLS out 
           of his pocket. 

           He looks around to make sure nobody is looking, then pops a 
           couple and washes them down with champagne. He leans back in 
           his chair, getting stoned.

                                 PIERO
                        Where is it?

                        Aren’t we forward.  

           INT. ABBEY ROAD STUDIOS, STUDIO TWO - SAME TIME

           Lennon leads Ted and Yoko into Studio Two, holy ground of 
           rock & roll. Three musicians are inside tinkering around with 
           instruments, working on a song that sounds like it belongs on 
           the  Sgt. Pepper’s . 

           These are the Beatles - PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO. 

                                 LENNON
                        Gentlemen, may I introduce you to 
                        my dinner companions Yoko Ono and 
                        Mama Cass, also called Ted. 

           The Beatles say their hellos. Ted shakes their hands, but 
           doesn’t even try to speak. 

           George seems suspicious of Yoko. Lennon grabs a guitar and 
           joins his bandmates.  

                                 LENNON
                        Did I miss much? 

                                 PAUL
                        We just got here ourselves. 

           Lennon becomes wrapped up in playing around with the band. 
           Ted and Yoko are unsure what they’re supposed to do. 

                                 RINGO
                    (helpful)
                        If you’d like, there’s tea in the 
                        other room. 

           Ted and Yoko get the hint. They head into the SOUNDBOARD 
           ROOM, where a prim GEORGE MARTIN sits at the controls. 

                                 GEORGE MARTIN 
                        I’m George. I work with the band. 

           Ted forces himself to speak. 

                                 TED
                        I’m Ted. This is Yoko.  

                                 GEORGE MARTIN

           Martin.

           Ted looks around - Abbey Road, the Beatles on the other side 
           of the glass, George Martin pouring him tea. Holy shit. 

           George Martin hands him a CUP and SAUCER. 

                                 TED
                        Thank you. 

           Ted’s hands tremble as he takes a sip. 

           INT. SCRAP HEAP NIGHTCLUB, BACK ROOM - SAME TIME

           A BOUNCER waves the Policeman and Piero through the door to a 
           back room.  

                                 POLICEMAN
                        Is this what you were looking for? 

           The room is an OPIUM DEN. Blissed-out REVELERS smoke 
           together. Men and women are openly amorous. 

           In the center of the room is the MOTHERSHIP, which has been 
           psychedelically painted. Beads hang over its open door. HASH 
           SMOKERS greenhouse the interior. 

                                 PIERO
                        How did you get it in here? 

           The Policeman points to a wall. It’s actually a GARAGE DOOR.

           INT. ABBEY ROAD STUDIOS, SOUNDBOARD ROOM - SAME TIME

           Ted seems to have visibly relaxed. He drinks his tea and 
           talks to Yoko, barely paying attention to the Beatles playing 
           on the other side of the glass.

           INT. ABBEY ROAD STUDIOS, STUDIO TWO - SAME TIME

           From the other side of the glass, Lennon watches Ted and Yoko 
           talking and laughing together. He’s distracted. He isn’t 
           focusing on his music. He isn’t playing his guitar. 

           George Harrison leans towards him. 

                                 GEORGE HARRISON
                        You know the rules. No wives or 
                        girlfriends at the studio. 

                                 LENNON
                        It’s fine. 

                                 PAUL
                        George is right. We don’t need the 
                        distraction.  

           The entire band has stopped playing their instruments. 

                                 LENNON
                        What does their body language look 
                        like to you?

                        Like you have competition, mate. 

           Lennon doesn’t like this. On the other side of the glass, 
           Yoko signals that she and Ted are going to leave. 

           Lennon puts down his guitar and walks into the Soundboard 
           Room. 

                                 YOKO
                        I think we’re going to get food.

                        the last time you were actually

           In the kitchen, Pop swallows down a few RED PILLS with a 
           glass of water. He is stoned out of his mind. 

           On the couch, he notices something RECTANGULAR and WHITE. He 
           walks over to it... 

           ...It’s Piero’s  iPod . Headphones and all.  

           Pop puts on the headphones. He presses a button. The iPod 
           lights up. He presses ARTISTS and fumbles through the 
           choices. 

           Finally, he chooses an artist - THE BEE GEES.

           He can’t sleep. He looks at the clock. 2:30 in the morning.

           He looks around. Bundled in with Ted’s dirty clothing is 
           Ted’s JOURNAL. Piero takes it and opens it. 

           Piero flips to a random page and begins to read.

                        I read today that giraffes only 
                        sleep half an hour per day. I wish 
                        I was a giraffe, because that way 
                        I’d have more time to play music 
                        and paint... 

           Piero flips the page. 

                                 PIERO
                        Man. This is really what goes on in 
                        your head. 

           Piero flips to another page. 

           CLOSE ON: The PAGE, where Ted has written the LYRICS to 
           “Can’t Fight This Feeling [Anymore]” by REO Speedwagon: 

                 I can’t fight this feeling any longer
                 And yet I’m afraid to let it flow
                 What started out as friendship has grown stronger!
                 I only wish I had the strength to let it show... 

           ...And so on. 

           Piero busts out laughing. Then, he hears the sound of the 
           FRONT DOOR shutting. He puts the journal back. 

           Piero hears the sound of female GIGGLING. He walks out to 
           investigate and sees Ted and Yoko RAIDING THE FRIDGE.

           A PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a picture of Lennon.

                        What are you doing here? 

                                 LENNON
                        Your chariot awaits. 

                                 YOKO
                        I’m eating food. 

                                 LENNON
                        Heaps of food back at the studio. 
                        There is a boar turning on a spit 
                        in the piano room. Ringo killed it 
                        with his voice. 

           Yoko laughs. Ted joins her on the fire escape. 

                                 LENNON
                        Caesar. Antony has come for 
                        Cleopatra. 

                                 TED
                        I’m pretty sure you’d be Caesar in 
                        this case. 

                                 YOKO
                        Do you want to come up? 

                                 LENNON
                        I’d rather you come down. 

           Yoko appeals to Ted. 

                                 TED
                        It’s only fair that I share. 

           Yoko nods and ducks through the window, back into the 
           apartment. 

           INT. CAFE - THE NEXT DAY 

           Ted, Piero and Pop are having a continental breakfast. There 
           are two empty Bloody Mary glasses in front of Pop, and he is 
           drinking a third.

                                 TED
                        John Lennon says hello. 

                                 POP
                        Ah. The spring thaw after the long 
                        winter. 

                                 TED
                        Did you have a falling out? 

                                 POP
                        I was the Beatles’ public relations 
                        man until John fired me.

                        He was jealous I was seeing a bird 
                        he used to be with, and then I was 
                        gone. 

                                 PIERO
                        The other guys in the band didn’t 
                        try to stop him? 

                                 POP
                        They were happy to see me go. John 
                        is a good man, but he can get a bit 
                        paralyzed by jealousy. And when 
                        that happens, he stops playing 
                        music.    

           EXT. CAFE - LATER

           Ted and Piero putter outside the cafe. Inside, Pop waits 
           outside the bathroom.  

                                 TED
                        Oh my God... Look... 

           Ted and Piero are standing in front of a poster of JAMES 
           BROWN with the caption: 

                  THE HARDEST WORKING MAN IN SHOW BUSINESS, LIVE! ONE      
                  NIGHT ONLY! NOVEMBER 17 IN HYDE PARK, LONDON. 

           Ted points to the picture of James Brown. 

                                 TED
                        James Brown is the closest anybody 
                        in the sixties came to playing 
                        funk.  That  could be our way back.  

                                 PIERO
                        In 1966 I think he would still be 
                        considered R & B. 

                                 TED
                        In 1964 he released “Out of Sight,” 
                        which is considered one of the 
                        first funk singles.

           Piero forgot about that. 

                                 PIERO
                        Alright, well even if James Brown 
                        does count as funk, how do we get 
                        the Mothership to the concert? 

                                 TED
                        We have some time to figure that 
                        out. Where’s the club where you 
                        went with Pop?

                        You mean the Scrap Heap? 

           Pop exits the cafe, shaking his hands dry. 

                                 TED
                        Do you know anything about this 
                        James Brown concert? 

                                 POP
                        I’m promoting it. Last stop on his 
                        European tour.   

           INT. ABBEY ROAD STUDIOS, STUDIO TWO - LATER 

           Lennon isn’t at the studio. The three other Beatles stare 
           down at a late edition of the DAILY MIRROR newspaper. 

           The front page is a picture of Lennon staring up at Yoko on 
           the FIRE ESCAPE, along with the headline: JOHN LENNON TURNS 
           CYRANO LATE NIGHT ON CARNABY STREET. 

           George Harrison turns to Paul. 

                                 GEORGE HARRISON
                        Do you want to see if you can find 
                        him? 

           Paul nods and puts on his coat. 

           INT. JOHN LENNON TOWNHOUSE - SAME TIME 

           Yoko and Lennon are in Lennon’ townhouse, sitting in front of 
           a reel-to-reel TAPE RECORDER hooked up to a MICROPHONE. 
           They’ve been up all night.  

           Yoko HOWLS into the microphone. Lennon runs these ‘vocals’ 
           through the machine, creating overdubs. Lennon bangs together 
           a pair of SHOES, adding this sound effect to the recording.

                                 LENNON
                        Brilliant. 

           Lennon hits PLAYBACK on what they’ve done. It’s a mishmash of 
           babbling dialogue and conceptual sound. 

                                 LENNON
                    (sincere)
                        I think it’s the best thing I’ve 
                        ever done. 

                                 YOKO
                        You needed to free yourself from 
                        the constraints of form. 

           Lennon takes Yoko by the hand. He puts his arms around her 
           waist and moves in to KISS her. 
                                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)

                                 YOKO
                        No...  

                                 LENNON
                        Why not?

                        I have a meeting. 

                                 LENNON
                        With who? 

                                 YOKO
                    (lying)
                        A buyer. 

                                 LENNON
                        Whatever he wants to buy, I’ll pay 
                        double. 

                                 YOKO
                        You’re sweet. But it would be rude 
                        for me to break an appointment. 

           Lennon stares at Yoko. 

                                 LENNON
                        You’re meeting Ted. 

           Yoko doesn’t say anything. 

                                 LENNON
                        What do you see in him? 

                                 YOKO
                    (beat)
                        He’s just different. I have fun 
                        with him... He doesn’t think like 
                        anybody else. He makes me laugh... 

                                 LENNON
                    (jealous)
                        Have you been with him? 

                                 YOKO
                    (beat)
                        Let’s not do this, John. I consider 
                        you a good friend.  

           Lennon deflates at the word ‘friend.’

                        It’s okay. 

           INT. SCRAP HEAP NIGHTCLUB, BACK ROOM - SAME TIME 

           Ted, Piero and Pop stand in front of the Mothership. The 
           opium den is empty aside from some WORKERS cleaning. 

           They are in the midst of a conversation with the NIGHTCLUB 
           OWNER. 

                                 NIGHTCLUB OWNER
                        The man who alerted me to it said 
                        that it had been abandoned in St. 
                        James Park. 

                                 POP
                        How much do you want?

                                 NIGHTCLUB OWNER
                        I won’t part with it. It’s an 
                        attraction. 

           EXT. SCRAP HEAP NIGHTCLUB - MOMENTS LATER 

           Ted, Piero and Pop stand outside the nightclub. 

                                 POP
                        I’m unclear why you want to take 
                        that thing to the James Brown 
                        concert. 

                                 TED
                        The ship runs on funk. James Brown 
                        is the closest you get to funk in 

                                 POP
                        I’m sorry, but I don’t know what 
                        funk is.

                    (beat)
                        It’s a mixture of jazz and R&B 
                        targeted at the ass instead of the 
                        ears.  

                                 TED
                        It gets popular in a couple of 
                        years. 

           Pop stares at Ted and Piero. 
                                          (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)

                        How do you know? 

           Ted and Piero look at each other. 

                                 TED
                        Pop. Piero and I are from the 
                        future. 

                                 POP
                    (beat)
                        Oh. Is that all?

                                 PIERO
                        That doesn’t do anything for you? 

                                 POP
                        Half the people I know say they’re 
                        from the future. It’s London. 

                                 TED
                        But we really are from the future.

                                 POP
                        Lots of my friends say that too. 

           Ted and Piero give up. They tried. 

                                 TED
                        What time do you have? 

                                 POP
                        1:30.

                        Shit. I’m meeting somebody.  

                                 PIERO
                        No... We need to come up with a 
                        plan for getting the Mothership out 
                        of there. 

                                 TED
                        We can do it tonight. I’ve got to- 

                                 PIERO
                        No, you don’t. 

                                 TED
                        Tonight. I promise. 

           Ted jogs away down the street.

                                 POP
                        I do. 

           Pop silently looks Piero over. 

                                 POP
                        Astronauts are normally in better

                                 PIERO
                        You don’t need to be an astronaut 
                        to be from the future.  

                                 POP

                                 PIERO
                        It doesn’t mean I would need to be 
                        a robot, either. 

           EXT. YOKO’S STUDIO - LATER 

           Ted stands outside a dingy building, looking up.  

           Yoko drops a key attached to a small PARACHUTE out of window. 
           The key floats down to Ted. 

                                 TED
                        You do everything different. 

                                 YOKO
                        I’m thinking of marketing them. 

           Ted opens the front door with the key.  

           INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS 

           A spacious, cheap-looking workspace/apartment. Yoko’s 
           installations are everywhere: A grapefruit in an aquarium 
           labeled WATER/GRAPEFRUIT. A punching bag with the word OUCH 
           written across it. 

           Yoko stands over a damp cardboard box hooked up to a series 
           of TUBES. 

                                 TED
                        Is that the crying machine?

                        Yeah, but every time it cries the 
                        cardboard gets wet and rips. It 
                        needs to at least be able to make 
                        it through a show. 

                                 TED
                        Why not build it out of wood or 
                        metal? 

                                 YOKO
                        Too depressing. A machine that 
                        cries  forever ? Think about it. 

                                 TED
                        You’re right. It’s better if it 
                        cries itself out and dies 
                        naturally. 

                                 YOKO
                        As long as it gets through the 
                        opening. 

           Yoko sips a cup of something. Ted notices she has dark BAGS 
           under her eyes. She notices him looking. 

                                 YOKO

                        I’ve decided you’re more my type. 

                                 TED
                        I’d agree with that.

           INT. THE SCOTCH OF ST. JAMES - SAME TIME 

           John Lennon is at his usual table, drinking hard alcohol in 
           the middle of the afternoon.

           Paul sits down across from him. 

                                 PAUL
                        Been waiting for you at the studio. 

                                 LENNON
                        I’m not going to the studio today. 

                                 PAUL
                        You need to stop putting these 
                        schoolboy crushes above the band. 

                                 LENNON
                        You’re right, Paul. That’s exactly 
                        what I need to do - put aside what 
                        I feel about something so that I 
                        can rush back to the studio and 
                        listen to you rhyme  go  and  know  and 
                        car  and  star .

                        You can have any girl in the world. 

                                 LENNON
                        I’m supposed to be with Yoko.

                                 PAUL
                        And she’s chosen this lad Ted. 

           Lennon nods. 

                                 LENNON
                        The band seems less important than 
                        that, right now. I need some time

CONSTRUCTION SITE - LATER 

           Piero and Pop sit on the curb outside a construction site 
           where an office building is going up. 

                                 POP
                        Sure. I’d love to hear what happens 
                        to me.  

                                 PIERO
                        I’m not kidding. You  told  me to 
                        give you a message.

           Pop’s face drops - how does Piero know about his pills?

                    (lying)

                        You also told me to tell you to

           Piero winces. That was irresponsible. 

                                 POP
                        What’s Led Zeppelin? 

           A stocky construction FOREMAN walks over to Piero and Pop.

                        I try not to date artists, but I 
                        always do. My life is strange 
                        enough. I don’t need weirdness in 
                        my relationships. I just want 
                        people to be straight with me.

                        I wouldn’t have thought that.

                        Well, that’s probably because you 
                        haven’t been straight with me. 

           Yoko grins at Ted. She’s got him. 

                                 TED
                        I’m not sure I understand.

                        you aren’t, actually. 

           Yoko walks over to her BOOKSHELF. She removes a thin ART SHOW 
           CATALOGUE from the stacks, which she holds up to Ted. 

           The catalogue’s title is THE HAIRY WHO: HYDE PARK ART CENTER, 
           CHICAGO 1966. Ted is busted. 

                                 YOKO
                        I took a look to see what you 
                        painted. Turns out that there is no 
                        Ted Archer in the Hairy Who.

                        I’m a musician who works at a

                        I’d find something more air-tight

           Ted starts to exit. Yoko pulls him back and KISSES him. He 
           kisses her back, surprised.  

           Then, they don’t say anything. Yoko waves. Ted exits.

           Ted enters the apartment, happy. Piero GRABS him immediately.

           album cover. 

           There are still only three Beatles in the photograph, but now 
           a couple of strange elements are also visible in the scene: 

           There is a RAM in the foreground, and Paul is now carrying a 
           ROSE in his mouth.

                        now,  you  are Yoko Ono. 

           Piero clicks through the Abbey Road songs.

                        Do you know what the first song on

                        No, Ted . The  iPod  is not  
                        malfunctioning . What’s  happening  is 
                        that you’re somehow changing 
                        history so that John ends up 
                        leaving the band too soon. And 
                        without John in the band to balance 
                        out Paul, Paul is about to hit his 
                        Wings  stage too early.

                        I’m not sure what you want me to 
                        say.  

                                 PIERO
                        You need to fix it!   

                                 TED
                        She likes me as much as I like her. 

                                 PIERO
                        Look at me. 
                    (beat)
                        Right now you’re saying that you’re 
                        willing to sacrifice albums loved 
                        by you and the rest of the world, 
                        for the sake of a girl. Face it. 
                        The plan  backfired . Fix  it.    

           Ted looks at the small Abbey Road album cover on the iPod. 
           The iconic image has been destroyed.

                        I’m sorry, man. 

                                 TED
                        What do I need to do? 

                                 PIERO
                        Put Yoko and John back together. 

           INT. RITZ HOTEL - THE NEXT DAY 

           Pop sits in a hotel room with JAMES BROWN, whose hair is 
           being put in CURLERS by a STYLIST. 

           MUSICIANS mill about in the hallway. James Brown keeps an eye 
           on them through the open door. 

                                 JAMES BROWN
                        Pee Wee! I said wear a  two  button  
                        coat! Not a three! Owe me fifty! 

           Pop looks over a clipboard.

                        I’m pleased you arrived a few days 
                        early, James. There are still 
                        several issues pertaining to the 
                        concert to work out.  

                                 JAMES BROWN
                        It’s a man’s world! 

                                 POP
                        All your backstage amenities have 
                        been handled...

                                 JAMES BROWN
                        Take the night train!

                                 POP
                        But we unfortunately still haven’t 
                        been able to book an opening act. 

                                 JAMES BROWN
                        James Brown don’t go on cold. This 
                        ain’t the Apollo no more, baby.  

           EXT. INDICA GALLERY - SAME TIME 

           Ted stands across the street from the Indica Gallery. He 
           looks like he hasn’t slept. 

           INT. INDICA GALLERY - MOMENTS LATER 

           Ted opens the door to the gallery. Yoko is inside cataloguing 
           some slides. She glances at a clock on the wall. 

                                 YOKO
                        Get lost sightseeing? 

                                 TED
                        Something like that. 

           Yoko detects something. 

                                 YOKO

                        I’m fine. Let’s go eat. 

           EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - LATER 

           Ted and Yoko sit across from each other at the sidewalk cafe 
           where they had their first lunch together. Ted barely touches 
           his food.

                        You’re going to break up with me.

                        I didn’t realize we were together. 

                                 YOKO
                    (ouch)
                        Then you’re breaking up with the 
                        chance of us being something good. 

                                 TED
                        I’m leaving the city.

                        Did you already know you were going 
                        to leave when you started hanging 
                        around with me? 

                                 TED
                        Yeah. 

                                 YOKO
                        And you just wanted a fling. 

                                 TED
                    (lying)
                        Yeah.

                                 YOKO
                        Well, we didn’t sleep together, so 
                        I don’t think this counts.

                                 TED
                        I wasn’t going to count it. 

                                 YOKO
                        You should have given it a few more 
                        days. Then it would have counted. 

           She means it. Ted tries not to show his disappointment. 

                                 YOKO
                        I should leave.

           She stands. 

                                 YOKO
                        Tell Maryland I said hello.  

                                 TED
                        I will.  

           Yoko walks away. Ted watches her go.

ABBEY ROAD STUDIOS, STUDIO TWO - LATER 

           Paul, George and Ringo are playing something that sounds like 
           “Lovely Rita.” Lennon is nowhere to be seen. 

           A SECRETARY walks up to George Martin in the Soundboard Room, 
           holding a phone.  

           Paul stops the music. 

                                 PAUL
                    (into microphone)
                        Is that John? 

                                 GEORGE MARTIN
                    (from booth)
                        It’s that lad Ted who John brought 
                        here the other day. 

           MOMENTS LATER - Paul is inside the Soundboard Room, talking 
           to Ted.  

                                 PAUL
                        He isn’t here. I’m afraid he has 
                        been rendered catatonic by the girl 
                        you had with you the other night.

                                 TED
                        That’s why I’m looking for him. 

                                 PAUL
                        Presumably, you can do something to 
                        fix this situation. The band 
                        doesn’t sound as good as a trio.  
                    (beat)
                        Though it does offer me a bit more

                                 TED
                        I’m going to try, but I need his 
                        address.

           Piero examines the LOCK securing the back garage of the Scrap 
           Heap. He tries to cut it with a set of BOLT CUTTERS, but it’s 
           too heavy-duty.

           very pretty and wearing waitress clothing.

                        Did you have anything to do with 
                        that?

                        They were in there when I got home. 

           There is a KNOCK at the door. Pop looks through the peephole. 
           He opens the door. Lennon is standing there.

                        To what do I owe the honor of such 
                        a royal visit?

                        I came to see Ted, actually. 

           Ted walks to the door. 

                                 TED
                        I didn’t think you’d show up.

                        You think I can get Yoko back.

                    (to Pop)
                        Do you mind if I come in? If I go 
                        back outside I’ll be mobbed. 

           Reluctantly, Pop nods. 

           LATER - 

           In the BATHROOM, Pop stares down at two REDS in the palm of 
           his hand. He is debating whether to take them. He drops them 
           back in his drug bag and puts the bag in his pocket. 

           In the MAIN ROOM, Ted and Lennon sit on Pop’s couches, 
           drinking coffee. Lennon is chain-smoking. 

                                 TED
                        If you’re going to do this, you 
                        have to think like Paul. Straight-
                        forward. Honest. 

                                 LENNON
                        I can’t think like Paul.

                        things everybody understands - “I 
                        Love You Girl”“You’re my girl”... 
                        Stuff about girls.  You  write “I am 
                        the Walrus.”  

                                 LENNON
                        What’s “I am the Walrus?”

                        The thing about Yoko is that her 
                        life is abstract enough - she’s a 
                        conceptual artist. She just wants 
                        somebody who can be straight with 
                        her.

                        Tell me what to do. 

           An ALARM CLOCK rings in a nearby room. Ted ignores it.

                        But the  reason  the Beatles are 
                        great is that none of them think

                                        Picture 
           yourself in a boat on a river, with tangerine trees and 
           marmalade skies ... 

           He stares down at his lyrics. 

                                 LENNON
                        What the fuck is a marmalade sky? 

           EXT. LONDON STREET - LATER 

           Piero drives the forklift in the opposite direction, 
           precariously carrying the MOTHERSHIP. Ted, Anna and Pop ride 
           shotgun.

                        I’ve been careful on every turn.

                        That’s because I keep reminding 
                        you. 

           Piero gingerly TURNS the forklift. 

           The Mothership TEETERS, and then CRASHES to the ground, 
           whacking a steel FIRE EXTINGUISHER, which breaks on impact. 
           Water gushes everywhere.  

           MOMENTS LATER

           Ted, Piero and Pop guide ANNA - who is operating the forklift 
           - in picking up the Mothership.

           Lennon vacantly stares down at his empty notebook. 

           He’s crumpled up all the sheets of paper, which are scattered 
           in heaps everywhere. 

           EXT. HYDE PARK - LATER 

           The forklift arrives in Hyde Park carrying the Mothership. 

           The lawn in front of the STAGE is empty, aside from a small 
           grouping of TENTS - concert-goers getting to the show early.

           James Brown is getting a double-handed MANICURE, tended to by 
           a pair of WOMEN. 

           A tired-looking Pop sits across from him.

           not going to stop.

           Lennon is lying on the floor, stripped to his underwear. He 
           is once again listening to the discordant tape-to-tape music 
           he made with Yoko.  

           He has scrawled abstract LYRICS on the WALLS and on his BODY.

                        I really want you to come. 

                                 ANNA
                        Everyone I know is here. My 
                        friends. My family. Even if we made 
                        it safely, chances are my parents 
                        would be dead when we arrived. I 
                        don’t think I could deal with that.  

           Piero considers this.

                                 PIERO

HYDE PARK - LATER 

           The field in front of the stage is packed. A big crowd waits 
           for the show.

           James Brown sits in his DRESSING ROOM. His hair is being 
           worked on by a stylist with a professional PLASTIC-HOODED 
           HAIR DRYER. 

           On Pop’s signal, stage hands bring trays of DESIGNER SHOES 
           into the room. Some leather. Some buckled. Some mod. Some 
           casual. 

                                 POP
                        One-hundred and twenty-five pairs 
                        of shoes.  

                                 JAMES BROWN
                        Gotta try them on, see how they 
                        fit.

                        You’re due to go on in less than an

                                 JAMES BROWN
                        Then you better start loosening 
                        those laces, Mr. Promoter Man.

           Yoko stands unhappily near the front of the stage, next to a 
           few stage hands. 

           She studies her hanging James Brown banner. It is crooked and 
           difficult to see behind the spaceship.

           INT. HYDE PARK BACKSTAGE - LATER 

           Pop’s fingers are cracked and bleeding. He slides a pair of 
           alligator loafers onto James Brown’s feet.

           James Brown looks down at the shoes, satisfied.

                        Alright. Let’s turn this mother 
                        out. 

           Then, Pop’s ASSISTANT taps Pop on the shoulder.

           Pop is on the verge of a meltdown.

                        The opening act  cancelled ? I’ve 
                        never heard of such a thing...

                        The lead singer of the band we 
                        booked had a bit of an... episode, 
                        it seems. 

                                 POP
                        Who is the singer? 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        A lad called Syd Barrett.

                                 POP
                        James Brown won’t go on without an 
                        opener. This is a disaster.

                        I might be able to help. 

           Pop turns to look at Ted, who is standing behind him, holding 
           an ELECTRIC GUITAR. 

                                 POP
                        Do you have any songs?

                        A few.

                        How did you get back here? 

           Ted nods to John Lennon, who is looking over a batch of 
           hastily scrawled LYRICS. 

                                 LENNON

                        Mind if I use the piano?

                        front when the show starts.

                        It might be easier if you push your 
                        way up now.

                        Should be a legendary night. 

           Lennon and Pop make eye contact. They’re cool with each 
           other. Pop signals to a TECHNICIAN controlling the LIGHTS. 

           The lights go down over the crowd. Pop clicks the ON button 
           on a MICROPHONE. 

                                 POP

           Ted paces nervously backstage. 

           EXT. HYDE PARK - SAME TIME 

           Pop’s voice rings out of LOUDSPEAKERS on every side of the 
           stage. 

                                 POP (O.C.)
                        ...On behalf of the Hyde Park and

                        give a warm hand to... Ted Archer!

           INT. HYDE PARK BACKSTAGE - SAME TIME

           Ted turns to John Lennon. 

                                 TED
                        I’ve waited my whole life to hear 
                        that. 
                                                    (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)

                        Nothing to worry about, mate. 
                        You’re a terrific musician.  

           It’s the most important thing anybody has ever said to Ted - 
           validation for everything in his life. 

           He takes a deep breath and walks onto the stage.  

           EXT. HYDE PARK - SAME TIME

           Ted makes his way to the microphone. He nods to Yoko. She is 
           stunned to see him on stage.  

           Ted stares out at the biggest crowd he’s ever seen. 
           Applebees, this is not. 

           The crowd alternately waits for him to say something, and 
           shouts at him about the show:  Who is this guy?... Bring on 
           James Brown!... Get off the stage, wanker!
                                      ... etc. 

                                 TED
                        Hello... Man, there are a lot of 
                        you... I’m Ted... I was going to 
                        play some of my songs, but a... 
                        friend of mine asked if he could 
                        play something new... 

           Displeased whistles from the crowd. 

                                 TED
                        You see, my friend is supposed to 
                        be with a girl who’s here 
                        tonight... She’s right there, 
                        actually... 

           Ted points to Yoko. 

           Ten thousand people crane their necks to look at Yoko, 
           including Piero, who is standing a few feet away. 

           INT. HYDE PARK BACKSTAGE - SAME TIME 

           James Brown is listening to Ted’s speech. He turns to his 
           BASSIST. 

                                 JAMES BROWN
                        We gonna need to put on a  show  
                        tonight to wake the people up after 
                        this bullshit.  

                                 BASSIST
                    (re: bass)
                        You know how I do. 
                                             (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                 JAMES BROWN
                        Gonna have to make these mothers 
                        dance .

           EXT. HYDE PARK - SAME TIME 

           Ted on stage. 

                                 TED
                        ...And having her stuck in this 
                        crowd is maybe the only way to make 
                        sure that she’d stay and listen. 
                    (beat)
                        Everybody, John Lennon. 

           Lennon walks out of the wings. He takes a seat at the PIANO. 

           After a moment of shock, the crowd ROARS. Lennon speaks into 
           the microphone. 

                                 LENNON
                        A friend of mine told me that I 
                        needed to be more direct with the 
                        people I love. So, here you go, 
                        Yoko. 

           Lennon starts playing the piano... It’s a familiar melody... 
           Then Ted comes in on the guitar, and there is no doubt about 
           what Lennon is playing: 

           “Can’t Fight This Feeling (Anymore)” by REO Speedwagon.

           Lennon begins singing. 

                                 LENNON
                        I can’t fight this feeling any 
                        longer! 
                        And yet I’m still afraid to let it 
                        flow... 
                        What started out as friendship has 
                        grown stronger! 
                        I only wish I had the strength to 
                        let it show... 

           And so on. And then we hit the chorus... 

                  LENNON
                                        TED

                               Anymore... 
                               For... 

                               Shore... 
                               Oar...
           I can’t fight this feeling 
           anymore! I’ve forgotten what 
           I’ve started fighting for! 
           It’s time to bring this ship 
           into the shore 
           And throw away the oar, 
           forever!

           Yoko is visibly moved. 

           ON STAGE

           Ted solos on his guitar. It’s sweet. He looks over at Lennon, 
           who nods, impressed. 

           Ted shakes his head, disbelieving. Lennon finishes out the 
           song... 

                                 LENNON
                        Cause I can’t fight this feeling 
                        anymore! 
                        I’ve forgotten what I started 
                        fighting for! 
                        And if I have to crawl upon the 
                        floor! 
                        Come crushing through your door!
                        Baby, I can’t fight this feeling 
                        anymore...  

           Lennon plinks the final piano notes. The song is over. 

           ...And the crowd ERUPTS. 

           Lennon hops from the stage and walks over to Yoko. 

                                 YOKO
                        That was the cheesiest thing I’ve 
                        ever heard. 

                                 LENNON
                        Did you like it?  

                                 YOKO
                        I loved it. 

           Lennon leans over the partition and KISSES Yoko. Huge 
           approval from the crowd. 

           Ted watches from the stage, a little bummed. And then, there 
           is a HAND around his microphone. 

           He looks over and sees JAMES BROWN. James Brown’s band are 
           taking their places. 

                                 JAMES BROWN
                        Time for me to take over, Ted 
                        Archer. 

                                 TED

                        You want me to play guitar. For 
                        you. James Brown. 

                                 JAMES BROWN
                        Don’t make me ask twice, baby.

           Ted thinks about it. 

                                 TED
                    (beat)
                        No. It’s time for me to go home. 
                    (beat)
                        But hey, could you do me a favor? 

                                 JAMES BROWN
                        What you want? 

                                 TED
                        Go hard tonight. That spaceship 
                        runs on funk. 

                                 JAMES BROWN
                        Funk? 

                                 TED
                        You already invented it with 
                        “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” and 
                        some other songs. Just emphasize 
                        the one-three beats instead of the 
                        two-four.

                                 JAMES BROWN
                        Been doing that for years! 

                                 TED
                        That’s what I’m saying. Give it up 
                        or turn it loose. 

                                 JAMES BROWN
                        I’ll do both, baby. 

           Ted spots Piero at the front of the crowd. He motions at him. 
           Let’s go. 

           Piero climbs over the railing. SECURITY GUARDS step in.

                        It’s fine. He’s with me. 

           Ted helps Piero on stage. 

                                 PIERO
                        Holy shit. I didn’t know you could 
                        do that. 

                                 TED
                        I didn’t either.

                        I saw somebody bootlegging the 
                        show. You’re a part of rock 
                        history.  

           Ted turns to Piero. 

                                 TED
                        Say that again. My ears are still 
                        ringing.  

                                 PIERO
                        A guy was bootlegging the show. 
                        People were taking photographs, 
                        writers were scribbling in their 
                        notebooks - this is a real thing. 

           Ted gets a strange expression on his face. 

                                 TED
                        Holy shit. I peaked. 

                                 PIERO
                        What? 

                                 TED
                        I’ve never been a part of something 
                        people would remember. Tonight 
                        mattered. 

                                 PIERO
                        Yeah. It did. 

                                 TED
                        This is it. This is all I ever 
                        wanted to feel. 

                                 PIERO
                        Ted...

                                 TED
                        No. It’s fine... 

           Ted looks at James Brown waiting in the wings. He looks at 
           John Lennon, still kissing Yoko Ono. This is the best moment 
           of his life. 

                                 TED
                    (moved)
                        It’s great, actually. 

           James Brown stands with his back to the audience. His Bassist 
           introduces him...

                        On the one! 

           The band launches into “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag.” 

           INT. HYDE PARK BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 

           Ted and Piero reach Pop. They shake his hand. 

                                 POP
                        I wish you were staying.

                                 TED

                        for us. 

                                 POP
                        Of course. And thank you for the

                        ...sign Led Zeppelin, is that 
                        right? 

           Piero nods, sheepishly. Ted shoots him a look. 

                                 POP
                        Look me up when you get back. 

                                 TED
                        We will. 

           From the stage, we hear a low, throbbing BASSLINE. 

                                 TED
                        Let’s go. 

           EXT. HYDE PARK - MOMENTS LATER 

           Ted and Piero creep on stage to the Mothership while James 
           Brown’s band plays. They check the ship’s engine. 

           It is steadily filling with PINK GOO. Drip. Drip. 

                                 PIERO
                        Funk.

                        We’re in business. 

           They open the Mothership’s door. Ted takes a final look at 
           John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who are in the front row of the 
           crowd. Lennon has his arms around Yoko, pulling her close.  

           Lennon and Ted make eye contact. A mutual thank you.

           of the stage. She has a sad smile on her face. She waves 
           goodbye to him. 

           Piero looks at Anna. He looks at the Mothership. He looks 
           back at Anna. 

                                 PIERO
                    (quiet)
                        I’m not going, Ted. 

                                 TED
                        What? 

                                 PIERO
                        I’m staying here. I want to be with 
                        Anna. 

                                 TED
                        You don’t belong here. 

                                 PIERO
                        There’s nothing for me back in 
                        Maryland. My job is terrible. My 
                        entire family lives in Peru. Women 
                        hate me. 
                    (beat)
                        I can have another kind of life 
                        here. 

           Silence. 

                                 TED
                        As long as you promise to be there 
                        when I land. I’ll need a ride.  

           Piero laughs. 

                                 PIERO
                        I’ll be the fat senior citizen in 
                        the wheelchair.  

                                 TED
                        You’re going to age terribly. 
                        You’re already falling apart. 

                                 PIERO
                        At least I’ll be with her. 
                    (beat)
                        By the way... 

           Piero holds his iPod up to Ted. The Abbey Road cover has been 
           fully restored. Four Beatles. 

           Ted nods. He gives Piero a hug. 

                                 PIERO
                        Be safe.

                        Do something cool.  

           Ted climbs into the Mothership. Piero shuts the door behind 
           him. 

           Piero climbs offstage and walks over to a stunned Anna. He 
           kisses her.

                                 ANNA
                        I can’t believe you did that. 

                                 PIERO
                        I guess this means you’re stuck 
                        with me. 

           She kisses him back. 

           INT. MOTHERSHIP - SAME TIME 

           Ted powers up the ship. He sets his destination coordinates 
           to Maryland. He sets his destination time back to when he 
           left. 

           Ted pushes down on the EMERGENCY BRAKE. The Mothership starts 
           to tremble ferociously. 

           EXT. HYDE PARK

           Rivers of blue electricity run over the Mothership. It just 
           makes the James Brown band play harder.  

                                 JAMES BROWN
                        Bring it on home! 

           INT. MOTHERSHIP

           Ted holds on to his seat. Then, comes the familiar PAUSE, 
           followed by a wild SURGE OF ACCELERATION. 

           EXT. HYDE PARK 

           The Mothership BLASTS through the ROOF of the Hyde Park 
           stage. 

           James Brown and his band duck and dive to get out of the way 
           of the falling wood and lights. The music stops. 

           In a flash of LIGHT, the Mothership DISAPPEARS into the night 
           sky. 

           After a moment of shocked silence, the crowd ROARS its

           He takes his bag of REDS out of his pocket and drops them in 
           the TRASH. No more drugs. 

           On stage, James Brown stares at the spot the Mothership used 
           to be. He’s impressed.

           EXT. SUITLAND PARKWAY WOODS - DAY 

           With a tremendous CRACK, the Mothership CRASHES through trees 
           into the middle of the Suitland Parkway Woods. 

           The DOOR opens and Ted crawls out. He collapses onto the 
           ground, trying to get his wind back. 

           He looks around.

                        Piero? 

           No response. He looks at the Mothership. It is smashed and 
           battered. It’ll never be used again.

           Ted walks along the side of the road, hitchhiking. He looks 
           like hell. Nobody gives him a ride. 

           EXT. COLLEGE PARK, MARYLAND - LATER 

           A TAXI pulls up in front of SPINNAKER RECORD SHOP. 

           Ted climbs out and gives the driver a few loose dollars and 
           POUND NOTES he has in his pocket. The driver looks down at 
           the money, perplexed. 

           INT. SPINNAKER RECORD SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           The store looks exactly the same. A pony-tailed HIPSTER 
           stands behind the cash register. 

           Ted clearly doesn’t know who this guy is.

                        There’s a box of blues records that 
                        need to be scanned into the system. 
                        Other than that, it’s been slow. 

                                 TED
                        Ok. 

                                 HIPSTER
                        See you tomorrow, man. 

           The Hipster leaves the record store. 

           Ted is all alone. He looks around the store. Nothing is 
           different. Beatles posters. Radiohead. The Modern Lovers. We 
           see a BEE GEES poster on the wall. A NIRVANA poster hangs 
           nearby. It seems rock history has worked itself out after 
           all. 

           Ted smiles. He loves this place. 

           He bends down to open the box of blues records, when he spots 
           something at the bottom of a LED ZEPPELIN IV poster. He leans 
           in close to look at it:

                        Son of a bitch. 

           Ted walks over to a small shelf filled with rock biographies. 
           He takes a BEATLES BIOGRAPHY off the shelf. He opens it and 
           flips through the PHOTOGRAPHS in the middle.  

           He stops abruptly on one of the photos. It’s a PICTURE of him 
           on stage with John Lennon. He reads the caption:        

                A photo from the evening John and Yoko began their 
                romance. The performance of “Ted Archer” that night,  
                and his subsequent disappearance, remains a legendary 
                part of rock and roll history.  

           Ted closes the book.

PIERO (early 70s) and POP (late 60s) enter 
           the store. Both of them are dressed in stylish suits. Pop 
           looks great. Piero looks good, but he’s put on weight.

                        supported me doing the things I 
                        love. You made me think you were 
                        the only person who would ever want 
                        me. You told me to get a job you 
                        knew would make me miserable, just 
                        so you’d save face in front of your

                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)           Jessica exits the store. Ted, Piero and Pop watch her go. 

                                 PIERO
                        I’ve waited fifty years to see you 
                        do that. 

           Ted looks at Piero. 

                                 PIERO
                        So tell me what’s up. 

           Ted thinks about what he’s going to say. 

                                 TED
                        When I was playing with John, I 
                        looked over at him and thought, 
                        there is a guy who operates on a 
                        different level than the rest of 
                        us. And in that moment, I realized 
                        something - I’m a better fan than I 
                        am an artist. 
                    (beat)
                        I mean, I’ve written a few songs, 
                        but none of them have been 
                        spectacular. And the older the get, 
                        the more I realize that my 
                        satisfaction in life comes from 
                        having these songs... 

           Ted gestures to stacks of records all around the store. 

                                 TED
                        ...In my life. This place makes me 
                        happy. For as long as I can 
                        remember, I wanted to be part of 
                        something bigger than me. And now I 
                        kinda think I am. I felt something 
                        I always wanted to feel, and I 
                        think that might be enough. I don’t 
                        need anything else. 

           Pop and Piero think about this. 

                                 POP
                        How about we at least buy you the 
                        store so you can work better hours. 

                                 TED
                        And the building next door. I want 
                        a separate jazz room.  

                                 PIERO
                        Done.

TED ARCHER’S RECORDS - WEEKS LATER

           The sign for Spinnaker Records has been removed. A new one 
           has been put in its place - TED ARCHER’S RECORDS. 

           The WALL has been knocked down between the main store and the 
           place next door. Drywall and bits of wood are everywhere. 
           It’s a construction site. Sheets of plastic protect the 
           records in the main store.  

           Ted works side-by-side with Piero and Pop, who are still 
           strong workers. 

                                 YUKO (O.C.)
                        Hello? 

           Ted stops hammering. He turns around to see YUKO (20s), a 
           pretty Japanese girl. 

                                 YUKO
                        Do you work here? 

                                 TED
                        I own the store. 

           Ted smiles. It feels good to say it. 

                                 YUKO
                        Great. I didn’t want to mess with 
                        the plastic. Maybe you can help me 
                        find something. I’m looking for the 
                        Green Vinyl pressing of  Abbey Road . 

                                 TED
                    (beat)
                        The limited edition export 
                        pressing? 

                                 YUKO
                    (beat)
                        Wow. You know it. 

                                 TED
                        Yeah. 

                                 YUKO
                        Cool. 

           Love. 

                                 TED
                        Hi. I’m Ted. 

                                 YUKO
                        Yuko.

           Piero look on... 

           THE END.
