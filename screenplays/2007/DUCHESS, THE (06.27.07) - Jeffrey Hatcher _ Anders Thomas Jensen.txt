           TITLE: Althorp Estate, 1774

           CLOSE UP brush strokes on canvas, as an ARTIST paints a 
           miniature portrait. It’s a perfect English summer’s day, 
           birds singing, gentle breeze rustling in leaves.

           Sunlight hits the face of a young, beautiful and content 
           GEORGIANA, who is trying with difficulty to stay very 
           still. She is his subject, and is being a painted on the 
           BACK LAWN of her home estate. The ARTIST is aware that she 
           is itchy to move. 

                                 ARTIST
                        Nearly done...(politely) if her 
                        ladyship can hold on just a 
                        little longer.

           GEORGIANA straightens her back and tries her best.

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (Warmly)
                        My mother tells me you have 
                        recently painted the King...

                                 ARTIST
                        That’s correct.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Does he have difficulty keeping 
                        still, too?

           The ARTIST smiles at her cheekiness. He carries on. 

                                 ARTIST
                            (Diplomatically)
                        I haven’t yet come across anyone 
                        who finds it easy.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Oh? Who else have you been 
                        painting? 

           GEORGIANA smiles charmingly. The ARTIST is won over.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        I promise I won’t tell.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. ALTHORP - DAY

           In CLOSE UP, a quill pen dips into an ink well and starts 
           to write up a LEGAL DOCUMENT on a virgin piece of white 
           paper, ‘The Fourteenth Day of May, Seventeen Hundred and 
           Seventy Four...’
           BURLEIGH, a solicitor, is at a table writing this document, 
           his ink pen scraping against the paper. Around him, the 
           room has the atmosphere of a serious occasion: still and 
           dark although the sun shines brightly outside.

           The DUKE, BURLEIGH’s employer, is standing at the library 
           window, looking into the garden at GEORGIANA having her 
           portrait painted, the image distorted through the wavy 
           glass window pane.

           LADY SPENCER is seated behind the DUKE, perched on the edge 
           of a large leather sofa, with LORD SPENCER behind her. 

                                 LADY SPENCER
                            (Cautiously)
                        I trust your Grace still finds 
                        her an attractive girl?

           The DUKE turns and we now see his face properly. He is 
           handsome, older than GEORGIANA, and has a rakish twinkle in 
           his eye. He looks at LADY SPENCER enigmatically. 

                                 DUKE
                        Of course, Lady Spencer.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        She is well-bred and devoted to 
                        her duties. She speaks French, 
                        Latin and Italian, and is fully 
                        versed in horsemanship and 
                        dancing... 

                                 DUKE
                        Yes, I am aware of all that. She 
                        is a credit to you.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        ...I can't think of anything in 
                        Georgiana that would stand in the 
                        way of a singularly happy 
                        marriage -

           The DUKE turns for a brief moment and smiles inscrutably at 
           LADY SPENCER. BURLEIGH cuts to the chase.

                                 BURLEIGH
                        These are not the issues that 
                        burden the Duke, Lady Spencer. 
                        His Grace won't come into his 
                        inheritance until he produces a 
                        male heir. On the other hand, 
                        your daughter may expect a 
                        handsome reward when that occurs -

                                 DUKE
                        Thank you, Burleigh.
                                 BURLEIGH
                            (resuming his writing)
                        Your Grace ...

           The DUKE remains looking out of the window, not so much out 
           of interest in GEORGIANA, but rather because he finds these 
           pre-nuptial proceedings uncomfortable. LADY SPENCER throws 
           a brief glance at LORD SPENCER, who seems disinclined to 
           discuss these matters. She resolutely turns to the DUKE.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        Your Grace can rest assured that 
                        a boy will be produced. The women 
                        in our family have never 
                        forfeited on that account.

           LADY SPENCER smiles at her husband who nods back. BURLEIGH 
           looks to the DUKE for confirmation, then decides to address 
           his comment to no one in particular.

                                 BURLEIGH
                        Well in that case...

           BURLEIGH turns the document around toward the others for 
           them to look at. The DUKE smiles at them, then turns and 
           fastidiously removes a spot on the window pane.

                                 DUKE
                        So be it, then.

           EXT. ALTHORPE - DAY

           The ARTIST stands back. He has finished the portrait. 

                                 ARTIST
                        There.

           GEORGIANA jumps up and comes round to look at it, peering 
           close at the two-inch picture. 

                                 GEORGIANA 
                        It’s perfect. 

                                 ARTIST
                            (Flattered)
                        Splendid. I’ll bring it to you 
                        when it’s dry.

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (Young and impatient)
                        Can I not take it now?

           GEORGIANA smiles another winning smile. 
                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        I want to show Mama. Please.

                                 ARTIST
                        Oh...well be very careful with 
                        it...

           EXT. ALTHORP - DAY

           GEORGIANA walks back across the estate with the portrait, 
           carefree and excited. When she sees LADY SPENCER exiting 
           the main house and coming towards her she starts to run 
           across the lawn.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Mama! Mama!

           LADY SPENCER comes out of the house. 

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        Look at this! I’m going to wear 
                        it as a pendant around my neck - 
                        Mr Gresse says that’s what Lady 
                        Davenport does with hers...

           LADY SPENCER smiles, holding in her secret.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        Very good, Georgiana. Although I 
                        must say I have something rather 
                        more important for you to 
                        concentrate on than fashion.

           GEORGIANA looks at the portrait, a little dejected but 
           intrigued nonetheless. LADY SPENCER pauses for dramatic 
           effect. GEORGIANA looks up.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Yes?

                                 LADY SPENCER 
                        Rumour has it I shall very soon 
                        be addressing my daughter as Her 
                        Grace, the Duchess of Devonshire. 

           GEORGIANA is taken wholly by surprise. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Is it true, Mama?

                                 LADY SPENCER
                            (Proudly)
                        It is. 
                                 GEORGIANA
                        The Duke of Devonshire ... He is 
                        the handsomest man.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        And the most eligible. The 
                        Devonshires rank among the very 
                        first families of England.

           GEORGIANA is thinking.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        So he loves me?

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        Yes, of course.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        But he hardly knows me. 

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        You have met him twice. And when 
                        one truly loves someone, one 
                        doesn't have to know them well to 
                        be certain, Georgiana. One feels 
                        it right away.

           GEORGIANA desperately wants this fairy tale to be true.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Yes...well if he didn't, he 
                        wouldn't wish to spend the rest 
                        of his life with me would he?

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        Then there you are.

           LADY SPENCER smiles and pauses, momentarily caught by a 
           different thought. 

                                 LADY SPENCER (CONT'D)
                        Dearest G, I have held onto you 
                        for as long as I could. I am sure 
                        I shall be lost without you. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        But we will still see each other.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        Yes. And I do believe you will be 
                        happy with the Duke.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I know I shall, Mama ... I know I 
                        shall.
           The camera moves in to a CLOSE UP of her optimistic face.

           INT. GREAT LONDON CHURCH - MORNING

           CLOSE UP of GEORGIANA’S face, same framing as before, but 
           now heavily made up and in her BRIDAL DRESS, and looking 
           ever so slightly petrified. Wedding music plays as she is 
           walking forward down the aisle, accompanied by her father.

           A high PLAN SHOT reveals that this church is packed with 
           people. GEORGIANA continues to walk, her eyes flicking from 
           side to side to take them in: all the important members of 
           society, even the King and Queen. Journalists and sketchers 
           are busy scribbling away from the back. All eyes are fixed 
           on the couple at the front. 

           GEORGIANA looks nervous - as well she may - within this 
           massively daunting environment, as if she wasn’t prepared 
           to be thrust into the limelight in such a dramatic way. 

           Near the front she passes LADY SPENCER who looks incredibly 
           proud. When GEORGIANA finally reaches THE DUKE, he looks 
           composed. She smiles at him.

           Credits are superimposed throughout this sequence, until 
           the main title appears as GEORGIANA stands at the front:

           THE DUCHESS

           INT. GREAT LONDON CHURCH - LATER THAT MORNING

           The marriage ceremony itself is underway. A MINISTER quotes 
           Genesis, his voice booming loudly across the space:

                                 MINISTER
                        "Unto the woman he said, I will 
                        greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy 
                        conception; in sorrow thou shalt 
                        bring forth children; and thy 
                        desire shall be to thy husband, and 
                        he shall rule over thee..."

           The DUKE looks impatiently at the MINISTER, evidently 
           annoyed that the ceremony is taking so long.

                                 THE DUKE
                        I had no idea that it would take so

                        The ritual must be observed, your 
                        Grace, sir.

                                 THE DUKE
                        By all means, although I fail to 
                        see why... well, now it's over. At 
                        long last.

           The DUKE smiles calmly at GEORGIANA and takes her hand. She 
           smiles blissfully back at him. The FAMILY MEMBERS step 
           forward to congratulate the couple, although the DUKE now 
           seems slightly distant.

           EXT. LONDON STREET - AFTERNOON

           It’s a wide and busy London street. There are ORDINARY 
           PEOPLE on the side of it, TRAFFIC kicking up dust. It’s a 
           messy mass of noise and smells.

           Through the middle of this comes the DUKE’S GILT COACH 
           followed by two other COACHES, in stark contrast to their 
           surroundings. Heads turn to look at this eighteenth century 
           motorcade, and the famous people inside.

           I/E. DUKE’S GILT COACH. LONDON STREET - AFTERNOON

           Still in her wedding dress, GEORGIANA sits alongside the 
           DUKE in his CARRIAGE. There’s an awkward silence. Finally,

                                 DUKE
                        Here we are.

           As the CARRIAGE nears a set of massive gates a large group 
           of THE GENERAL PUBLIC can be seen waiting outside. When 
           they see the carriage these people start waving. The DUKE 
           waves back, out of duty. GEORGIANA looks bemused.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        What do they want?
                                 DUKE
                        To see me. And my new wife, of 
                        course.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Oh.

                                 DUKE
                        It’s a damn bother, but you’ll 
                        get used to it. Comes with the 
                        job, I’m afraid.

           GEORGIANA, however, smiles and gives a little wave: she 
           doesn’t mind at all.

           I/E. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           The CARRIAGE turns off the street and through the massive 
           gateway. The gates are locked behind them. 

           Inside the huge courtyard Devonshire House is revealed as 
           an oversized, stark and austere building. A wall runs all 
           the way around it, blocking the view and completes the 
           foreboding sense of arriving in a prison.

           SERVANTS are formally lined up to greet them. They bow and 
           curtsy as GEORGIANA walks past, averting eye contact.

                                 SERVANT 1
                        Your Grace.

                                 SERVANT 2 
                        Your Grace.

           The DUKE strides off ahead. GEORGIANA follows him into a 
           massive ENTRANCE HALL the size of small aircraft hanger. 

                                 DUKE (O.S.)
                        This way.

           INT. THE DUKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           GEORGIANA stands in front of the DUKE who is sitting on the 
           bed, about to undress her. He awkwardly unfastens her skirt
           and lets it fall to the floor. She smiles at him in 
           excitement, a bit nervous. She tries to caress him, and leans 
           forward to kiss him.

                                 THE DUKE
                        Erm, stay where you are, please...
           GEORGIANA straightens herself up. The DUKE proceeds to take 
           off her clothes.

                                 THE DUKE (CONT'D)
                        I take it this is all quite new to 
                        you?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Yes...very.

                                 THE DUKE
                        Well, don’t worry. You’re in safe 
                        hands.

           GEORGIANA remains standing and looks up at the ceiling, while 
           the DUKE proceeds to remove the rest of her garments - with 
           some difficulty.

                                 THE DUKE (CONT'D)
                        For the life of me I don't 
                        understand why women's attire 
                        must be so damned complicated. I 
                        swear I'd pay a million pounds to 
                        whomever can provide me with an 
                        answer.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I suppose it's just our way of 
                        expressing ourselves.

                                 THE DUKE
                        Whatever do you mean?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Well, that you have so many ways 
                        of expressing yourselves, whereas 
                        we must make do with our hats and 
                        our dresses, I suppose.

                                 THE DUKE
                        Hmmm.

           The corset gives the DUKE some trouble, and he pulls it off 
           giving GEORGIANA a fierce jolt. Suddenly, she is completely 
           naked. She sends the DUKE an uneasy look. For a moment he 
           appears to be lost in his thoughts, just staring at her.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Is something the matter?

                                 THE DUKE
                        No. No, not in the least. Lie down 
                        on your back, please.

           The DUKE gets up and starts to undress. Around him the 
           faces of his forefathers bear down from the massive 
           portraits crammed onto the walls of his bedroom. 
           The DUKE, now naked, walks over to the bed and stands 
           before her. The camera is behind the DUKE and focussed on 
           GEORGIANA: having never seen a penis before let alone an 
           erect one, she is intently and nervously staring at his.

                                 THE DUKE (CONT'D)
                            (Bending down)
                        Kiss me.

           GEORGIANA kisses him. He lies down on top of her and 
           penetrates her, the look on her face suggesting this is not a 
           very pleasurable experience. The DUKE pumps away while 
           GEORGIANA wonders what all the fuss is about, all the time 
           watched intensely by dozens of his male ancestors’ eyes.

           GEORGIANA sits reading a newspaper. The headline is 
           ‘Society Welcomes The New Duchess’, and underneath is a 
           caricatured sketch of Georgiana in her wedding dress. The 
           room she’s in is huge - two storeys high, flanked by 
           drawing rooms of equal size, and leading to an anteroom and 
           dining rooms - and she looks isolated and lonely.

           A SERVANT enters and walks across the vastness toward her. 
           Georgiana puts the paper down. 

                                 SERVANT
                        Lady Spencer is arrived, Your

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Oh, thank you.

           GEORGIANA sits with LADY SPENCER, in another massive room. 
           They are playing cards, as they’ve always done, and talking.  

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        ...One has to accept one's 
                        responsibility, my darling. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LADY SPENCER (CONT'D)
                        Certain obligations come with 
                        marriage, no matter how burdensome 
                        they may seem. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Yes, but when we are together, 
                        intimately, I mean, he...

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        I know; it can be a bother. 
                        However, it is only until you 
                        have given him a son. With luck 
                        the occasions will then become 
                        fewer, and less... determined.

           Lady Spencer places down a card.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I think it would feel different if 
                        he might talk to me every once in a 
                        while. It’s not that he’s unkind 
                        but he never talks to me.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        Well, perhaps you ought to talk 
                        less - just be there for him. I 
                        fear you may have had a little too 
                        much education. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        How can one ever have too much? 

                                 LADY SPENCER
                            (Cutting in)
                        You make boring conversation and 
                        ask questions which a man is 
                        disinclined to answer.

           GEORGIANA looks at her mother in resignation.

                                 LADY SPENCER (CONT'D)
                        Learning these things takes time, 
                        too, my darling. Marriage is not 
                        like languages or music or 
                        painting. It requires a longer 
                        apprenticeship.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Yes. But he is... he is not at all 
                        as when I first met him. I thought 
                        he would be like Papa. Under his 
                        cool reserve I would find a wealth 
                        of depth and sentiment. But he 
                        doesn’t seem interested in 
                        anything. Apart from his dogs.
                                 LADY SPENCER 
                        Try not to be too hard on him, G. 
                        He is merely intent on producing a
                        boy. As for talking - whatever is 
                        there to talk about, my dear?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        No, you're right. How foolish of me 
                        to think that I should be able to 
                        converse with my husband.

           LADY SPENCER sighs and looks at her spirited daughter.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        Trust me, G. Brace yourself with 
                        patience and try to look outside 
                        your marriage for your 
                        entertainment. A male heir will 
                        come soon enough, then you'll 
                        see. 

           GEORGIANA nods. She sends her mother a polite little smile.

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - BALLROOM - NIGHT

           A great, noisy dinner party. WHIGS in full gala, among 
           which is CHARLES FOX, a stout little man making a speech in 
           the grand room. Everybody listens to him.

           GEORGIANA is by his side, her attire conspicuously more 
           daring than before. She looks apprehensive: the room is 
           dominated by alcohol and testosterone-fuelled MEN. 
           GEORGIANA, though, pays attention to FOX. The DUKE, at the 
           other end of the table, does not.

                                 FOX
                        ...a political party, in my 
                        definition, consists of men of 
                        honour, entertaining similar 
                        principles that may be more 
                        successfully pursued by the force 
                        of mutual support and, not to 
                        forget, the unfailing generosity of 
                        his Grace the Duke of Devonshire.

           Everybody looks to the DUKE, applauding loudly and somewhat 
           sycophantically. The DUKE nods cordially.

                                 FOX (CONT'D)
                        So between the persistence of my 
                        own humble self...

           Everybody laughs again, including GEORGIANA, thus betraying 
           that nobody finds Fox humble. FOX, pleased with the success 
           of his joke, joins in the laughter.
                                 FOX (CONT'D)
                        I say, between my persistence and 
                        the Duke's purse, we must always 
                        remember the honourable and 
                        principle aims of the Whig party, 
                        aims that some consider quite 
                        radical but which, to us, seem 
                        simply just and right and 
                        sensible. Just to bring 
                        independence to America. Right to 
                        end the slave trade. And sensible 
                        to pursue freedom for all, so 
                        that the blessings of this 
                        blessed plot, this England, may 
                        be more equally enjoyed. 

           All these are greeted by ‘hear hears’ from the room, and a 
           deep thoughtfulness from GEORGIANA.

                                 FOX (CONT'D)
                        And so - having kept everyone 
                        from the burgundy long enough - 
                        let me propose a toast to our 
                        host and benefactor his Grace, 
                        the Duke and his charming and 
                        beautiful new Duchess.

           They all shout "hear, hear" and reach for their glasses. In 
           the midst of all the commotion, the DUKE seems more eager to 
           resume his chat with an obliging lady at his side.

           FOX sits down at GEORGIANA's side. The murmur of small talk 
           rises as the guests carry on with their eating and drinking. 
           The LADY on the other side of FOX compliments his speech.

                                 LADY
                        Excellent speech, Mr. Fox, 
                        splendid.

                                 FOX
                        I thank you. However, it is always 
                        easy to address a congregation of 
                        friends, and even more so when 
                        those friends are drunk.

           The LADY and GEORGIANA smile.

                                 LADY
                        How did the Duchess find Mr. Fox's 
                        speech?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I must confess I am not yet at ease 
                        with political speeches. Their very 
                        form tends to obstruct my view to 
                        their actual meaning - if such 
                        there be.
           Fox, expecting inane flattery, is surprised, although 
           favourably impressed by GEORGIANA's candour. The LADY, not 
           observing that GEORGIANA has earned FOX's undivided 
           attention, proceeds to think that she is still part of the 
           conversation:

                                 LADY
                        I myself have no head for 
                        politics...

           FOX ignores her. He knows who he wants to talk to.

                                 FOX 
                        In which particular section of 
                        the speech did the message elude 
                        your Grace?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Well, I have great sympathy with 
                        your sentiments in general, but 
                        fail fully to comprehend how far we 
                        - the Whig party, that is - are 
                        fully committed to the concept of 
                        freedom.

                                 FOX
                        We would like to see the vote 
                        extended...

                                 GEORGIANA
                        To all men...?

                                 FOX 
                        Heavens no. But certainly to more 
                        men. Freedom, in moderation. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        "Freedom in moderation"?

                                 FOX
                            (Pleased with himself)
                        Precisely.

           GEORGIANA nods, then smiles faintly, but mischievously.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I am sure you are full of the 
                        best intentions, Mr. Fox, but I 
                        dare say I would not spend my 
                        vote - assuming I had it - on so 
                        vague a statement. Either one is 
                        free or one is not. The concept 
                        of freedom is an absolute. After 
                        all, one cannot be moderately 
                        dead, moderately loved, or 
                        moderately free. It must always 
                        remain a matter of either or.
           Fox smiles at GEORGIANA in surprise. 

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                            (Cheeky)
                        It is no wonder you are having 
                        such problems at the ballot box.

           GEORGIANA smiles, winningly. Fox scrutinizes her face, not 
           a little shocked but clearly impressed.

           Another well-dressed MAN taps his glass and rises to speak. 
           The room falls silent.

                                 MAN
                        I think it's appropriate to say a 
                        few words...

           The DUKE seems in no mood for another speech, and resolutely 
           gets up and leaves. The entire company, including the MAN 
           about to make a speech, look bewildered at one another.

           GEORGIANA, too, is surprised and doesn’t really know what 
           she should do, so she jumps up and goes after the DUKE.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - AT THE STAIRCASE - NIGHT

           The DUKE is on his way up the staircase. GEORGIANA exits the 
           room behind him, trying to catch up.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        William?

           He turns and looks at her.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        Is anything the matter?

                                 DUKE
                        No...

                                 GEORGIANA
                        You just left?

                                 DUKE
                        Well... I had done eating. And 
                        those damn speeches bore me to 
                        distraction. We have to ban them in 
                        the future.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        But you are the Whigs main 
                        supporter...
                                 DUKE
                        I have no problem with politics, 
                        it’s the rhetoric I can’t stand. 

           The DUKE turns back and continues up the stairs.

                                 GEORGIANA 
                        So...shall I come with you?

                                 DUKE
                        Not at all, why ever should you? 
                        Just go back in and have some fun. 

           The DUKE turns and leaves. GEORGIANA looks at him, bemused.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - BALLROOM - NIGHT

           GEORGIANA re-enters the dining room. The conversation has 
           stopped, everyone fearful their benefactor is aggrieved for 
           some reason.  GEORGIANA walks back to her place. All the 
           men look to her for reassurance. She turns to FOX.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        The Duke is fine. He simply wants 
                        to rest a while.

           People nearby nod. The news quickly makes its way down the 
           table and the conversations resume. FOX looks at her.

                                 FOX
                        Was it the length of the speech 
                        that got the better of the Duke?

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (Wry, flirtatious)
                        Certainly not. He enjoyed it 
                        immensely and expressed a hope that 
                        next time it would be even longer.

           Fox sends her a look. She smiles back at him, reaches out for 
           a drink and takes a long swig. The LADY leans over.

                                 LADY
                        The dress you are wearing is made 
                        of a fascinating fabric, Duchess.

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (Quick off the mark)
                        Thank you. Canton Crepe, a bit 
                        heavier than crepe de chine. 
                        They've developed an entirely new 
                        dyeing technique, which produces 
                        the most incredible nuances...

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - HALL - LATE NIGHT

           Late night, and all the guests have left. GEORGIANA walks 
           through the massive hall where a SERVANT is about to 
           extinguish the candles on the huge candelabra. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Good night, Miss Horsham.

           Surprised to be acknowledged in such a way by her superior, 
           the SERVANT curtsies. GEORGIANA proceeds upstairs.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - HALLWAY OUTSIDE BEDROOM - NIGHT

           GEORGIANA passes quietly down more vast candlelit hallways 
           and staircases in this massive house.

           GEORGIANA walks towards their bedroom. She hears a noise. 
           Then a door opens and a SERVANT GIRL comes running out. She 
           is half naked, carrying her clothes in her arms. She looks at 
           GEORGIANA in alarm, and runs down the corridor in the 
           opposite direction.

           GEORGIANA looks at her, shocked and speechless, as she 
           disappears off into the darkness. Georgiana turns and 
           proceeds toward the bedroom. 

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

           In the bedroom the DUKE is sitting naked on the bed. 
           GEORGIANA stops at a distance.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        What is going on?

                                 DUKE
                        Come over to me.

           There is an empty bottle by the Duke’s side. He is clearly 
           drunk. GEORGIANA approaches, unnerved.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        What have you been doing?

                                 DUKE
                        Nothing to concern you. 

           He smiles at her, kisses her.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Wait, William. I don’t 
                        understand...
                                 DUKE
                        What is there to understand? 

           GEORGIANA is lost for words.

                                 DUKE (CONT'D)
                        You look very beautiful tonight. 
                        Is this dress your design?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Thank you. Yes it is.

                                 DUKE 
                        Then allow me to appreciate it in 
                        more detail.

           The DUKE kisses her breasts and proceeds to remove her 
           clothes. GEORGIANA, with a desire to do the right thing, 
           acquiesces.

           Time has passed. Months. The season has changed from summer 
           to autumn, with wind in the trees and leaves on the ground, 
           which workmen are busy collecting.

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE. DRESSING ROOM - AFTERNOON

           GEORGIANA is designing clothes on a piece of paper, 
           flamboyant dresses with massive trains and headdresses.

           Two MAIDS come in. One holds a newspaper. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Yes?

                                 MAID#1
                        We thought you might like to see 
                        this, your Grace. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Oh? What does it say?

           MAID#1 nods to MAID#2: the one who can read.

                                 MAID#2
                        The conduct of the young, 
                        beauteous and virtuous Duchess of 
                        Devonshire is a pattern worthy of 
                        imitation; and in her dress a 
                        Standard may be expected to be 
                        given to the Fashion.
           GEORGIANA is flattered. She hands her drawings to her MAID.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Thank you, ladies. Would you give 
                        these drawings to the seamstress. 
                        Let’s see what effect they have.

           The MAIDS smile. GEORGIANA then stands up to reveal she is 
           obviously pregnant. She gently strokes her stomach. 

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

           GEORGIANA and the DUKE sit together in a gigantic dining room 
           at a very long table. SERVANTS are discreetly serving food 
           and wine. They eat in silence. 

           A BUTLER emerges to whisper something into the ear of the 
           DUKE. He understands the message and nods.

                                 THE DUKE
                        Send her in...

           The BUTLER exits. GEORGIANA looks at him.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Are we having company?

           The DUKE chews his food and swallows before he replies.

                                 THE DUKE
                        Yes, we are. Don't you think this 
                        mutton has a funny taste?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Not really, no...

                                 THE DUKE
                        Well, I do...

           The BUTLER enters with a NANNY holding a little three-year-
           old girl, CHARLOTTE, by the hand. The girl is very nervous. 
           The DUKE looks at them, then at GEORGIANA.

                                 THE DUKE (CONT'D)
                        This is Charlotte. She will be 
                        staying with us.

           GEORGIANA looks at the little girl who remains absolutely 
           still. Then she looks at the DUKE.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Why...?

           The DUKE signals to the BUTLER that they can leave the room, 
           upon which the BUTLER leads the NANNY and Charlotte out.
                                 THE DUKE
                        Because her mother is dead. She has 
                        no other place to go.

           GEORGIANA looks in disbelief at the DUKE. The penny drops:

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Have you fathered that child?

                                 THE DUKE
                        It's only a little girl, Georgiana, 
                        hardly the end of the world.

           The DUKE sends a suspicious look at the mutton before him. He 
           looks up again, only to find that GEORGIANA is still staring 
           at him. He takes a tiny bite of the mutton, examining its 
           taste as if he suspected poison, during which he continues:

                                 THE DUKE (CONT'D)
                        We have a house full of vacant 
                        rooms, G. She need not bother you. 
                        As a matter of fact, she may even 
                        be of use; you can practice your 
                        motherhood on her...
                            (gesturing at her 
                             stomach)
                        ...until our son arrives.

           GEORGIANA looks at him with vacant eyes as he continues 
           tasting his mutton.

                                 THE DUKE (CONT'D)
                        This certainly doesn't taste like 
                        normal mutton. I am sure something 
                        is the matter with it.

           The DUKE pushes his plate away and smiles at her.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - CHILDREN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

           GEORGIANA pauses outside the room in which the nanny is 
           putting CHARLOTTE to bed for the night. She hears sobbing 
           coming from inside.

           GEORGIANA pushes open the door a little to catch a look at 
           the little girl, not knowing if she dares enter. The NANNY 
           catches sight of her and makes a curtsy.

                                 NANNY
                        Your Grace, I didn't see you.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Would you leave us, please.
           The NANNY looks nervously at GEORGIANA, not knowing whether 
           she ought to leave.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        ...leave us, please...

           The NANNY scurries out of the room. GEORGIANA sits down on 
           CHARLOTTE's bed. CHARLOTTE is hiding her face, still sobbing. 
           She reaches for her doll, as if it was threatened by 
           GEORGIANA's presence and she means to rescue it.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                            (Softly)
                        I am Georgiana. What's your name?

           CHARLOTTE makes no reply. GEORGIANA smiles at her. She can 
           see that she is trembling and gently puts her hand on her 
           shoulder to calm her.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        Shh, there now, you are safe here
                        ...so what do you call your doll?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        ... nothing ...

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Surely, it must have a name. Every 
                        doll must have a name.

           CHARLOTTE stares at her in silence.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        Let us make a deal, then. Tonight 
                        you decide on a name for your doll. 
                        You may choose between any in the 
                        whole wide world, and then, in the 
                        morning, you tell me which one 
                        you've picked.

           Charlotte nods slowly. GEORGIANA rises and turns to leave.

                                 CHARLOTTE (O.S.)
                        Alice.

           GEORGIANA turns back to Charlotte and smiles.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Good night then Alice. And good 
                        night Charlotte. 

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - FOYER - EVENING

           MUSICIANS are playing in the foyer. It’s winter outside and 
           GUESTS arrive in fur coats which they shed at the door.
           GEORGIANA - dressed amazingly - receives people with smiles, 
           and poses as a newspaper sketcher draws her from the corner 
           of the room. Her belly is gigantic - she is in the very last 
           stage of pregnancy. FOX arrives with the flushed and flashy 
           RICHARD SHERIDAN. He looks at her.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        An inch more, and I do believe your 
                        Grace will explode.

                                 FOX
                        Sheridan certainly knows how to pay 
                        a compliment.

           GEORGIANA smiles.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        There are still a few more weeks to 
                        wait.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        I'm starved. Shall we carry you to 
                        the table?

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER

           They walk slowly to the table. FOX detects that GEORGIANA 
           is sweating a bit. 

                                 FOX
                        Are you all right? You are not too 
                        cold, or too hot?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        No no, everything's perfectly all 
                        right...

           FOX smiles at her and once again contemplates the vastness of 
           her belly.

                                 FOX
                        A huge belly has never been more 
                        becoming on anyone.

           GEORGIANA smiles.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        And Fox here offers an expert 
                        opinion, seeing, as he does, a 
                        giant belly every time he passes a 
                        mirror.

           SHERIDAN leans against FOX in affected confidentiality.
                                 SHERIDAN (CONT'D)
                        If your belly were on a woman, we'd 
                        all know what to think.

           FOX leans against SHERIDAN in imitation of his act.

                                 FOX
                        My dear Sheridan, less than an hour 
                        ago, my belly was on a woman - so 
                        now what do you think?

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Touché.

           GEORGIANA delights in the risky repartee.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        That'll teach you to insult Mr. Fox 
                        before we have even sat down.

                                 FOX
                        As a Whig, I cannot blame a man for 
                        speaking the truth. However, your 
                        belly, Duchess, will be gone before 
                        we know it. Mine may remain a 
                        little longer.

           All three laugh. They have reached the table. GEORGIANA 
           sits down. FOX and SHERIDAN sit next to her. Suddenly 
           GEORGIANA stiffens as she feels a sharp pain. She gasps and 
           looks at them in alarm.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Are you certain that you are all 
                        right?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Yes...

           Another dart of pain. GEORGIANA is in anguish.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        I would like to...

           Another shooting pain. By now, FOX, SHERIDAN, and several of 
           the other guests have jumped to their feet to help her out.

           The DUKE notices the turmoil.

                                 DUKE
                        Are those labour pains? My wife is 
                        in labour!

           The DUKE now raises his glass and addresses the guests. He 
           looks genuinely excited.
                                 DUKE (CONT'D)
                        I think this calls for a toast. I 
                        may have an heir before this dinner 
                        is over.

           He toasts. EVERYBODY joins in the toast and some cheer, save 
           those who are helping GEORGIANA out of the room.

           EXT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

           The house is quiet. All the guests have left. A cab arrives 
           and Lady Spencer gets out. She hurries inside.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

           LADY SPENCER steps into the room, still dressed in her cape. 
           A SERVANT follows her and receives her cape.

           The DUKE is sitting in the library, very depressed. LADY 
           SPENCER is shown in.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        Your Grace -

                                 THE DUKE
                        I'm in no mood for conversation, 
                        I’m afraid.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        But, pray tell, is my daughter -

                                 THE DUKE
                        Is your daughter at all able to 
                        give me a son? 

           Beat, as LADY SPENCER takes in the situation and quickly 
           contemplates her response.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        Take heart, your Grace. As long as 
                        the mother is in good health, 
                        consider this mishap a draft, a 
                        promise of what is soon to come. In 
                        our family -

                                 THE DUKE
                        Yes, yes -

           LADY SPENCER stops as the DUKE waves her away, in a gesture 
           which roughly signals that the DUKE appreciates her efforts 
           to comfort him, but is too troubled to talk. LADY SPENCER 
           smiles politely and leaves. 
                                 THE DUKE (CONT'D)
                            (muttering)
                        Hell and damnation ...

           The DUKE puts his head in hands. He is deeply troubled.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           LADY SPENCER enters a big room in which GEORGIANA lies 
           exhausted. She musters a smile as she approaches her 
           daughter.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        Darling, how are you?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Fine.

           LADY SPENCER sends her a warm smile and steps up to look at 
           the baby sleeping in GEORGIANA's arms.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        ...and is she well and healthy?

           GEORGIANA nods and smiles. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        She is perfect.

           LADY SPENCER smiles and looks at the girl.

                                 LADY SPENCER 
                        She looks just like you...

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Did William receive you?

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        Yes.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Was he upset that it wasn't a 
                        son? He just glanced at her 
                        briefly and left.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        It's been a long night for him, 
                        too. Men don't know how to handle 
                        these things, my dear. (Looks at 
                        the baby) Why, she's the 
                        loveliest...

           GEORGIANA looks at the baby with LADY SPENCER, seeming to 
           think that this makes it all worth while. The baby starts 
           to wake up, hungry and crying.
                                 LADY SPENCER (CONT'D)
                        Nurse...

           Lady Spencer gestures to the WET NURSE to come forward 
           which she does, unbuttoning her shirt to feed. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (Firmly)
                        No, I will do it, thank you. 

           The wet nurse looks to Lady Spencer.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        Darling, are you sure...?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Yes, I am her mother after all.

           Georgiana is already starting to feed her hungry baby from 
           her breast, a picture of earthy motherhood in stark 
           contrast to the pomp of her surroundings.

           It’s a busy and affluent London street. There are carriages 
           going either way, and people walking to and fro.

           A carriage pulls up and the GEORGIANA and the DUKE get out.
           People stop to look at her and point. GEORGIANA sends a 
           wave back as the DUKE walks straight on.

           INT. DOCTOR'S SURGERY - DAY

           DR. GRAHAM, a society quack, is meeting with The DUKE and 
           GEORGIANA. He consults a file.

                                 DR. GRAHAM
                        Do either of you have any reason to 
                        believe you cannot birth a male?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        We've no reason to suspect 
                        otherwise.

                                 DUKE
                        Except that we've been going at it 
                        forever with nothing to show for 
                        it. … Four miscarriages, two still 
                        births - both of which were sons - 
                        and one girl …

           GEORGIANA looks down, upset. 
                                 DR. GRAHAM
                        Your Grace, your time usually falls 
                        within the fortnight, is that so?

                            (embarrassed)
                        Yes.

                                 DR. GRAHAM
                        Well. Nature can be a bit 
                        laggardly.  Let us see what science 
                        can accomplish.

           Georgiana looks apprehensive.

           FOUR ASSISTANTS stand behind WIRED-UP COPPER TURBINES, 
           ready to turn the cranks. A STRING QUARTET sits nearby. DR 
           GRAHAM tinkers with the machinery.

           Adjacent to this is a high-chambered room with a COPPER BED 
           in the middle connected to the WIRES with the words BE 
           FRUITFUL, MULTIPLY AND REPLENISH THE EARTH above it.

           GEORGIANA and the DUKE are on the bed, under a sheet, ready 
           to make love. They look nervous and awkward. Outside the 
           room, Dr Graham cues the quartet and assistants. The 
           turbines whirl and the quartet plays a beautiful and 
           haunting Scarlatti tune. Pistons pump and the bed begins to 
           move up and down in rhythm with the music. The music 
           carries over into the following sequences...

           Close up on the face of a three year old girl, HARRYO, 
           sitting in a GILT COACH: ‘science’ has clearly not been 
           successful. HARRYO sits opposite GEORGIANA - now four years 
           older - and between CHARLOTTE, now aged 10, and G (4).

           In the second COACH the DUKE sits alone and in silence, 
           staring out of the windows at the passing countryside. He 
           has also aged four years.

           The music continues...

           A very wide shot of the empty English countryside, with the

           The COACHES clatter past a small country village.  All the 
           LOCALS stand on the side of the road and watch. Small 
           children run with the train, like Third World kids following 
           an aid truck. GEORGIANA leans out of her window and waves to 
           them, touching their hands and saying ‘hello’. 

           The music continues...

           the Royal Crescent, then proceed down a long road with a 
           MASSIVE VILLA at the end of it. Passersby stop and stare.

           The music continues...

                                 DUKE
                        Well.  It'll have to do.  It's only 
                        for a month.

           There’s a hushed ‘wow’ as everyone takes in GEORGIANA’S 
           extraordinary appearance: she wears a HUGE, THREE FOOT 
           ADORNED WIG with an OSTRICH FEATHER inserted into it. She 
           beams at the crowd, the total centre of attention. The Duke 
           looks uncomfortable next to her.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        We come away to Bath to get away

           a smile as his wife disappears into the crowd.

           Leading Whig SIR JAMES HARE addresses the crowd.

                                 SIR JAMES HARE
                        It is always a delight, when one 
                        is on holiday, to request a few 
                        words of wisdom. So without 
                        further ado it is my great honour 
                        to hand over to our distinguished 
                        guest...

           We see the DUKE. Does HARE mean him? 

                                 SIR JAMES HARE (CONT'D)
                        ...the Empress of Fashion herself
                        ...The Duchess of Devonshire.

           There is laughter from the CROWD. GEORGIANA relishes it.

                                 SIR JAMES HARE (CONT'D)
                        When she appears, every eye is 
                        turned towards her; when absent, 
                        she is the subject of universal 
                        conversation; and what we see her 
                        wearing tonight, I look forward 
                        to seeing the rest of you wearing 
                        tomorrow. 

           The CROWD laugh and applaud. The DUKE claps softly. When it's 
           over GEORGIANA stands up:

                                 GEORGIANA 
                        I always appreciate Sir James' 
                        introductions. He has a 
                        jeweller's wit; whenever he turns 
                        a phrase, one finds another 
                        facet. 

           There are chuckles from the CROWD. GEORGIANA, looking 
           confident, strokes the feather in her hair.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        And as he generously suggests, 
                        somebody did indeed ask me 
                        earlier what kind of feather it 
                        is I’m wearing. Well, only two 
                        specimens of this rare species of 
                        bird are known to man. One of 
                        them has clearly ended up on top 
                        of my head. The other, rumour has 
                        it, is running for office in the 
                        Tory party. 

           There is great laughter. The DUKE, jealous perhaps, seems 
           disinterested.
                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        But let me be fair to our friends 
                        on the Opposition, for they have 
                        always known what they believe 
                        in: King’s never wrong, Britain 
                        never fails, the world is ours 
                        for the taking. Their problem is 
                        that these things belong to the 
                        past.

           There are ‘hear hears’ from the room. GEORGIANA looks to 
           the side of the room and sees that the DUKE is now courting 
           a young blushing BEAUTY. He whispers into her ear, and she 
           laughs immoderately. GEORGIANA carries on regardless.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        Us Whigs, however, belong to the 
                        future. We want more respect for 
                        the rights of men and less for 
                        the rights of property. Our 
                        problem is that all the men who 
                        vote own property. 

           EVERYBODY laughs.

           INT. BATH VILLA - BALLROOM - NIGHT

           HIGH TEMPO MUSIC is being played by some MUSICIANS. Many 
           people are dancing energetically on the floor - especially 
           GEORGIANA who is in the middle of a group of admirers: on a 
           high and basking in the attention. 

           GEORGIANA is an expert dancer, moving from one male partner 
           to the next. The CAMERA follows the feather on her head 
           standing high over everyone as she twirls around the room, 
           like a sharks fin jutting out above the water line. 

           All eyes are upon her: COURT REPORTERS in the corner try to 
           sketch it; men look on from the sides with barely disguised 
           sexual interest; women look at her dress, the feather, and 
           then their husbands’ reactions.

           The DUKE, however, stands at the side, pretending only to 
           be half-watching. GEORGIANA is spurred on by his 
           indifference, and as the dancing progresses, she begins to 
           show off and flirt in inverse proportion to it. 

           GEORGIANA then loses herself in the dancing until...She 
           glances up to see the DUKE talking to another prey - a 
           beautiful young woman in a dark dress, BESS FOSTER.

           GEORGIANA now sees BESS evidently rejecting the ducal 
           overtures and leaving the room. 
           Rejection is a new experience for the DUKE, and he is 
           appropriately taken aback, as is GEORGIANA. The DUKE's eyes 
           stay on BESS as she leaves into the next room. GEORGIANA 
           stops dancing.

                                 GEORGIANA 
                            (To her partner)
                        Excuse me...

           GEORGIANA turns and walks away from the DANCERS.

           INT. SALON - NIGHT

           BESS is helping herself to some food from the sideboard. She 
           is about to take a bite of a tart when she sees GEORGIANA, 
           staring.  BESS returns the stare, bites the tart, and chews.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I don't believe we have been 
                        formally introduced?

                                 BESS
                        I haven't, at any rate. Bess 
                        Foster.

           They greet each other.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I saw you in the ballroom.

           BESS nods.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        Why did you decline the Duke's 
                        invitation?

                                 BESS
                        I'm ill at ease with male company 
                        for the moment. Not that I've come 
                        across any real males tonight...

           GEORGIANA laughs. BESS smiles back at her. GEORGIANA looks at 
           BESS, sizing up this beautiful girl.

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (hedges)
                        The Duke is taking the waters for 
                        his gout.

                                 BESS
                        Well it certainly isn't water that 
                        has put him in such a passionate 
                        mood.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Was he? I can't imagine the Duke 
                        being passionate.

                                 BESS
                        Well, that explains.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Explains what?

           GEORGIANA guesses what's to come. BESS barrels on.

                                 BESS 
                            (imitating gossip)
                        "The Duchess of D., married how-
                        many-years and still no son and 
                        heir."

           GEORGIANA is taken aback. People don't speak to her like that
           and she finds it refreshing and attractive. 

                                 BESS (CONT'D)
                        I beg your pardon - no offence.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        None taken.

           GEORGIANA smiles and moves closer to BESS on the sofa. She 
           lowers her voice in a conspiratorial way. It’s almost as if 
           they are flirting with each other.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        Although I had hoped to avoid being 
                        reminded of that. If only tonight.

                                 BESS
                        I apologize. Trust me to say 
                        something silly. I always do, you 
                        know.
                                 GEORGIANA
                        Then perhaps you should have 
                        accepted the Duke's invitation. You 
                        would have gotten on like a house 
                        on fire...

           BESS does not know if she is allowed to laugh. She looks at 
           GEORGIANA and smiles. Then they both laugh. There is a real 
           connection here, two lost people who have found each other.

           The DUKE enters the room, nibbling at a chicken drumstick. He 
           seems to dislike the taste, looks at the drumstick and throws 
           it.

                                 DUKE
                        Too bad... well... Home, I think. 
                        Georgiana.

           He turns to leave, throwing a puzzled look at the drumstick 
           on the floor. GEORGIANA and BESS look at him as he leaves. 
           Then GEORGIANA gets up.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Where are you staying?

                                 BESS
                        I've rented some rooms in town.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        We must meet again.

                                 BESS
                        We must.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT./INT. THE DUKE'S CARRIAGE-NIGHT-LATER

           The DUKE sits on the seat of the carriage. GEORGIANA, 
           however, has to sit on the floor to make room for the ostrich 
           feather that’s still on top of her head.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. GEORGIANA'S BATH VILLA - UPPER HALL -NIGHT - LATER

           GEORGIANA and the DUKE reach the top of the steps. The strain 
           of their relationship shows on them both.

                                 DUKE
                        Goodnight, G.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Goodnight, William.

           They go their separate ways to their separate bedrooms, not
           looking back at each other. The DUKE enters his.
           GEORGIANA lingers, then enters hers. Immediately her public 
           face falls and we can see the pain her marriage is causing 
           underneath. MAIDS appear and begin to take off her clothes
           and make up, beginning with the feather. 

           We remain on GEORGIANA’s face as the bright sounds of young 
           children’s voices fade up until we...

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. BATH PARK - DAY

           GEORGIANA, a NANNY flanking her, is playing chase and 
           running races with her children in the sunshine. It’s free 
           and easy and everyone is laughing and having a good time.

           GEORGIANA steps back to watch the three girls run to a tree 
           and back, and gets her breath back. HARRYO runs and falls.

                                 BESS (O.S.)
                        Up and fall down, up and fall 
                        down. 

           GEORGIANA turns to see BESS standing behind her watching 
           the children play.

                                 BESS (CONT'D)
                        Why can’t we recover like that?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Too far to fall now.

           They smile.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        Hello again.

                                 BESS
                        Hello. [Beat] Your girls are 
                        lovely.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Thank you. Do you have any 
                        children?

                                 BESS
                        I do. Three boys...

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Three boys ... What the Duke 
                        wouldn't give for one of them.

           BESS smiles.

                                 BESS 
                        She is very dark, your eldest.
                                 GEORGIANA
                        Yes. (Makes a decision) Her mother 
                        was dark.  I'm sure you know the 
                        story.

           GEORGIANA looks at BESS. BESS does, but she doesn't speak.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        My husband's daughter was born 
                        before we married.  The mother was 
                        a maid.  The maid died; we took the 
                        child.

                                 BESS
                        I'm sorry, I shouldn't have spoken. 
                        There I go again, talking nonsense.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Never mind.  It's the worst kept 
                        secret in London.  She's nine years 
                        old now.

                                 BESS
                        And...do you love her?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Of course I do, the same as all my 
                        children. They are the only thing 
                        of value in my life.

           BESS smiles, but behind it her own pain shows through.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. BATH - ROMAN BATHS - DAY

           GEORGIANA and BESS walk through the streets and enter a 
           BATH HOUSE.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. BATH - ROMAN BATHS - DAY

           The baths are made up of a whole range of unfortunate 
           people: INCURABLES, RHEUMATICS, GOUT SUFFERERS, those 
           afflicted with RAMPANT ECZEMA and other unsightly SKIN 
           DISEASES. Awful PROVINCIAL MUSICIANS play in the corner.

           GEORGIANA and BESS sit with a cup and saucer in their 
           hands. BESS takes a sniff and recoils.

                                 BESS
                        What’s this?
                                 GEORGIANA
                        Thermal water. It’s the sulphur 
                        that makes it smell so bad.

                                 BESS
                        And you really have to drink it? 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Twice a day for four weeks. Along 
                        with all the women who cannot 
                        give birth... 

           GEORGIANA gestures toward a group of WOMEN, also sipping 
           from teacups.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        ...even to a girl.

           GEORGIANA takes a sip from her cup, grimaces and puts it 
           down. BESS laughs.

           LATER:

           GEORGIANA and BESS undress to get in the water. GEORGIANA 
           is suddenly a little self-conscious taking her clothes off, 
           but BESS is much more open.

           GEORGIANA ducks under the water. BESS joins her.

                                 BESS 
                        There is some financial interest in 
                        a male heir, I take it?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Certainly. Instead of having too 
                        much money as it is, we will have 
                        far too much once the Duke comes 
                        into his full inheritance.

                                 BESS 
                        Money played no part in my marriage 
                        arrangement, but little good it 
                        does me. I married for love. What 
                        Mr. Foster married for I cannot 
                        say. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I grant your husband’s affair is 
                        hurtful, but isn’t this what men 
                        do?

           BESS looks evenly at Georgiana, as if trying to decide to 
           tell her something. 

                                 BESS
                        And what about this?
           BESS lifts her hair to reveal a RED MARK on her NECK. 
           GEORGIANA is shocked, and her hand instinctively reaches 
           out to touch Bess. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        But - he can't do that...

                                 BESS 
                        Well he did...It’s not illegal 
                        for a man to beat his wife with a 
                        stick unless the stick is thicker 
                        than your thumb.

           GEORGIANA is speechless.

                                 BESS (CONT'D)
                        Considering what else he's done to 
                        me, that's not the worst...

                                 GEORGIANA
                        What could possibly be worse...?

                                 BESS
                        He's taken my children. He won't 
                        let me see them.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        But ... how can that happen? What 
                        do you propose to do?

                                 BESS
                        Really, I'm at my wits' end. I 
                        have made some sort of alliance 
                        with a man who will assist me in 
                        abducting them. What I'll do when 
                        he does, I don't know. Live under 
                        an assumed name, I suppose. The 
                        law supports Mr. Foster.

           GEORGIANA is lost in the horror of BESS’s situation. A 
           SERVANT pours more HOT WATER into the bath. Steam rises.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        And in the meantime, where shall 
                        you stay? 

                                 BESS
                        Continue renting I suppose, until 
                        my money runs out.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Well, there at least, I think we 
                        can help.

                                                            CUT TO:
           EXT. DINING ROOM. BATH VILLA - NIGHT

           Georgiana, Bess and the Duke eat. Georgiana and Bess exchange 
           secret glances.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        William? We leave tomorrow. And 
                        Lady Elizabeth is not due to meet 
                        her parents on the continent for 
                        some time. And she hardly visits 
                        London at all.

                                 DUKE
                        Ah. Pity that.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        You see she doesn’t have a place to 
                        stay.

                                 DUKE
                        Oh dear, problem there.

           BESS and GEORGIANA hold their breath. The DUKE glances up. 

                                 DUKE (CONT'D)
                        Well why doesn’t she stay with 
                        us? For a while at least.

           Georgiana and Bess grin like schoolgirls.

           EXT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - DAY

           SERVANTS are lined up outside Devonshire House. A row of 
           carriages stop in front. BESS and GEORGIANA are in one of 
           them. They get out.

           BESS is gazing at the house. GEORGIANA, tickled to have her 
           friend with her, takes her arm and hurries her inside. Unlike 
           GEORGIANA’s first arrival it feels informal, free, excited.

           BESS marvels at the grandiosity of it all. GEORGIANA sweeps 
           through and BESS follows.

                                 BESS
                        This is incredible ...

                        There’s the castle in Ireland, 
                        Bolton Abbey, Chiswick, Burlington -
                        and Chatsworth, of course, which is 
                        much bigger - but this is more like 
                        home.

           BESS laughs. GEORGIANA is climbing up a grand staircase.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        Let me show you your quarters.

           GEORGIANA leads the way down the corridor.

                            (Ironically again)
                        Unfortunately the State Rooms are 
                        reserved solely for the King and 
                        Queen...So this will have to do.

           GEORGIANA opens a door to reveal a bedroom the size of a 
           tennis court with equally massive dressing area. Open 
           double doors reveal BESS’s own drawing room. BESS is 
           suitably impressed. 

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        My husband and I have separate 
                        rooms. You are near to mine.

           They laugh and hug each other close.

           EXT. DRURY LANE THEATER - NIGHT

           A HUGE CRUSH of SOCIAL TYPES -- a wave of the fashionable -- 
           fight their way into the theatre. It's a RED CARPET NIGHT. 
           Many of the women have their hair piled high with an ostrich 
           feather in it.

           GEORGIANA, BESS, and the DUKE cut through the throng.  As 
           people see them - in fact, see GEORGIANA - the CROWD gets in 
           more of a frenzy, with people shouting out and calling her 
           name. FOOTMEN make a path for her through the baying people.

           JOURNALISTS and CARTOONISTS stand off to the side, like 
           paparazzi, sketching.  We see glimpses of their renditions.  
           In them, GEORGIANA's large wig looks even larger.

           Up on a billboard is the title of the play, "’The School 
           for Scandal’, by Richard Sheridan"

           INT. DRURY LANE THEATER -NIGHT

           ON STAGE the performance is in full flow: an argument
           between "Sir Peter Teazle" and "Lady Teazle."  The actors
           are made-up and costumed to look suspiciously like 
           GEORGIANA and The DUKE, and the set is a replica in 
           miniature of the Devonshire House living room. 

                                 ACTOR PLAYING SIR PETER
                        “May all the plagues of marriage 
                        be doubled on me, if ever I try 
                        to be friends with you any more!” 

                                 ACTRESS PLAYING LADY TEAZLE
                        "So much the better"

           IN THEIR BOX the DUKE and GEORGIANA look on, stiff and very 
           separate. There’s a very tense air: the DUKE is looking 
           mortified while GEORGIANA seems to know exactly what’s 
           going on. She looks down at SHERIDAN sitting in the front 
           row, who looks back equally knowingly, and winks at him.

                                 ACTOR PLAYING SIR PETER
                        "No, no madam.: ‘tis evident you 
                        never cared a pin for me, and I 
                        was a madman to marry you."

                                 ACTRESS PLAYING LADY TEAZLE
                        “And I am sure I was a fool to 
                        marry you - an old dangling 
                        bachelor...

           The camera moves into the DUKE. He endures the humiliation 
           with a straight face but his insides are in knots.

                                 ACTRESS PLAYING LADY TEAZLE (CONT'D)

                        because he never could meet with 
                        anyone who could have him.”

           The audience LAUGH LOUDLY and look up to where the DUKE and 
           GEORGIANA are sitting. The DUKE grips his seat.

                                 ACTOR PLAYING SIR TEAZLE
                        Very well, madam! Very well! A 
                        separate maintenance as soon as 
                        you please. Yes, madam, or a 
                        divorce!”

                            (Triumphant)
                        “Agreed! Agreed!”

           The audience laugh and cheer as the curtain comes down.

           Amid the noise, GEORGIANA smiles at FOX in a box across the 
           theatre. Next to him is a handsome YOUNG MAN in his 20s.
           She smiles at them both then looks back to the stage. FOX 
           does the same, but the YOUNG MAN remains gazing at her. 
           GEORGIANA, aware of this, can’t help glancing back.

           After the show. The DUKE is skulking around the edge of the 
           crowd. GEORGIANA and BESS meet with FOX.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Bess. This is Mr. Fox. The Leader 
                        of the Opposition. Mr Fox, Lady 
                        Elizabeth Foster.

           BESS is impressed. They nod at each other. The YOUNG MAN 
           approaches from behind FOX. It is CHARLES GREY, and 
           GEORGIANA can’t take her eyes off him.

                                 FOX 
                        Ah. And here is my protegee, 
                        Charles Grey. 

           BESS nods to both the men. GEORGIANA smiles at GREY.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        A pleasure to meet you, Mr Grey.

                                 GREY 
                        Likewise, Your Grace.

                                 FOX
                        He’s our newest bright young man - 
                        scarcely out of Cambridge and 
                        already a member of Parliament.

           GEORGIANA smiles, quite taken with him. He looks at her 
           too. BESS notices how preoccupied they are with each other. 
           Just then SHERIDAN approaches with open arms. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Your Grace! How we've missed you! 
                        In your absence London has been 
                        reduced to the dreariest province! 
                        Now the season can commence.

           GEORGIANA smiles. She breaks her eyes from GREY’S.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        And this, of course, is the 
                        playwright, Mr. Sheridan. May I 
                        present the Lady Elizabeth.

           SHERIDAN greets BESS. Then, with an apologetic mien at the 
           others, he pulls GEORGIANA away.
                                 SHERIDAN
                        Pardon us. I do not mean to be 
                        rude, but I have an entire cast 
                        dying to meet the Duchess. I shall 
                        return her in a moment, promise.

           SHERIDAN and GEORGIANA leave. BESS watches GREY as GREY 
           watches them go. They pass the DUKE, who has found some 
           consolation in the form of a gauche young GIRL.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Could you relate in any way to the

                        gossip?

           SHERIDAN smiles.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        Were we fair on the Duke? We 
                        didn’t go too far?

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Well it could have been worse. 
                        (Whispers to her) My original 
                        title was "The Bad Marriage."

           A SERVANT enters with a tray of drinks. Everybody helps 
           themselves to one. SHERIDAN produces a bottle of opium.

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT'D)
                        Opium?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Just a drop...

           SHERIDAN pours opium in their drinks. A few of the actors and 
           actresses have a drop too.

                                                     CUT TO:

           BESS standing near the WINGS.

           She watches GEORGIANA surrounded by admirers, laughing, 
           charming them all.  Then she looks at the DUKE, who now sits 
           very close to the young GIRL. GREY comes up to her with a 
           drink. BESS takes it.
                                 GREY
                        Infantile atmosphere, isn't it?

                                 BESS
                        Well, it's ... certainly not what 
                        I’m used to. 

                                 GREY
                        It's quite a feat to get through 
                        all the conversations and still 
                        remain sober.

           GREY raises his glass and smiles at her. BESS raises hers. 

                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                        What does Her Grace make of it 
                        all?

                                 BESS
                        In truth I think Her Grace may be 
                        tiring of Society. Her real 
                        passion lies in politics.

           BESS gives GREY a cheeky look to make sure the innuendo is 
           not lost on him.

                                 GREY
                            (Very interested)
                        Really...

           They both observe GEORGIANA talking animatedly on the 
           stage, a crowd around her and loving the attention. Then 
           they spot the DUKE, who has cornered his prey against a 
           wall. GREY cannot believe what he is seeing.

                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                        Is it always like this?

                                 BESS
                        Well, as they say, the Duke of 
                        Devonshire must be the only man in 
                        England not in love with his wife.

           GREY takes this in as he watches the DUKE and GEORGIANA.

           two teenage girls after a night’s clubbing.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Were you at all able to forget 
                        things and enjoy yourself?
                                 BESS

                                 GEORGIANA
                        My dear Bess. He's just a boy.

                                 BESS
                        No, he's not.

           GEORGIANA looks at her, thinks. BESS smiles.

                        Can't you tell by the way he looks 
                        at you? He wants to touch you. 
                        Honestly, can't you tell?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Stop it, please.

                                 BESS
                        Georgiana. Procreation is not just 
                        about offspring. In fact, it can be 
                        quite nice.

                        Try to close your eyes ... and 
                        envision Grey slowly opening your 
                        dress ... and kissing your back.

           GEORGIANA starts to giggle. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Oh, please, they never do such 
                        things...

                                 BESS
                        Oh yes they do.
           BESS gets up and lies behind GEORGIANA. GEORGIANA looks a 
           little nervous about this.

                                 BESS (CONT'D)
                        Close your eyes...Grey is behind 
                        you....slowly opening your 
                        dress...

           BESS pulls back part of GEORGIANA’s clothing to reveal her 
           shoulder. BESS begins to kiss it.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Bess, stop.

                                 BESS
                            (Firmly)
                        ...close your eyes....kissing 
                        your back...

           GEORGIANA relents and closes her eyes. BESS continues to 
           kiss her back. Suddenly GEORGIANA goes silent, a look of 
           real surprise on her face: she is experiencing sensations 
           she never knew even existed. 

           Bess continues, soft but in charge, as they both allow 
           themselves to become lost in the erotically charged moment:

           GEORGIANA lets out little gasps of pleasure...

           BESS pushes it further... 

           Her hands explore under GEORGIANA’S nightclothes...

           Over her breasts... 

           The tops of her legs...

           GEORGIANA gasps again, a realisation that parts of her body 
           could give such pleasure...

           BESS tugs GEORGIANA’S hair back a little... 

           Her hands reach further...

           GEORGIANA closes her eyes...

                                 BESS (CONT'D)
                            (Whispers)
                        There...see... 

           BESS stops what she’s doing. Beat. They both breathe 
           heavily, the sexual tension and arousal hanging heavy in 
           the air. They are a little embarrassed, scared even of what 
           might happen if they carried on, and for a moment it seems 
           that is what they might well do...
           But BESS gets up and walks to the window as GEORGIANA 
           readjusts her clothes. They regain composure and try to 
           carry on as if nothing has really happened.

                                 BESS (CONT'D)
                        In the play this evening, there 
                        was a scene in which Lady Teazle 
                        and Mr. Surface discuss their 
                        affair. They acknowledge that 
                        once a lady of good standing has 
                        provided her husband with a son 
                        then she may take a lover.

           GEORGIANA takes it in.

                                 BESS (CONT'D)
                        Be ready, dear G, when the time 
                        comes. 

           After what’s just happened - and from the look on 
           GEORGIANA’s face - she clearly can’t wait.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - GEORGIANA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           GEORGIANA undresses and goes to bed. She lies in the dark, 
           eyes wide open, thinking. This image is held as the sound 
           of a haunting operatic voice - accompanied by harp - starts 
           over it and carries us into the next scene. 

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. DERBYSHIRE - DAY

           The music continues as we dissolve to an aerial shot of 
           dramatic Derbyshire countryside rushing fast beneath us. A 
           title reads: Chatsworth Estate.

           The shot develops as it passes over the 35000 acres of land 
           that belong to the DUKE - from HILLS to FIELDS to LAWNS to 
           GARDENS and finally a huge country house. SWARMS of COUNTRY 
           PEOPLE, MEN on HORSES and TENANTS surround it.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. CHATSWORTH - DAY

           Massive amounts of food are laid out on trestle tables with 
           white table cloths. The singing and harp continue, and we 
           find that AN OPERA singer - with GEORGIANA on harp - 
           perform beautifully, perfectly, to a grand outdoor picnic.

           CLOSE ON GEORGIANA as she plays: eyes closed, passionate.
           We see the DUKE and BESS standing together with FOX and GREY 
           at the rear of the audience. To one side stands LADY SPENCER. 

           The music ends. GEORGIANA and SINGER bow to APPLAUSE.

           MINUTES LATER:

           The harp is being carried back inside by FOUR SERVANTS.

           GEORGIANA works her way through the ORDINARY PEOPLE and 
           TENANTS, making them feel welcome and urging them to eat. 
           She walks up to LADY SPENCER and embraces her. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Hello Mama.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                            (Coolly)
                        Hello my dear.

           BESS comes over too.

                                 BESS
                        We’re so glad you were able to 
                        visit, Lady Spencer. 

           LADY SPENCER looks hurt.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        Are ‘we’ really? 

                                 BESS
                        Yes, G speaks of you all the 
                        time. 

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        Well that is nice to hear. My 
                        daughter’s letters have become so 
                        short of late that finally they 
                        do not exist at all. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I do apologise Mama. It is merely 
                        a reflection of my current state 
                        of happiness... 

                                 LADY SPENCER
                            (Cutting across)
                        I only know what she is up to by 
                        reading the gossip columns of the 
                        Morning Post.

           GEORGIANA is stung by this. The DUKE wanders up behind.

                                 DUKE
                        Me too.
                                 LADY SPENCER 
                        And how long do you intend to 
                        stay on Lady Elizabeth?

                                 BESS
                        Please, ‘Bess’. I don’t know. I’m 
                        sure I’ve worn out my welcome
                        already.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Nonsense.

                                 DUKE
                        Lady Elizabeth is free to stay 
                        with us for as long as she likes.

           LADY SPENCER is left open-mouthed, a little alarmed at how 
           close they all seem. FOX and some WHIGS come forward. 
           GEORGIANA turns from her mother and smiles broadly.

                                 GEORGIANA 
                        Who let these radicals through 
                        the gates of Chatsworth?

                                 FOX
                        No one lets us in anywhere! 
                        That’s why we’re radicals!

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. A HILLSIDE ABOVE THE PICNIC AREA - LATER

           At the bottom of the hill, the DUKE leads a SHOOTING PARTY of 
           men with rifles. Ahead of them GAMEKEEPERS walk through the 
           trees, banging them with sticks to rouse the birds. The first 
           Grouse flies above the trees and a shot rings out.

           Down by a river GEORGIANA leads a group on a walk with 
           SHERIDAN, BESS, GREY.  They have come upon the ruins of an 
           OLD FARMHOUSE. The distant gunshots echo in the background.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        What's this?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        One of the old farm houses.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Hideous. Reminds me of Ireland.

           The crowd moves on. GEORGIANA is left with GREY.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I wanted to make it over into a 
                        school for the tenants' children, 
                        but the Duke was unresponsive.
                                 GREY
                        The Duke prefers ruin?

           GEORGIANA turns to see GREY is the only one left near her. 
           She starts to stroll, but her smile invites him to follow. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        It is his property.

                                 GREY
                        Perhaps then His Grace should be 
                        divested of such troublesome 
                        possessions. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (Provocatively)
                        What an interesting idea.

           GREY, encouraged by her double meaning, continues.

                                 GREY
                        I despise the fact that so few men 
                        have so much power - and that they 
                        mismanage it so appallingly.

           GEORGIANA smiles at him.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        So you agree with the French?

           He returns her smile.

                                 GREY
                        Yes, except I believe in reform, 
                        not revolution...That a man ought 
                        not to be governed by laws in the 
                        framing of which he had no voice.

           GEORGIANA looks impressed. She realizes how close they're 
           standing. She moves away a few feet.

                                 GEORGIANA 
                        We’re lagging behind...

           GEORGIANA starts to walk. GREY look at her, disappointed and 
           a bit taken aback. He starts toward the rest of the group.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. THE LAWN BEHIND THE HOUSE - DAY - LATER

           GEORGIANA sits against a tree, sipping a cordial, all the 
           while watching GREY in conversation with some men. BESS 
           approaches GEORGIANA.
                                 BESS
                        Whatever is the matter with you? 
                        Your behaviour is so out of the 
                        ordinary.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I just feel like keeping to myself 
                        today...

           BESS sits down beside her, leaning close and intimate. They 
           look at the men, GREY at the centre, then look at each 
           other. BESS smiles broadly. GEORGIANA blushes. BESS digs 
           GEORGIANA playfully and gently in the ribs. They giggle 
           like schoolgirls. 

           GEORGIANA looks up to see LADY SPENCER is watching, a 
           disapproving expression on her face.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. SITTING ROOM. CHATSWORTH - LONG AFTER DINNER.

           A VIOLINIST is playing beautifully in the corner.

           The GUESTS are engaged in a range of activities: some 
           listen to the music, some gamble at gaming tables, some 
           gather around the fireside, drinking and talking. The DUKE 
           and FRIENDS are playing billiards and smoking.

           LADY SPENCER and GEORGIANA are walking through. Across from 
           them BESS is talking to a circle of people.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                            (Hushed)
                        But you have only known her three 
                        months! 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Bess is my friend! She brings the 
                        best out in me...

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        She certainly brings something 
                        out in you, but I would be hard 
                        pushed to say it were the best.

                                 GEORGIANA 
                        It may pain you to recognise it 
                        Mama, but a great change has come 
                        over my life and its name is Lady 
                        Elizabeth Foster...about whom it 
                        can be truly said I have at long 
                        last found my other self.

           LADY SPENCER’s pulse races. She wants to interject.
                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        I understand if that may make you 
                        feel a little jealous.

           LADY SPENCER stops.

                                 LADY SPENCER 
                            (Fierce whisper)
                        This is a dangerous path of life 
                        to choose my girl. You have begun 
                        to cavort so constantly in public 
                        you cannot live for your own 
                        soul. It is no surprise you are 
                        gathering weeds instead of 
                        flowers. 

           GEORGIANA is stunned, like a little girl cut dead by her 
           mother for showing off. LADY SPENCER turns on her heels and 
           walks off leaving GEORGIANA fuming inside.

           A LITTLE WHILE LATER:

           GEORGIANA, a rebellious look on her face, takes a drink 
           from a BUTLER. She then looks at LADY SPENCER - who is 
           talking to a group of stuffy aristocrats - and heads toward 
           GREY who is among a group of MEN. As he sees GEORGIANA he 
           excuses himself from the conversation and meets her.

                        Your Grace...

                                 GEORGIANA 
                        Mr Grey, I have been thinking. 
                        The national election is in six 
                        weeks, yes? How is the campaign 
                        going?

                                 GREY
                        Terribly. Our only hope is to 
                        save Westminster for Fox.

           GEORGIANA smiles. There’s a mischievous sparkle in her eye. 

                                 GEORGIANA 
                        Well, I have many faults as you 
                        may know, not least among them is 
                        my ability to draw attention.
                        Perhaps we could use that to our 
                        advantage...

           A WIDE VIEW of the GREAT CITY at the end of the 18th century.

           EXT. GROSVENOR SQUARE - DAY

           GEORGIANA stands on a platform dressed in the most 
           outrageous costume yet, her hair piled three foot high 
           above her head and decorated with Whig-coloured ribbons. In 
           front is a HUGE SEATED CROWD. Banners proclaim WHIGS, VOTE 
           FOX. JOURNALISTS mill around, scribbling into notebooks and 
           sketching GEORGIANA. In the crowd, women are fanning 
           themselves with fans bearing Georgiana’s likeness. The DUKE 
           is sat to one side.

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (Shouts to the crowd)
                        Ladies and Gentlemen. I give you 
                        a man who will inform us of the 
                        work we must do and the party we 
                        so believe in! Sir Charles Grey!

           APPLAUSE as GREY moves to take the stage.  GEORGIANA and 
           GREY exchange a look as he positions himself.

                                 GREY
                        I am here in Westminster to speak 
                        on behalf of our candidate Sir 
                        Charles Fox...

           APPLAUSE.

                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                        Well, I wish only to address a  
                        single issue. Power. 

           GEORGIANA looks at GREY, clearly proud of him. 

                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                        The basis of power in our country 
                        is land, as it has been for 
                        centuries. And the aristocracy 
                        owns nearly all of it...

           There are a few laughs from the CROWD. GREY can’t help but 
           look over at the DUKE - is this speech directed at him? 

                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                        ...along with all the places in 
                        the Government, control of the 
                        House of Commons, Ambassadors, 
                        Governors, Judges, and a host of 
                        other posts too numerous to 
                        mention. They levy what taxes 
                        they think proper and pass what 
                        laws their self interest dictate. 
                        They maintain this influence and 
                        affluence by transferring their 
                        land intact, generation after 
                        generation.

                        And in so doing continue to 
                        dominate English life.

           GREY stops to look at the faces of the PUBLIC looking back 
           at him. They are with him. The DUKE, unsurprisingly, isn’t.

                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                        So, if we win this election, if we
                        get the power we seek, what will we 
                        do with it? Assign the old 
                        patronage positions? Bilk the 
                        treasury like the ones who came 
                        before us?

           GREY’s listeners are quiet. GREY proceeds.

                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                        Will we master the art of 
                        compromise? Of killing a good bill 
                        in a bad committee? Of postponing 
                        the greater good for the greater 
                        advantage? Will we do that?
                            (Long pause)
                        No. We won’t. Because we believe 
                        in the words we’ve spoken...

           A few scattered ‘hear hears’ begin. 

                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                        ...and we have faith in the hearts 
                        we’ve stirred.

           More ‘HEAR HEARS’. GREY’s rhetoric takes flight.

                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                        The world is on the brink of 
                        disaster or salvation. From 
                        France to America, men and women 
                        are struggling to free themselves 
                        and find meaning in their 
                        existence. Change is upon us.

           Loud calls of ‘YES’ and applause.

                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                        We shall not return to the old 
                        ways! We shall not shirk our 
                        promises and our duties! We shall 
                        take England into this brave new 
                        world and shake the thunder from 
                        the skies! This we vow!

           APPLAUSE. CHEERS. GEORGIANA gazes at GREY. GREY looks at 
           her, flushed and excited. She blushes like mad. BESS sees 
           this. So does the DUKE, who has got up and is on his way to 
           his carriage.

           INT. COVENT GARDEN HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

           GREY stands alone.  GEORGIANA enters and shuts the door.  

                                 GREY
                        How did I do? 

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (Trying to hide her 
                             feelings)
                        I think it was not an 
                        embarrassment.

           Grey’s face crumbles in disappointment. GEORGIANA grins.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        It was a marvel.

           GREY smiles. A big open, boyish smile of relief.

                                 GREY
                        But did you agree with what I said?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Every word. 

           GREY gains self-confidence. He approaches GEORGIANA.

                                 GREY
                        I was jittery. Your presence 
                        trebled the numbers at least. 

           GREY is now very close indeed. GEORGIANA feels the effect 
           of it. She becomes short of breath. GREY speaks softly.

                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                        I am jittery even now...

           GEORGIANA knows that she ought to keep a distance, but 
           remains where she is.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        So am I.

           She stares at him, then withdraws a little.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        We ought to join the company. We 
                        must all go and celebrate.

           GEORGIANA makes for the door. GREY remains standing.

                                 GREY
                        ..and the Duke?

           She turns and looks at him, flushed and exuding desire. 
                                 GEORGIANA
                        He has taken refuge in his club.

           INT. GAMING HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

           The rooms are full of GAMBLERS, drinking and letting off 
           steam. It has a decadent, opulent and smoky atmosphere. 

           GEORGIANA sits at a packed FARO TABLE. GREY stands behind 
           her, SHERIDAN sits to one side and FOX to the other. The 
           conversation runs fast and easy.

                                 DEALER
                        Another wager?

                                 SHERIDAN
                        I’m out. My funds have run dry 
                        and I’ve no one left to borrow 
                        from.

                                 GREY
                        Maybe it would be different if 
                        people thought you had the 
                        slightest intention of paying 
                        them back?

                                 SHERIDAN 
                        One should never give money to 
                        one’s creditors, dear boy. It 
                        only encourages them.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Is there no one in London not in 
                        debt?

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Just the poor.

           They all laugh. FOX pushes three chips into the centre of 
           the table. 

                                 GEORGIANA 
                        Got to risk more than that. Not 
                        worth winning if you don’t.

           GEORGIANA and FOX stare at each other for a beat. Then 
           GEORGIANA pushes all her chips to the centre. A YOUNG LORD
           matches GEORGIANA’S bet with his chips. The DEALER deals. 
           GEORGIANA turns an ace. YOUNG LORD, a club.

                                 DEALER
                        Her Grace wins again.
           GEORGIANA shrieks with pleasure. The CHIPS are raked to 
           her. YOUNG LORD is stricken but immediately places a new 
           bet. GEORGIANA downs her cordial and smiles at GREY. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        I’ll never know how you drink so 
                        much and remain standing.

           GEORGIANA, GREY, FOX, SHERIDAN, and others emerge from the 
           gambling house. High spirits abound, and they’re all a 
           little worse for wear. There’s LAUGHTER, AD-LIBS. 

           A VALET opens the door to GEORGIANA's waiting carriage. She 
           addresses all her admirers.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Time to go home.

                            (Equally ironically)
                        My husband will be waiting. 

           GEORGIANA and GREY make eye contact - a tad too long.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                            (Back to Fox)
                        And you usually drink the port all 
                        by yourself, anyway.

           PEOPLE laugh. 

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        I'll be seeing you, gentlemen.

           GEORGIANA addresses to all of them but shares a last look 
           with GREY before getting into her carriage.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT

           GEORGIANA sits in the carriage, submerged in alcohol-fuelled 
           thought. She smiles to herself and gazes out the window. They 
           drive by the Thames, and she looks across the river. 
           GEORGIANA taps on the side of the carriage.
                                 GEORGIANA
                        Make a stop here, please...

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. LONDON BY THE THAMES - NIGHT

           GEORGIANA gets out. The coachman and the servant look at her.

                                 SERVANT
                        Is anything the matter, your Grace?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Nothing at all. It's just such a 
                        beautiful night. I want to enjoy it 
                        for a little while.

           They nod. GEORGIANA moves slightly unsteadily away from the 
           carriage and goes to the railing at the embankment. Here she 
           stops and contemplates the sight of the city.

           Other carriages pass. Among them is CHARLES GREY's. He spots 
           GEORGIANA's parked carriage and notices her standing outside 
           with her back turned to him. His carriage stops. GEORGIANA is 
           lost in thought as he very quietly draws near.

                                 GREY
                        Your Grace?

           GEORGIANA turns and looks at him. She smiles.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Are you following me?

                                 GREY
                        No, I saw you standing here. Is all 
                        well?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Yes ... I didn't feel like going 
                        home after all.

                                 GREY
                        You shouldn't be here in the middle 
                        of the night. It isn't safe.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Even thieves must sleep.

                                 GREY
                        Yes, but not at this hour, I'm 
                        afraid.

           GEORGIANA sends him a little smile. Then she turns to look at 
           the city again. The alcohol has emboldened her.
                                 GEORGIANA
                        Do you ever think of me when we are 
                        not together?

                                 GREY
                            (surprised)
                        You ought to know I do... of you 
                        more than anything else.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        You hesitated before replying ...

                                 GREY
                        I am unused to being asked so 
                        directly, and by you of all people. 

           GREY walks close. He very gently puts his hand on hers. She 
           looks down at his hand, then up at him, blushing a little.

                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                            (whispering)
                        I think of you every day.

           They look lovingly at one another. GEORGIANA is just about 
           to reward GREY's candour with a confession of her feelings 
           when the sight of the coachman and the servant - joined now 
           with GREY's coachman - brings her to remember herself. She 
           withdraws her hand.

           GREY nods. GEORGIANA returns to her carriage, never taking 
           her eyes off GREY, who remains on the bridge.

           GEORGIANA turns away only when GREY disappears from her view, 
           excited by the rush of early love.

           GEORGIANA enters. Silence. She races across the vast space.

           GEORGIANA, makes her way quickly down the hall.  She 
           approaches the door to BESS's room.

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (Hushed whisper)
                        Bess.

           She stops. She can hear BESS and the DUKE having sex - her 
           husband and her best friend. And it’s not the kind she has 
           with him: it’s passionate, energetic, enjoyable. For a while, 
           she is paralyzed. Then she moves away and down the hall.

           INT. THE DUKE'S BEDROOM - DAWN - HOURS LATER

           THE DOOR opens and the DUKE enters, stealthily.  The sun is 
           just pouring GRAY LIGHT into the room.  He closes the door 
           very softly and then turns to see...

           GEORGIANA sitting on his bed.  She looks ashen.

                                                     CUT TO:

           THE SAME. AN HOUR LATER.

           GEORGIANA paces. The DUKE sits on the bed, caught. It is 
           difficult to see if he is actually ashamed, but he is 
           listening patiently to GEORGIANA.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Of all the women in England, you 
                        had to throw yourself upon her. I 
                        have not objected once to any of 
                        your affairs, I have accepted 
                        whatever arrangement you have 
                        proposed, I have raised Charlotte 
                        as my own daughter, but this... I 
                        have one single thing of my own... 
                        why couldn't you let me keep 
                        Elizabeth for myself?

           We see a distraught BESS listening at the door.

                        What kind of man are you?!

           GEORGIANA is raging at him.

                                 GEORGIANA 
                        She is all I have to cling to! She 
                        is my sole comfort in this house, 
                        in our marriage.

           The DUKE patiently hears her out.

           BESS's eyes are filled with tears.

                                 GEORGIANA (O.S./CONT'D)
                        You have robbed me of my only 
                        friend!

           GEORGIANA pauses, nearly spent. Then she finally challenges 
           the DUKE, more imploring than angry.

                                 GEORGIANA 
                        What is wrong with me? Why have you 
                        never loved me?!

                                 DUKE
                            (simple, exhausted 
                             clarity)
                        I do not claim to be a man of 
                        depth or complexity, G, but I 
                        have always known what I expect 
                        from this marriage and what I am 
                        prepared to give. 

           GEORGIANA doesn’t reply.

                                 DUKE (CONT'D)
                        You, it seems, have hoped for 
                        something else, something more. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        She has to go! Now! She is never to 
                        set foot in this house again!

                                 DUKE
                            (Hackles rising)
                        Do mind your temper, G. You are 
                        quite forgetting yourself.
                                 GEORGIANA
                        I want her out! I never want to lay 
                        eyes on her again! Go down and tell 
                        her to leave at once!

                                 DUKE
                        I couldn't ask her that. I won't do 
                        it, G.

           The door swings open - BESS jumps aside - and GEORGIANA 
           comes crashing out of the sitting room, furious.  GEORGIANA 
           storms down the hall, followed by BESS.

                                 BESS
                        Georgiana--!

                                 GEORGIANA
                        You have taken yourself from me!

                                 BESS
                        Please --!

                                 GEORGIANA
                        You don't love me!

                                 BESS
                        I do love you, Georgiana. Really I 
                        do.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        No!  Love is an act! It is more 
                        than words and undying oaths! It's 
                        what you do! I loved you! You only 
                        said you did. 

           BESS is stung. Her eyes fill with tears.

                                 BESS
                        ...I do love you. But ...

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Leave. Get out of this house!

           BESS remains standing, reaches out for GEORGIANA. 

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        Leave!!! (breaks down, cries out) 
                        Get out!!!
           BESS leaves the room. GEORGIANA sinks slowly to the floor, 
           weeping, sobbing.

           GEORGIANA sits, like a little girl, back at home and 
           surrounded by portraits of her as a child. A MANSERVANT 
           pours tea, slowly, meticulously, from a silver Samovar. It 
           seems to take for ages. LADY SPENCER can’t wait to get 
           talking. Finally the MANSERVANT finishes and leaves.

                                 LADY SPENCER 
                        I did not like her from the first.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        You’ve made that quite clear, Mama.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        She is gone from Devonshire House, 
                        I hope.

           GEORGIANA looks away, ashamed. 

                                 LADY SPENCER (CONT'D)
                        They're living there together?  
                        Georgiana, what have you permitted 
                        to happen?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I don’t know! Won't you please just 
                        help me! Tell me what to do, Mama!

           GEORGIANA hangs her head. LADY SPENCER surveys her daughter 
           and the mess she's in.  Her demeanor softens.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        You must write William and insist 
                        he send her back to whatever horrid 
                        little place she came from.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        He will not. It is out of the 
                        question, he says.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        Then you must return and resume 
                        your duties. Make him realize 
                        whom he loves. You will give up 
                        your politics, your nights on the 
                        town. For once you will devote 
                        yourself as a loving wife and 
                        settle down to the task at hand: 
                        providing him with an heir. And 
                        then he will soon tire of her.
           GEORGIANA looks at her mother with sadness.

                        Hello, G. ...

           GEORGIANA walks down the corridor. BESS meets her with an 
           apologetic demeanour. GEORGIANA is cold as ice. She passes 
           her without even a look.

           BESS quietly enters GEORGIANA's room.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I may not have the authority to 
                        remove you from this house, but I 
                        can at least order you out of my 
                        room.

                                 BESS
                        Won't you please let me explain?

           GEORGIANA becomes furious and shouts at BESS.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        There is nothing to explain. I 
                        trusted you, I made you my 
                        confidante, and you repaid me by 
                        stealing what is mine.
                                 BESS
                        We do what we have to do.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        How true. And now you have to 
                        leave.

                                 BESS
                        I know you may find it hard to 
                        believe, but you can still trust 
                        me.

           GEORGIANA walks to the door and opens it.

                        This is my only chance of ever 
                        seeing my children again. William

                        England. He is my only chance.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        There are limits to the sacrifices 
                        one makes to see one's children.

           BESS looks her in the eye.

                                 BESS
                        No, there aren't. No limits 
                        whatsoever.

           GEORGIANA takes in what she just said, before letting 
           animosity get the better of her once again and turning away.

                                 BESS (CONT'D)
                        Give me a chance to show you that 
                        you can trust me... Please... 
                        Please.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Get out of here. We have no more to 
                        say to each other.

           BESS leaves, closing the door silently behind her. GEORGIANA 
           punches walls and cupboards, throwing things around the room.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE. GEORGIANA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

           GEORGIANA is still asleep in her bed. She is awakened by the 
           sound of a carriage outside. She goes to the window.

                                                     OUTSIDE:

           The DUKE's CARRIAGE pulls up the front door. AUGUSTUS, JOHN, 
           and HARRY emerge from the carriage.
           BESS shrieks with joy and leaps out of the house. She runs 
           and hugs them, crying. It’s incredibly touching and GEORGIANA 
           is moved, despite herself.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - LIBRARY - DAY

           GEORGIANA comes downstairs. Unseen, she looks into the 
           library and watches the DUKE getting AUGUSTUS a hunting 
           rifle from the wall. The DUKE appears surprisingly keen, 
           gentle even. He clearly relates to boys. To one side BESS 
           holds a sleeping HARRY. 

           GEORGIANA stares on in silence, understanding the DUKE and 
           BESS in a way she has never done before. They look like a 
           quiet, functional family unit. 

           GEORGIANA quietly comes closer. The DUKE is now showing 
           AUGUSTUS how to use the rifle.

                                 DUKE
                        ...hold it like that, it won't come 
                        back at you.

                                 AUGUSTUS
                        Yes, I see.

                                 DUKE
                        Good. Your father doesn't hunt, I 
                        take it.

                                 AUGUSTUS
                        No.

                                 DUKE
                        Oh dear. Well, we can soon make up 
                        for that.

           AUGUSTUS smiles, as does BESS. The DUKE looks up, and seeing 
           her approval does a rare thing: he smiles too. BESS gets up 
           and brings the DUKE a drink. He strokes her hand. GEORGIANA 
           moves away and leaves. 

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. VAUXHALL PLEASURE GARDENS - DAY

           The fashionable and wealthy stroll up and down the park.
           GEORGIANA walks with GREY under the trees in a secluded 
           part. GEORGIANA seems preoccupied. GREY, however, is simply 
           excited about them meeting again. 
                                 GREY
                            (Hushed voice)
                        Did you tell the Duke who you 
                        were meeting?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        No.

                                 GREY
                        Did he ask?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        No. 

           GREY pauses for a moment.

                                 GREY
                        Good.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        He has other things on his mind.

           GREY stops and scrutinises GEORGIANA. He can tell that she 
           is not truly present. 

                                 GREY
                        As do you.

           The direct recognition causes GEORGIANA to stop too, and 
           then look away.

                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                            (Softer now)
                        Would it help to unburden 
                        yourself?

           GEORGIANA sends him a little smile and a shake of the head.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        It is nothing I can discuss with 
                        you. Besides, it would only bore.

                                 GREY
                        You don't have to please others all 
                        the time.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I was brought up to. It's a 
                        difficult lesson to unlearn. 

                                 GREY
                        Would you permit me an 
                        observation?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Of course.
                                 GREY
                        I think you do it so that people 
                        will love you.

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (looks deeply at him)
                        What would make you think that?

                                 GREY
                        From what I have seen. With your 
                        husband, your friends - especially 
                        Lady Bess. Even the press and the 
                        public, you want them to too.

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (looks away)
                        I have never thought of it that 
                        way. You make me sound pitiable.

           GEORGIANA turns and walks away, upset. GREY realizes he has 
           gone too far. He chases up with her.

                                 GREY 
                        I've gone beyond my brief.  I 
                        apologize.  Please believe it was 
                        only for your sake I spoke. 

           GEORGIANA looks at him, and then carries on walking slowly, 
           thinking deeply. Grey moves closer to her again.

                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                        Please tell me what is wrong.

           She turns and looks at him intensely.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I fear I have met some people too 
                        late in life and some too early.

           They stare at each other a moment. The wind blows gently in 
           the leaves of the trees above them.

                                 GREY
                        No, you haven’t.

           Slowly, GREY moves to GEORGIANA.  The air is thick. GREY gets 
           closer. They kiss. Not for long, but a gentle, warm kiss. 
           Then he withdraws. GEORGIANA is blushing. 

                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                        I have waited all my life for that 
                        kiss.

           GEORGIANA averts her eyes, and looks confused. He loses his 
           composure a bit.
                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                        I'm sorry ...

                                 GEORGIANA
                        No. It's...

           She looks up at him again.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        I have never been kissed like that 
                        before.

           They stand and look at each other. Then they move closer, for 
           another kiss. Gentle. And longer, this time.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE SITTING ROOM - MORNING

           GEORGIANA is with BESS and the DUKE. She seems sober, 
           together and strong: fortified. They sit opposite each other 
           at the table as if in negotiation. A long silence.  Then:

                                 GEORGIANA
                        All right.

           Beat.  The DUKE looks at BESS.  What does she mean?

                                 DUKE
                        "All right..?"

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Do you love each other?

                                 DUKE
                        Georgiana -

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Do you love Bess, William?

                                 DUKE
                        ... Well ... I ... where is all 
                        this leading? I mean...

                                 BESS
                        I make no demands on him.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        ...And Bess, you love William?

                                 BESS
                        ... As I do you.

           GEORGIANA nods, still not giving anything away.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        You intend to stay?
                                 BESS
                        ... William asked that I do.

           GEORGIANA nods.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        And you couldn't find it in your 
                        powers to refuse him.

                                 BESS
                        ...No.

           BESS and the DUKE remain quiet. Beat. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Then let us make a deal.

                                 DUKE
                        A deal?

           Beat.  The DUKE and BESS exchange glances.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Yes. I give you my blessing if you 
                        will accept my feelings for Charles 
                        Grey.

           BESS blinks, taken aback. GEORGIANA is nervous.  She smiles, 
           waiting for The DUKE's reaction.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        I wasn't sure at first, I thought 
                        perhaps it was a dalliance or  ... 
                        But it isn't.  He can make me 
                        happy.

           BESS tries to manage a smile.  She darts a look at the DUKE, 
           who now stands. Suddenly cutlery and crystal jangle.  BESS 
           and GEORGIANA start.

                                 DUKE
                            (seething with fury)
                        A deal! A deal!! I don't make 
                        deals! I'm in charge of it all!! I 
                        would call him out!  I would 
                        challenge him! I would put a bullet 
                        in his head--!

                                 BESS
                        William--!

                                 DUKE
                            (to BESS)
                        Be quiet!
                            (to GEORGIANA)
                        Are you determined to make me a 
                        total laughing stock? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DUKE (CONT'D)
                        A man who cannot sire a son and 
                        then a cuckold?

                                 BESS
                        William, Georgiana only asks what 
                        we ourselves -

                                 DUKE
                        Be quiet, you fool! (to GEORGIANA)
                        Are you his whore?!

                                 GEORGIANA
                        ... No... but I can't see why you 
                        should mind. You have Bess and 
                        three boys...

                                 DUKE
                        Three boys??? Do you think I can 
                        make those bastards my heirs? Well, 
                        do you?

           GEORGIANA and BESS are frightened. GEORGIANA hurries out of 
           the room. A moment passes, then the DUKE strides out as well.

                                 BESS
                        William...?

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. HALLS AND CORRIDORS- MORNING - MOMENTS LATER

           GEORGIANA walks fast through the space. The DUKE charges 
           after her. GEORGIANA quickens her pace.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. GEORGIANA'S BEDROOM - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER

           GEORGIANA comes into her room, and slams the door behind her. 
           A few moments later, the door opens. The DUKE enters. He 
           shuts the door. He glares at GEORGIANA. She looks at him. The 
           DUKE asks a real question for once.

                                 DUKE
                        You don't know me in the least, do 
                        you?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I do.  We're a bad match.

                                 DUKE
                        I asked but two things when we 
                        wed: loyalty and a male heir.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Yes, same as your dogs.
           The DUKE's eyes flash. He snaps. He grabs her. She tries to 
           fight him off. Her dress is torn. They struggle. The DUKE 
           slaps her repeatedly until she no longer resists, then drags 
           her to bed.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. HALL OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM -MORNING -SAME TIME

           BESS stands outside the door. We HEAR GEORGIANA SCREAM.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. GEORGIANA'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           The DUKE pins GEORGIANA onto the bed and tears away at her 
           undergarments.  We hear the RIP of silk and lace.  GEORGIANA 
           screams again. He holds her face tightly between his hands 
           and stares coldly at her.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT.  NURSERY -SAME TIME

           LITTLE G. and HARRYO stare at the door of their room as the 
           screams continue.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. UPPER HALLWAY -SAME TIME

           A BUTLER stands at attention, impassive.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. HALL OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM-SAME TIME

           BESS hovers at the door as she listens to the struggle and 
           screams inside.  She turns and sees CHARLOTTE standing a few 
           feet away, staring at her. BESS moves away from the door, 
           unable to stop what's going on inside.  

                                 BESS
                            (To Charlotte, softly)
                        Come with me.

           CHARLOTTE stays rooted to the spot.

                                 BESS (CONT'D)
                            (Firmer)
                        Charlotte, come with me.

           BESS takes CHARLOTTE’S arm and hurries her off down the hall.

                                                            CUT TO:
           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - GEORGIANA'S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

           GEORGIANA lies on the bed.  It's over.  Her clothes are 
           torn.  Her face is red and wet with tears.  The DUKE sits 
           on the side of the bed, panting, used up.

                                 DUKE
                        Give me a son and then do what the 
                        hell you want, as long as you do it 
                        discreetly. Until then you will 
                        stay here and do as I say.

           The DUKE gets up and leaves. GEORGIANA's expression is blank, 
           dead. The sounds of crowds cheering and clapping fade up in 
           the background until we...

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. VAUXHALL PLEASURE GARDENS - DAY

           SHERIDAN stands before A HUGE CROWD. Across the river are 
           the HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT. There is bunting in WHIG colours
           and banners. The PRESS are out in even greater numbers than 
           before.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        I give you the winner!  Mr Fox! The 
                        Man of the People!

           FOX comes forth to a ROAR of approval.  He yells out:

                                 FOX
                        And I give you the weapon!  The 
                        Duchess of Devonshire!

           GEORGIANA, still shell-shocked, comes forth to WILD CHEERS.  
           She succeeds in smiling to the crowd. BESS and the DUKE stand 
           together off to the side. They clap and smile, but the strain 
           is evident.

           GREY, unseen near the doorway, watches GEORGIANA taking in 
           the APPLAUSE. Finally, the applause dies.

                                 FOX (CONT'D)
                        Thank you, all of you, for this 
                        reception tonight.

           GEORGIANA sees GREY on the sidelines. She glances at the  
           DUKE then turns to slip away. GREY sees this. He follows.

                                 FOX  (O.S.) (CONT'D) 
                        We have won the vote, and now we 
                        must win the future!
           APPLAUSE as GREY exits.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. VAUXHALL PLEASURE GARDENS - MOMENTS LATER

           GEORGIANA heads for her coach, well away from the crowd. 
           GREY catches up with her.  

                                 GREY
                        We did it. Or should I say you did 
                        it. 

           GEORGIANA tries to smile, but she can't.  She turns away from 
           GREY.  He knows something's wrong.

                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                        Georgiana?

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (the hardest thing to say)
                        Mr. Grey... I have enjoyed more 
                        than I can say the times we've 
                        spent together, the talks...

           GEORGIANA is overcome. She almost breaks down. GREY sees 
           she's upset and leads her to a bench. She sits and collects 
           herself. GREY looks distraught.

                                 GREY
                        Tell me.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I cannot say what -

                                 GREY
                        Now!

           GEORGIANA looks at him.  She has to do this as she planned.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        ...I have been unfair to you.

                                 GREY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (trying to be composed)
                        ...I have...indulged in your 
                        affections and made it seem my 
                        feelings towards you were more than 
                        they are in fact.  I fear the heat 
                        of the election...

                                 GREY
                        Say what you mean!
                                 GEORGIANA
                            (looks dead at him)
                        You love me.

                                 GREY
                        Yes!

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I do not love you.

           GREY takes this punch, but his eyes never blink, never waver.  

                                 GREY
                        You are not speaking what is in 
                        your heart.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        It is, it truly-

           GREY suddenly stands and strides away, pacing, angry.

                                 GREY
                            (cuts her off)
                        This is a speech, forced upon you-

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (overlaps below)
                        It isn't, it's what I've always 
                        known to be true!

                                 GREY
                            (overlaps above)
                        -- by those who would destroy our 
                        happiness!

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (loud, in the clear)
                        THIS IS HOW I AM!

           GREY is taken aback by her force and volume.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        I was wrong to offer you hope. I 
                        was wrong to pretend an affection I 
                        do not feel. You have said it 
                        yourself, I need to be adored. That 
                        is my weakness.

           GREY looks sick.  Then GEORGIANA delivers her coup-de-grace.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        This is not the first time I have 
                        been so careless.  Ask Mr. Fox.

           That does it.  GREY turns from her, angry, hurt, unable to 
           find a place to put his rage.
           GEORGIANA fights back the tears. We hear CHEERS o.s. GREY 
           turns to her and bows before heading back across the grass to 
           the stage. We can hear FOX still speaking.

                                 FOX (O.S.)
                        We have followed our ideas and 
                        our ideals, and in the struggle, 
                        we have found ourselves!

           CLOSE ON GEORGIANA as the colour drains from her face. She 
           is dying inside but she keeps it all in. She calmly turns 
           and walks to her carriage. Loud bangs fade in as we...

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

           It’s dusk over the HOUSE. Fireworks explode above it as 
           hoards of PEOPLE make their way up to the front entrance. 
           Whig-coloured ribbons decorate the outside.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - FOYER - THAT NIGHT

           The DUKE waits at the top of the GRAND STAIRCASE. He's 
           dressed for the evening. BESS is with him, also dressed. They 
           don't speak. They're waiting for GEORGIANA.  After a few 
           moments, GEORGIANA appears, dressed to the nines and powdered 
           a deathly white. 

           The DUKE refuses to register GEORGIANA, but BESS looks 
           across, shocked. GEORGIANA will not meet her eyes, however. 
           They walk down the staircase together all looking forward.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - BALLROOMS -- THAT NIGHT

           AN ELECTION NIGHT PARTY. Music plays. 

           Part of the UPSTAIRS has been converted into a gaming room 
           for the evening. It is boisterous and smoky. There are card 
           tables and players everywhere. 

           GEORGIANA, who has been drinking heavily, wanders through, 
           taking another drink from a passing WAITER. BESS is in the 
           background watching her every move. As GEORGIANA goes we 
           pick up details of this decadent society. Where before it 
           may have seemed glamorous and exciting it now looks uglier 
           and more sordid: a place of corruption and addiction, 
           dangerously on the edge of collapse.
           GEORGIANA is gambling at a table. A GENTLEMAN GAMBLER shows 
           his hand, GEORGIANA shrugs and pushes her chips across the 
           table with an air of indifference, but is stopped by 
           another GENTLEMAN on her left. 

                                 GENTLEMAN
                        No, Duchess...you can top that.

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (Hazily)
                        Can I?

                                 GENTLEMAN
                        Your Grace seems to have 
                        forgotten the king of hearts...

           The GENTLEMAN sends a quick, apologetic smile at 
           GEORGIANA’s fellow gamblers, then rearranges her hand to 
           form a trump. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Why so I have, so I have.

           GEORGIANA slowly rises to collect the chips. BESS steps 
           forward to help her but is ignored.

           LATER:

           GEORGIANA comes into the dancing area alone. The DUKE and 
           BESS are with a group nearby. GEORGIANA seems to radiate a 
           force field that keeps people away from her. But not FOX. 
           He comes up and smiles.

                                 FOX
                        You promised me a dance. Come. 
                        Give me my small pleasures.

           GEORGIANA yields to her old friend. ON THE DANCE FLOOR --

           GEORGIANA is dancing very uncontrollably with FOX, amid the 
           rest of the GUESTS. She grabs another drink as they pass a 
           SERVANT. She bumps into SHERIDAN. Drink goes on his jacket.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        My dear Duchess, much as I know 
                        you love dancing and drinking, I 
                        really must advise you to settle 
                        for one or the other, for the two 
                        are incompatible in the long run.

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (very drunk)
                        Why, Sheridan, you never were 
                        such a spoilsport before!

           GEORGIANA does a turn and slips. FOX steadies her. She 
           smiles an apology. Then...
           Suddenly GEORGIANA stumbles. Her WIG falls against a CANDLE 
           and GOES UP IN FLAMES.

           DANCERS back away. BESS looks shocked.

           GEORGIANA SCREAMS as she staggers, hair on fire.  DOORS 
           OPEN, SHOUTS, SERVANTS rush about.

           BESS attempts to knock the WIG off GEORGIANA's head. The 
           DUKE appears in his doorway, none too pleased.  He sees the 
           situation.  He turns to a FOOTMAN, all efficiency.

                                 DUKE
                        Please put out Her Grace's hair.

           The FOOTMAN splashes water on the wig.  HISS and SMOKE.

           The DUKE looks down at GEORGIANA: she lies sprawled on the 
           polished parquet floor: wig-less, her make-up smeared, her 
           eyes red and glassy.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - GEORGIANA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON a SMALL BOWL with a WHITE HANDKERCHIEF draped over 
           the top. There are DROPS OF BLOOD on the handkerchief.

                        The bleeding is stopped.

           We see GEORGIANA in bed, pale, washed out, and exhausted.  
           BESS, the DUKE, and SERVANTS hover as DR. NEVILLE (62) sets 
           the bowl aside.

                                 DR. NEVILLE (CONT'D)
                        As long as you follow strict 
                        instructions, there should be no 
                        impediment to the birth.

           The DUKE is mystified. BESS looks at GEORGIANA, who shows no 
           sign of registering what has been said.

                                 DUKE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 DR. NEVILLE
                        Her Grace is pregnant.

           The DUKE and BESS react.  GEORGIANA has no reaction at all.

           A church stands out against the countryside. There are sounds 
           of distant bells far off in the distance. A BOY runs into the 
           bell tower and rings the bell as hard as he can... 

           In another church in another part of the county, another 
           BOY hears the sound and rings his own the church’s bells...

           And in another church, bells ring out too...

           room are BESS, the DUKE, DR. NEVILLE, and SERVANTS.

                                 DR. NEVILLE

           DR NEVILLE bows and makes his way out of the room. The DUKE 
           looks down at GEORGIANA, who looks up at him.

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (very sad and dry)
                        Success at last.

           The DUKE looks away, ashamed.

           GEORGIANA gently puts the sleeping BOY to bed in his cot. 
           There’s a knock on the door. A SERVANT appears.

                                 SERVANT
                        His Grace wishes to see you in

           The DUKE is seated at his desk, a contract out in front of 
           him. BURLEIGH stands and points out where he should sign.  

                                 BURLEIGH
                        Also there Your Grace...And 
                        there...

           BURLEIGH offers a smile. The DUKE says nothing. He senses 
           GEORGIANA, who is at the library door looking in.
                                 DUKE
                        Come.

           GEORGIANA enters. The DUKE looks to BURLEIGH.

                                 BURLEIGH
                        Your Grace. As per the terms of 
                        His Grace’s inheritance, this is 
                        for you. To spend as you wish.

           BURLEIGH hands her a cheque. GEORGIANA looks at the DUKE 
           with disdain then turns to the door.

                                 DUKE (O.S.) 
                        It may surprise you but I too 
                        abhor this whole thing.

           GEORGIANA turns back. The DUKE is now standing. 

                                 DUKE (CONT'D)
                        Yet remove it - separate our 
                        estates, sell off the land - and 
                        the aristocracy simply ceases to 
                        be; and with it the Whig party. 
                        England will once again be ruled 
                        by a tryrannical monarchy, or, as 
                        will occur in France, anarchy. 
                        And it won’t just be you and I 
                        with our heads on the block, but 
                        all of our children too. I don’t 
                        wish to see that happen. Do you?

           GEORGIANA looks at him, then turns and leaves.

           The BABY BOY lies in a moving pram. GEORGIANA walks with the 
           children. She holds CHARLOTTE by the hand, while LITTLE G. 
           and HARRYO look into a pram pushed by a NANNY.

                                 LITTLE G
                        He's so small.

                                 HARRYO
                        You've been that small yourself.

                                 LITTLE G
                        Not that small. Have I, Mama?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        You have, darling. You've all been 
                        that small once.

                                 HARRYO
                        See, I told you.
           They continue towards the old FARM HOUSE.

                                 HARRYO (CONT'D)
                        One can't tell that he's a boy at 
                        all.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        But he is.

                                 HARRYO
                        But when one can't tell, I fail to 
                        see why it's so important. He looks 
                        just like the rest of us.

           GEORGIANA smiles.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I don't understand it myself, 
                        darling.

                                 HARRYO
                        All babies look alike when they 
                        have their clothes on.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Yes, but each of them is something 
                        quite unique.

                                 HARRYO
                        How so?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        You and Little G did not look at 
                        all like one another. You cried all 
                        the time when you were a baby, 
                        whereas Little G was quiet as a 
                        mouse. She could walk before you, 
                        but you could talk before her.

           The children listen. Charlotte looks at GEORGIANA.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What about me, Mama?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        You never cried, darling. You were 
                        always so brave.

           They have reached the ruins which GEORGIANA strolled through 
           together with GREY. She surveys the crumbling walls, the moss 
           and ivy, and the GREEN FIELDS beyond.  

           The children instinctively run in and start playing around 
           and climbing. GEORGIANA watches them and makes a decision.

           PEOPLE "ooh" and "ahh" at the interior.  There are MANY

                                 GUEST
                        Your Grace, if it is to be a 
                        school for study and learning, 
                        what need will the children have 
                        of windows?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        For gazing and dreaming.

           GEORGIANA stares out the window.  She should be happy.  She 
           isn't.  She looks out onto the fields for a long time and 
           then seems to see someone.

           HER POV -- A MAN coming across the GREEN. As he gets closer 
           she realises who it is: GREY, riding towards the SCHOOL.

           GEORGIANA almost has a heart attack. She looks around to 
           see if anyone has glimpsed her reaction. No one has. She 
           moves to the door.

           CHILDREN, etc.  She waits for GREY.  And then he reaches the 
           steps.  He takes off his hat and bows. It’s awkward, stiff.

                                 GREY

                        You built it. I knew you would. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Yes, I came into some money of my 
                        own. Are you recalled from France?
                                 GREY
                        For a while.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        No revolution yet?

                        of time.

           They look at each other.

                                 GEORGIANA 
                        You have been missed...much missed.

                        (a long beat; then:) I understand 
                        you bore a son.

           GEORGIANA realizes he is making a point.  She nods, nervous.

                        ...Yes. William Hartington. We call 
                        him... Hart.

                        He is.  We are.

           Beat. GREY gazes at her. They're both full of longing.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        I must talk to you... about Fox.

                                 GREY
                        There is no need. We have already 
                        spoken...

           GREY smiles at her. There is kindness in his eyes.

                                 GEORGIANA 
                        How is it that you are here?

                                 GREY
                        I was in London and received an 
                        invitation. I assumed it was on 
                        behalf of the party; I could not 
                        say no.

           GEORGIANA is confused.  She opens her mouth to speak, but at 
           this point, FOX and SHERIDAN come out of the SCHOOL.
                                 SHERIDAN

                        You'll need cards, of course.

                        You summoned Grey.

                        William must not know.  Honesty is

           BESS goes off to her own room.  GEORGIANA watches her go, 
           shocked.  When BESS is gone, GEORGIANA hears a DOOR OPEN.  
           She turns. GREY stands in his doorway.

           GEORGIANA stares at him, down the long corridor.

           GEORGIANA walks down the hall to GREY and his DOORWAY.  
           Behind him we can see his BED.  They stare at each other 
           over the flickering candlelight.

                                 GREY
                        I don't just want an affair.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Nor do I.

           Beat. They keep staring. GEORGIANA takes his hand and pulls 
           him towards his own room. He does not move. She turns and 
           kisses his lips. Finally, he responds. Still embracing, they 
           go into the room.

           INT. CHATSWORTH - GREY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER

           GEORGIANA and GREY are passionately making love in his bed.  
           It's as if it's the first time for both of them. The sex is 
           real and intimate and convincing, an extraordinary release 
           and revelation for them both...

           LATER:

           The night is still. Night birds call in the background. The 
           window is open and wind blows gently in. GEORGIANA and GREY 
           lie in each other's arms. They kiss, long and tender. GREY 
           pulls away. 

                                 GREY 
                            (Gently)
                        You should return to your room.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        No I should not.

           They begin to make love again...

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY

           A few days later. GEORGIANA, BESS, and the DUKE eat.  
           GEORGIANA is nervous. She hesitates, then:

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I'm going to Bath.

                                 DUKE
                            (looks up)
                        But I can't get away for weeks.

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (trying to seem natural)
                        I shall go without you.
                            (To Bess)
                        Bess, you stay and keep our 
                        husband company, whilst I take 
                        the cure.

           The DUKE looks decidedly undecided. GEORGIANA looks to BESS 
           for help. She’s not sure it’s a good idea but acquiesces.

                                 BESS
                        Yes, William, why not? If G goes 
                        now we can catch her up when 
                        you’re free.

           GEORGIANA looks at BESS, thankful for the help.  She tries 
           to remain looking casual. The DUKE relents.  

                                 DUKE
                        Well, if you must.

           GEORGIANA and GREY in bed, naked.  GEORGIANA is asleep.  GREY 
           is awake.  He stares at her.  Something is troubling him.  
           She wakes.  She sees his concern.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        ...What’s the matter?

                                 GREY
                        The matter is that after this 
                        week we will have to leave. You 
                        will be back home with your 
                        husband, and I won’t be with you.

           GREY gets out of bed.
                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                        Perhaps it would be better if I 
                        were married too, then we could be 
                        a triangle or a foursome, or... 
                        whatever angle could contain you 
                        and me and-- I should ask Lady 
                        Bess; she seems to have surveyed 
                        the geometry and bent it to her 
                        favour.

           GEORGIANA gets out of bed and tries to comfort him.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I know this is hard. It's hard 
                        for me, too. But it won’t be like 
                        this forever.

           GREY smiles. GEORGIANA embraces him. GREY holds her tight.

           EXT. A BATH ALLEY - MORNING

           POLITICAL PEOPLE are filing into a building for a meeting.

           GREY and GEORGIANA are in an isolated alley, adjacent to 
           the building, holding close, obviously in love. They kiss 
           and then GREY goes inside.

           ANGLE - THE END OF THE ALLEY: PEOPLE have spotted them. 

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. GEORGIANA'S RENTED HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           GREY is reclining in the bath. GEORGIANA is washing his back 
           and arms with a sponge. The room is candlelit, atmospheric.

                                 GREY
                        I thought of you the whole 
                        afternoon. Why people insist on 
                        arguing on a sunny day is beyond 
                        me. 

           Beat, smiles, looks over his shoulder at her.

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (Smiles)
                        You'll be gone tomorrow as well?

                                 GREY
                        Only for a few hours, hopefully. 
                        I am beginning to fear that 
                        politics is divided into those 
                        who want to fix things and those 
                        that merely want to talk about 
                        fixing things. 
           Grey kisses her hand. GEORGIANA smiles blissfully.

                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                        I wish we had this time just for 
                        ourselves.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Whatever will become of us when 
                        you're made Prime Minister?

           GREY laughs, delighted.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        When you are, you'll be very far 
                        from me.

                                 GREY

                        Never. We'll be together. Always.  

           GREY smiles. GEORGIANA leans across and kissees him.

                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                        Now pass me a towel.

           ...to find the DUKE and LADY SPENCER waiting for her. They 
           are in travelling clothes. GEORGIANA gasps.

                                 DUKE
                        Thought we would surprise you. I 
                        think you once said there wasn't 
                        enough spontaneity in our marriage. 
                        Or words to that affect.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Mama, what are you doing here?

           LADY SPENCER sends her a severe look.

                                 DUKE
                        So. Have you seen many of our 
                        circle down here?
                                 GEORGIANA
                        Some. The Cokes. And Haverford. And 
                        Lord Wicklow.

                                 DUKE
                        Bunch of politicos, too, aren't 
                        there?  Meetings and such.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I believe.

                                 DUKE
                        Isn't... isn't Grey here?

           A beat as GEORGIANA's heart stops.

                                 DUKE (CONT'D)
                        By which I mean Sir Charles Grey. 
                        Rumour has it that he is.

           GEORGIANA jumps to the heart of the issue.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I won't give him up.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        Georgiana!

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Everyone has a lover. Bess is the 
                        lover of my husband!

                                 DUKE
                        That situation was agreed upon.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Yes, I held myself in so little 
                        esteem that I acquiesced to make 
                        you happy!

                                 DUKE
                        If you had taken a lover with 
                        discretion, it may have been
                        different.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Differ--?!

                                 DUKE
                        The only saving grace is that it 
                        hasn’t yet made it to the papers.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        My dear, Grey is unmarried.  He 
                        risks nothing with this affair.  
                        The hazard is all yours.
                                 GEORGIANA
                        Grey loves me.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        So does William.

           GEORGIANA stares at her mother in frustration, then at the 
           DUKE.

                                 DUKE
                        Yes. I love you!

                                 GEORGIANA
                        HOW?!

                                 DUKE
                        In the way I understand love.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        Georgiana, this has gone much too 
                        far. It is beneath our dignity. All 
                        London is talking...

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Then let them talk! Grey makes me a 
                        fallen woman, well and good, now 
                        William may divorce me and Bess 
                        becomes Duchess of Devonshire!

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        That will never happen!

           LADY SPENCER stares harshly at GEORGIANA. Then she makes for 
           the door.

                                 LADY SPENCER (CONT'D)
                        I think I will leave you to it.

           LADY SPENCER leaves the room. GEORGIANA looks apprehensively 
           at the DUKE.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        What follows now? Are you going to 
                        tear off my clothes and rape me 
                        again?

                                 DUKE
                        Why on earth would I do that?

           GEORGIANA looks at him in surprise.

                                 DUKE (CONT'D)
                        I know that you've thought much of 
                        neither my intellect nor my 
                        manners, but in fact I never do 
                        anything that serves no purpose.
           GEORGIANA is hurt, and looks at the DUKE in silence. He is 
           composed in a way she has never seen before.

                                 DUKE (CONT'D)
                        I know precisely what you two have 
                        together.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        We love each other.

                                 DUKE
                        I do not doubt it. He is a dreamer 
                        like yourself. You both dream of 
                        another world that does not exist 
                        and never will. (Beat) As for 
                        reality, however, allow me to 
                        enlighten you: If you do not give 
                        him up at once, I will see to it 
                        that every home and cheque book in 
                        this country is closed to him.  He 
                        will be welcome neither in the 
                        halls of government nor its back 
                        rooms of power.  His dream of 
                        becoming prime minister, your 
                        mutual fantasy of a changed world, 
                        will be dead as ash. 

           The DUKE pauses before delivering the final blow.

                                 DUKE (CONT'D)
                        And you will never see your 
                        children again.

           GEORGIANA is open mouthed, stunned.

                                 DUKE (CONT'D)
                        You are given to say "love is an 
                        act."  Well, this was an act.

           GEORGIANA turns and runs out of the room.

           INT. GEORGIANA'S RENTED HOUSE. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           GEORGIANA is close to the wall, trembling.  LADY SPENCER 
           enters and shuts the door behind her.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        What do you imagine you will have 
                        if you stay with Grey?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Love. Passion.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        For a time.
                                 GEORGIANA
                        For life.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        There is no such thing. Will you 
                        never grow up! And how will you 
                        live, even? Friends will shun you, 
                        family will abandon you.  There 
                        won't be a house open to you in all 
                        of England.

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (trying to convince 
                             herself)
                        Grey will be Prime Minister.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        Not with his whore, the Duchess of 
                        "D" on his arm and the Duke pulling 
                        every string to ruin him. He will 
                        never be Prime Minister. He'll 
                        pretend it doesn't matter, but it 
                        will.  He'll put on a good face for 
                        a while, but he'll come to hate you 
                        for it.

           At this GEORGIANA's eyes fill with tears.

                                 LADY SPENCER (CONT'D)
                        Most likely you’ll end up alone - 
                        a wife with no husband and a 
                        mother with no children. At best 
                        you’ll become someone else’s 
                        mistress, living on charity, 
                        which can be taken away at any 
                        moment.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        You can’t know all that!

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        Look at your friend Bess!

           GEORGIANA descends the stairs and walks to the door. She now 
           sees the DUKE waiting for her.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I must ask you to return to London.

                                 DUKE
                        Without you?
                                 GEORGIANA
                        Yes.

                                 THE DUKE
                        Then I must warn you. This will be 
                        the mistake of your life.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        No, I made that many years ago. I 
                        trust you can let yourselves out.

           GEORGIANA leaves. The DUKE sends her an icy stare. LADY 
           SPENCER joins him. They exchange one look, then the DUKE 
           turns to the SERVANT at the door.

                                 DUKE
                        For God's sake, open the door, man!

           The servant quickly opens the door. The DUKE exits. LADY 
           SPENCER follows him.

           INT. BATH. ANTE ROOM. POLITICAL MEETING ROOMS - DAY

           GEORGIANA and GREY are discussing what has happened. She 
           looks worried and is pacing up and down. In the background 
           are muted sounds of POLITICIANS debating next door.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        He will come down on us with 
                        everything in his power, Charles.

                                 GREY
                        Yes...(beat) Does that frighten 
                        you?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I would be foolish not to be 
                        frightened.

                                 GREY
                        We would be foolish to let future 
                        fears stand in our way.

           Georgiana takes heart in Grey's determination.

                                 GREY (CONT'D)
                        Sorrows will come however we try to 
                        avoid them. And when they come, we 
                        must stay our course and not give 
                        in. 

           Georgiana is relieved and elated at his words, but holds her 
           course as the voice of prudence.
                                 GEORGIANA
                        He will be without mercy.

                                 GREY
                        Then so will we. 

           GREY kisses her and strides back into the MEETING ROOM next 
           door where a noisy, heated argument is underway.

           GEORGIANA arrives back at her house in her carriage to find

           GEORGIANA walks inside. BESS follows.

                        Dearest Georgiana, you cannot -

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I cannot give up Charles. I could 
                        not survive another day without 
                        him. You think I've chosen to be 
                        with him, of my own free will, and 
                        so did I, for a while. But Bess, 
                        I've come to realize that it was no 
                        choice at all. Not really.

                                 BESS
                            (Getting angry)
                        But these are your children you are 
                        talking of. You must pack up 
                        immediately and...

                            (Getting angry too)
                        No! All my life I have been 
                        dominated by my family, my 
                        husband and now my husband’s 
                        lover.... 

           BESS is stopped in her tracks.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        ...All my life, it seems to me, 
                        I've fought my way upstream.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        With Charles, I find myself going 
                        down the stream, effortlessly and 
                        naturally. I never realized that 
                        life and love could be that easy. 
                        You can't ask me to battle 
                        nature, and my own heart. Not 
                        now, when I've come so far.

           BESS sends GEORGIANA a kind, but worried smile. She goes to 
           her bag and takes out a PACKAGE OF LETTERS.

                                 BESS
                        These are from your girls - I 
                        promised to deliver them. Hart 
                        neglected to write, but then he is 
                        not yet one.

           BESS puts the PACKAGE down on the table. GEORGIANA refuses 
           to even acknowledge them.

                                 BESS (CONT'D)
                        I know you will do the right thing 
                        eventually.

           GEORGIANA carries a candle into the adjacent room. She 
           takes a deep breath, rips it open. There are LETTERS in

                        I'll be back soon.
           GEORGIANA looks at him as he leaves. GREY turns in the

                        pleased that we have come to an

                                 BESS (O.S.)
                        How did he take it?

           GEORGIANA turns to see BESS appearing from behind her. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        He didn't. I just left. If I had 
                        seen him again, I would have 
                        stayed.

                                 BESS
                        No letter, either?
           GEORGIANA shakes her head.

                                 BESS (CONT'D)
                        I know it's hell, but it’s for 
                        the best, Georgiana...

           GEORGIANA keeps looking at BESS while her aspect changes 
           and her face goes blank. Then she returns to look at the 
           children laugh, shout, and play.

           INT. KITCHEN AREA- NIGHT - WEEKS LATER

           Three silver plates covered by silver domes are carried by 
           SERVANTS out of the kitchen and through the downstairs 
           corridors into the main part of the house.

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE DINING ROOM - NIGHT - WEEKS LATER

           GEORGIANA, BESS and the DUKE are seated for dinner at their 
           vast table. It’s tense, silent and extremely formal as 
           SERVANTS bring in the plates. In unison THREE SERVANTS step 
           forward to take away the domes, revealing elaborately 
           prepared POUSSIN - it’s an unexpected comic moment.  

           They begin to eat. No one says a word. Suddenly we hear 
           DOORS CRASH OPEN from far outside the room. There is the 
           distant sound of a man’s voice, raised and angry. GEORGIANA 
           knows immediately that it is GREY. So too does the DUKE who 
           shoots her a vicious look. GEORGIANA rises, 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Your Grace, Bess. Will you excuse 
                        me.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. CORRIDOR. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

           GEORGIANA enters to see GREY storming up the corridor, 
           followed by FOOTMEN trying to stop him. GREY is wild. He 
           yells at GEORGIANA, quite oblivious to the FOOTMEN.

                                 GREY 
                        Why haven't you responded to my 
                        letters?!

           GEORGIANA tries to maintain calm. She looks at the FOOTMEN, 
           headed by HEATON, the butler.
                                 GEORGIANA
                        Thank you, Heaton.

           HEATON bows, and though still remaining present, recedes 
           into the background with the FOOTMEN. GREY comes closer.

                                 GREY 
                        I have written a dozen times a 
                        day, and there is nothing from 
                        you!  What has happened?!  Do you 
                        love me no longer?!

           GEORGIANA steels herself...

                                 GEORGIANA 
                        My personal feelings remain 
                        unaltered...

                                 GREY
                        Then we must be together again. I 
                        want to marry you. I want you to 
                        bear my children ... and I don't 
                        care if they are boys or girls!

           ...But GEORGIANA is barely holding it together.  

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I wish it could be like that.

                                 GREY
                        It can. It will. You must leave 
                        and be with me, a free woman! 
                        Now, let us leave now!

           GREY steps forward to take her arm but GEORGIANA backs 
           away. HEATON makes as if to intervene, but holds back.

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (Firmly)
                        No, Charles. I am a mother 
                        already. I cannot abandon my 
                        children. This is a sacrifice I 
                        am forced to make. I have given 
                        you up for them only.

           GREY stares at her with wide, angry, tortured eyes.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        And in so doing, I have lost my 
                        heart and soul. 

           GREY looks at her, sad and weak, nothing left to argue. 
           GEORGIANA stands firm. She gestures to HEATON.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        Heaton, will you please escort 
                        Mr. Grey to the door?
           HEATON comes forward and stands next to GREY.

           GEORGIANA still looks at him. Her eyes glisten. GREY, 
           choking with pain, stares one more beat, then turns and 
           walks away. HEATON and FOOTMEN follow, like bouncers. 

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE DINING ROOM - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

           GEORGIANA slowly sits again. She is distant, with no 
           interest in the food in front of her. The DUKE looks up, 
           chewing.

                                 DUKE
                        What’s the matter, don’t like the 
                        chicken? I find it really quite 
                        decent. 

           The table is quiet. Not even BESS can muster a reply. 
           GEORGIANA looks at him, as if she’s got something to say.

                                 DUKE (CONT'D)
                        Yes?

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - ROOM - THE FOLLOWING MORNING

           Rain spits against the window. Wind blows in the trees 
           outside. GEORGIANA is sitting in her bed, staring blankly 
           before her. The DUKE and BESS enter.

                                 DUKE
                            (to Bess)
                        Will you be so kind as to inform 
                        the Duchess of my decision?

           BESS looks deeply uncomfortable.

                                 BESS
                            (appealingly)
                        Georgiana -

           GEORGIANA does not respond, but keeps staring into the air. 
           BESS takes a deep breath.

                                 BESS (CONT'D)
                        It will be like this: you will be 
                        taken to the country where you 
                        will give birth to the child, and 
                        the child will subsequently be 
                        trusted to the care of Charles 
                        Grey’s family.
           GEORGIANA makes no reply.

                                 BESS (CONT'D)
                        Are you listening to me?

           GEORGIANA slides silently into a reclining position.

                                 DUKE
                        I think she has heard you. Let's 
                        leave her.

                                 BESS
                        Georgiana, please -

                                 DUKE
                        I said: let's leave. This is not 
                        a discussion. She has been 
                        informed of my decision.

           BESS looks at GEORGIANA.

                                 BESS
                        Have pity on her, William...

                                 DUKE
                        Pity be damned. She brought this 
                        upon herself, as well you know. 
                        Now come...

           The DUKE starts to go out. BESS’s voice stops him.

                                 BESS 
                        No. I will go with her.

                                 DUKE
                        You’re not going anywhere...

                                 BESS
                            (Turns, magnificently)
                        I will go with G if G will have 
                        me, and there is nothing you can 
                        say or do to stop either of us.

           The DUKE is speechless. GEORGIANA looks up for the first 
           time. The DUKE leaves. The women are left alone in silence 
           with each other.

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. DAY

           On a cold, windy, grey March day, TWO PLAIN COACHES travel 
           across the flat and largely featureless landscape.

           In one carriage are TWO MAIDS and DR NEVILLE. In the other 
           is GEORGIANA and BESS.

           EXT. HOUSE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. DAY

           The house is on a farm. It is rustic and remote, the only 
           building for miles around. Chickens peck outside. It is far 
           removed from the opulence GEORGIANA and BESS are used to.

           The two COACHES are parked outside. From the rear COACH, 
           luggage is being unpacked and brought inside.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. DAY

           GEORGIANA enters this house with BESS and a SERVANT. It’s 
           simple, unlived in and dusty.

           BESS enters what is to be Georgiana’s bedroom and tries to 
           open a window, but it’s locked shut.

           EXT. HOUSE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. DUSK

           GEORGIANA comes out and watches the sun go down from the 
           vast sky, to disappear at the very lowest point of the 
           horizon. A few moments later BESS comes out and puts a 
           shawl around her. A moment passes.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Thank you for coming.

                                 BESS
                        I couldn’t not be with you. 

           GEORGIANA smiles.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I count it a triumph we have 
                        become friends again when fate 
                        has been so intent on keeping us 
                        rivals.
                                 BESS
                        So do I. I may have caused you a 
                        lot of pain but you must believe 
                        that I didn’t plot or plan any of 
                        it. [Beat] The Duke is for my 
                        boys only. You are for me.

           GEORGIANA is touched by these comments. Another moment 
           passes and her mind returns to the situation to hand. She 
           puts her hands around her stomach.

                                 GEORGIANA 
                        Bess, how will I do this?

                                 BESS
                        For Charlotte, for Harryo, for 
                        little G, for Hart... 

           GEORGIANA nods her head.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Has Charles confirmed he’ll be 
                        coming...for the little one?

                                 BESS
                        Not yet. But I’m sure he will.

           BESS and DR NEVILLE attend as GEORGIANA gives birth, seen 
           from some distance away down the end of a long corridor. 
           It’s real and difficult. BESS holds GEORGIANA’s hands. 

           As GEORGIANA screams we cut outside so the muted sounds are 
           heard over the shots of the nature around the farmhouse.

           I/E. HOUSE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. DAY

           It’s a bright Spring morning. Birds are singing. Inside it 
           is peaceful. Brutal-looking eighteenth century birthing 
           instruments lie covered in blood. It is unclear whether 
           something really terrible has happened.

           Outside, hens peck in the courtyard. DR NEVILLE, in a 
           sombre mood, washes the blood off his hands and arms with 
           water from a well. BESS joins him.

                                 BESS
                        How are they?
                                 COUNTRY DOCTOR
                            (Bluntly)
                        The girl is well. Her Grace lost 
                        a lot of blood. 

           BESS looks worried.

           INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. MORNING

           GEORGIANA’s in bed, summoning up all her strength to breast-
           feed her BABY. GEORGIANA strokes her head as she does so.

           BESS is sitting in the other corner of the room. After a 
           moment, she hears a faint sound and goes to look out of the 
           window. From a long distance away, a small train of COACHES 
           travel toward the house, kicking up dust in its wake. 

           BESS looks apprehensive. She goes to GEORGIANA’s bedside.

                                 BESS
                            (Gently)
                        He’s here.

           GEORGIANA flinches - it’s the moment she’s been dreading. 
           BESS comes closer and gestures toward the BABY.

                                 BESS (CONT'D)
                        Would it help if I...

                            (Looking up)
                        No, Bess. I must do it.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. HOUSE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. DAY

           A COACH is at the gate. A BUTLER stands to one side, a WET 
           NURSE to the other. Out steps a serious looking older man, 
           GENERAL GREY. CHARLES GREY is nowhere to be seen.

           BESS looks on from the doorway as GEORGIANA slowly takes 
           the BABY up the path toward GENERAL GREY, holding it tight 
           to her all the way. She reaches him.

                                 GENERAL GREY
                            (Flatly)
                        Your Grace. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Where is Charles?
                                 GENERAL GREY
                        I am Charles’ father, General 
                        Grey. Your husband thought it 
                        best if I took care of this.

           GEORGIANA takes a deep breath. She hadn’t expected this, 
           and now she is being asked to hand her baby over to a 
           stranger, and a cold one at that. It’s not clear that she 
           will go through with it...

           GEORGIANA gently kisses the baby’s head, whispering to her, 
           smelling her hair, her skin, running her nose down her face 
           and breathing her in for one last time. BESS finds this 
           impossible to watch and turns away. 

           With immense difficulty GEORGIANA finally goes to hand her 
           baby over. GENERAL GREY does not take it. He nods sharply 
           to his WET NURSE who steps forward to take the BABY, 
           although for a moment GEORGIANA simply can’t let her go.

           GENERAL GREY immediately turns to go back to the COACH. 
           GEORGIANA calls after him.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        General Grey...

           GENERAL GREY stops and turns.

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        ...her name is Eliza. She is 
                        innocent of all of this. Please 
                        take care with her. 

           GENERAL GREY is no longer able to maintain his business-
           like facade. He nods and gives a small, gentle smile. 

                                 GENERAL GREY
                        Of course. She is my grand-
                        daughter, after all.

           GEORGIANA is comforted by his unexpected show of humanity.

                                 GEORGIANA 
                        What will you tell her, of her 
                        mother?

           GENERAL GREY takes a moment to respond.

                                 GENERAL GREY
                        That she is dead...But that she 
                        loved her very much.

           GEORGIANA gives a small smile, one that hides the 
           excruciating pain she is in. GENERAL GREY turns and goes 
           back into his COACH, followed by the BUTLER and the WET 
           NURSE and GEORGIANA’S BABY GIRL.
           As the BABY GIRL is passed into the coach, GEORGIANA can 
           hear her daughter begin to cry a little. GEORGIANA 
           instinctively flinches, using all her strength to hold her 
           back from running over to comfort her. 

           The driver cracks the whip and GEORGIANA watches as the 
           COACHES ride off, leaving her alone at the gate with the 
           barren landscape behind. 

                                                            CUT TO:

           I/E. HOUSE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN

           The MAIDS, SERVANTS and DR NEVILLE are packing up in the 
           early morning light of dawn.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN

           The cot is empty. Low sun cuts through the windows.

           GEORGIANA sits staring into space in her bedroom, her 
           fingers rolling backwards and forwards over a locket of 
           Eliza’s hair, as if she has been sat there all night.

           BESS enters and comes close. It takes a moment for 
           GEORGIANA to notice she’s even there. She looks up.

                                 BESS
                        We’re ready.

           GEORGIANA nods but doesn’t move.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I can’t go back...to how it was. 
                        It will finish me off.

                                 BESS
                        I know. We will find a way, I 
                        promise. But now we must go.

           BESS produces two linen FLANNELS. GEORGIANA looks 
           quizzically at them.

                                 BESS (CONT'D)
                            (Gently)
                        For your milk.

           GEORGIANA looks down - there are two wet patches on her 
           breasts. BESS kneels next to GEORGIANA and holds her tight.

                                                            CUT TO:
           EXT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - DAY

           It’s a sunny May day. We see still lives of the house and 
           grounds. 

           In the courtyard SERVANTS are lined up in military 
           precision. The DUKE is at the head of them standing alone. 
           A small band are at the ready. A SERVANT at the gates gives 
           the signal and they play bright, happy, celebratory music. 

           GEORGIANA’s carriage enters the gates and stops in front of 
           them. GEORGIANA steps out, clearly very subdued, followed 
           by BESS who holds back near the CARRIAGE. The music playing 
           is in total contrast with the mood of the occasion.

           The DUKE steps up to greet GEORGIANA. 

                                 DUKE
                        Welcome home, G.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Thank you, William.

           One by one the servants greet her, looking into her eyes, 
           real affection showing through the formal setting. 

                                 SERVANT 1
                        Welcome home, your Grace.

                                 SERVANT 2
                        Welcome home, your Grace.

           Finally there are the CHILDREN, who are last in line but 
           can wait no longer and break ranks, rushing forward to 
           greet her, all cuddles and tears.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           GEORGIANA’s MAIDS unpack all of her things. 

           GEORGIANA and BESS are talking quietly to one another by 
           the window. Outside their children play together, the 
           images distorted by the wavy glass of the window pane.

           The DUKE approaches tentatively from the background. 

                                 DUKE
                        Hello, G. I hope I’m not 
                        disturbing you.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        No, not at all.
           GEORGIANA gestures to her staff who all leave, as does 
           BESS. The DUKE fidgets and, unusually for him, looks 
           distinctly nervous.

                                 DUKE
                        I am aware that I am not 
                        particularly adept at expressing 
                        myself when it comes to matters 
                        of a more personal nature, but I 
                        shall endeavour to try. [Beat] 
                        Over the years I have acted in 
                        ways that you have judged... 
                        harsh. Well I do not wish for you 
                        to undergo any further suffering. 
                        Indeed, I would like our life to 
                        return to a calm normality. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Thank you William. Your 
                        sentiments are very welcome. 

           The DUKE looks very relieved. He smiles.

                                 DUKE
                        Lady Melbourne has arranged a 
                        ball in honour of your return 
                        from holiday. Given some of the 
                        vague reports that have been 
                        circulating over this past year, 
                        I think it would be wise for us 
                        to go. A show of unity, so to 
                        speak.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        As you wish.

                                 DUKE
                        Very good. Please inform BESS... 
                        so that she too has enough time 
                        to prepare.

           The DUKE, pleased with himself, leaves. After a moment BESS 
           re enters. The women face each other, seemingly trapped 
           once again in the DUKE’s triangle. But their faces are not 
           despondent. In fact they display tiny, mysterious smiles.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. GEORGIANA’S BEDROOM. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - EVENING

           GEORGIANA is carefully made up by her MAIDS. At the same 
           time, her SEAMSTRESS holds up a series of fashionable and 
           eye-catching clothes for her to wear. GEORGIANA shakes her 
           head to all of them. 
           Finally the SEAMSTRESS holds a dress up - although we don’t 
           see it - and GEORGIANA nods.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. BALL. LADY MELBOURNE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A big, lively ball is in full swing. A FOOTMAN stands at 
           the door and addresses the party in a booming voice.

                                 FOOTMAN
                        The Duke and Duchess of 
                        Devonshire. And Lady Elizabeth 
                        Foster.

           The room goes quiet with a great sense of expectation... 

           The doors swing open... 

           GEORGIANA steps back into the limelight...

           But she is now dressed in a far more sober way and cuts a 
           demure, conservative figure.  GEORGIANA’S appearance is 
           clearly a disappointment to the guests, and the press react 
           with far less interest than ever before. In contrast, ahead 
           of her the room is packed with fashionable new debutantes.

           GEORGIANA walks steadily through the crowd. She is to the 
           left of the DUKE, BESS to the right. He has his head held 
           high, finally seeming to be in total control of it all.

           GEORGIANA nods hello to FOX and SHERIDAN, and there’s a 
           warm, ad-hoc mix of bowing and ‘welcome home Your Grace’. 
           There is however, a hint that they don’t quite recognise 
           her, or that she has undergone some kind of minor lobotomy.

           LADY SPENCER steps forward and kisses her.

                                 LADY SPENCER
                            (Genuinely)
                        G, my darling, how wonderful to 
                        see you.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        And you, Mama.

           LADY SPENCER guides her off to one side, and whispers;

                                 LADY SPENCER
                        How are you?

           GEORGIANA gives a look as if to say ‘alright’.

                                 LADY SPENCER (CONT'D)
                        I wish I could have done more to 
                        help. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LADY SPENCER (CONT'D)
                        But the choices you have made are 
                        for the best. Things will become 
                        easier in time.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Thank you. I know.

           GEORGIANA walks on. Suddenly she sees GREY, talking to a 
           group of YOUNG PEOPLE. She cannot help but approach him, 
           speeding up as she gets nearer. 

                                 GEORGIANA (CONT'D)
                        Charles...

           He turns, looking awkward and nervous when he sees that it 
           is her. Next to him a YOUNG WOMAN turns too, a younger 
           spitting image of GEORGIANA.

                                 GREY
                        Your Grace...allow me to 
                        introduce my fiance, Mary 
                        Ponsonby.

           GEORGIANA is shocked but manages to hold out her hand.

                                 MARY PONSONBY
                        Your Grace.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Miss Ponsonby.

           GEORGIANA looks to GREY. GREY takes his fiance’s arm.

                                 GREY
                        Please excuse us.

           GREY and MARY PONSONBY walk off. After a moment, GEORGIANA 
           appears behind them. 

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Charles...

           GREY turns to face her. He looks at MARY, who is not happy 
           about it, but slopes off. GREY faces GEORGIANA.

                                 GREY 
                        Yes?

                                 GEORGIANA
                        I’m sorry that the Duke didn’t 
                        let you come.

                                 GREY
                        What do you mean?

                                 GEORGIANA
                            (Whisper)
                        To pick up our Eliza.
           GREY looks at her. Beat. There is a coldness in his 
           expression we haven’t seen before.

                                 GREY
                        It was me who didn’t want to 
                        come.

           GEORGIANA tries hard to remain composed, but finally looks  
           to have been crushed, cracked and defeated. 

                                 GEORGIANA 
                        I wish you every happiness.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - NIGHT

           The DUKE, BESS and GEORGIANA walk through the halls in 
           silence. They stop at the turn off for the DUKE’s bedroom. 

                                 DUKE
                        Good night, G.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        Good night, William.

           The DUKE turns to BESS, expecting her to follow him, but 
           she doesn’t.

                                 BESS
                        I am tired, William. It has been 
                        a difficult trip. I’m sure you 
                        understand.

           The DUKE is taken aback, but doesn’t want to upset the 
           newfound harmony.

                                 DUKE
                        Oh...yes, well...another time. 
                        Good night Bess.

                                 BESS
                        Good night William.

           The DUKE walks off to his quarters alone.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY TO BEDROOMS. DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - NIGHT

           GEORGIANA and BESS now walk together, two massive dresses 
           side by side down the wide corridor. They don’t speak, but 
           the knowing, mysterious smile we saw earlier returns to 
           GEORGIANA’S face. It is matched by BESS’s.
           They reach GEORGIANA’S room and she pushes open her double 
           doors to reveal her four poster bed. GEORGIANA turns, a 
           devilish, coquettish, rebellious twinkle in her eye.

                                 GEORGIANA
                        After you.

           BESS returns a cheeky, mischievous look and sexily brushes 
           past, heading for the bed. GEORGIANA puts her head back 
           into the hallway and looks left and right to check no one’s 
           watching. 

           GEORGIANA takes the handles and pulls closed the heavy 
           doors, her triumphant face finally disappearing behind the 
           crack in the middle as she shuts us out with a bang. 

                                                      CUT TO BLACK:

           FADE UP - A PORTRAIT OF GEORGIANA

           Over the portrait, a title card fades up: 

           Georgiana, the Duke and Bess lived together until Georgiana 
           died 

                                                     FADE TO BLACK:

           FADE UP - A PORTRAIT OF THE DUKE

           Over the portrait, a title card fades up:

           Soon after, the Duke proposed to Bess

                                                     FADE TO BLACK:

           FADE UP -  PORTRAIT OF BESS

           Over the portrait, a title card fades up:

           And Bess became the new Duchess of Devonshire

           The shot begins to move in on Bess’s face, but then starts
           to close in on the pendant necklace she is wearing. 

           The camera gets closer and closer until we realise that 
           Bess is wearing a miniature portrait of GEORGIANA - the one 
           we saw in the opening scene. She stares back and smiles.

           The camera moves even closer still, until we disappear to 
           BLACK between a tiny crack in the paint of this two hundred 
           year old picture.
