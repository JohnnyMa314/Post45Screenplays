           INT. BMW SPORTSTER (MIDTOWN)-- EVENING 

           We're skimming through evening traffic.  The concrete jungle 
           rushing past the windshield.  Outside, it's cold, late winter
           fighting off spring.  Inside, it's warm.  Safe.  

                                 JULIA  (O.S.)
                        Did you look at the refrigerator yet?

           The CAMERA finds DAVIS MITCHELL (38) in the passenger seat. 
           He's staring out the window.  We STAY ON HIM THE ENTIRE SCENE.

                                 DAVIS (oblivious)
                        Huh?  Refrigerator?

                                 JULIA (O.S.)
                        Yeah... the box in our kitchen that
                        keeps things cold?

                                 DAVIS
                        Yeah.  No.  What about it?

                                 JULIA (O.S.)
                        It's leaking.  It's been leaking for
                        two weeks.

                                 DAVIS (distant)
                        The refrigerator's leaking...

           Davis is a man content with being content.  Handsome in a
           way that makes life just a little bit easier.  

                                 JULIA (O.S.)
                        Please don't do that... that thing
                        where you repeat part of what I say
                        so I'll think you're paying attention.

                                 DAVIS 
                        I'm not doing anything.  The
                        refrigerator's leaking.  I didn't notice.

                                 JULIA (O.S.)
                        You don't notice anything, Davis. 
                        You're in you're own little Davis-
                        world.  You don't pay attention.

           The city reflects in his vacant eyes.  Cars passing, people
           passing, life passing.  All a blur. 

                                 DAVIS
                        You think there's other worlds out
                        there?  Like planets with people or
                        some other kind of life form?

                                 JULIA (O.S.)
                        What?  
                                 DAVIS
                        What? 

                                 JULIA (O.S.)
                        The refrigerator.

           He faces forward.  Still not looking at her.

                                 DAVIS
                        Oh, right.  Just call the guy.

                                 JULIA (O.S.)
                        What guy?  There's no guy.

                                 DAVIS
                        There's a guy for everything.

                                 JULIA (O.S.)
                        Can't you fix it?  My father gave
                        you those tools.

                                 DAVIS
                        I have tools?

                                 JULIA (O.S.)
                        Yeah.  From two Christmases ago.

                                 DAVIS (almost impressed)
                        Huh.  I have tools.

                                 JULIA (O.S.)
                        Wait... three Christmases.

           Davis sits quietly.  His wife is waiting for an answer. 
           She's always waiting for an answer.

                                 JULIA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Davis?

           As he finally turns to offer his full attention, LOOKING
           DIRECTLY INTO THE CAMERA...

           SMASH.  The most horrible sound in the world.  METAL
           COLLAPSING around human life.  We're thrown into DARKNESS...

           NO SOUND but the LIGHT THUMP of a HUMAN HEARTBEAT.  It's
           perfect.  A finely tuned instrument.

           EXT. MANHATTAN STREET (CAR WRECK) -- EVENING

           The next moments are FLASHES, in and out of DARKNESS,  all
           beneath the steady lull of the beating heart...

           -- Flashing lights, Scattered glass, Traffic piling up.  

           -- An ambulance.  Davis sitting on the curb, dazed.
           -- Paramedics racing against the clock.  Precious seconds.

           But the DARKNESS wins out.  The HEARTBEAT COMES TO A STOP.  

                                 PHIL (over black) (V.O.)
                        Davis...

           A steady voice.  

                                 PHIL (over black) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Davis...

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING AREA. -- LATER

           FADE IN ON Davis, fast asleep.  His clothes are dirty, bloody. 

                                 PHIL (V.O.)
                        Davis.

           Davis opens his eyes to find his father-in-law, PHIL EASTMAN,
           (late 60's), an imposing figure of authority and strength.  

                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        She's gone.

           INT. OPERATING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Davis stands in the EMPTY O.R. 

           He looks at the instruments -- the pumps, the tubes, the
           monitors.  Everything is quiet.  At rest.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- LATER

           Davis wanders down the hall, a HOLLOW ECHO in each step. 
           Fading behind him, a GRIEVING FAMILY.

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING AREA. -- MOMENTS LATER

           Davis finds himself in another waiting area.  He stands there. 
           Not sure what to do next.  He looks left... A VENDING MACHINE. 
           He JIGGLES the change in his pocket.

           AT THE VENDING MACHINE.  Davis drops coins in the slot. 
           Presses a button...

           A pack of PEANUT M&M's pushes forward with a MECHANICAL GROAN. 
           Then, they stop... STUCK.  The candy hangs there.  Davis
           waits, expectant.  But the machine is silent.

           He TAPS the glass... no luck.  He BANGS the side... nothing. 
           The M&M's just hanging, staring back at him.  

           Davis walks to the RECEPTION DESK.  A NURSE is watching with
           a saddened expression.  She notices the BLOOD on his shirt.
                                 DAVIS
                        That machine over there... my candy
                        got stuck.

                                 NURSE
                        I noticed.  It happens sometimes.

                                 DAVIS
                        Do you have a key or something?  Can
                        we open it up?

                                 NURSE
                        I'm sorry, no.  I don't have a key.  

           He digs in his empty pockets.  Glances back at the machine. 
           Completely lost.

                                 DAVIS 
                        Can I get a refund then?

                                 NURSE
                        I don't... I mean, the machine doesn't
                        belong to the hospital.  It's a
                        vending company.  I could ask, but...

           Her voice trails off, lost in Davis's stare.  She reaches
           for her purse.  Starts digging...

                                 NURSE (CONT'D)
                        How much was it?

                                 DAVIS
                        Wait... I don't want you to pay. 
                        That's not the point.

                                 NURSE 
                        No, it's okay... I've got a ton of
                        change in here.  I'm always trying to
                        get rid of it.  Probably have like
                        ten dollars in change. 
                             (then)
                        Here.  Is this enough?

           She holds out a handful of coins.  Davis looks exhausted.  

                                 DAVIS
                        It's okay.  Really.  

           He walks away.  The nurse watches him go.

           BACK TO THE VENDING MACHINE.  The candy still hanging there. 
           Davis stares at it.  He notices a sticker on the glass...
           "SECOND GENERATION VENDING CO.  For suggestions and
           complaints, please write us at P.O. BOX 1334 Princeton Avenue,
           Toms River, NJ 08753." 

           Davis reaches inside his jacket pocket.
           INT. HOME/FOYER -- MORNING

           Davis hangs his coat.  He steps through the FOYER AREA and
           disappears OFF SCREEN.  A moment later, he reappears.  And
           TAKES OFF HIS SHOES.  He steps forward again.

           INT. HOME/ DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Davis checks his VOICEMAIL on a speaker phone.

                                 VOICEMALE (female voice) (O.S.)
                        Davis, it's Mom and Dad...
                             (Dad's voice)
                        Son, we're on our way...
                             (Mom's voice)
                        We tried your cell phone, but...

           BEEP... Davis ERASES it.  Then, he looks at the phone.  Pushes
           another button... "OUTGOING MESSAGE."

                                 JULIA'S VOICE
                        Hi, you've reached Julia and Davis. 
                        We can't come to the phone, so please
                        leave a message.

           BEEP.  Davis stands there for a moment.  Then walks away.

           INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT

           Davis opens the refrigerator door and grabs a carton of milk. 
           As he's closing the door, he notices something...

           A DRIP.  He looks closer to see a small pool of water clinging
           to the ceiling of the fridge.  It's LEAKING.  He rubs the
           liquid in his fingers.  Interesting.  

           INT. KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

           Davis sits at the kitchen table eating a bowl of cereal. 
           The house settles quietly. 

           INT. MASTER BATH -- NIGHT

           Davis in his boxer shorts, brushing his teeth thoroughly. 
           He rinses and places his toothbrush in the porcelain holder. 
           He looks at the OTHER TOOTHBRUSH.

           He takes it out.  Throws it in the garbage.  

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           A large bedroom.  Flat screen TV.  The glow of an infomercial
           on Davis's tired face.  He lays on his side of the bed.

           His eyes are half-mast, starting to close.  On the TV, an
           ICON APPEARS... "SLEEP TIMER."  It begins to count down...  
           10, 9, 8... eyes fading... 5, 4, 3... they close softly. 
           "GOOD NIGHT."  The TV turns itself off.  

           INT. HOME/FOYER -- MORNING

           The door opens.  DAVIS'S PARENTS (late 60's), stand there
           with their luggage.  They embrace him.  He doesn't move.

           INT. ANDERSON FUNERAL HOME -- DAY

           Davis stands in a RECEIVING LINE.  Shaking hands with a slew
           of UNFAMILIAR FACES.  He looks down the line to Phil and his
           wife, MEG (60's).  She's heavily sedated, leaning on Phil.  

           INT. LIMOUSINE -- DAY

           Davis rides with his parents and in-laws.  Nobody's talking. 
           He looks out the tinted window to see the FUNERAL PROCESSION. 
           A line of cars following with their HEADLIGHTS ON. 

           EXT. CEMETERY -- DAY

           Davis watches calmly as the CASKET is lowered into the ground. 
           Meg is weak with grief.  Phil holds her tight.  

           INT. PHIL AND MEG'S BROWNSTONE -- DAY

           A grand living room.  Classic, elegant.  Davis sits on a
           couch, a plate of food on his lap, squeezed between his
           parents.  STRANGERS mull about, speaking in hushed tones.

           INT. BATHROOM -- LATER

           Davis is SOBBING in front of the mirror.  It's overly
           dramatic... a man who has lost everything.

           But instantly, he stops.  He was FAKING IT.  He regards his
           reflection.  Then, tries again... really forcing it... 

           But it's still no good.  He gives up.  Tucks his hands in
           his jacket pockets, defeated.  Something isn't right.  Then,
           he discovers a PIECE OF PAPER in his pocket. 

           INT. PHIL'S STUDY -- NIGHT

           Davis sits behind a dark, mahogany desk.  The VENDING
           INFORMATION set out in front of him.  He takes out a clean
           sheet of paper.  A pen.  And begins to write...

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        Dear Second Generation Vending
                        Company, comma.  This letter is in
                        regards to a poor vending experience
                        at St. Anthony's... no, wait...

           He erases something.  Consults the vending info.  Continues...
                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        ... In regards to vending machine
                        No. 714, located in the Intensive
                        Care Unit of St. Anthony's Hospital,
                        period.  I put three quarters in
                        your machine and proceeded to push
                        "B2," which should have given me the
                        Peanut M&M's, period.  Regrettably,
                        it did not.  I found this upsetting
                        as I was very hungry, and also, my
                        wife had died ten minutes earlier. 
                        I'm not saying that was your fault. 
                        We were in a car accident. 
                        Remarkably, I escaped without a
                        scratch.  I'm not trying to dramatize
                        my claim.  I just want to be thorough. 
                             (beat)
                        Maybe I should start from the beginning.

           Davis thinks for a moment.  Then, puts pen to paper...

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I get up every morning at six...

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM -- MORNING (FLASHBACK)

           Davis's eyes pop open and he ROLLS OUT OF BED.  We HOLD ON a
           DIGITAL CLOCK that reads 5:59.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        I work in the financial district, so
                        it's important to get an early start.

           The clock turns to 6:00.  The ALARM SOUNDS.  

           INT. SHOWER -- MORNING (CONTINUED FLASHBACK)

           We see his silhouette through the steamed glass door.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        Not to imply it's more important
                        than say, a baker or toll collector...
                        those are fine jobs.  Respectable
                        jobs.  I just meant that I commute.

           INT. NJ TRANSIT TRAIN -- MORNING (CONTINUED FLASHBACK)

           Davis sits on the train.  The NEW YORK TIMES on his lap.  

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        I catch the "7:15" out of Hazlet. 
                        It's pretty much the same crowd during
                        the week.  

           An OLDER MAN in a YANKEES CAP is talking his ear off.
                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        John works the ground crew at Yankee
                        Stadium.  The first time we met, he
                        asked what I did and I told him... 
                             (to John)
                        Retail mattresses.

           John smiles... a new friend in the retail mattress business.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I don't know why.  It just popped
                        into my head.  One time he offered
                        me box seats in exchange for a deal
                        on a California King, but I said I
                        was a Sox fan.  We stopped talking
                        after that.  I was glad because I
                        hate baseball and couldn't stand his
                        hot coffee breath.  

           THE CAMERA TILTS to a RED HANDLE above his head... "Pull
           handle in case of emergency."  

           EXT. CITY SIDEWALK -- MORNING (CONTINUED FLASHBACK)

           Suits and ties passing in every direction.  Davis shuffles
           along with his BRIEFCASE.  A tired face in the tired crowd.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        I never thought I'd be one of those
                        people who carried a briefcase.  It
                        always reminds me of carrying a lunch
                        box to school.  Do they still make those?

           EXT. CITY STREET CORNER -- MORNING

           Davis stops at A STREET VENDOR.  They make an exchange...

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        I usually grab a soy latte and bran
                        muffin on the corner of 9th and Lex...

           He takes a careful sip, continues down the block...

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        That leaves me just enough time to
                        get to work and settle into my day...

           INT. EASTMAN RITTER (BATHROOM) -- MORNING (FLASHBACK)

           Davis hurries into a stall.  WE HEAR his BELT hit the floor.

           INT. EASTMAN, RITTER (HALLWAY) -- MORNING (FLASHBACK)

           Davis walks the hall of this upscale office.  Spacious and
           efficient.  Everyone belongs.
                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        Julia's father is a founding partner
                        at the investment firm I work at. 
                        Nepotism in its truest form.  They
                        started grooming me when I was twenty-
                        five.  Grooming.  I hate that word. 
                        Monkeys groom.

           STOCK FOOTAGE OF MONKEYS GROOMING EACH OTHER AT THE ZOO.

           INT. DAVIS'S OFFICE -- DAY (CONTINUED FLASHBACK)

           On the phone, the Manhattan skyline at his back.  

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        It's a small firm, but we handle
                        quite a bit of money.  I don't want
                        to say how much because I think that
                        would be inappropriate.  
                             (beat)
                        Okay, it's around four hundred million.

           EXT. THE GARDEN CAFE -- DAY (CONTINUED FLASHBACK)

           We watch through a street-side window.  A lunch meeting with
           DAVIS, PHIL AND TWO OTHER MEN.  Jackets slung over the chairs.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        Equity funds, retirement plans, stocks,
                        bonds, you name it.  But none of it
                        is real.  Nothing to hold in my hands.  

           The bill comes and Davis reaches for it.  Phil quickly
           intercepts.  But not in a generous way.  It's a power thing.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Just numbers, computer codes being
                        transferred electronically through
                        the air.  It's right in front of us.

           We turn away from the window, to the busy mid-town traffic
           and see BILLIONS OF DIGITAL NUMBERS RACING THROUGH THE AIR.

           INT. EASTMAN, RITTER / CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY (FLASHBACK)

           A long table, about 9 men and women.  PHIL STANDS at the
           head, talking to a SPEAKER PHONE.  Davis twists in his chair.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        Philip Eastman.  My father-in-law. 
                        Phil, Phil, Phil.  I think the acronym
                        is hysterical.  I know Phil is spelled
                        "P.H.", but it still makes me laugh
                        in my head.

           Davis smiles ever-so-slightly.
           INT. FRATHOUSE -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           A college party.  A YOUNGER DAVIS stumbles through with a
           red solo cup.  He spots a GIRL through the crowd.  

                                 DAVIS  (V.O.)
                        I met Julia at a party.  A mutual
                        friend said she thought I was hot.  

               They sit and talk.  All we see of Julia is her LONG BROWN HAIR.

                                 DAVIS  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        We had sex that first night and I
                        didn't talk to her again for three
                        weeks.  Then I saw her out with Kevin
                        Timmons who was a really good-looking
                        guy and that made me jealous.  So I
                        called her the next day.

           INT. CHURCH -- DAY (FLASHBACK)

           A wedding ceremony.  Davis looks at Julia's veil-covered
           face.  CLOSE ON Phil and Meg watching from the front pew. 

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        I don't think Phil liked me much at
                        first.  I didn't come from money, I
                        wasn't all that ambitious, and I
                        puked on the ice sculpture at our
                        engagement party.  

           Not the most excited look on Phil's face.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Also, he told me once... "I don't
                        like you, Davis."

           INT. COUNTRY CLUB -- EVENING (FLASHBACK)

           The wedding reception.  No expense spared.  Davis dances
           with his new bride.  A content smile. 

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        Julia was a nice girl, a good person. 
                        She snorted when she laughed and cried
                        every time they showed footage of the
                        towers falling.  Other than that, I
                        didn't know a Goddamn thing about who
                        she really was.  We were strangers
                        with the same address... which I suppose
                        brings us into some new territory.  I
                        wasn't in love with my wife.  
           INT. PHIL'S STUDY -- PRESENT

           Davis lifts his hand from the page.  A realization.  A weight
           lifted simply from writing it down.  He goes back to it. 

                                 DAVIS (writing) (V.O.)
                        Perhaps you'll find this information
                        irrelevant in your deliberation of
                        my refund.  But I think you deserve
                        the whole truth.  You can contact me
                        at 732-270-8204. 
                             (beat)
                        Sincerely, Davis Mitchell.  

           INT. EASTMAN, RITTER (HALLWAY) -- MONDAY MORNING

           Davis walks the hall, an ENVELOPE IN HIS HAND.  Colleagues 
           slow to watch him pass.

                                 DAVIS
                        Morning, morning...

           INT. EASTMAN, RITTER / ASSISTANT'S DESK -- MOMENTS LATER

           Davis reaches his assistant's desk.  AMY (20's), looks up at
           him, a loss for words.  He retrieves a stack of MESSAGES.

                                 DAVIS
                        Morning, Amy.  Is this everything?

                                 AMY (re: messages)
                        Yeah.  That's it.  

                                 DAVIS
                        Can you put this in outgoing mail,
                        please?  It's very important.

           He hands her the ENVELOPE and continues into his office.  

                                 AMY (quietly)
                        Okay.

           INT. DAVIS'S OFFICE -- MORNING

           Davis settles in behind his desk.  Flips through the stack
           of messages.  Amy taps on the door.  Hesitant. 

                                 DAVIS
                        What's up?

                                 AMY
                        I just, um... I wasn't expecting you
                        today.  They said you weren't...
                             (collecting herself)
                        I'm really sorry, Davis.
                                 DAVIS (preoccupied)
                        Why?

           She looks at him.  Awkward.  

                                 DAVIS (thoughtful)  (CONT'D)
                        Oh.  Right.  Thank you.  
                             (then)
                        Could you get me the figures for the
                        Alderman portfolio?  And also, get
                        Jim Geraghty on the phone to see if
                        we can push lunch to two.  I've got
                        some catching up.

                                 AMY 
                        I canceled that.

                                 DAVIS
                        Why?

                                 AMY
                        Well, because... I didn't think... 
                             (then)
                        I'll call him.

           She retreats.  Davis types at his computer.

           INT. BATHROOM -- DAY

           Davis enters the spacious bathroom.  Three stalls.  Three
           sinks.  You could eat off the tile floor.  

           INT. BATHROOM STALL -- CONTINUOUS

           He pushes the metal door.  It CREAKS open.  He steps inside,
           closes the door.  It CREAKS again... catching his attention.

           Davis SWINGS the door back and forth several times... it
           CREAKS consistently.  He examines the HINGES, top and bottom.

                                 DAVIS (interesting)
                        Huh.  

           INT. DAVIS'S OFFICE -- DAY

           Davis steps back into his office.  Phil is sitting behind
           Davis's desk, waiting in his overcoat.  He needs a shave.

                                 DAVIS (stopping, surprised)
                        Phil.  Hey. 

                                 PHIL
                        They called the house.  Told me you
                        were up here.
                                 DAVIS
                        They did?  Okay.

           Davis sits in the guest chair.  

                                 PHIL
                        Is everything alright, Davis?

                                 DAVIS
                        Yeah, fine.  I mean, you know...
                        considering.
                             (then, switching gears)
                        I spoke with Clayton Rice this
                        morning.  I think I talked him off
                        the ledge... with that whole thing. 

           Phil looks at him for a concerned beat.  

                                 PHIL
                        Why don't we grab a drink?

                                 DAVIS
                        Actually, I'm kinda buried, Phil.  

                                 PHIL
                        Davis.  Let's grab a drink.

           INT. JASON'S BAR -- DAY

           Davis and Phil sit at a small table.  Dim lighting.  A SERVER
           places drinks neatly in front of them. 

                                 PHIL
                        Ya know the drinks run about fifteen
                        bucks a pop here?  I don't get it.

           Nor does Davis.  The men are quiet.  Phil stirs his cocktail. 

                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        We haven't really talked.  Not since
                        everything.
                             (then)
                        I loved Julia very much.  A father's
                        love.  It's different from a husband's
                        love.  There's a bond you can't put
                        into words.  I'll remember moments. 
                             (reminiscent)
                        A little girl on her horse.  Pealing
                        glue off her fingers after art class. 
                        Sifting through trash for a lost
                        retainer.

           Phil forces a tiny smile.   
                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        You're like me, Davis.  You keep
                        your emotions close to the vest. 
                        That's good.  It's strong.  All that
                        crying and carrying on... it's not
                        for us.  But you have to be careful. 
                        Something like this can break a man. 

           As Phil continues, Davis LOOKS OUT OVER THE BAR...

                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        Repairing the human heart is like
                        repairing an automobile.  You have
                        to take everything apart.  The anger,
                        the love, the loss.  

           Davis notices the dark wood, the soft leather...

                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        Examine everything and decide what's
                        important.  What'll make you stronger?  

           The lighting design, the attractive bartenders...

                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        Then you can put it all back together. 
                        Do you understand what I'm saying?

                                 DAVIS
                        It's the atmosphere.

                                 PHIL
                        What?

                                 DAVIS
                        That's why the drinks are so
                        expensive.  You're paying for the
                        atmosphere.  It just occurred to me.

           He indicates the atmosphere around him.

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        It's almost noir-ish.  

           Davis finds it amusing.  Phil doesn't.  

           INT. CADILLAC SEDAN/ BACK SEAT -- LATER

           Gliding along.  Phil and Davis in the back.  Tinted windows.  

                                 PHIL
                        Now, there's some other business
                        that needs looking after.  Julia's
                        insurance policy.
                                 DAVIS
                        Ah, right.  Insurance.

                                 PHIL
                        Everything was set up to go to her
                        spouse, but seeing as you're quite
                        comfortable... I've been generous
                        with your salary, bonuses, incentives,
                        what-have-you... I'd like to take
                        the money and start a foundation in
                        Julia's name.

                                 DAVIS
                        Foundation.  Interesting.

                                 PHIL
                        A merit-based scholarship.  Something
                        we can award annually to one student
                        who is most deserving.  

                                 DAVIS
                        How much are we talking about?

                                 PHIL
                        It's significant.  

           A moment as Phil adjust the climate control.  

                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        One point seven.  

           Davis's expression doesn't falter.  

                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        Invested properly, we'd never have
                        to touch the principal.  Steven's
                        setting up the whole thing.
                             (then, important)
                        This will be her legacy.

                                 DAVIS (agreeing)
                        Legacy.

           EXT. TRAIN STATION -- LATER

           Davis on the platform, a face in the crowd.  He's DAYDREAMING.

                                 DAVIS
                        Legacy.  Legacy.  Legacy.  Legacy.

           A salty OLD MAN turns to him...

                                 OLD MAN
                        What a stupid word.  It sounds like
                        a car. 
                                 DAVIS
                        I agree.  Something with heated seats
                        and a navigation system.

           They look up at a BILLBOARD towering high above.  It shows a
           SLEEK AUTOMOBILE.  "Introducing the Acura Legacy... How do
           you want to be remembered?"

                                 OLD MAN 
                        Stupid car-word.

           INT. DAVIS'S HOUSE (OFFICE) -- NIGHT

           Davis clicks on his DESK LAMP and sits down in his ROBE.  He
           starts writing on a YELLOW LEGAL PAD... 

                                 DAVIS  (V.O.)
                        Dear Second Generation Vending, comma. 
                        This is Davis Mitchell... again. 
                        There have been some recent
                        developments in my claim for
                        reimbursement and I'd like to
                        represent myself as accurately as
                        possible.  New paragraph.

           EXT. DAVIS'S DRIVEWAY -- NIGHT

           Davis is in his SUV, waiting for the garage door to open. 
           As he starts to pull forward, he STOPS SHORT...

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        First, there was a strange package
                        blocking my garage...

           INT. GARAGE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Davis stands next to his mother.  Both looking at AN ENORMOUS
           BOX set just inside the garage entrance.

                                 DAVIS
                        What is it?

                                 MOTHER
                        I think it's a cappuccino machine. 
                        One of those big ones.

                                 DAVIS
                        I didn't order a cappuccino machine.

                                 MOTHER
                        It was in Julia's name.  It's big.

           Davis looks at the box.  Interesting.  

                                 DAVIS
                        Huh. 
           EXT. DRIVEWAY -- MORNING

           Davis walks down the driveway.  Suit, tie, briefcase.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        Then, my dad was fertilizing the
                        lawn... at seven in the morning.

           Davis looks over to find his father spreading FERTILIZER.

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Dad?  What are you doing?

                                 FATHER
                        It's the season, Davis.  You have to
                        do this early.  Get the soil ready.

                                 DAVIS
                        I have someone for that.  

                                 FATHER
                        I don't mind.

                                 DAVIS
                        They come and do the whole block,
                        Dad.  I pay them.  A lot.

                                 FATHER
                        Oh.

           His father stops.  Chilled breath in front of his face.  The
           neighborhood still asleep.

                                 FATHER (CONT'D)
                        Do they know about gypsy moths?

                                 DAVIS
                        Gypsy moths?  I don't know, what
                        about them?

                                 FATHER
                        They'll destroy your trees.  You
                        should spray.    

                                 DAVIS 
                        A moth?

                                 FATHER
                        It starts out a caterpillar.  They
                        eat the leaves and lay eggs.  Then,
                        the trees die.  

           Davis looks at the TOWERING OAKS scattered about his yard.
                                 DAVIS (very interesting)
                        And they're coming here?  To this
                        neighborhood?

                                 FATHER
                        They don't know for sure.  You should
                        tell your guy to spray.  Just in case.

           They both stand there.  Then, his dad starts spreading
           fertilizer again.  Davis lets him go.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        And of course, the train incident...

           INT. NJ TRANSIT TRAIN -- EVENING

           Davis is on the train.  He notices John in his Yankees cap. 
           He watches him for a moment, then makes a decision... goes
           to SIT NEXT TO HIM.

           John seems uncomfortable by the sudden proximity.  Davis
           finally engages...

                                 DAVIS 
                        I think there's something I should
                        tell you.

           John looks at him.  This sounds serious.

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        I'm not in the mattress business. 
                        I'm in finance.

           John is nonreactive.  

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        I don't know why I said mattresses. 
                        I guess I didn't think I'd see you
                        every day for the next ten years.
                             (then, venting)
                        And I'm not a Sox fan either.  I
                        hate baseball altogether.  I find it
                        excruciating to watch on television.  
                             (off John's look)
                        You think I'm a dick.

                                 JOHN
                        Yes.

           The train LIGHTS FLICKER.  They're quiet again, but a tension
           has seemingly been lifted.  John takes off his hat.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        I don't work for the Yankees anymore.  

           He fixes the hair on his balding head.  A little embarrassed.    
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        They fired me two years ago after a
                        drainage problem ruined the visitor's
                        bullpen.  Now I do security for Parade
                        of Shoes in Midtown.
                             (then)
                        I never told my family.  It's a
                        bullshit job.  My prick boss is thirty
                        years younger than me.  I wanna smash
                        his prick face.

           They sit together.  Bonded in honesty.  Then, like a bomb...

                                 DAVIS
                        I didn't love my wife.

           Once again, John is nonreactive.   

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        She's gone now and I don't even feel
                        sad.  I don't feel pain.  

                                 JOHN
                        What do you feel?

           Davis thinks for a moment.  Then, shakes his head.  NOTHING. 
           He faces forward, a moment of respect for this small but
           undeniable truth.  HOLD ON DAVIS as his eyes glance upward...

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        I couldn't tell you why I did it. 
                        Maybe because I was finally being
                        honest... and that's a scary, wonderful
                        feeling that deserves an equally scary,
                        wonderful action.  Or maybe
                        subconsciously, I had always wondered
                        what would happen... and for a split
                        second it felt like the perfect moment
                        to find out.  None-the-less, it was a
                        legitimate emergency.

           He rises from his seat and PULLS THE RED HANDLE.  As the
           BREAKS LOCK UP and passengers are thrown forward.  WE FREEZE
           ON DAVIS -- TUMBLING OVER THE WOMAN IN FRONT OF HIM. 

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (BACK OFFICE) -- NIGHT

           Davis sits in a chair, flanked by TWO OFFICIAL AGENTS.  

                                 AGENT #1
                        So, that's when you pulled it?

                                 DAVIS
                        That's right.  
                                 AGENT #2
                        And you realized that would stop the
                        train, correct?

                                 DAVIS
                        Well, I wasn't positive.  I mean, I
                        assumed it would.  I was hoping. 

           The agents appear baffled.  A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN steps in
           and WHISPERS to one of them.

                                 POLICEMAN (whispering to agent)
                        His parents are here.  Apparently,
                        this guy's wife just died.

           INT. RENTAL CAR -- LATER

           CLOSE ON Davis riding in the back-seat, like a child.  His
           mother driving, dad in the passenger seat.  Somber concern.

                                 MOTHER
                        Davis, maybe you should come stay
                        with us for awhile, take it easy. 
                        We have the extra room.

           Davis looks around at the back-seat, enjoying the experience.

                                 DAVIS
                        You guys remember when you used to
                        drive me to the ice-skating rink when
                        I was little and I would make you
                        drop me off in back 'cause I was too
                        embarrassed to be seen with my parents?

                                 MOTHER (in mirror)
                        Yes, honey... it's okay.  All kids
                        go through that phase.

                                 DAVIS
                        I know.  I was just thinking about
                        it.  Riding in the back-seat and
                        everything.  Most times I wouldn't
                        even go skating.  We'd go smoke
                        cigarettes in the woods and make fun
                        of the fat girls in their little
                        figure skating outfits.

           Davis smiles fondly.  His parents share a silent exchange.

           EXT. CITY STREET/ POST OFFICE BOX -- DAY

           Davis drops a LETTER into a BLUE POST OFFICE MAILBOX.

           INT. BUILDING LOBBY -- DAY

           Davis hands a LETTER directly to a POSTMAN. 
           EXT. DAVIS'S DRIVEWAY -- DAY

           He tosses a LETTER into his MAILBOX and raises the flag.

           EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM -- MORNING

           Davis waits for the 7:15.  He sits inside one of the heated
           alcoves, writing on his YELLOW PAD.  

           The CAMERA SWEEPS down to the end of the bench to find a WOMAN
           WATCHING HIM.  She's bundled beneath a heavy winter jacket, a
           wool cap pulled snug over her head.  She stares at Davis with
           familiar eyes.  Curious eyes.  Like she wants to know everything.

           Davis glances up in her direction... the woman redirects her
           gaze.  A moment later... she looks over again.

           EXT. CITY SIDEWALK -- MORNING

           Davis navigates through morning foot traffic, a little more
           lively.  He stops at his usual STREET VENDOR for his latte.

           As he walks off, the CAMERA SETTLES on THE WOMAN bundled in
           the winter jacket, standing in the b.g.  She watches him go.

           INT. HOME/FOYER -- DAY

           Davis sets his parents LUGGAGE down and helps his mother
           with her coat.  She looks at him with a sadness.  

                                 DAVIS (reassuring)
                        Everything's fine.  I'll be fine.  

           He grabs their bags.  They follow him OUT THE DOOR...

                                 FATHER  (O.S.)
                        Remember to tell your guy to spray.

           INT. NEWARK LIBERTY AIRPORT -- DAY

           Davis sits just outside the ticketing area.  DAYDREAMING. 
           Beyond the window, the jet fuel haze left by a 747.

                                 DAVIS  (V.O.)
                        Dear Vending Company.  My parents
                        left for Florida this afternoon and
                        I stayed at the airport an extra two
                        hours watching people walk back and
                        forth with their luggage in tow.  

           SUITCASES wheel past from every crowded angle. 

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I find I'm suddenly filled with...
                        wait... overwhelmed by... a growing
                        sense of cu-ri-osity.  Period.
           HUNDREDS of BAGS... THOUSANDS of BAGS...

                                 DAVIS  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        What are in these bags?  I wanna
                        know what these people can't do
                        without for four days in Buffalo.  I
                        wanna go through every one of them
                        and dump their shit in a huge pile.

           WE SEE a 25-FOOT PILE of clothes and other travel items in
           the middle of the terminal.  A luggage landfill.  Next to
           it, a NATIONAL GUARD OFFICER in full uniform.

                                 DAVIS  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And the National Guard guy.  I want
                        to hold his gun. 

           The officer walks over to Davis and hands him his M-16. 
           Davis weighs it in his arms.  An ALARM SOUNDS...

                                 DAVIS  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I want to protect my country.

           A TERRORIST RUNS FULL STEAM THROUGH THE TERMINAL... FEDERAL
           AGENTS ON HIS HEELS.  Davis lifts the weapon, takes aim...

           And FIRES. 

           INT. SUV -- DAY

           The truck route.  Davis drives down the JERSEY TURNPIKE.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        I'm starting to notice things, Dearest
                        Vending Company.  Things I never saw
                        before.  Okay, maybe I saw them.  I
                        just wasn't paying attention.  

           Davis looks out his window at the passing landscape...

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        For some reason, everything has become
                        a metaphor.  

           A DEAD DEER, A BROKEN DOWN TRUCK, "LAST REST 20 MILES."

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Metaphor, metaphor, metaphor.

           A GIANT UPROOTED PINE TREE.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Metaphor.  I am the pine tree.  No,
                        wait... I am the storm that uprooted
                        the pine tree.  No, wait... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                             (even better)
                        I am the gypsy moth that ate the leaves
                        and laid the eggs that killed the pine
                        tree.  They forgot to spray for me.

           EXT. GARAGE -- NIGHT

           Davis searches the SHELVES in his immaculate garage.  

                                 DAVIS  (V.O.)
                        There's something else, Vending Co. 
                        Something I haven't been able to get
                        off my mind.  

           He stops.  He's found what he's looking for.  HE REACHES...

                                 DAVIS  (CONT'D)
                        I went and got my tools from three
                        Christmases ago because I couldn't
                        take it one second longer...  

           INT. REFRIGERATOR -- MOMENTS LATER

           The DOOR OPENS.  Davis looks at the pool of water... DRIP. 

                                 DAVIS  (V.O.)
                        The Goddamn refrigerator was leaking.
                        I had to do something.

           INT. KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

           Davis opens his TOOLBOX and sifts through his shiny tools.

                                 DAVIS  (searching) (V.O.)
                        Now, I wouldn't say I'm handy by any
                        means.  Mechanically retarded would
                        be closer to the truth.  But Phil
                        said it himself, "If you wanna fix
                        something, you gotta take it apart
                        and figure out what's important."
                             (finds the right tool)
                        So, I tore the fucker to pieces.

           In HYPER SPEED, Davis goes to work on the refrigerator.  He
           empties the contents first, then begins to deconstruct it
           piece by piece until there's just a metal skeleton remaining.

           FINISHED.  Davis looks over the dismantled refrigerator with
           a look of UTTER SATISFACTION.  Maybe not an understanding of
           how it works, but he can see how it's put together.

           His cell PHONE RINGS.  Davis looks at it, curious.  Answers.

                                 DAVIS (ON PHONE)
                        Hello?
                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Is this Davis Mitchell? 

                                 DAVIS (cautious)
                        Yes.  Who's this?

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE  (O.S.)
                        This is Karen Moreno.  From Second
                        Generation Vending Company.  
                             (then)
                        I'm with customer service.

           Davis tightens.  

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        Is this regarding my complaint letter?

                                 KAREN  (O.S.)
                        You're complaint letters... yes. 
                        There have been four.  So far. 

           He looks on the table... LETTER #5.  The smoking gun.

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        Okay.  And you're with the customer
                        service department?

                                 KAREN  (O.S.)
                        I am the customer service department. 
                        It's just me.  

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        Do you usually make your customer
                        service calls at two in the morning?

                                 KAREN  (O.S.)
                        Not usually.  No.  Never.

                                 DAVIS (interesting)
                        Huh.

           Davis begins to pace.  The remnants of an expensive
           refrigerator at his feet.  

                                 DAVIS (on phone) (CONT'D)
                        I didn't think anyone actually read
                        those things.  I mean, I was just
                        venting.   

                                 KAREN  (O.S.)
                        They made me cry.

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        What?
                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Your letters made me cry.  Mr.
                        Mitchell, I've never read anything
                        so honest in my life.
                             (confiding)
                        I took them home with me.  They're
                        in the nightstand next to my bed. 

           A long silence while Davis sorts this whole thing out.

                                 KAREN  (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        This is embarrassing.  I shouldn't
                        have called.

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        No, wait... it's okay.
                             (then)
                        Karen Moreno?  That's your name?

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Yeah.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           SPLIT SCREEN: On one side, DAVIS is in his SUV, driving
           through the empty night.  The OTHER SIDE is BLANK... 

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        Moreno means "brown hair" in Spanish. 
                        Did you know that?

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Yes, I did.

           A SKETCH BEGINS TO TAKE FORM ON THE BLANK SCREEN... A
           NONDESCRIPT OUTLINE OF A WOMAN... 

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        Do you have brown hair?

                                 KAREN  (O.S.)
                        Uh-huh.

           LONG BROWN HAIR and BIG BROWN EYES fall into place...

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        And brown eyes?

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Sometimes they're hazel.  

           The brown eyes are ERASED and replaced with HAZEL.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        Are you of Spanish decent?
                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        My grandmother was from Cuba.  Why
                        do you...?

                                 DAVIS (interrupting) (V.O.)
                        I'm painting a mental picture.

                                 KAREN  (embarrassed)
                        Oh-God-no, please, I don't...
                             (beat)
                        How does it look?

           The narrow-waisted frame is replaced with a SEXY LATINA BODY.   

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        I think we should meet.  Where are
                        you?

           An outline of NEW JERSEY forms around the woman. 

           We ZOOM IN on the COAST.  The figure is standing in DUNEGRASS
           in front of BREAKING WAVES.  A blue, sunny day.  

           EXT. NEPTUNE DINER -- LATER

           The SUV pulls into the lot of this greasy spoon.  Plenty of
           parking at this hour.

           INT. NEPTUNE DINER -- MOMENTS LATER

           Davis enters to bad fluorescent lighting and stale coffee.  
           A MINI JUKEBOX at every booth.  

           He sits at a booth by the window.  The WAITRESS approaches.  

                                 DAVIS
                        Hi.  Is Karen Moreno here yet?

                                 WAITRESS
                        Who?

                                 DAVIS
                        Karen Moreno?  Brown hair, sometimes
                        hazel eyes... Hispanic like her name
                        suggests.  

           The waitress looks at him, deadpan.  

           INT. NEPTUNE DINER -- LATER

           Davis has a half-eaten plate of pancakes in front of him. 
           Still alone.  His phone RINGS...

                                 DAVIS (answering)
                        Hello?  
                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Hi.  It's me.  It's Karen. 

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        Hi.  Where are you?  

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Well, I was there... in the diner. 
                        I sat at a booth for a few minutes. 
                        I even played a song on the little
                        baby jukebox.  And then, I don't
                        know... I got sad.  So, I left.

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        Oh.   

           Davis is disappointed.  He glances at the baby jukebox.

                                 DAVIS  (CONT'D)
                        What song did you play?  

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        It was, um, "Crazy On You."  By Heart.

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        A "Heart" song?  That made you sad?

                                 KAREN  (O.S.)
                        Not so much the song... it just
                        reminded me of a this time when me
                        and Kelly Carlysle stole her mom's
                        car to go to 7-11 at three in the
                        morning.  We were singing it at the
                        top of our lungs.
                             (then, exhaling)
                        How are your pancakes?

                                 DAVIS
                        What? 

           Davis is caught off guard.  He glances around the diner.

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Oh, right... when I got home I decided
                        I was being ridiculous.  So I came back. 
                        I'm in the parking lot.   

           He looks out the window.  Searches the dark lot...

                                 KAREN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        The piece of shit Toyota.

           He sees the Toyota.  A SILHOUETTE in the front seat with the
           GLOWING EMBER of a cigarette.
                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        You're a smoker.

                                 KAREN (exhaling) (O.S.)
                        It's cannibus.  I have a prescription.

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        Oh.  O-kay.

                                 KAREN  (O.S.)
                        What's that?

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        What's what?

                                 KAREN  (O.S.)
                        "O-kay?"  What's that supposed to
                        mean?

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        Nothing.  It's "okay."  It's one of
                        those words you use when you can't
                        think of anything else to say.  

                                 KAREN  (O.S.)
                        It just felt like you were judging.

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        This is a very strange conversation. 
                        Do you think you could come inside?

           The phone goes quiet.  Davis looks out into the dark.  

                                 DAVIS (on phone) (CONT'D)
                        Hello?

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        I'm sorry... it's just, I have this
                        nice image of you... sitting there,
                        eating pancakes in the window.  I
                        don't want to ruin it.

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        Okay, but my image of you is a shadowy
                        figure smoking pot in a parking lot. 
                        To a "Heart" song.  

                                 KAREN (defensive) (O.S.)
                        It's cannibus.  I have a prescription.  

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        O-kay.

                                 KAREN
                        Whatever.  Screw this...
           The Toyota's headlights turn on and Karen PULLS OUT of the
           parking lot.  Davis signals the waitress.

                                 DAVIS 
                        Check.  

           As Davis waits, Karen's car reappears.  She's just circled
           the building.  His PHONE RINGS.  He answers...

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        I'm sorry.  This shit makes me
                        defensive.  Could we start over? 

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        Sure.  Are you coming in now?

           More silence.  She's thinking again.

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Ya know what?  I think I ruined it.  I
                        should just go.  Yeah... I'm gonna go.
                             (decisive)
                        I'm going.

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        Wait, Karen... I have another letter
                        for you.

           She weighs this for a moment.

                                 KAREN  (O.S.)
                        Put it in the mail.

           And she pulls away.  

           INT. EASTMAN, RITTER/CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

           Davis sits at the table with 9 other suits.  He's WRITING ON
           THE TABLE absentmindedly.  STEVEN (30's) has the floor.

                                 STEVEN
                        I definitely think it's doable, Phil. 
                        If their second quarter earnings are
                        an indication of growth... even just
                        two or three net percent, then I
                        think it's a risk worth taking. 

                                 PHIL
                        Well done.  Let's just make sure
                        those numbers are there before we
                        pull the trigger.

           WE SEE what Davis is scribbling on the table... "MORENO." 
           Phil glares from across the table.
                                 PHIL  (CONT'D)
                        Davis, I see you're taking copious
                        notes.  Would you like some paper?

           Davis stops.  The group laughs cautiously.  

                                 DAVIS
                        Sorry. 

                                 PHIL
                        Is there something you'd like to
                        contribute to the discussion? 

           Davis thinks.  There is something...

                                 DAVIS
                        Yes.  Actually, it's more of a question.
                             (gathering)
                        Would any of you consider "Crazy on
                        You" to be a sad song?  That's
                        assuming you're familiar with the
                        Heart catalogue.  

           The room looks at him with quiet sympathy.

                                 DAVIS  (CONT'D)
                        Interesting. 

           INT. BATHROOM -- LATER

           Davis enters.  He walks up to the SECOND STALL and pulls the
           door open... SQUEAK.  He swings it back and forth, the door
           SQUEALING consistently.  Just as he expected.

           Davis takes off his jacket and lays his briefcase down, flips
           the latches.  IT'S FILLED WITH HIS TOOLS.

           SCREWDRIVERS, WRENCHES, A RATCHET SET, A HAMMER... Davis
           chooses a screw driver and sizes it up to a hinge.  It doesn't
           fit.  He tries another.  Perfect.  He starts unscrewing...

           EXT. BATHROOM/ HALLWAY -- LATER

           Steven walks the hall with a cocky stride.  A FEMALE CO-WORKER
           PASSES, he checks out her ass.  Arriving at the Men's Room... 

           INT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Steven steps in and stops short.  Davis stands in front of
           the DISMANTLED STALL wearing a look of accomplishment.  The
           walls and door are on the floor.  The toilet and tile wall
           exposed.  Davis notices Steven.  He's a bit shocked.

                                 DAVIS
                        The door was squeaking.
           INT. ELEVATOR -- MOMENTS LATER

           Davis is headed down, a pleasant look on his face. 

           EXT. ELEVATOR/ LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS

           Davis hops off the elevator... and COLLIDES WITH PHIL... 

                                 PHIL 
                        What's going on, Davis?  What's this
                        nonsense about sad songs and
                        scribbling on tables? 

                                 DAVIS 
                        Sorry, Phil.  I guess I've been a
                        little preoccupied. 

                                 PHIL
                        I don't accept that.  You need to
                        focus now more than ever.  Do you
                        understand? 

           Davis nods.  Phil lets it slide.  He offers a FOLDER.

                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        This is the foundation proposal. 
                        Just the nuts and bolts, but I need
                        you to sign off before we move forward.

                                 DAVIS
                        Yeah, sure.  Where?

           Davis takes a PEN out of his jacket pocket. 

                                 PHIL
                        Don't you think you should look at
                        it first?

                                 DAVIS
                        Yes.  Of course.

           He puts the pen back.  Phil is looking at him.  Davis tosses
           the folder in his briefcase.  It RATTLES WITH TOOLS.

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        She'll be safe in here.  See ya
                        Monday...

           Phil watches Davis walk off.  Heart's "Crazy on You" begins.

           EXT. EASTMAN, RITTER BUILDING -- DAY

           Davis exits through the REVOLVING DOORS.  Heading inside at
           the same time is THE WOMAN in the winter coat. 
                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        Dear Karen.  Is it okay that I call
                        you Karen now that we've almost met?  
                        I'll assume so.

           She comes right back out... and starts following him...

           EXT. MANHATTAN SIDEWALK -- DAY

           Davis passes a GIFT SHOP with items set out on display.  

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        Something's different, Karen.  And I
                        think you might be responsible.

           Something catches his attention.  He stops.  Looks closer... 

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        I'm getting these urges.  Like this
                        afternoon... I had the urge to conduct
                        a social experiment and explore the
                        true nature of human curiosity.

           He picks out A PAIR OF HANDCUFFS.

           EXT. MANHATTAN STREET/ CROSSWALK -- MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE ON Davis crossing the street.  THE CAMERA TILTS DOWN
           to his briefcase... HANDCUFFED TO HIS WRIST.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        So, I handcuffed my briefcase to my
                        wrist and walked around Manhattan.

           We notice a YOUNG GIRL WHISPERING to her friend.  It's
           definitely about the briefcase.

           -- Davis passes a CAFE, a man lowers his newspaper to peek...

           -- Davis watches the OLD MEN play chess in the park.  One
           player is fixated on the case.  His opponent gets impatient.

                                 CHESS PLAYER
                        Charlie, it's your move for Christ's
                        sake.

           -- Davis watches KIDS BREAK DANCE on the sidewalk with a
           CROWD OF ONLOOKERS.  The WOMAN squeezes in next to him. 
           She's staring.  Davis feels her gaze and looks back.  They
           share a LONG, SILENT MOMENT.  As if they recognized each
           other.  

           Just as she's about to speak, a FAT GUY bumps Davis...
                                 FAT GUY (to Davis)
                        Hey, buddy.  What ah... what's in
                        the briefcase?

           Davis looks at the case.  Then, at the guy...

                                 DAVIS (our secret)
                        My wife.

           When Davis turns back... the woman is gone.  

           INT. DAVIS'S HOUSE (OFFICE) -- NIGHT

           Davis is at his desk, writing on his yellow pad.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        I find that people are drawn to things
                        that hold an element of mystery. 
                        Not exactly a ground breaking
                        conclusion, but it certainly explains
                        my actions of late.
                             (beat)
                        I have to meet you, Karen.

           EXT. SECOND GENERATION VENDING CO.(ESTABLISHING) -- DAY

           A NONDESCRIPT WAREHOUSE in a nondescript part of town.  In
           stenciled black paint, "SECOND GENERATION VENDING CO."

           INT. SECOND GENERATION VENDING CO. -- DAY

           Davis enters through a GARAGE DOOR.  BOXES of ASSORTED CANDY
           stacked against the walls.  A dozen VENDING MACHINES standing
           by.  A forklift cruises past A FEW WORKERS.  Davis walks over...

                                 DAVIS (to worker)
                        Excuse me.  Who could I speak with
                        in customer service?

           INT. SECOND GENERATION (HALLWAY) -- CONTINUOUS

           Davis walks down the hall, approaching a DOOR with a sign,
           "Customer Service."  HAND WRITTEN beneath the sign is "Karen
           Moreno."  He arrives and carefully peeks around the corner...

           It's EMPTY.  Just a cramped little office.  He enters and
           takes inventory:  An outdated computer.  File drawers half
           open.  He focuses on a DEAD PLANT wilting on the desk. 
           Touches it as if it were his only connection to Karen. 

                                 DAVIS (O.S.)
                        Can I help you?

           Standing in the doorway is CARL (40's), balding.  
                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Yes, hi.  I'm looking for Karen.

                                 CARL (suspicious)
                        She's not here.  Is there something
                        I can do for you?

                                 DAVIS
                        Um.  No.  Not really.
                             (beat)
                        Are you expecting her back?

           Carl takes pause.  

                                 CARL
                        Who are you?

                                 DAVIS
                        I'm Davis.  I have a customer service
                        issue.  

                                 CARL
                        Oh.  Well, I'm Carl.  This is my
                        company.  What's the problem?  

                                 DAVIS
                        I really can't get into it, Carl. 
                        There's way too much ground to cover. 
                        But thanks for your concern.  

           Davis slips past and out the door.  Carl looks dumbfounded.

           INT. DAVIS'S SUV (DRIVEWAY) -- NIGHT

           Davis sits in his truck.  The engine off.  We get the feeling
           he's been here for a long time.  He's looking at something
           through the windshield... 

           A HUGE BOX.  The CAPPUCCINO MACHINE.  It's still sitting
           there just inside the garage, blocking the entrance.

           Finally, Davis grabs his BRIEFCASE and opens the car door...

           INT. GARAGE -- LATER

           Davis rips away the final piece of cardboard.  He steps back
           to examine the machine... all kinds of nobs, handles, spouts.  

           He opens his tool filled case and tosses the foundation
           proposal aside.  Reveal his shiny tools.  Choices, choices. 
           He begins diligently unscrewing everything.  QUICK SHOTS as
           he works his way around the coffee behemoth...

           He removes the protective shell to find an intricate MAZE OF
           COMPONENTS.  The heart of the beast.
           As Davis studies the machine, we see that something's off. 
           He isn't satisfied.  He looks around the garage.  Something
           grabs his eye.  He walks OFF SCREEN.  We wait for him...

           Davis returns holding an ALUMINUM LOUISVILLE SLUGGER.  He
           sizes up his opponent and TAKES A SWING.  Pieces come snapping
           off... plastic breaking, metal bending.  This feels good.

           Davis swings AGAIN AND AGAIN.  The destruction like a
           revelation.  He raises the bat for ONE FINAL BLOW...    
           When his CELL PHONE RINGS. 

           He answers...

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        Hi, Karen.

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        How did you know it was me?

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        I programmed you into my phone.

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Oh.  I'm not sure how I feel about
                        that.  Why are you out of breath?

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        I just destroyed a cappuccino machine.   

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Why? 

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        Because I didn't know what to do
                        with it.  I don't think I know what
                        to do with anything anymore.

           Karen doesn't respond to this.  But we know she's intrigued.

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Your letters are killing me, Davis. 
                        I'm in my bath tub trying to pull
                        myself together.  

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        Are there candles?

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Why?

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        Mental picture.
                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Oh.  Right.  Yeah, there's two.  But
                        I'm not bathing or anything. 
                        Sometimes I just sit here.  In my
                        pajamas.  It's nice.  It's quiet. 
                        And I don't wanna wake up my son. 
                        Did I mention I have a son?

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        No.  

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        He's thirteen and I'm thirty, so
                        yes, that would mean I was only
                        seventeen when I had him.  Does that
                        freak you out?

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        No.  Does it freak you out?

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        He's got some sort of presentation
                        tomorrow that he was working on all
                        day.  Something for History.  Or
                        maybe it was World Affairs.  Shit, I
                        can't remember.  Shit. 

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        Karen, why are you telling me all this?

                                 KAREN (calming)
                        I don't know.  Maybe because I find
                        your honesty extremely attractive
                        and I wanna know what that's like.    
                             (then)
                        Or maybe I'm just high.  Shh... wait.

           The phone goes quiet.  Davis waits.  

                                 KAREN (a whisper) (CONT'D)
                        You shouldn't have come to my office,
                        Davis.  This is getting dangerous.

                                 DAVIS (on phone)
                        Dangerous?  I don't... 

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Gotta-go... bye.

           CLICK.  She's gone.  Davis stands there. 

           He grabs the bat.  Raises it over the cappuccino machine. 
           As he drops the ax, we... CUT TO BLACK.

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Chris Moreno?
           INT. 9TH GRADE WORLD AFFAIRS CLASS -- DAY

           MRS. SHERMAN (40's) stands before her class.

                                 MRS. SHERMAN
                        Chris Moreno... you're up.

           MOLLY gathers up her PRESENTATION... a DIAGRAM of the American
           government by branches.  She heads back to her seat.

                                 MRS. SHERMAN  (to girl)
                        Nicely done, Molly.  Good job with
                        eye contact and citing your sources. 

           Sitting in back is CHRIS MORENO (13).  He picks up his visual
           aide, a MOCK DESERT BATTLE GROUND complete with PLASTIC
           SOLDIERS and VEHICLE CONVOY, and makes his way forward. 
           Chris carries himself with confidence despite his youth and
           frail demeanor.  There's something dangerous about him.

           He stands before his class.  All eyes on Chris.

                                 CHRIS (to class)
                        With the invasion of Iraq, we've seen
                        many young men and women heading off
                        to battle... putting their lives on
                        the line so the Iraqi people can enjoy
                        the liberties of freedom... and God-
                        willing, someday soon, our gas prices
                        will become more affordable.  

           A few chuckles.  Mrs. Sherman raises her brow... 

                                 CHRIS (CONT'D)
                        I'd like to talk about a few of the
                        brave Americans who volunteered to
                        protect our great country.  

           He presents his model.  Holds up one of the plastic soldiers. 

                                 CHRIS (holding soldier) (CONT'D)
                        This is PFC., Kevin Falk.  Nineteen. 
                        He joined the military because his
                        family was too poor to send him to
                        college and a Marine Corps. recruiter
                        sold him on the GI Bill.  
                             (then)
                        On March 2nd, Falk lost both arms in
                        a fire-fight trying to secure Falluja. 

           Chris RIPS BOTH ARMS OFF THE ACTION FIGURE...

                                 CHRIS  (CONT'D)
                        He begins community college in the
                        fall.  Needless to say, he won't be
                        participating in intermural sports.
           More classroom stirring.  Some disturbed.  Some laughing.

                                 MRS. SHERMAN
                        Chris, I don't think this is
                        appropriate.  

           Chris picks up ANOTHER FIGURE...

                                 CHRIS (holding soldier #2)
                        This is 1st Lieutenant Dan Doviak of
                        the Army Reserve.  Father of three. 
                        Decorated police officer.  
                             (holds up a PHOTO)
                        Here he is with the little league
                        team he coached back on Long Island. 
                        His son Brandon played first base,
                        leading the league in RBI's.

           Chris puts the figure back in the Hum-vee and moves it slowly
           down a dirt path, making CHILDISH SOUND EFFECTS...

                                 CHRIS (pushing vehicle) (CONT'D)
                        On June 5th, during a routine patrol
                        through Baghdad, Doviak's Hummer
                        pulled over to assist a 15 year old
                        girl who was laying in the road.  To
                        their surprise, she had 60 pounds of
                        explosives strapped to her body...

           Chris lights an M-20 that's tucked under the Hummer... BANG! 
           KIDS SCREAM... Mrs. Sherman jumps to her feet... 

                                 CHRIS (CONT'D)
                        The Hummer was quickly engulfed in
                        flames...

           Chris grabs a can of HAIRSPRAY AND LIGHTER...  WOOSH!!!  A
           FIREBALL SMOTHERS THE HUMMER AND SOLDIERS... 

                                 MRS. SHERMAN
                        NO!  FIRE EXTINGUISHER!  NO!

           The class leans back in their seats.  Mrs. Sherman scrambles.

                                 CHRIS
                        Iraqi citizens quickly gathered,
                        chanting "Death to America" as Doviak
                        and his unit were burned alive.

           The model is now FULLY ABLAZE.  Mrs. Sherman rushes in, DOUSES
           it with an EXTINGUISHER.  

                                 CHRIS (CONT'D)
                        Sorry.  I forgot to cite my sources.
           INT. HIGH SCHOOL OFFICE -- DAY

           The WOMAN IN THE WINTER COAT walks in and goes to the desk.

                                 KAREN (to secretary)
                        I'm Karen Moreno.  

                                 SECRETARY 
                        Yes.  Have a seat.

           KAREN takes a seat, embarrassed and angry all at once.  She
           pulls off her jacket and we finally get a good look at her. 
           She looks disheveled, exhausted by her thirty years.  A woman
           who's uncomfortable in her own skin.

           TWO CHEERLEADERS sit across from her.  Cute, chatty, carefree.

                                 CHEERLEADER #1
                        You so went tanning.  

                                 CHEERLEADER #2
                        I did not.

                                 CHEERLEADER #1
                        You're such a liar.  Look at your
                        stomach, slut.

                                 CHEERLEADER #2
                        I laid out.

                                 CHEERLEADER #1
                        It's April... you can't lay out. 
                        It's like two degrees.

                                 CHEERLEADER #2
                        It was like eighty on Saturday, bitch.

           Karen envies their immaturity.  The PRINCIPAL'S DOOR OPENS... 

                                 PRINCIPAL (from doorway) 
                        Ms. Moreno.  Nice to see you again. 
                        Shall we?

           INT. KAREN'S CAR -- LATER

           Karen drives, her face tight, on the verge of tears.  Her
           son is at her side, examining a MELTED ACTION FIGURE.

                                 CHRIS 
                        His face is totally melted off. 
                        That's fuckin' crazy.

           Karen has more anger than she knows what to do with. 
                                 CHRIS (CONT'D)
                        They should sell them like this...
                        all fucked up with amputated limbs
                        and melted faces and shit.  It's
                        more realistic, don't you think? 
                        They could even make one with post-
                        war stress disorder... he just lays
                        in bed all day or something. 
                             (turns to Karen)
                        Oh yeah, I borrowed your hairspray.

           CLOSE ON KAREN'S EYES.  She's lost.  Desperate.  

           INT. KAREN'S HOUSE/ KITCHEN -- NIGHT

           ON THOSE SAME EYES.  Karen is cooking a meal for one.  She
           weighs each item on a scale before dishing it on her plate. 

           Karen sits and eats alone, wishing away another shitty day.

           INT. SECOND GENERATION (CUSTOMER SERVICE OFFICE) -- DAY

           AGAIN, ON THOSE EYES.  Karen sits behind her cluttered
           customer service desk.  The BUZZ of the florescent lights
           above.  She looks at her DEAD PLANT.  Touches one of the
           withered leaves.  It crumbles to dust.  Then, something
           changes...

           Karen grabs her winter coat and hurries out...

           INT. NJ TRANSIT TRAIN -- EVENING

           Davis sits among the crowd of commuters.  He looks over to
           see the woman in the winter coat... WE NOW KNOW HER AS KAREN.

           She's sitting two rows over, pretending to read a MAGAZINE. 
           She glances up and they make eye contact.  Davis nods...  

           WE FREEZE ON THIS EXCHANGE.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. KAREN'S HOUSE (BATHROOM) -- NIGHT

           Karen is in her tub, smoking a joint, in pajamas.  She tears
           open an envelope to find a LETTER ON YELLOW PAPER. 

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        Dear Karen.  I was on the train today
                        and I met a woman.

           Karen's eyes light up.  She's actually in his letter now. 
                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        There was something very familiar
                        about her.  I couldn't figure it
                        out, so I went and sat next to her...

                                                                 BACK TO:

           INT. NJ TRANSIT TRAIN -- NIGHT

           Davis sits with Karen.  Her heart pounding through her chest. 

                                 DAVIS
                        Hi. 

                                 KAREN
                        Hello.  

                                 DAVIS
                        Do we know each other?

                                 KAREN
                        I don't, um... think so.

                                 DAVIS
                        Huh.  Cause' you seem really...

           He can't put his finger on it.  It's quiet again.  Karen
           settles down.  Feeling safe.  Feeling anonymous. 

                                 KAREN
                        Tough day?

                                 DAVIS
                        No, not really.  My job isn't very
                        difficult.  The guys beneath me do
                        most the heavy lifting while I'm at
                        lunch.  I just take credit for it.  

           FREEZE ON KAREN.  Locked in by his honesty.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        She was quiet.  But somehow, she got
                        me talking about my wife.  I even
                        missed my stop I was talking so much. 
                        Then, out of nowhere, she asked...

           MOTION BEGINS AGAIN.

                                 KAREN
                        So why did you marry her?

           Davis considers this.  Maybe for the first time.

                                 DAVIS
                        Because it was easy.  Everything was
                        laid out in front of me.  I guess
                        I'm just lazy. 
           She's still mesmerized when she realizes the train is stopped.

                                 KAREN 
                        Shit, this is me.  Shit... 

           Karen gets up and hurries for the door.  

                                 KAREN  (turning back)
                        It was nice to meet you.

                                 DAVIS
                        Yeah.  You too...

           He watches her leave, something suddenly more familiar. 

           INTERCUT:  KAREN IN BATHTUB READING LETTER/ DAVIS ON TRAIN 

           KAREN IN THE TUB:  she's smiling, like she's gotten away
           with a crime.  She turns the page over...

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        I wanted to ask her name, but she
                        disappeared so quick.  Fortunately,
                        she left something on her seat...

           ON THE TRAIN:  Davis picks up a MAGAZINE where Karen was
           sitting.  

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It was that Oprah magazine that Oprah
                        always seems to be on the cover of.  
                             (then)
                        And I think you know who it was
                        addressed to, Karen.

           KAREN IN THE TUB:  She freezes.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I knew you were familiar.  No more
                        games.  I'll see you soon.

           She puts the letter down, in shock.  Her mind racing.  Then... 
           THE DOORBELL RINGS.  Karen panics, jumps out of the tub...

           EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Davis stands on the doorstep of this two-story home in a
           modest neighborhood.  Oddly enough, his suit is COVERED IN
           DIRT FROM HEAD TO TOE.  He RINGS THE BELL again...

           He waits patiently, and when the door opens... IT'S CARL. 

                                 CARL
                        You.  What the hell are you doing
                        here?
                                 DAVIS
                        I'm looking for Karen.  What are you
                        doing here?

                                 CARL
                        I live here.  This is my house,
                        asshole.  What the fuck do you want?

                                 DAVIS
                        I told you.  I have a customer service
                        issue, Carl.  But you really don't
                        need to curse at me.  

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Davis, hi!

           Karen steps out behind Carl. 

                                 CARL 
                        You know this guy?

                                 KAREN
                        Yes.  I do.  Yes.  
                             (to Davis)
                        I'm sorry, Davis.  I know I was
                        totally supposed to call you.
                             (to Carl)
                        Davis works over at the Rec Center. 
                        They're having problems with a few
                        machines.  I was supposed to call.

                                 CARL
                        It's ten o'clock, Karen.  Why is he
                        at my house?

                                 KAREN (stern)
                        I'm sorry.  Just give me a minute. 
                        I'll deal with it.

           Carl looks at her.  At Davis.  Something's off.  

                                 KAREN (to Carl) (CONT'D)
                        It's fine.  I'll be right in.

           Carl reluctantly goes inside.  Karen closes the door and
           looks at Davis.  She can't quite believe what's happening.

                                 DAVIS
                        I was in the neighborhood.  

                                 KAREN
                        You shouldn't be here, Davis.  I
                        live with someone.  
                             (clarifying)
                        Carl.  I live with Carl.  
                                 DAVIS
                        It's not fair.  You know everything
                        about me.  The only thing I know
                        about you is you're not very good
                        with plants.  

                                 KAREN
                        And fish.  I neglect plants and fish
                        equally.  What else do you wanna
                        know?  I buy my clothes at the mall,
                        okay?  I went to community college
                        for eight days.  I have a gym
                        membership that I never use and a
                        kid who scares the shit out of me. 
                        That's it.  That's me.  Sorry to
                        disappoint you. 

           Davis is quiet.  She changes her tone. 

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        Look, I shouldn't have called you. 
                        I shouldn't have... started following
                        you.  That was wrong.  I'm gonna
                        recommend to management they give
                        you a refund.  So you should hear
                        something soon.     

                                 DAVIS
                        Great.

           Davis takes AN ENVELOPE out of his jacket.

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        This is the last one.  I wrote it in
                        the car ten minutes ago.
                             (hands it to her)
                        You've got a good face, Karen.  My
                        mental picture was way off.

           He starts to walk away.  Karen is stunned.

                                 KAREN
                        Davis?

           He turns back.

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        What happened to your clothes?

                                 DAVIS
                        It's all in the letter.  

           He keeps going.  She wants to stop him.  But doesn't.
           INT. KAREN'S HOUSE/ KITCHEN -- LATER

           Alone in the kitchen.  She looks at the envelope.  Like a
           bomb she's been asked to disarm.  She weighs her options... 

           Then PEELS IT OPEN.  She peeks in at the YELLOW PAPER...

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        Dear Karen.  Fuck Phil.  

                                 CARL (O.S.)
                        Everything okay?

           Karen CRUMPLES THE ENVELOPE...

                                 KAREN
                        What?  Yeah, it was my fault.  Sorry. 
                        I was supposed to...

           She stuffs the LETTER IN THE TRASH.   

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        ... call him.  We sorted it out.
                        What's time's your flight again?

                                 CARL 
                        Noon. 

                                 KAREN
                        Noon.  Okay.  Good.  I'm going to bed.

           She starts to walk out... 

                                 CARL (blurting)
                        Karen, I trust you.  

           She stops.  But doesn't turn back.

                                 CARL (CONT'D)
                        I just want you to know that. 

                                 KAREN
                        Good.  You should.  Good night. 

           She keeps going.  Carl just stands there. 

           INT. AIRPORT (AMERICAN BANDSTAND RESTAURANT)-- DAY

           Karen and Carl are at a little table, RECORDS and other ROCK
           MEMORABILIA on the walls.  The terminal is crowded.

                                 CARL
                        It should only take a few weeks for
                        me to get things up and running out
                        there.  And then, ya know... I think
                        we should really consider moving.  
                                 KAREN 
                        Yeah.  Maybe... 

                                 CARL
                        You can go to tech school like we
                        talked about... I can finally be more
                        creative with my vending ideas.  And
                        Chris, I mean, he's struggling here...

           Carl continues with his pitch, but Karen TUNES HIM OUT.  She
           focuses on all the LUGGAGE wheeling through the terminal. 
           HUNDREDS of bags.  THOUSANDS of bags.  And then...

           A NATIONAL GUARDSMAN holding an M-16.  Karen smiles slightly.  

                                 CARL (noticing her smile) (CONT'D)
                        Karen?

                                 KAREN
                        Huh?  

                                 CARL
                        I asked if you thought about the
                        marriage thing any more?

                                 KAREN
                        Oh.  No, not yet.  But I plan to. 
                        Soon.  

           She continues eating.  Carl senses her distance.

           INT. KAREN'S KITCHEN -- DAY

           Karen hurries into the kitchen and starts digging through
           the trash.  She finds the envelope.  Tears it open...

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        Fuck Phil.  He called me into his
                        office today...

           INT. PHIL'S OFFICE -- YESTERDAY

           Davis pokes his head inside.  Phil sits behind his desk.

                                 PHIL
                        Davis.  Come in.  Sit.  Let's have a
                        dialogue.

           It's more of a suite than an office.  Spacious and masculine. 
           Davis slides into a soft leather chair.  

                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        Davis, did you advise Darren Woods
                        to sink $50,000 into some kind of
                        amusement park?
                                 DAVIS
                        It's not an amusement park, Phil. 
                        Blackbeard's Cave is gonna have an
                        arcade, batting cages and go-carts. 
                        And not those pussy go-carts you can
                        run faster than.  These fuckers fly.

                                 PHIL (unenthused)
                        Blackbeard's Cave... 

           Davis smiles.  Phil disapproves, but he dismisses the subject.  

                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        Now I'm going to ask you another
                        question.  And I'd like you to be
                        completely honest with your response.

                                 DAVIS
                        Okay.

                                 PHIL
                        Did you dismantle a stall in the
                        washroom near your office?

                                 DAVIS
                        Yes, I did.

                                 PHIL
                        Why?

                                 DAVIS
                        That's a bit harder to answer. 

                                 PHIL
                        Try me.

           Davis gathers his thoughts on the matter.

                                 DAVIS
                        Well, Phil... the door was squeaking. 
                        And it's probably been like that for
                        quite some time.  I just never
                        noticed.  Now I do.  Now I notice
                        lots of things.  And I wanna know
                        how those things work.  I wanna know
                        how they're put together. 

           Phil is blank.  Davis tries to clarify.

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Like that clock for example...

           Davis points at a LARGE ANTIQUE CLOCK.

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Pure craftsmanship.  Artistry.  
                                 PHIL (proud)
                        It's a German antique.  1862.  

                                 DAVIS
                        It probably keeps perfect time and I
                        bet it's worth a bundle.

                                 PHIL
                        It belonged to my grandmother.  It's
                        priceless.

                                 DAVIS
                        I wanna smash it.

           Phil is silenced.  

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        No offense to your grandmother, but
                        I see that clock and I wanna know
                        what it looks like on the inside.  I
                        don't know why.  It's just where I'm
                        at right now.

           Phil calculates.  Maybe offended?  Confused?  Finally...

                                 PHIL
                        I understand.

                                 DAVIS
                        You do?

           Phil gets up, leans against the corner of his desk.  Sleeves
           rolled to his forearm... 

                                 PHIL
                        Julia was a big part of your life. 
                        Now that part is empty and you need
                        to fill it with things... no matter
                        how silly they might seem.  Don't
                        you think I feel the same way?  Just
                        the other day, I was driving home...

                                 DAVIS 
                        I think I quit.

                                 PHIL
                        What?

                                 DAVIS
                        No, wait...
                             (considering)
                        It's okay.  I'll stay.

           It's worse than Phil thought.
                                 PHIL
                        Don't fall apart on me here, Davis. 
                        There's too much at stake.
                             (an order)
                        I want you to take some time off.  A
                        month.  Two months.  Whatever it
                        takes.  Just get your head straight.
                             (then)
                        Did you sign the proposal yet?

           Davis raises an eyebrow.  

           INT. SUV -- DAY

           Davis drives down the parkway.  He loosens his tie.  

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        Fuck him and the way he leans on the
                        corner of his desk with his sleeves
                        rolled up like he's about to dig a
                        ditch.  I don't need it anymore. 
                        From now on, it's me and my tools.

           Davis looks affectionately at his briefcase.  

           EXT. SUV -- LATER

           The SUV passes a sign... "EXIT 115."  

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        I accidentally passed my exit so I
                        figured I'd just keep driving.  Maybe
                        it wasn't an accident.  Maybe there
                        are no accidents.  Maybe I'm being
                        too philosophical.  Anyway, I decided
                        to come look for you.

           He looks at the address on the OPRAH MAGAZINE. 

           INT./EXT. SUV (SUBURBAN STREETS) -- LATER

           The SUV cruises around this blue-collar, Jersey suburb.  

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        I'm not familiar with the area, so I
                        started at the diner with the little
                        jukeboxes and drove up and down all
                        the streets for a two mile radius. 
                        That's a rough estimate.

           QUICK CUTS... the SUV cruising down several streets.  We see
           a man getting his mail... a woman pushing a stroller... 

                                 DAVIS (sing-song) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Where are you, Karen Moreno?
           EXT. SUV/ SUBURBAN STREET -- LATER

           A SCHOOL BUS stops in front of Davis.  He yields.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        I don't remember the last time I
                        stopped behind a school bus.  I felt
                        very responsible for doing so. 

           A group of KIDS with backpacks hop down and cross the street. 

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I wondered if any of these kids could
                        be your son.  One in particular
                        grabbed my attention and I started
                        following him home... 

           A YOUNG BOY walks down the sidewalk.  The SUV creeps slowly
           behind him.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I quickly reconsidered because I'd
                        rather not go to prison.

           He speeds up and passes the kid...

           INT. SUV -- LATER

           Davis drives slowly, taking in the street signs.  He pulls
           to the side of the road and looks out the window. 

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        I was in a neighborhood where all
                        the streets were named after precious
                        metals when I saw it...

           ANGLE ON:  A DEMOLITION CREW OF THREE MEN TEARING A HOUSE
           APART PIECE BY PIECE AND THROWING IT INTO A LARGE DUMPSTER. 
           RIPPING SHINGLES, SMASHING GLASS, SWINGING SLEDGEHAMMERS...  

                                 DAVIS (to himself) (CONT'D)
                        This changes everything.

           EXT. DEMO HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Davis walks past the dumpster in his expensive suit.  JIMMY
           (30's), stops working.  He's one hundred percent blue collar.

                                 DAVIS
                        Hi.

                                 JIMMY 
                        Hey.  You the insurance guy?

                                 DAVIS
                        Insurance?  No.  Not me.
                                 JIMMY
                        Saw the suit.  So I figured...

                                 DAVIS
                        No, I was just driving past and saw
                        you guys working.  Looks like fun.

                                 JIMMY
                        Yeah, right.  Fun.  

           Jimmy laughs.  Davis doesn't.

                                 DAVIS
                        What exactly are you doing?

                                 JIMMY
                        House burned.  Gotta tear it down
                        before they rebuild.  

                                 DAVIS
                        You think I could help?

                                 JIMMY (confused)
                        What?  With this?

           ON THE HOUSE.  It's partially burned with a huge hole in the
           side where the TWO MEN are carrying out slabs of sheetrock
           and tossing them into the dumpster. 

                                 DAVIS
                        Yeah.  Just tell me what to do.  You
                        don't have to pay me.  I just wanna
                        do what you guys are doing.  

                                 JIMMY
                        Don't bust my balls.  You're the
                        insurance guy, right?  Barry sent
                        you over to bust balls? 

                                 DAVIS
                        I don't even know who Barry is.  
                             (then)
                        Here... I'll pay you.  Fifty dollars. 
                        Just let me help.  

           Davis reaches for his wallet.  Offers the cash...

                                 JIMMY
                        Whoa, hold on... what is this?

                                 DAVIS
                        Please... take it.  I'll work hard.

           He forces the cash in Jimmy's hand.  Jimmy finally takes it.  

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Where do I start?
           INT. DEMO HOUSE/ BEDROOM -- LATER

           Davis wears SAFETY GOGGLES in the middle of the empty bedroom. 
           Jimmy hands him an AX-LIKE TOOL and steps back.  Davis weighs
           it in his hands, then SWINGS AWAY... it sinks into the wall
           and a large piece of sheet-rock RIPS AWAY FROM THE FRAME.  

           Davis comes alive, the walls CRUMBLING AROUND HIM.

           EXT. DEMO HOUSE -- LATER

           Davis walks out of the house and throws STACKS OF DEBRIS in
           the dumpster.  His clothes stained with dirt and soot.  

           ON THE SIDEWALK, the other guys observe.  Smoke break.  

                                 OWEN
                        He's probably a crackhead.

                                 JIMMY
                        Crackheads don't give people fifty dollars. 
                        They suck dick for twenty.

                                 SEAN
                        We're splittin' that shit.

           INT. BURKE'S ARMY NAVY -- DAY

           Davis walks up to the COUNTER CLERK in his filthy suit.

                                 DAVIS
                        Hi.  Do you carry work overalls?  

           INT. BURKE'S ARMY NAVY/ BACK OF STORE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Davis sizes up a WORK JUMPSUIT.  He sees an ARMY HELMET...
           tries it on for size.  Then, he notices...

           A GAS MASK.  He stretches it over his face.  ANOTHER CUSTOMER
           notices him... jacket, tie and gas mask.  Nice. 

           He scans the store for more toys.  His gaze lands on a SIGN. 
           He pulls off the mask, interested... "BULLET PROOF VESTS."

           INT. DAVIS'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Davis sits on his bed watching TV and wearing his GAS MASK. 
           The DOORBELL RINGS. 

           INT. DAVIS'S HOUSE/ FRONT DOOR -- MOMENTS LATER

           Davis opens the door.  It's Karen.  She's SOAKING WET.  

                                 KAREN 
                        Did you really do that?  Did you
                        really drive around looking for me?
                                 DAVIS
                        Yes.  I did.  

           She's shivering.  Dripping wet.    

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Is it raining?

                                 KAREN
                        No. 
                             (off his curious look)
                        I don't want to tell you.  

                                 DAVIS
                        I think you should.

                                 KAREN
                        It's embarrassing.  

                                 DAVIS
                        Tell me.

           She can't escape it.  She holds up her RIPPED SKIRT...

                                 KAREN
                        I closed the car door on my skirt
                        and your sprinklers turned on, which
                        shouldn't be a huge problem, but the
                        lock on the driver's side has been
                        getting stuck for about four years
                        and I haven't had a chance to fix
                        it... like most things in my life. 
                        Do I smell grilled cheese?

                                 DAVIS
                        You're high, aren't you?

                                 KAREN
                        A little bit, yeah.

           After a moment, Davis pushes the door open.  Karen nervously
           steps in.  As he's closing the door, Davis notices a STATION
           WAGON creeping past the house and down the block.  Very odd.

           INT. DAVIS'S KITCHEN -- LATER

           Davis dishes GRILLED CHEESE onto a plate.  Karen sits at the
           counter in an oversized SWEATSHIRT.  She's focused on the
           DISMANTLED REFRIGERATOR. 

                                 KAREN
                        I feel like I'm in a book I just read.

                                 DAVIS (re: fridge)
                        Don't worry, I bought groceries this
                        morning.   
           He sits down across from her with his own sandwich.  Karen
           glances at the kitchen table... A YELLOW PAD AND PEN.

                                 KAREN 
                        Is that..?  I thought the last one
                        was the last one?

                                 DAVIS 
                        I couldn't help it.  There's a lot
                        on my mind, Karen.

           Karen tugs at her sleeves.  Not sure how to be in this moment. 

                                 KAREN
                        You're bathroom is lovely.  You're
                        whole house is.  Just lovely.  

                                 DAVIS 
                        I hate this house.  I feel like I
                        don't belong here.  

           Karen is taken by his honesty.  But her expression fades.

                                 KAREN
                        Are you gonna disappoint me?  Because
                        everyone disappoints me.  I build
                        something up in my head and then it
                        all goes downhill.  Can you promise
                        not to?  Because that would suck.

                                 DAVIS
                        Can I feel your face?

           Not the answer she was expecting.  But it'll do.  She nods...

           Davis reaches over the counter and puts his hand on her face. 
           He covers her chin, her nose, her cheeks.  She closes her
           eyes.  Nobody has ever touched her like this.

           He pulls his hand away and she opens her eyes.

                                 KAREN
                        Would you like to come stay with me?

           INT. KAREN'S HOUSE/ LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           The glow from a street lamp tumbles through the window.  We
           can just make out a living area with a fireplace.  Davis
           crosses to the mantle. 

           He examines a FISHBOWL with rocks at the bottom and a DEAD
           FISH floating on top.  Karen steps up next to him.

                                 DAVIS
                        Plants and fish.
                                 KAREN
                        Yeah.  I'm not much better with kids.

           Suddenly, they're very close. 

                                 KAREN (hushed) (CONT'D)
                        I can't have sex with you.  It's
                        nothing personal.  It's me.  It would
                        be dangerous.

                                 DAVIS (hushed)
                        There's that word again.  What's
                        dangerous?  Is Carl really out of town
                        or did you chop him into little pieces
                        and stuff him in your sock drawer?

                                 KAREN (hushed)
                        That's ridiculous.  I don't have a
                        sock drawer.

                                 DAVIS (hushed)
                        Then where do you keep your socks?

                                 KAREN (hushed)
                        In the same drawer as my underwear.

           He gives her a look. 

                                 KAREN (hushed) (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 DAVIS (hushed)
                        Nothing, I just think a woman's
                        underwear is deserving of it's own
                        space, don't you?  My wife had an
                        entire drawer dedicated to
                        delicates... with lotions, scented
                        soaps... if she had a vibrator, I'm
                        sure that's where it would be.

                                 KAREN
                        Let's go to bed.

           INT. SPARE BEDROOM -- LATER

           Davis and Karen lay in SEPARATE BEDS, FIVE FEET APART.  

                                 KAREN
                        This is all I can handle.  Is that
                        okay?  

                                 DAVIS
                        It's fine.

                                 KAREN
                        Let's just fall asleep together.  
                                 DAVIS
                        Together?

                                 KAREN
                        Together-apart.

           Silence again.  Karen's mind swimming.  

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        Did you know that while sleeping a
                        human ingests an average of seven
                        spiders over the course of a lifetime.  

                                 DAVIS
                        Interesting.  Who determines something
                        like that?

                                 KAREN
                        Research scientists.

                                 DAVIS
                        Ah, the research scientist. 

                                 KAREN
                        The first time I heard that, I was
                        fifteen and it completely scared the
                        shit out of me.  So, when I went to
                        bed I would tape my mouth shut.

           Davis finds this amusing.

                                 KAREN  (CONT'D)
                        Then I realized they could still
                        crawl in through my nose and that
                        scared me even more because it's a
                        more direct route to the brain.

                                 DAVIS
                        Ah, brain-eating spiders.  Then what? 
                        You taped your nose shut?

                                 KAREN
                        No, I lost my virginity to Adam Russo
                        and he was all I could think about
                        for three months. 

           This moment resonates.  

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        There's something I wanna tell you.

           Davis waits.  It sounds important.

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        But I'm not going to.  Not yet.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        I just want to give you a heads-up. 
                        There's something I'm going to tell
                        you that I've never told anyone.   

                                 DAVIS
                        Whenever you're ready.

           She settles on this.  Closes her eyes.  

           INT. KAREN'S HOUSE/ KITCHEN -- 6 AM

           Early.  Davis enters the kitchen dressed, ready to leave. 
           He opens the refrigerator and drinks from a carton of milk.  

                                 CHRIS (O.S.)
                        That's fuckin' disgusting.

           Davis almost chokes.  Chris is at the table. 

                                 DAVIS
                        You must be Chris.

                                 CHRIS
                        Are you fucking my mom?

                                 DAVIS
                        No, I'm not.  We were just sleeping.

                                 CHRIS
                        'Cause she's fuckin' crazy.  And if
                        you haven't noticed, she's a fucking
                        pot-head.  She calls it "cannibus"
                        because it makes her feel like less
                        of a fucking pot-head.

                                 DAVIS
                        You like to say "fuck" a lot.

                                 CHRIS
                        So?

                                 DAVIS
                        So, you're not using it properly.

                                 CHRIS
                        What the fuck does that mean?

                                 DAVIS
                        That's what I mean.  "Fuck" is a
                        great word, but you're overusing it.  
                             (explaining)
                        Think of it like a bomb.  You don't
                        have a lot, so you have to conserve. 
                        If you say it too much, it loses it's
                        value.  It makes you sound stupid.
                                 CHRIS
                        Fuck you.

                                 DAVIS
                        Exactly.  I feel nothing and you
                        sound like and idiot.

           Davis closes the fridge and starts out... 

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Have a good one.

                                 CHRIS
                        Who the ff...

           But he's gone.  WE HEAR the front door OPEN AND CLOSE.   

           EXT. DEMO HOUSE -- MORNING

           Davis hands Jimmy and Sean CASH.  He's wearing his new
           JUMPSUIT.  He pulls his gloves on and walks inside, eager to
           get to work.

           Only moments later, WE HEAR SOUNDS OF DESTRUCTION... 

                                 SEAN (to Jimmy)
                        Guy's a fuckin' animal. 

           INT. KAREN'S BEDROOM -- MORNING

           Karen is in her UNDERWEAR... racing to get ready for work. 
           She pulls on a pair of pants and goes into her drawer for a
           pair of socks.  She stops.  Stares into her sock drawer.

           MOMENTS LATER...

           Karen has her DELICATES piled against her chest.  She pulls
           open Carl's drawer and dumps his shit on the floor.  She
           fills the drawer with her underwear, a satisfied grin.   

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL LOCKER ROOM -- DAY

           Chris is changing, sitting in front of his locker.  He glances
           over at ANDREW WHITE (17), also changing, in his underwear. 
           He's a good looking kid.  Slender.  Athletic. 

           Chris forces his eyes to his own locker.  He pulls his shirt
           on, ties his shoe, trying not to look, but he can't help it...

           He looks over again, and this time, ANDREW IS LOOKING BACK. 
           They make eye contact, maybe for a second too long.  Andrew
           starts to smile, but Chris doesn't let him... he shuts his
           locker and walks out.   
           INT. KAREN'S CAR/ SECOND GENERATION PARKING LOT -- DAY

           Karen is trying to get out of her car, but the lock is STUCK. 
           She SLAMS her shoulder against the door, but it's no use. 
           She awkwardly climbs over the passenger's seat and out the
           door... BANGING her knee in the process.

           INT. SECOND GENERATION VENDING CO. -- MOMENTS LATER

           Karen limps through the warehouse.  Off to a great start.   

           INT. DAVIS'S HOUSE -- DAY

           The PHONE IS RINGING.  Davis enters the DOWNSTAIRS FOYER,
           completely FILTHY.  He tracks mud and dirt, disappearing
           down the hall.  The ANSWERING MACHINE PICKS UP:

                                 ANSWERING MACHINE (Davis's voice)
                        Hi, you've reached Davis Mitchell. 
                        I'm unavailable at the moment, so
                        please leave a message.
                             (then)
                        Oh... if you're calling for Julia, I
                        regret to inform you that she isn't
                        with us anymore.  Which makes her
                        even more unavailable.  BEEP.

           IN THE SHOWER.  Davis watches the dirt swirl down the drain.

                                 ANSWERING MESSAGE  (Phil's voice)
                        Hello, Davis.  It's Phil.  This is
                        my third message.  I am deeply
                        concerned with your well being.  I'm
                        trying to reach out to you.  Trying
                        to help.  But you refuse.

           IN THE BEDROOM.  Davis throws some clothes into a bag.  

                                 ANSWERING MESSAGE(Phil's voice)
                        We're moving forward with the
                        scholarship.  Julia would want you
                        to be part of it.  That's all.  BEEP.

           EXT. DAVIS'S DRIVEWAY -- LATER

           As Davis hurls the bag of clothes in his truck, he notices a
           STATION WAGON parked across the street.  He watches, curious.

           INT. CUSTOMER SERVICE OFFICE -- DAY

           Karen is typing away.  A CO-WORKER steps into her office. 

                                 CO-WORKER
                        Line one's for you. 

           She picks up. 
                                 KAREN (into phone)
                        This is Karen, customer service. 

                                 DAVIS (O.S.)
                        Hello Karen, customer service. 

           Karen tries to mask her nervous excitement.  Her co-worker
           lingers in the doorway.  

                                 KAREN (on phone)
                        What can I do for you today, Mr.
                        Mitchell?

                                 DAVIS (O.S.)
                        This might sound crazy, but I think
                        there's a station wagon that's been
                        stalking me the past couple days... 

           The co-worker finally exits.  Karen lets herself smile.

           SPLIT SCREEN:  KAREN IN OFFICE/ DAVIS DRIVING

           Davis drives through his neighborhood, on SPEAKER PHONE.  In
           his mirror... THE STATION WAGON FOLLOWS AT A DISTANCE.  

                                 DAVIS (into speaker phone) (CONT'D)
                        Yes, this does raise a number of
                        other concerns, including, "A," why
                        would anyone be following me? 

           He steps on the gas...

                                 DAVIS (into speaker phone) (CONT'D)
                        "B," could I possibly be in some
                        kind of danger?  

           He takes a SHARP TURN, tires SQUEALING...

                                 DAVIS (into speaker phone) (CONT'D)
                        And "C," who the fuck still drives a
                        station wagon?

           Davis looks in his mirror.  The wagon is gone.  

                                 KAREN (into phone)
                        Well, if you disappear, I know where
                        to begin the investigation.   

           EXT. SEASIDE BOARDWALK -- DAY

           Karen and Davis walk down the boardwalk.  The Atlantic Ocean
           shimmering at their side.  Amusements retired for the season.
                                 DAVIS
                        This is where you get your
                        prescription filled?  An empty
                        boardwalk?

                                 KAREN
                        He's not actually a doctor.  He's a
                        friend.  I used to work up here.

           Davis gives her a look. 

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        Okay, the prescription isn't actually
                        mine.  I lied.  Sorry. 

           INT. CAROUSEL BUILDING -- DAY

           Karen and Davis walk next to the massive BOARDWALK RELIC...
           PORCELAIN HORSES with POLES reaching to the ceiling.  The
           ride is shut down, but you can almost hear the ORGAN PLAYING,
           the CHILDREN LAUGHING.  A silent carnival.

           Karen steps up onto the ride.  

                                 KAREN
                        Come on.  It's in here.

           Davis steps up.  Karen leads him past the battered horses to
           the middle of the ride... where they find a LITTLE DOOR...  

           INT. CAROUSEL -- CONTINUOUS

           Davis follows Karen into the heart of the beast.  A circular
           room with all kinds of motors, wheels, and tools scattered
           about.  Davis looks at the ANTIQUE ORGAN.  It's IN PIECES.

           They continue past a CURTAIN to find an OLD MAN sitting on a
           tiny bed.  RAY stands up, walks over with a smile.

                                 KAREN
                        Hi, Ray.  This is my friend, Davis.  

                                 RAY
                        Hello, young man. 

                                 DAVIS
                        Hello.  

                                 KAREN
                        This is for you...

           Karen hands Ray a box of SALT WATER TAFFY.  Ray looks
           inside... a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL tucked under the candy.

                                 RAY
                        My favorite kind.
           He hands her a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE.  Looks at Davis.

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        It's for my arthritis.  But I don't
                        use it.  It makes me think too much. 
                        I'm seventy-nine years old.  Too
                        many memories.

           EXT. CAROUSEL -- LATER

           Ray walks with them.  Passing the antiquated ride.  We see
           now that a good part of it has been DISMANTLED.  

                                 RAY
                        It used to be so beautiful.  But
                        nobody wants carousels anymore. 
                        They want roller coasters that go
                        upside down.  

           They stop.  The carousel has been ROPED OFF at the far end.

                                 DAVIS
                        You're tearing it down?

                                 RAY (accepting)
                        Too many repairs.  Too much money. 
                        Everything ends. 

           CLOSE ON THE DETAILS:  Faded paint on the horses.  The
           crumbling facade.  It's time has come and gone.

                                 DAVIS
                        Can I help?  I'm great at taking
                        things apart.  I have lots of
                        experience... and my own tools.  

                                 RAY
                        You're very strange.

           EXT. FUNTOWN PIER -- LATER

           Davis and Karen sit on the edge of this Jersey Shore pier,
           legs hanging over the freezing ocean.  Karen smokes a joint.

                                 DAVIS
                        Julia used to talk about moving out
                        here.  Somewhere you could wake up
                        in the morning, look out the window
                        and see nothing but ocean.  

                                 KAREN
                        You miss her.  

                                 DAVIS
                        I'm trying to.
           They leave it at that.  Karen takes a big puff.    

                                 KAREN
                        Do you ever feel like something's
                        about to happen? 

                                 DAVIS
                        Something good or bad?

                                 KAREN
                        Just something.  

                                 DAVIS
                        I don't know.  Maybe.  

                                 KAREN
                        I always do.  It's right here... in
                        my stomach.  Like something's just
                        about to happen. 

           She puts her hand on her stomach.

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        It started two years ago.  Chris got
                        really sick with pneumonia.  There
                        was this whole day in the hospital
                        when nobody knew anything.  Everything
                        in his body was shutting down and
                        nobody could tell me why.  I felt so
                        helpless.

           Karen has her hand on her stomach.  ON THAT FEELING.

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        It's like that tension during a storm,
                        ya know?  When you see the lightning
                        and you're counting the seconds 'til
                        the thunder.  
                             (then)
                        I'm always counting the seconds.

           INT. KAREN'S SPARE BEDROOM -- 2 AM

           Laying in separate beds.  Both awake.  Staring at the ceiling.

                                 KAREN
                        What're you thinking about right
                        now?  If you have to write it down
                        first, that's fine.

           He searches, trying to find a way to explain...

                                 DAVIS
                        I was thinking how much I'd like to
                        be shot into outer space, orbit the
                        earth once or twice and then burn up
                        during re-entry.
           It's quiet.  Karen gets up and PUSHES HER BED NEXT TO HIS. 
           She lays next to him.  Inches apart. 

                                 KAREN
                        I'm scared, Davis.  I have a habit
                        of trying to fix people when I'm the
                        one who needs fixing. 

                                 DAVIS
                        Tell you what... if you fix me, I'll
                        fix you back. 

           Karen is quiet, counting the seconds.  Then, SHE ROLLS ON
           TOP OF HIM... STARTS KISSING HIM.  He kisses her back.  Karen
           needs him more than anything at this moment. 

           EXT. SPARE BEDROOM -- LATER

           Karen is asleep with her back pressed tight against Davis. 
           He lays awake.  Those same unaffected eyes, wide open.

           INT. BATHROOM -- LATER

           Davis stands in his underwear, staring into the mirror. 
           Something is very wrong.  He begins to take DEEP BREATHS... 

                                 MAN'S VOICE  (O.S.)
                        Deep breath...

           Davis BREATHES IN DEEP.  Exhales...

                                 MAN'S VOICE  (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Deep breath...

           Davis BREATHES IN DEEP.  Exhales... 

           INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- DAY

           Davis sits up on a table with his shirt off.  DR. BRODKEY
           (60's), presses a stethoscope to his chest.

                                 DR. BRODKEY
                        Again and hold it...

           Davis breathes in again, holds it...

                                 DR. BRODKEY (CONT'D)
                        And exhale.  Good.  

           Brodkey sits down, scribbles on a chart.

                                 DR. BRODKEY (CONT'D)
                        Well, you have a heartbeat, so that's
                        positive.  What's the problem, Davis? 
                                 DAVIS
                        I'm not sure, Doc.  I don't... I
                        can't really feel anything. 

                                 DR. BRODKEY
                        Do you feel sick?  Maybe depressed?

                                 DAVIS
                        No.  Sick would be something. 
                        Depressed is something.  I'm just
                        kinda numb all over.

                                 DR. BRODKEY (carefully)
                        After the accident, did they examine
                        you thoroughly?  Neck, back... 

                                 DAVIS
                        Yeah.  No.  Nothing like that.  

                                 DR. BRODKEY
                        Because sometimes a blow to the
                        head...

                                 DAVIS (certain)
                        That's not it. 

           Brodkey concedes.  

                                 DR. BRODKEY
                        What exactly is numb, Davis?  Can
                        you point to it for me?

           Davis thinks... he waves a hand over THE BULK OF HIS BODY.

                                 DAVIS
                        It's this whole area right in here.

           Brodkey nods with experience.  Starting to get the picture.

                                 DR. BRODKEY
                        How long have you felt like this?

                                 DAVIS
                        I couldn't say for sure. 
                             (counting in his head)
                        Maybe twenty years?  Give or take.

           The doctor lays his chart down.  Prepares his prognosis.  

                                 DR. BRODKEY
                        I'm sorry to hear about your wife,
                        Davis.  Loss is a strange thing...

           As the doctor continues, Davis TUNES HIM OUT... he glances
           at the CHARTS on the wall... detailed illustrations of the 
           skeletal system, the muscles, the brain, and finally... the
           HEART.  The source of human life.  He's mesmerized by it. 

           Suddenly, the paper heart BEGINS TO BEAT.  This brings us to...

           INT. OPERATING ROOM (DAYDREAM) -- DAY

           BEEP, BEEP, BEEP... a heart monitor.  Davis lays on the table,
           eyes closed.  A SURGICAL TEAM hovers over him in WHITE MASKS.  

                                 SURGEON #1
                        Rib spreader.

           He cranks the instrument forcefully in Davis's chest.  Davis
           OPENS HIS EYES...

                                 DAVIS
                        How's it going in there?

                                 SURGEON #1
                        Coming along nicely.  Why are you
                        awake?

                                 DAVIS
                        I told them no anesthesia.  I wanna
                        get the full experience.

                                 SURGEON #1
                        Hey, it's your dime.  Suction... 

           The SUCTION DEVICE.  It SLURPS FLUID.  ANOTHER SURGEON steps
           forward as the suction stops.  He assesses the situation...  

                                 SURGEON #2 (confident)
                        Bone saw.  

                                 DAVIS
                        Bone saw?  Is that really necessary?

                                 SURGEON #2
                        It's essential. 

           They hand him his instrument.... like a chain saw with a
           long narrow blade.  He starts it with a PULL CORD... 
           WHAAAAAAAAAA!!!  He goes to work.  Davis's body shakes, a
           powdery debris clouding the air.  Then... it stops. 

           The team looks into the chest cavity.  They start WHISPERING,
           SHAKING THEIR HEADS... looks grim.

                                 DAVIS
                        Could you please stop whispering and
                        tell me what the problem is?  I
                        promise I won't freak out. 
                                 SURGEON #1 
                        Mr. Mitchell, it seems that a large
                        part of your heart... is missing.  

                                 DAVIS
                        What?  How could that happen?

                                 SURGEON #2
                        Judging from the bite pattern, I'd
                        say gypsy moths.  

                                 DAVIS
                        Fucking gypsy moths?  

                                 SURGEON #2
                        Well, it starts out a caterpillar...

                                 DAVIS
                        Yeah, I know... how did they get in
                        my chest?

                                 SURGEON #1
                        It could be a number of things.  Are
                        you getting enough fiber?

                                 DAVIS
                        I think so.

                                 SURGEON #2
                        When you pick up heavy objects, do
                        you lift with your back or your legs?

                                 DAVIS
                        My, um... legs.

                                 SURGEON #1
                        Hmm.. then it must be you don't give
                        a shit about anything but yourself.

           Surgeon #1 snaps his gloves off.  There's the problem.   

                                 DAVIS
                        Okay.  Fine.  What do I do now?

                                 SURGEON #1
                        That's not our area.

           Surgeon #2 REMOVES DAVIS'S HEART AND HANDS IT TO HIM.  

                                 SURGEON #2
                        Your heart is in your hands.
           The surgeons disappear.  Davis holds his BEATING HEART...
           PART OF WHICH IS MISSING.  A disturbing site to say the least.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        Dear Karen.  I keep thinking about
                        my childhood.  When I was sick and I
                        would lay my head on my mother's
                        lap.  She'd run her fingers through
                        my hair.  She'd kiss my eyelids. 
                        And everything felt better.  Do you
                        think it's too late for that?

           INT. KAREN'S KITCHEN -- MORNING

           Chris and Davis sit across at the table.  Staring at each
           other.  Karen scrapes eggs on Chris's plate. 

                                 KAREN (trying too hard)
                        So, Chris... how's that math class? 
                        I was trying a few problems in your
                        book and it was like another language.  

                                 CHRIS
                        There's some guy eating breakfast in
                        Carl's kitchen and you wanna know if
                        I'm good at math?  You're so transparent.

                                 KAREN 
                        Can you just... okay?  Gimme a break. 
                        It's my kitchen too. 

           Karen is embarrassed.  Davis sits there patiently. 

                                 KAREN (explaining) (CONT'D)
                        Davis is a friend.  We've been
                        spending time together because that's
                        what friends do.  You spend time. 

                                 CHRIS
                        You're such a liar.

                                 KAREN (snapping)
                        The man's wife just died, you shit. 
                        Have some compassion.

           Karen immediately regrets her comment.  She scrapes eggs
           onto Davis's plate, then stands there awkwardly.

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        I have to get ready. 

           She escapes down the hall.  Chris and Davis are left alone.  

                                 CHRIS
                        Your wife died?
           Davis nods.  Starts eating.

                                 CHRIS (CONT'D)
                        How?  

                                 DAVIS
                        Massive trauma to the head.  Can you
                        pass the juice?  

           He passes the juice.  Looks at Davis a bit differently.

                                 CHRIS
                        I was thinking about what you said. 
                        About how I'm not using the F-word
                        properly.

                                 DAVIS
                        Oh, yeah.  What'd you come up with?

                                 CHRIS
                        I think you were right.  I'm gonna
                        try harder.

                                 DAVIS
                        Good for you.  The little things are
                        important.  

           Davis pours himself some OJ. 

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY

           The MORNING BELL.  Chris walks past a swarm of TEENAGERS,
           backpack over his shoulder.  No one acknowledges him.  

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL/ CAFETERIA -- AFTERNOON

           Chris is at the far end of the lunch table.  Again, ALL ALONE. 

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELDS -- DAY

           TRACK AND FIELD PRACTICE.  Boys and girls in uniform, spread
           out all over the field. 

           IN THE STANDS... Chris is the only one in the bleachers,
           keyed in on the HIGH JUMPERS.  ANDREW WHITE IS AMONG THEM.  

           Andrew takes his turn... a graceful stride before hurling
           himself over the bar.  Effortless. 

           Chris holds his hand over his eye like a telescope...  
           THROUGH THE TINY HOLE IN HIS FIST... it's just Andrew.

           INT. DEMO HOUSE -- DAY

           Davis SWINGS A SLEDGEHAMMER... CRUSHING A  FIREPLACE with
           uncontrolled energy.  But he starts to slow.  
           His energy fading.  Finally, he stops.  

           He surveys the damage.  The frame of the house exposed like
           a skeleton.  Disappointment washes over.  The drugs aren't
           working.  As he drops the sledge and steps toward the door...

           He SCREAMS OUT.  He falls to the ground and holds his foot... 

           There's a BLOCK OF WOOD attached to the bottom by a THREE
           INCH NAIL.  Jimmy and Owen rush into the room to find Davis
           writhing in pain...

                                 JIMMY
                        Oh, shit.  That don't look good.

           Davis takes in the gruesome site for a moment, then WRENCHES
           THE NAIL from his foot, SCREAMING AGAIN... invigorated by
           this new sensation. 

                                 DAVIS
                        Goddamn that fucking hurt!  Shit-Yeah!

           Jimmy and Owen look at each other... this guy's crazy. 

           INT. KAREN'S HOUSE/ LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

           ON THE COUCH.  Davis has his foot propped up, wrapped in a
           bandage. 

           AT THE TABLE, Karen is engaged in the latest LETTER.  We
           hear the end...

                                 KAREN (quietly, to herself)
                         ... And everything felt better.  Do
                        you think it's too late for that?

           She looks over at Davis. 

                                 KAREN (to Davis) (CONT'D)
                        No... it's not too late. 

           EXT. COUCH FORT -- NIGHT

           CUSHIONS make up the walls and roof of this adolescent COUCH
           FORT.  A BLANKET draped over top.  A DIM GLOW inside. 

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        I used to make these with my baby
                        sitter when I was little.  

           The HISS of a joint being smoked...

                                 KAREN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        She kissed me once when I was
                        sleeping.  I still remember how soft
                        her lips were.  
                                 DAVIS (O.S.)
                        My baby sitter was six feet tall
                        with hairy arms and cankles.

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        What are cankles?

                                 DAVIS (O.S.)
                        It's when there's no separation
                        between your calf and your ankle. 

           INT. COUCH FORT -- CONTINUOUS

           Karen and Davis share a laugh.  A FLASHLIGHT set up between
           them.  Karen holds the joint as the moment settles.

                                 KAREN
                        When was the last time you really
                        cared about something?

           He's blank.  He shakes his head.

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        Think hard.  It's there.  
                             (then)
                        What about when you were a kid? 
                        When you weren't allowed off the
                        block without permission.  What was
                        the most important thing?

           He searches his memory.  Nothing's coming.  Then, a flash...

                                 DAVIS
                        Running fast. 
                             (remembering)
                        Yeah.  That's it.  All the kids would
                        race on the blacktop at recess. 
                        Even in the winter when it was
                        freezing.  But I was always so slow...

           FOOTAGE OF 2ND GRADE RECESS:  A million eight year-olds 
           PLAYING, SCREAMING, FIGHTING.  Winter jackets zipped tight.  

           We see TEN KIDS lined up, shoulder to shoulder.  Snow drifting
           to the blacktop.  IN SLOW MOTION, they start RUNNING... 

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Just once, I wanted to come from
                        behind and blow everyone away...

           It seems innocent, but there's an intensity on their faces. 
           Youth hanging in the balance.  RUNNING AS FAST AS THEY CAN... 
                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And everyone would cheer for me...
                        just like they did for Ben Carney
                        and Mike Barone, those speedy
                        motherfuckers.

           THE FANFARE... boys and girls cheering on the front-runners
           like they were running gods.  The losers trail off in shame.

           REAL TIME.  Davis clings to a feeling he thought was dead.

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        That's it.  I wanted to run really
                        fast, Karen.  More than anything.
                             (then)
                        I almost said break dancing.

           They both smile.  Davis suddenly seems relieved. 

                                 KAREN
                        Let's stay in here forever.

           With that, the roof collapses.  

           INT. KAREN'S HOUSE (BATHROOM) -- DAY

           Chris is writing on the mirror with LIPSTICK.  A CIRCLE drawn
           around his REFLECTION, and written above it... "FAG." 

           He stares into the mirror with discontent.  He doesn't like
           who's looking back.  He reaches into his backpack and pulls
           out a HANDGUN.  He takes aim at his reflection...

           SLOWLY SQUEEZING the trigger... the DOOR OPENS... it's Davis.  

                                 CHRIS
                        Jesus!  Do you live here now or
                        something?

                                 DAVIS
                        Sorry.  I didn't know you were home.

           Chris wipes off the mirror, hiding the gun behind his back.

                                 DAVIS (noticing) (CONT'D)
                        What's that?

                                 CHRIS
                        Nothing.

           Davis just looks at him.  Chris finally shows him the gun.

                                 CHRIS  (CONT'D)
                        Whatever... it's Carl's.  I was just
                        holding it.
                                 DAVIS
                        Can I see?

           Chris hands it over.  Davis weighs it in his hand.  

                                 CHRIS
                        You ever shoot a gun before?

                                 DAVIS  (aiming)
                        Just paintball.  We had an office
                        tournament last year and some prick
                        from accounting shot me in the neck.

           He lowers the gun.  

                                 DAVIS
                        Let's go try it out.

           INT. SECOND GENERATION VENDING CO.(OFFICE) -- DAY

           Karen types on her computer.  WE SEE HER WORDS APPEAR...

                                 KAREN (V.O.)
                        Dear Davis.  There's something I
                        need to tell you.  If I don't do it
                        soon, I'm afraid I never will.  I've
                        got that feeling again.  Like
                        something's going to happen...

           The INTERCOM BEEPS...

                                 MAN ON INTERCOM
                        Karen, line one.

           She looks at the BLINKING BUTTON with anticipation.  Answers.

                                 KAREN (into phone)
                        Hello? 
                             (then)
                        Hi, Carl.  Yeah.  I miss you, too.

           Her excitement melts away.  She looks at the MONITOR.  DELETES
           the letter.

           EXT. WOODED AREA -- DAY

           Chris has his fingers in his ears while Davis POPS OFF A FEW
           ROUNDS.  He's shooting at a DIRT MOUND.  SHOTS ECHOING.  

                                 DAVIS 
                        Your turn.

           Chris takes the gun and faces the dirt mound.  He holds it
           up... aims... squeezing the trigger...
           BANG... the gun recoils, almost knocking him backwards.  He
           fires a FEW MORE ROUNDS, excited by this new feeling of power.   

                                 CHRIS
                        Let's shoot something.

                                 DAVIS
                        Like what?

                                 CHRIS
                        I dunno.  A deer or something.

                                 DAVIS
                        I don't think there's any out here.

                                 CHRIS
                        What about a squirrel?  Let's kill a
                        squirrel.

           Davis looks around.  A SMALL ANIMAL darts off into the brush.

                                 DAVIS
                        Squirrels are very small and elusive. 
                        I doubt you'd hit one.

           He looks around for a target, thinking, thinking, then...

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Hold on a second...

           He walks off...

           EXT. WOODED AREA/ SUV -- MOMENTS LATER

           We find Davis's truck parked on a dirt trail.  He opens the
           back door, looks inside to find... the BULLET PROOF VEST.

           EXT. WOODED AREA -- MOMENTS LATER

           Davis is STRAPPING ON THE VEST.  Chris helps him adjust it.
           He steps back to look at him.

                                 DAVIS
                        How does it look?

                                 CHRIS
                        Who gives a shit?  Are you sure this
                        thing is real?

                                 DAVIS
                        Yeah, I mean... yeah.  I mean...

           Davis looks it over... not completely positive.
                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Just don't miss.  But if you do, try
                        and hit my shoulder.  Or maybe my
                        thigh.

           Chris takes a few steps back... a few more... a couple more...

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Whoa, that's a little far, isn't it?

                                 CHRIS
                        I don't know.  I never did this
                        before.

           Chris considers his range.  He takes several steps forward. 
           He cocks the hammer back...

                                 CHRIS (CONT'D)
                        Ready?

           Davis stands up straight.  Takes a deep breath.  Set.  

                                 DAVIS
                        Yeah.  

           Chris raises the gun, takes aim... SQUEEZING ON THE TRIGGER...
           SQUEEZING... THEN...

                                 CHRIS
                        Do you want me to count down?

                                 DAVIS
                        I don't care.  It's up to you.  

                                 CHRIS
                        Okay... I'll surprise you.

                                 DAVIS
                        Yeah.  That's good.  Surprise me.

           Davis sets himself again.  Chris raises the gun and takes
           aim... SQUEEZING... THEN...

                                 CHRIS
                        Safety's on.

           He searches for the SAFETY SWITCH... meanwhile, the gun is
           still aimed toward Davis, drifting up and down, left, right...

                                 DAVIS
                        It's on the side there.  

                                 CHRIS
                        Where?  
                                 DAVIS
                        Right there... on the side... of the
                        gun.

           Chris flips the switch... BANG!  DAVIS IS HIT... KNOCKED
           BACKWARD... Chris freezes.

           Davis winces.  Looks to see the SLUG imbedded in the vest.  

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Nice shot. 

           Chris holds the smoking gun.  Getting some kind of rush.  

                                 CHRIS
                        What did it feel like?

                                 DAVIS
                        It hurt.  But not like I thought it
                        would.  You'd think getting shot
                        would be excruciating.  This was
                        more like...

           CHRIS FIRES AGAIN... ANOTHER ONE IN THE CHEST.  DAVIS HITS
           THE GROUND COUGHING, GASPING FOR AIR.  Chris stands over him.

                                 CHRIS
                        Surprise.  

           Davis catches his breath.  

                                 DAVIS
                        You're one fucked up kid.

                                 CHRIS
                        You're one fucked up adult.

           Davis ponders this usage of "fuck."

                                 DAVIS
                        Not bad.  But I think you're trying
                        too hard.  

           INT. EASTMAN, RITTER (HALLWAY) -- DAY

           Davis limps down the hallway, refreshed by his latest
           experience.  Colleagues stop and watch him pass.  

           EXT. DAVIS'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Davis approaches his secretary.  She's surprised to see him.

                                 DAVIS
                        Hey, Amy.  Have you seen Phil?  I
                        think he's been looking for me.
                                 AMY
                        Davis.  Hi.  Yeah, um... they're
                        doing the interviews.
                             (off is non-reaction)
                        For the scholarship candidates.

           INT. CONFERENCE 2 -- DAY

           CLOSE ON TODD (17), jacket and tie.  In the middle of a story. 

                                 TODD (confident)
                        It was the last lap and I was behind
                        by at least a full length.  And let
                        me remind you that butterfly is not
                        my stroke.  I'm a freestyle swimmer
                        by nature. 

           WE SEE Phil and Meg at the other end of the table.  Steven
           sits close.  All impressed by this young man's confidence.

                                 TODD (CONT'D)
                        So, I blocked everything out and
                        focused on my breathing.  It was
                        just me and the water.  As one.

           He pauses for dramatic affect.

                                 MEG
                        So what happened?!

                                 TODD
                        About two meters from the wall I...

           A RAP ON THE DOOR.  Davis pokes his head in...

                                 DAVIS
                        Hey guys.

                                 PHIL
                        Davis, we're in the middle of
                        something.

                                 DAVIS
                        You don't mind if I sit in, do you?

           You can feel the air leave the room as Davis limps over to
           their side of the table.  Steven slides down to make room.  

                                 STEVEN
                        You okay, pal?  Looks like you're
                        limping.

                                 DAVIS
                        A nail went through my foot, Steve. 
                        It fucking hurt like hell.  But I'm
                        good.
           Meg's face hardens.  Davis makes himself comfortable.  Todd
           shifts in his seat, his momentum is gone.

                                 MEG
                        So, Todd... you were saying?

                                 TODD
                        Oh, right... we, um... won.

                                 MEG
                        Ahh.  You won.  Wonderful.

                                 DAVIS
                        What did you win?

           Todd doesn't know where to begin.  Phil's anger is palpable.

                                 PHIL 
                        Swimming.  He's a swimmer. 

                                 DAVIS
                        Ahh.  I swim.  
                             (beat)
                        Not competitively.  I used to do
                        laps at the "Y" every Monday and
                        Friday.  Then I started thinking
                        about how many people must urinate
                        in that pool on a daily basis.  That
                        ruined it for me.  
                             (then)
                        But congratulations.  And good luck
                        with my wife's scholarship.

           There's a clock on the wall.  You can hear it TICK.  

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Who's next?

           Meg and Phil are beyond words.  Davis isn't leaving.  

           This begins A MONTAGE OF THE SCHOLARSHIP CANDIDATES... LOOKING
           DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA.

                                 YOUNG MAN

                                 COCKY YOUNG MAN (with a wink)
                        I got one answer wrong on my SAT's.  
           As Davis watches this confessional of academic excellence,
           his mind wanders, reading the kids for WHO THEY REALLY ARE...

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        My parents are in pharmaceutical
                        sales.  They could afford to send me
                        to school on the space station...

                                 YOUNG BLACK MAN
                        I'm the black candidate.  Keep your

                        My dad gave me a Lexus for my
                        birthday.  I fingered my best friend's
                        sister in the back seat.  Slut.  

           BACK TO DAVIS... realizing that these kids are all privileged
           and completely full of shit.

                                 DAVIS
                        Legacy.

           That was OUT LOUD.  Phil has had enough.  

           INT. BATHROOM -- LATER

           The stall has been fixed.  Phil has Davis cornered.  

                                 PHIL
                        Where is this coming from?  This
                        selfishness.  This disrespect.  Do
                        you think you're the only one who
                        has ever lost someone close to you? 
                        I've felt more pain and helplessness 
                        in this life than you could ever
                        fathom.  But you don't see me acting
                        the fool.  Do you know why?

           Davis doesn't have an answer.

                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        Because I'm a man.  And I won't let
                        this fucked up world break me.

           Phil is pleased with this speech.  He stands strong.  He
           reaches out to Davis.  A peace offering. 

                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        There's still time, Davis.  You can
                        still be a part of this.  We're having
                        a dinner next week.  It's important.
                                 DAVIS
                        Is that when you'll decide which
                        underprivileged candidate is worthy of
                        a Julia Eastman-Mitchell Scholarship? 

           Phil tenses.  A quiet anger.

                                 PHIL
                        You will not disrespect her memory. 
                        If you choose to self destruct, fine. 
                        But I won't let you take her with you.

           Phil holds out a FOLDER.  

                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        Sign it.

           He forces it in Davis's hand and walks out of the bathroom.  

           Davis looks at the cover of the PROPOSAL... an artist's
           depiction of WOMAN ON A THOROUGHBRED HORSE... TREES, A
           SUNSET... very pleasant.

           INT. SUV (PARKING GARAGE) -- LATER

           The truck is off.  Davis is flipping through the proposal. 
           The CAMERA CAPTURES A SERIES OF WORDS AND NUMBERS...  

           SECTION 1A... ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE... OPERATING AGREEMENT...
           CLAUSE 3F... 7.45... 1.6....  Then, JULIA'S VOICE...

                                 JULIA'S VOICE
                        Over a three year period, my principal
                        earnings will quadruple.  Wow, I've
                        become quite an investment, Davis. 
                        I'm gaining interest by the minute.

                                 DAVIS
                        Your father.  He's concerned about
                        your legacy.

                                 JULIA'S VOICE
                        That's a stupid word.  Percentage,
                        decimal point...

                                 DAVIS
                        I know.  I said the same thing.

                                 JULIA'S VOICE
                        Legacies are for important people
                        who did important things.  Dividend. 
                        M.L.K., J.F.K., F.D.R... pretty much
                        anyone with recognizable initials.
                                 DAVIS
                        You fostered those kittens once. 
                        That was nice.

                                 JULIA'S VOICE
                        Don't be an idiot.  Take the money. 
                        It's yours.

                                 DAVIS
                        I don't want it.  It won't make me
                        happy.  I'm having a little crisis. 

                                 JULIA'S VOICE
                        You feel like something's missing?

                                 DAVIS
                        Yes.  I'm trying to take everything
                        apart, but...

                                 JULIA'S VOICE
                        Did you take us apart yet?  

           This never occurred to him.  He waits for more...

                                 JULIA'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                        This conversation is too obvious. 
                        Just sign me already...

           INT. HOME DEPOT -- DAY

           Davis and Chris walk down an aisle.  Davis pushes a CART...
           it's already filled with a number of demolition tools.

                                 CHRIS
                        Why are you buying all this shit? 
                        Don't they have tools for you?

                                 DAVIS
                        I quit that job.  New project.  New
                        tools.

           He grabs a few METAL PRY BARS... different shapes, sizes. 
           Throws them in the cart and keeps moving...

                                 CHRIS
                        Davis, if I asked you a question,
                        you'd give me an straight answer
                        right?  I mean, that's your thing...
                        you're honest about everything, right?

                                 DAVIS
                        That is my thing.

                                 CHRIS
                        Do you think I'm gay?
           Davis slows down a little.

                                 DAVIS
                        I don't know, Chris.  Do you think
                        you're gay?

                                 CHRIS
                        I don't know.  I think maybe.  But I
                        figured you would tell me.

           Davis grabs a SLEDGE HAMMER... throws it in the cart.

                                 DAVIS
                        Well, let's figure it out together. 
                        Do you like boys or girls?

           Chris looks perplexed.

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Okay... let's take a step back. 
                        I'll simplify.  Do you like girls?

                                 CHRIS
                        I don't know.  I mean, I think
                        Jennifer Hymen is pretty.  She flirts
                        with me in gym and I can see the
                        outline of her underwear through her
                        sweat pants.  But I'm not sure if I
                        like her or I'm just fixating.

           Davis stops.

                                 DAVIS
                        You go to school with a girl named
                        Jennifer Hymen?  That's really her
                        name?

                                 CHRIS
                        Yeah.

                                 DAVIS
                        That fuckin' blows.
                             (keeps moving)
                        Okay... what about boys?  Is there a
                        boy at school that you like?  Do you
                        find someone attractive?

           Davis looks over the POWER TOOLS.

                                 CHRIS
                        Maybe Andrew White.  He's a Junior,
                        but he has the same gym period too. 
                        We have to get changed together.
                                 DAVIS
                        And do you watch him... when he's
                        getting changed?

                                 CHRIS
                        No.

                                 DAVIS
                        Then I don't think you're gay.

           Davis throws a POWER DRILL in the cart.

                                 CHRIS
                        But I'm trying not to look.  I have
                        to tell myself not to.

                                 DAVIS
                        Okay... that's normal though.  You're
                        young.  You're curious.

                                 CHRIS
                        And sometimes I imagine his cock in
                        my mouth.

                                 DAVIS
                        Oh.  That's different.

           Davis stops again.  Sorts through this new information. 

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Well, I think you're probably gay,
                        Chris.  But it's also possible you
                        could be bisexual.  Either way, you're
                        gonna get tortured.  If I were you,
                        I'd pretend to like girls for a few
                        more years.  Then move to a major city. 
                        New York, San Francisco... maybe Los
                        Angeles if you prefer warmer weather.

           Davis grabs a "SAWS ALL" off the shelf... it looks exactly
           like the bone-saw from his daydream.  Nice.  

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Anything else? 

           INT. KAREN'S HOUSE (BATHROOM) -- NIGHT

           Karen sits in the empty tub smoking a joint.  All alone. 
           Several YELLOW LETTERS crumpled around her. 

           INT. DAVIS'S HOME -- DAY

           Davis has his new tools laid out on his expensive wood floor. 
           Chris steps up next to him.  Both wearing SAFETY GOGGLES.

                                 DAVIS
                        Choose your weapon.  
           Chris eyes the instruments of destruction.  He picks up
           MASSIVE SLEDGE HAMMER... barely able to lift it.  

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Don't be so ambitious.  Try this...

           He offers more suitable tool... Chris takes it.  Davis reaches
           for his new "Saws All."  He grasps it firmly.

                                 CHRIS
                        What are we doing again?

                                 DAVIS
                        We're taking my marriage apart.  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           THE KITCHEN...

           A LOUD, METAL GRIND... Davis is cutting into the COUNTER
           TOP, his whole body vibrating.  Behind him, Chris swings a
           sledge with all his might, bashing the feeble CABINETS...

           QUICK CUTS AROUND THE HOUSE...

           -- The boys smash, cut and break everything in sight.  
           TABLES, WINDOWS, CHANDELIERS... SHEET ROCK WALLS CRUMBLE. 

           EXT. DAVIS'S STREET -- DAY

           Davis's NEIGHBOR gets his mail.  He HEARS THE SOUNDS OF
           DESTRUCTION and looks over at the Mitchell house.  A BOWLING
           BALL crashes through an upstairs window. 

           INT. BATHROOM -- DAY

           Chris bashes a PORCELAIN TOILET with a SLEDGE HAMMER.  WATER
           SPRAYS EVERYWHERE.

           Davis comes in carrying a TELEVISION.  Chris steps back...
           DAVIS HURLS IT THROUGH THE SHOWER DOOR... GLASS SHATTERS. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Fuckin' A.

           Chris waits for F-word approval.  But it rang a little false.

                                 DAVIS
                        I admire your commitment.  Keep at
                        it.

           EXT. DAVIS'S HOME/ FRONT PORCH -- EVENING

           Davis and Chris sit on the steps.  Each drinking a beer.   
           A job well done.  THEY SEE the STATION WAGON inching up the
           road.  It slows to a stop in front of his house.  Idling...  
                                 CHRIS (to Davis)
                        Who's that?

           Davis has no idea.  He stands up.  Grabs a LOOSE BRICK and
           starts walking toward the street... 

           THE CAR STARTS TO PULL AWAY.  We can see A MALE FIGURE in
           the front seat.  DAVIS RUNS FOR IT... THE CAR ACCELERATES... 

           HE TOSSES THE BRICK THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW... 

                                 DAVIS
                        WHO THE FUCK DRIVES A STATION WAGON?!

           The taillights fade down the block. 

           INT. KAREN'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

           Karen eats by herself at the kitchen table.  Chris enters,
           covered in dirt.  He goes to the refrigerator.  She watches
           him, badly wanting to make a connection.

                                 KAREN
                        So, you've been hanging out with
                        Davis, huh?  

           Chris doesn't acknowledge her.  He vanishes down the hall. 

           INT. KAREN'S HOUSE/ LIVING ROOM -- LATER

           Karen enters to find Chris on the couch FAST ASLEEP.  The TV
           turned down low.  She makes her way over and quietly sits
           next to him.  After a moment, she eases him onto her lap and
           watches him sleep.  She RUNS HER FINGERS THROUGH HIS HAIR...

                                 KAREN (whispering)
                        I don't know how to talk to you. 
                        I'm afraid to say the wrong thing. 
                        Why don't you just tell me, okay? 
                        Tell me what to say and I'll say it. 
                        Tell me what to do.  I don't want to
                        pretend anymore.  

           He's still asleep.  She leans over and gently KISSES HIS
           EYELIDS.  His body stirs and he rolls over, facing away from
           her.  His EYES OPEN for just a brief moment... but long enough
           to know he was listening.

           EXT. DAVIS'S DRIVEWAY -- DAY

           Davis and Chris are walking down the driveway, covered in
           dirt.  There's a FLATBED TRUCK ROLLING down the street.  It
           gets closer.  WE NOW SEE on the back of the truck...

                                 CHRIS
                        Is that a bulldozer?
                                 DAVIS
                        You can buy just about anything on
                        Ebay.
                             (then)
                        I hope it comes with a manual. 

           EXT. DAVIS'S STREET -- LATER

           Davis DRIVES HIS NEW BULLDOZER down the street.  A SMALL
           CROWD has gathered.  Chris watches from the curb.  He shifts
           gears... the rig BUCKS AND STALLS.  QUIET.

           Davis turns the key... the engine GRINDS.  He turns it
           again... it ROARS TO LIFE.  

           The rig lurches forward, parents hold their children close. 
           He turns onto his grass and stops.  The ENGINE REVS, SMOKE
           BILLOWS...

           Behind him, A MERCEDES SEDAN pulls up to the curb, the window
           powers down.  It's PHIL AND MEG.

           Then, Davis CHARGES.  The bulldozer tramples his lawn and
           CRASHES THROUGH THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE... the PORCH COLLAPSES. 
           CONCRETE SPLINTERS.  The machine STALLS.  

           An eerie silence follows.  Neighbors chatter with disbelief as
           Davis emerges from the dust.  Phil and Meg now stand on the
           sidewalk, sickened by this sight.  Chris keeps his distance.

                                 DAVIS (walking over)
                        Phil.  Meg.  Did you wanna come in?

                                 MEG
                        This was my daughters home.  You had
                        no right.

                                 PHIL
                        This ends now.  My attorneys will be
                        in touch.

           Phil pulls Meg away and helps her in the car.  He turns back.

                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        You're a disgrace, Davis.  You've
                        destroyed everything.  How does that
                        make you feel?

                                 DAVIS 
                        It doesn't. 

           Phil gets in, the car pulls away.  Davis looks back at the
           shell of his home.  That look of dissatisfaction creeps in.  
           INT. DAVIS'S HOME -- LATER

           Davis stands in the middle of his house and surveys the utter
           destruction.  It's completely torn down to the frame.

           ROOM TO ROOM.  Davis sifts through the debris.  Something
           must be missing.  Something still need smashing.

           IN THE BEDROOM.  He searching the remains of his marriage. 
           Complete destruction.  Nothing left to take apart.  Except... 

           A DRESSER.  Still intact.  Davis grabs the SLEDGEHAMMER AND
           STARTS SWINGING.  The antique wood splinters.  JULIA'S CLOTHES
           spew everywhere.  He keeps going till there's nothing left
           standing.  Complete destruction. 

           He drops the sledge and sits down.  Exhausted.  Something
           catches his eye... AN ENVELOPE beneath her underwear drawer.  

           INT. DAVIS'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Davis sets the envelope down on the bed.  The front is
           labeled, "Julia Eastman-Mitchell.  June 5, 2001."       
           Chris comes in behind him.

                                 CHRIS
                        What's that?

           Davis peels it open.  Removes an OFFICIAL DOCUMENT.  The cover
           reads "FRYMAN MEDICAL GROUP."  Davis flips the page to find... 

           AN ULTRASOUND.  He freezes. 

           ON the details.  DATE: JUNE 5, 2001.  PATIENT:  JULIA EASTMAN-
           MITCHELL.  Finally, the FETAL PICTURE.  A black and white
           blur, very obscure.  He looks closer.  Even closer...

           A TINY HEARTBEAT.  Gentle, almost imperceptible.  The shape
           of the fetus is suddenly clear.  

           INT. KAREN'S SPARE BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Davis and Karen lay next to each other.  He's in his head.

                                 KAREN
                        Carl comes home soon.

           He doesn't respond.  Karen slides closer.  She starts kissing
           him.  But there's no reaction.  She stops.

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        It's not fair that you feel nothing
                        and I feel everything.  

           She turns her back to him.
           EXT. STRIP MALL PARKING LOT -- MORNING

           Karen comes out of the QUICK MART with a COFFEE AND BAGEL. 
           She puts the coffee on her car, reaches for the handle. 
           It's STUCK.  Pulls HARDER.  Still stuck.  HER COFFEE SPILLS
           all over her new pantsuit.

           KAREN SNAPS... starts KICKING THE CAR DOOR IN... really losing
           it.  People stop to watch.  

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET -- DAY

           Chris is walking home from school.  His backpack over his
           shoulder.  An OLD CAMARO pulls up next to him.  Mint. 

           The window rolls down... it's ANDREW WHITE.  Chris stops.  

                                 ANDREW
                        Wanna ride?

           INT. ANDREW'S CAMARO -- MOMENTS LATER

           The engine HUMS.  Chris sits in the passenger's seat.  Andrew
           drives, wearing his Track letter jacket. 

                                 ANDREW
                        You know anything about cars?

                                 CHRIS
                        Not really. 

                                 ANDREW
                        This is a '69 Camaro.  It's a classic. 
                        Probably worth more than your parents
                        make a year. 

           Chris tries not to engage.  Looking out the window.

                                 ANDREW (CONT'D)
                        You going to Kirpatrick's party
                        tonight?  I hear they're getting
                        some nasty stripper.

                                 CHRIS
                        This is my street...

           But Andrew keeps driving.  He gives Chris a nod.

           EXT. SKYVIEW PARK -- DAY

           The Camaro pulls into the vacant parking lot.  Empty
           basketball courts.  Kids playing soccer in the distance.  

           INT. ANDREW'S CAMARO -- CONTINUOUS

           Andrew turns off the engine.  Chris keeps his distance.  
                                 ANDREW
                        Why are you so far away?

                                 CHRIS
                        I don't know.  I'm just sitting.  

                                 ANDREW
                        I've seen you watching me. 

           Chris won't look up.

                                 ANDREW (CONT'D)
                        It's okay.  You trust me, don't you?

           Andrew puts his hand on Chris's neck.  When he finally looks
           up, Andrew leans in to kiss him.  Chris pulls away...  

           Andrew leans in again.  This time, CHRIS LETS IT HAPPEN.  He
           KISSES ANDREW BACK.  Andrew puts his hand on Chris's thigh
           when ANOTHER CAR PULLS INTO THE LOT, MUSIC BLASTING...

                                 ANDREW (noticing car) (CONT'D)
                        Oh, shit.  Get out...

                                 CHRIS
                        What?

                                 ANDREW
                        Get the fuck out!

           Chris hesitates... the car steers toward them...

                                 ANDREW (CONT'D)
                        Get out of my fucking car, you faggot!

           Andrew opens Chris's door and PUSHES HIM OUT... Chris hits
           the pavement just as the other car stops next to them...

           EXT. CAMARO/ PARKING LOT -- CONTINUOUS

           THREE GUYS (17) hop out just as Andrew jumps out past Chris.  

                                 ANDREW
                        Holy shit... this kid just tried to
                        grab my cock!

                                 TEEN #1
                        Yeah, right.  Is that jizz on your
                        lip, White?  

                                 ANDREW
                        Fuck you, Johnston.  

           They start taunting.  Chris gets up...
                                 ANDREW (CONT'D)
                        I was gonna give him a ride home.  I
                        didn't know he was fucking homo.

                                 CHRIS
                        Shut up!  I am not!

                                 TEEN #2 
                        Oh my god, look... he's got a hard
                        on!   

           They tease Chris even more.  Nowhere to run.

                                 TEEN #3
                        Where did you find this kid?  He's
                        so gay!

                                 CHRIS
                        Stop saying that!

                                 ANDREW
                        Go suck a dick, homo.

           Chris is spinning... his rage gets the best of him... he
           tries to tackle Andrew.  But Andrew PUNCHES HIM IN THE
           STOMACH... THROWS HIM TO THE GROUND.

           The guys stand over him, LAUGHING, TAUNTING.  Chris looks up. 
           He only sees Andrew.  He pulls himself to his feet, RUNS OFF... 

           INT. LINCOLN TUNNEL -- EVENING

           Artificial lights streaming by.  We're GLIDING ALONG.  

                                 DAVIS (O.S.)
                        Wrecking balls.

           INT. SUV -- CONTINUOUS

           Karen and Davis are both dressed up.

                                 KAREN
                        What was that?

                                 DAVIS
                        That's what I was thinking about. 
                        Those huge metal balls that swing
                        from cranes.  I figured you were
                        gonna ask, so... 
                             (then)
                        I'd love to get my hands on one.

           She looks at him for a beat.  
                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Why won't you tell me where we're
                        going?

                                 DAVIS
                        I did.  A get-together.  

           She fidgets nervously.  

                                 KAREN
                        Davis? 

           He looks over at her.  Something on the tip of her tongue... 

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        Never mind.  

           She puts her hand on her stomach.  ON THAT FEELING.

           INT. CHRIS'S BEDROOM -- LATER

           Chris comes in and slams his bedroom door.  He starts pacing,
           the weight of his teenage world crushing down.  He sits down
           and hangs his head in his hands.  He's in a dark place. 
           Then, a decision.  He reaches under the bed...

           AND PULLS OUT THE GUN. 

           EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE/ DRIVEWAY -- LATER

           Chris walks out the door and over to his mother's car.  He
           gets in.  The car starts and he pulls out of the driveway...

           INT. PHIL AND MEG'S BROWNSTONE -- EVENING

           Davis and Karen enter the grand living room to witness a
           catered affair.  About THIRTY GUESTS mingling with champagne
           and plastic smiles.  Several people notice Davis and the
           whispers begin.  Karen still isn't sure what this is yet.  

           Meg and Phil walk over to them.

                                 PHIL
                        Davis.  I don't remember sending you
                        an invitation.  

                                 DAVIS
                        Maybe it got lost in the mail, Phil. 
                        You wanted me to be a part of this,
                        right?  You said it was important.

           Phil glares at him.  Karen is just realizing where she is. 
           Trying not to panic.  Other guests pretend not to watch.

                                 MEG (staring at Karen)
                        Who's your date.
                                 DAVIS 
                        This is Karen.  She's in customer
                        service. 

                                 KAREN (ultra uncomfortable)
                        Hi. 

           INT. PHIL AND MEG'S BROWNSTONE/ HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Karen pulls Davis aside.  She's in panic mode.

                                 KAREN
                        I hate you for this.  I'm leaving.  

                                 DAVIS
                        Karen... 

                                 KAREN
                        What's wrong with you?  Why would
                        you do this?

                                 DAVIS
                        Listen...

                                 KAREN
                        WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU!?

                                 DAVIS
                        I DON'T KNOW!

           That exchange was a little loud.  The crowd hushes.  Karen
           gets her bearings. 

                                 KAREN
                        I don't know how to help you, Davis. 
                        I'm broken too.  If we're just using
                        each other, fine.  But lets be honest
                        about it.  Tell me what you want.

                                 DAVIS
                        I want you to stay.  

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET -- NIGHT

           Chris gets out of the car and walks toward a HOUSE PARTY at
           the end of the block.  Kids are outside drinking and smoking.  
           WE SEE ANDREW'S CAMARO parked in the driveway.   

           INT. HOUSE PARTY/ LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 

           Chris walks through the front door to LOUD MUSIC and KEG
           STANDS.  He's smaller than these kids.  Definitely out of
           place.  He drifts through the crowd.  Anonymous.  
           EXT. HOUSE PARTY/ BACK YARD -- MOMENTS LATER

           Chris wanders around with his hands in his pockets.  He's
           searching, anger and fear in his eyes.  He stops... WE SEE
           Andrew White, surrounded by a group of kids.  

           INT. BROWNSTONE/ BATHROOM -- NIGHT

           Karen is DIGGING THROUGH HER PURSE.  She pulls out a ONE-
           HITTER... but it's empty.  She keeps searching.  Finds an
           EMPTY BAGGIE... getting desperate.  Counting the seconds. 

           EXT. BROWNSTONE/ BACKYARD -- EVENING

           Karen comes outside to a handful of guests smoking cigarettes. 
           She surveys the situation, but nobody fits the profile.  

           Then, she sees TODD... the cocky, young swimmer.  He's
           SNEAKING BOURBON INTO HIS SODA.

           INT. PHIL'S STUDY -- NIGHT

           Phil is behind his desk smoking a cigar.  Davis sits across
           from him.  Steven in the b.g.

                                 PHIL
                        I'm a good judge of character, Davis. 
                        I always knew you were weak.  But
                        tonight you've outdone yourself.  I
                        want you and you're friend to leave.

           Phil puffs on his cigar... 

                                 DAVIS
                        What's for dinner?

                                 PHIL
                        Don't you be smug with me.  I still
                        got enough in my gut to climb across
                        this table and kick your teeth in.

                                 DAVIS
                        You were right, Phil.  I've destroyed
                        everything.  I wanna start putting
                        things back together.  How much will
                        that cost?  

           Phil looks at him closely.  Was that an offer?  Davis doesn't
           flinch.  Phil opens his drawer and finds the PROPOSAL.  He
           slides it across the table...

           Davis looks at the cover... A WOMAN ON A HORSE.  TREES. 
           SETTING SUN.  Very pleasant. 

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Do you have a pen?
           EXT. HOUSE PARTY/ BACK YARD -- NIGHT

           WE'RE WITH Andrew now as he fills his cup up at the keg. 
           Chris steps up in front of him.  He has his hand tucked in
           his SWEATSHIRT POCKET... waiting for Andrew to look up.   

           CLOSE ON CHRIS'S HAND... ON THE GUN. 

           Andrew finally looks up to find Chris staring at him.  Andrew
           just stands there.  They're eyes are locked.  Neither making
           a move... Chris filled with confusion, fear.  AND THEN...

           Andrew walks away.  Chris is frozen.  He couldn't do it. 

           EXT. PHIL AND MEG'S BROWNSTONE -- NIGHT

           Karen and Todd are tucked away beside the house.  She's taking
           a HUGE HIT off a JOINT.  The DIN of PARTY CHATTER in b.g.

                                 TODD
                        Whoa, easy... that shit glows in the
                        dark.

           She COUGHS IT OUT.  They stand there in the darkness.  THUNDER
           RUMBLES.  It's starting to drizzle. 

                                 TODD (CONT'D)
                        Hey, Carol?

                                 KAREN
                        It's Karen.

                                 TODD
                        Oh... sorry.
                             (then)
                        Karen, can I feel your tits.

           She looks at him with disgust, but it's clear she's more
           disgusted with herself.  She takes another massive hit...

           INT. KAREN'S CAR/ RESIDENTIAL STREET-- NIGHT

           Chris sits in the car with the gun in his hands.  RAIN
           POUNDING ON THE ROOF.  He's crying.   Mad at himself.  Mad
           at the world.  This pain can't be real.  

           He looks out the windshield... and suddenly, he calms.  Like
           someone just told him a secret... and everything is better. 
           He STARTS THE CAR.  PUTS IT IN GEAR.  

           SLAMS DOWN ON THE GAS...

           CHRIS RACES DOWN THE STREET.  WE SEE THE CAMARO PARKED IN
           THE DRIVEWAY.  CHRIS GOES FASTER AND FASTER THROUGH THE
           DRIVING RAIN... THE GAUGE READING 40, 50, 60... HE YANKS THE
           WHEEL AND JUMPS THE CURB... 
           JUST AS HE'S ABOUT TO HIT THE CAMARO, THERE'S A FLASH...    

                                                         WE WHITE OUT TO:

           INT. PHIL AND MEG'S BROWNSTONE/ DINING ROOM -- LATER

           No expense spared.  A table has been set for thirty guests.  
           Phil at the head, Meg at the foot.  A WAIT STAFF stands by.                                              

           THUNDER RUMBLES OUTSIDE.  We find Karen sitting alone with
           her hand on her stomach.  She's really high.  Davis walks in
           and sits down next to her. 

                                 DAVIS
                        I thought you left.

                                 KAREN
                        No.  I'm still here.  

           Todd sits at the other side of the table.  He winks at Karen.  

           CLINK, CLINK, CLINK.  The room quiets.  Phil has the floor.
           Dark suit.  Tie.  In his element.

                                 PHIL (addressing guests)
                        Julia's mother and I... and her
                        husband, Davis... would like to thank
                        you all for sharing this special
                        evening with us.

           Eyes on Davis... renewed respect.  

                                 PHIL (addressing guests) (CONT'D)
                        The last month has been difficult to
                        say the least.  But a night like
                        tonight... surrounded by friends and
                        family... it dulls the pain.  And it
                        fills my heart with pride to know
                        we're making a difference.

           Phil smiles fondly.  He starts to move around the table.  

                                 PHIL (strolling) (CONT'D)
                        For those of you who were fortunate
                        enough to be a part of Julia's life,
                        you already know what a wonderful
                        person she was.  A beautiful soul.

           ON KAREN... she's even more high.  Staring at her plate.  

                                 PHIL (strolling) (CONT'D)
                        Meg and I will remember the moments. 
                             (fond memories)
                        A little girl on her horse.  Pealing
                        glue off her fingers after art class.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 PHIL (strolling) (CONT'D)
                        Sifting through the trash for a lost
                        retainer...

           ON DAVIS... this speech sounds familiar.

                                 PHIL  (CONT'D)
                        And on her wedding night.  Looking
                        so radiant in her mother's dress.

           ON MEG... her eyes swimming.  Phil has arrives behind her
           and puts his hand on her shoulder.  She touches it.

           ON KAREN... she's noticing something... on the wall directly
           behind Phil and Meg is a PORTRAIT OF THEMSELVES.  It shows
           Meg sitting at the table and Phil behind her with one hand
           on her shoulder.

                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        Julia brought out the best in people. 
                        It was her gift.  Now, through the
                        Julia Eastman-Mitchell Scholarship
                        Fund, that gift will be her legacy. 

           A few claps give way to APPLAUSE.  Karen WHISPERS TO DAVIS. 
           He looks over at the portrait and the uncanny likeness to
           the real thing.  It's EXACTLY THE SAME... EVEN THE CLOTHES.  

           The applause is suddenly replaced with DAVIS'S LAUGHTER. 
           Everyone TURNS.  Meg hardens.  Karen covers her eyes.  

           Davis finally gets a handle on it.  Phil stands his ground.  

                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        I'd like to introduce you to three
                        outstanding young adults... the
                        finalists for the first annual
                        scholarship.  Please welcome...
                             (introducing)
                        Jennifer Morello.  

           JENNIFER stands... the guests APPLAUD.  

                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        Benjamin Howard.

           BENJAMIN stands... continued APPLAUSE.

                                 PHIL (CONT'D)
                        And Todd Koehler.  

           TODD stands at his seat and Davis LOSES IT AGAIN.  The
           applause subsides.  DAVIS'S LAUGHTER FILLS THE ROOM.  

                                 MEG
                        That's enough!  
           The room goes silent.  Karen hides her face.  

                                 MEG (to Davis) (CONT'D)
                        I want you to leave.

                                 DAVIS
                        What?

                                 MEG
                        You heard me.  You don't belong here.  

           Meg stares down at him...

                                 DAVIS
                        I disagree, Meg.  I think I do belong
                        here.  I'm sending these brats to
                        college. 

                                 MEG
                        Get out.  And take your white trash
                        girlfriend with you.

                                 PHIL
                        Meg...

           Karen looks at Meg.  Hurt.  Embarrassed.  High. 

                                 DAVIS
                        You should be nicer.  You should
                        treat Karen with respect. 

                                 MEG
                        Or what?  Are you threatening me?

                                 DAVIS
                        Maybe I am.  Maybe I'll stand up on
                        the table and stomp all over this
                        nice food.  Maybe I'll swing from
                        the chandelier and break your
                        expensive dinner ware.  I can do
                        that.  That's what I'm good at.
                             (then)
                        I own a bulldozer.  I can destroy
                        all of this.

                                 MEG
                        Go ahead.  

           She calls his bluff.  They stare each other down.

                                 MEG (CONT'D)
                        You're nothing, Davis.  You're a
                        disappointment.  Your marriage was
                        fiction.  Julia told me everything.  

                                 DAVIS
                        Did she tell you she was pregnant?
                                 PHIL
                        Goddamn it!  

           Everyone is silent.  Stunned. 

                                 DAVIS
                        Five years ago, Phil.  She never
                        told me.  Why?  What happened?  

                                 PHIL
                        You're a Goddamn liar.

                                 DAVIS
                        I would've been a good father.  A
                        child might have changed things.  

                                 PHIL
                        Get out of my house!

                                 DAVIS
                        Why didn't she tell me?

                                 MEG
                        Because it wasn't yours.  

           This hits like a bomb.  Karen looks at Davis painfully.  The
           guests don't dare to move. 

                                 MEG (CONT'D)
                        She had a relationship with a man
                        for two years.  You never paid
                        attention.  
                             (then, a dagger)
                        I took her.  For the procedure.  

           Phil looks crushed.  Karen finally gets up and WALKS OUT. 
           Davis is trying to put the pieces together.  

                                 DAVIS
                        Who was it?  Is he here?

           Everyone looks at each other.  Meg shakes her head.

                                 MEG
                        It doesn't matter.  You don't matter. 
                        Go home.

           Davis has nothing left.  He slowly makes his exit.

           EXT. CITY STREET -- NIGHT

           Karen walks through the rain, trying to get away as fast as
           possible.  She flags a cab... 
           INT. CAB -- CONTINUOUS

           The cab pulls away.  Karen has her hand on her stomach...

                                 KAREN
                        Port authority.  

           Then, her PHONE RINGS. 

           INT. PHIL AND MEG'S BROWNSTONE -- NIGHT

           Davis walks toward the front door in a haze.  He stops in
           front of a TABLE... PICTURES OF JULIA HAVE BEEN SET OUT...

           PHOTO AFTER PHOTO.  We're seeing her for the first time, and
           it seems Davis is too.  Long brown hair.  Warm eyes.  This
           was someone's daughter.  Someone's wife.

           ANOTHER PICTURE... Davis picks it up to get a closer look. 
           WE DON'T SEE IT, but for the first time, he's affected.  

                                 MEG 
                        I hope it hurts.

           Davis turns.  Meg is in the hall. 

                                 DAVIS
                        It does.
                             (then)
                        I didn't love her, Meg.  I'm sorry.

                                 MEG
                        It's okay.  She didn't love you either.  

           Meg walks out.  Davis just stands there.   

           INT. LINCOLN TUNNEL -- NIGHT

           Davis drives through the tunnel.  Lights rushing past... as
           if the tunnel were moving and Davis was standing still.

           INT. KAREN'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Davis comes through the front door.  The house is dark.    

                                 DAVIS  
                        Karen!

           He disappears into the kitchen.  Searching.  When he walks
           back out, CARL IS THERE... with a handful of YELLOW LETTERS.  

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Carl.  Hey.  Is Karen home?

                                 CARL (realizing)
                        You wrote these.  Didn't you? 
                                 DAVIS
                        It's not what you think.

                                 CARL (re: letters)
                        What is this shit?  Some kind of
                        code?  What the fuck is this!?

                                 DAVIS
                        You wouldn't understand.

                                 CARL
                        Are you fucking my fiance?

                                 DAVIS
                        No.

                                 CARL
                        Don't lie to me. 

                                 DAVIS
                        Okay, yes.  Once.  But she's not
                        your fiance yet.  You're smothering
                        her, Carl.

           WHACK.  Carl punches Davis in the mouth.  Davis stands there,
           stunned.  Blood trickles from his lip.  

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        I deserved that.  It's fine.  I
                        completely...

           WHACK.  He hits Davis harder.  Davis wobbles, but maintains
           his balance.  He's actually getting off on this...

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        SHIT!  YES!  

           Carl grabs him and THROWS HIM OUT THE DOOR... 

           EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE/ FRONT LAWN -- CONTINUOUS

           Carl goes with him, they hit the ground and start wrestling
           on the grass.  Carl pins him down, punching him in the face. 
           But Davis isn't even attempting to fight back. 

                                 CARL
                        Fight back, you son of a bitch!

                                 DAVIS
                        NO!

           Carl HITS HIM AGAIN...

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        YES!
                                 CARL
                        Fight back!

                                 DAVIS
                        NO!

           Carl raises his fist, ready to unload, a clear shot... but
           he can't do it.  He rolls off of Davis and sits in the grass.  

           Davis lays still.  Beat and bleeding. 

                                 DAVIS (barely audible) (CONT'D)
                        I just wanted a refund.  

           Carl is holding a TOOTH.   

                                 CARL 
                        I think that's yours.

           He puts the tooth on Davis's chest and gets up. 

                                 CARL (CONT'D)
                        Karen's at the hospital.  Chris had
                        an accident. 

           Carl goes inside.  Davis is flat on his back, staring up at
           the night sky.  It's perfectly clear.  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL DEMOLITION SITE -- DAYDREAM

           We're in the midst of an industrial wasteland.  Crumbled
           buildings, exposed steel, wind whipping... post apocalyptic. 

           Davis wanders about.  He's lost.  Beaten. 

           He looks up at A GIANT CRANE... and swinging from the crane
           is a WRECKING BALL.  It climbs high into the sky... then,
           starts to come back down...

           It sweeps through frame and PULVERIZES DAVIS.

           CUT TO BLACK.

                                 KAREN'S VOICE
                        Davis. 

           Her voice repeats softly in the darkness.

                                 KAREN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                        Davis.  
           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING AREA -- EARLY MORNING

           FADE IN on Davis, fast asleep.  His clothes are dirty, bloody. 
           He opens his eyes to find Karen standing in front of him.  

                                 DAVIS
                        How is he?

           She sits.  Her face is pale.  Exhausted. 

                                 KAREN
                        He's in surgery.  They're not saying
                        much. 

           She looks like she might crumble at any moment.  Down the
           hall WE SEE Carl pacing back and forth, keeping his distance. 

                                 DAVIS
                        Listen, Karen...

                                 KAREN
                        I'm ready to tell you.  That thing
                        I've never told anyone.  Okay?

           She looks at him very seriously. 

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        I'm gonna tell you, and then I want
                        you to leave.  Do you understand?

           Davis looks back at her.  She needs this badly.  He nods.

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        It's when Chris was sick.  He was
                        getting worse and worse and the
                        doctors didn't know why.  They said
                        I should prepare myself.  I sat there
                        all night watching him sleep.  He
                        was so still.  So quiet.  Like he
                        wasn't alive.  And I started thinking
                        about that.  What it would be like. 
                        To be new.  To start over.  Then,
                        for a split second... not even long
                        enough to be considered a moment...
                        I wanted it to be true.  I didn't
                        want him to wake up.

           She fights the tears.  Like she's too ashamed.

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        Before that day, somewhere deep down,
                        I think I hated him.  After that
                        day, I hated myself.  

           She looks at him.  Hurting.   
                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        You lied.  You said you'd fix me,
                        Davis.  It's not fair. 

                                 DAVIS
                        What do you want, Karen?

                                 KAREN
                        I wanna take it back.  

           And there it is.  The truth.  They both sit there.  Broken.   

                                 DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        Ms. Moreno?

           Karen looks up... the DOCTOR stands by the nurse's desk. 
           She gets up and goes to him.  Davis stays there and watches.

           The doctor starts talking.  We can't hear what he's saying, 
           but Karen doesn't let him finish.  She starts crying.  The
           doctor leads her away.  She's gone.  

           Davis stands up.  Not quite sure where to go from here.  He
           looks over to see a VENDING MACHINE against the wall.  

           He turns and walks off down the hall.  FOOTSTEPS ECHO...   

           EXT. CEMETERY ROAD -- DAY

           Davis drives down the winding cemetery road.  Weathered
           headstones peeking out of the green grass.  Its peaceful. 

                                 KAREN (V.O.)
                        Dear Davis.  I didn't see this coming. 
                        I'm starting to wonder if things would
                        be different if I never met you.  If
                        I never picked up the phone.

           He passes a group of MOURNERS.  

                                 KAREN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I wonder if I ever would have been
                        able to forgive myself.  

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

           Karen walks in to see her son laying completely still.  Tubes
           and monitors everywhere.  She stands over him, tears flooding
           her eyes.  She reaches out and touches his hand.  Her heart
           breaking.

                                 KAREN (V.O.)
                        I guess I'll never know.  But I do
                        know this... I wouldn't change any
                        of it. 
           Chris grasps her hand.  His eyes open...

                                 KAREN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Because I don't have that feeling in
                        my stomach anymore.  Now it's in my
                        heart. 

           Chris squeezes her hand tight.  Tears fall from Karen's eyes.
           They need each other more than anything. 

                                 KAREN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And I hope that's where it stays.

           EXT. CEMETERY ROAD -- DAY

           Davis pulls to the side of the road and parks.  He notices a
           STATION WAGON in front of him.  The rear window SHATTERED.

           EXT. CEMETERY -- DAY

           Davis walks through the cemetery, passing headstones and
           monuments.  As he gets closer to Julia's grave, he notices a
           MAN (40's), already there.  He seems distraught. 

           Davis takes in this sight for a moment before moving on to
           her grave.  The man looks at Davis.  Davis doesn't look back.  

                                 DAVIS
                        I know who you are.  It's okay.  I
                        know everything.  Except your name.

                                 MICHAEL
                        It's Michael.  

           Michael's face tightens a bit.

                                 DAVIS
                        That's a good name.  I never really
                        read the bible, but I know it's in
                        there a bunch.  How did you meet
                        her, Michael?

           Michael looks at him, choked up.  Trying to explain...

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        It's not important.  I guess none of
                        it is.  Except, maybe...
                             (then)
                        Did you love her?  

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don't... I don't... 

                                 DAVIS
                        I think I did a long time ago.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        And then I forgot.  I realize that
                        now.  But she deserved more.  
                             (then)
                        I hope you loved her, Michael.  That
                        would make this whole thing easier.

                                 MICHAEL (confused)
                        I don't know what you're talking
                        about. 
                             (then, choked up)
                        I was in the other car.

           Michael can barely get it out.  Davis doesn't understand.   

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        I was driving the car that hit you. 
                        I killed her.  

           The pieces finally come together.  Davis is taken aback.

                                 MICHAEL (grasping) (CONT'D)
                        I've been trying to... I've been
                        trying... 
                             (finally)
                        I'm sorry.  Please... I'm so sorry.

           Michael REPEATS THIS OVER AND OVER through his tears... Davis
           puts his hand on Michael's shoulder.  

           INT. NEPTUNE DINER -- NIGHT

           Davis sits alone in a booth... flipping through songs on the
           BABY JUKEBOX.  He puts a quarter in... presses a button... 

           The WAITRESS stops at his booth.  

                                 DAVIS
                        Do you know if Karen Moreno is here
                        yet?

           She looks at him... this guy again?  His CELL PHONE RINGS.  

                                 DAVIS (to waitress) (CONT'D)
                        Never mind.

           He looks out the window.  Answers... 

                                 DAVIS (into phone) (CONT'D)
                        You're watching me, aren't you? 

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Yes.  
                                 DAVIS (into phone)
                        Did you see me pick my teeth with
                        the sugar packet?

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Uh-huh. 

           HEART'S "CRAZY ON YOU" begins over the diner speakers.  Davis
           scans the dark lot, but he doesn't see her.

                                 DAVIS
                        Where..?

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        You know what this song does to me. 
                        Why would you play this?  

           He realizes SHE'S INSIDE.  He turns over his shoulder...
           she's at A BOOTH IN THE CORNER.  He gets up and walks over.

           AT KAREN'S TABLE.  Davis sits down across from her.  

                                 DAVIS
                        Hi. 

                                 KAREN
                        Hi.  

                                 DAVIS
                        I got your letter.  I could hear
                        your voice while I was reading it.  

                                 KAREN
                        Did it fit your mental picture?

           She smiles.  Davis smiles back.  She takes a FOLDED PIECE OF
           PAPER out of her bag.  

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        Chris wanted me to give you this.  I
                        promised I wouldn't read it.  So... 

           She slides it over.  Davis fiddles with it for a moment, so
           much to say.  Not sure how.

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        Carl forgave me.  He says I'm gonna
                        have to earn his trust again.  And
                        he wants me to see a therapist.  

                                 DAVIS 
                        A therapist.  Okay.

                                 KAREN
                        He thinks I have to work on me before
                        I can work on us.  
                                 DAVIS
                        What do you think, Karen?  

                                 KAREN
                        I think he's probably right.  But I
                        left him anyway.  

           Davis didn't see that coming.  Karen seems proud of her choice.

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        I have no idea what I'm gonna do.  I
                        don't know where I'm going or any of
                        that.  But for some reason, I'm not
                        afraid.  And I'm not alone.  
                             (then, finally)
                        That's the truth.  

                                 DAVIS
                        Feels good, doesn't it?

           She lets herself smile.  They both realize this is the end.

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        I almost forgot, I have something
                        for you.  Hang on...

           He slides out and walks over to the booth he was just sitting
           at.  Karen waits patiently.  

           He returns carrying a FISHBOWL WITH A PLANT INSIDE. 

                                 KAREN
                        It's a plant.

                                 DAVIS
                        And a fish.  Look...

           There's a COLORFUL FISH inside, feeding off the leaves.  

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        They need each other.  The water
                        feeds the plant, and the plant feeds
                        the fish.  It's symbiotic.

                                 KAREN
                        What do I have to do?

                                 DAVIS
                        Nothing.  Just put it by a window,
                        Karen.  And love it. 

           Karen is touched by the gesture.  She stands up.  A sudden
           resolve about her.  Davis stands up with her.  She leans
           over and kisses him firm on the lips.  And they stay like
           that for a long time, almost making a scene.
           And when they finally separate, they look into each other
           and say goodbye without the words.

           Karen picks up her plant-fish and walks out the door.  Never 
           looking back.   

           Davis sits down.  Picks up the PIECE OF PAPER... unfolds it.  

                                 CHRIS (V.O.)
                        Davis.  There's something I think
                        you should see.  Be at this address
                        on Saturday at 11 am.  Trust me.  

           ON THE LETTER... there's an address... SINATRA PARK.  

                                 CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        P.S.

           Davis TURNS THE LETTER OVER... 

                                 CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Go fuck yourself.

           Davis grins.

                                 DAVIS
                        He nailed it. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

           Karen puts the PLANT-FISH down by the window where it will
           get plenty of light.  She looks at it... the water takes
           care of the plant, the plant takes care of the fish.  Then,
           she turns and looks at Chris who is sitting up in his bed.

                                 KAREN 
                        Metaphor.  

           EXT. SINATRA PARK -- DAY

           Davis arrives at the park... a WATERFRONT PAVILION overlooking
           the East River at Lower Manhattan.  HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE are
           gathered.  Waiting for something.

           Davis moves through the crowd, searching for some indication
           of what he's here for.  He approaches a WOMAN.  

                                 DAVIS
                        What's going on?

           Before she can speak, a LOUDSPEAKER CUTS IN...

                                 LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
                        Ten, nine, eight...
           She hurries into the crowd... everyone has their sights set
           on Manhattan, COUNTING DOWN TOGETHER...

                                 LOUDSPEAKER VOICE (CONT'D)
                        Six, five, four...

           Davis moves closer... looks out at the city.

                                 LOUDSPEAKER VOICE (CONT'D)
                        Three, two, one...

           A LOUD CRACK.  

           DAVIS'S POV:  A BUILDING IMPLODES on the opposite side of
           the river.  It COLLAPSES slowly.  In stages.  Crumbling to
           the ground.  Floor by floor.  A pure display of destruction.  

           Davis watches IN AWE.  ANOTHER CRACK...

           The BUILDING NEXT TO IT IMPLODES, collapsing the same way. 
           Then, A THIRD BUILDING... it tumbles to the ground behind a
           HUGE CLOUD OF DEBRIS.  

           It's over... an eerie SILENCE. 

           EVERYONE CHEERS.  Except Davis.  He's watching the cloud of
           dust push out over the water.  Blank. 

           He sits.  Suddenly overwhelmed by the destruction.  Then, we
           realize... he's crying.  And this time it's real.

           The crowd continues to CHEER while Davis empties himself
           out.  We lose sight of him in the celebration.

           INT. JASON'S PUB -- EVENING

           Davis sits at a table in the dimly lit pub.  The FOUNDATION
           PROPOSAL is on the table in front of him.  

           Phil appears in his overcoat.  He sits down.  Nothing
           welcoming about his demeanor.  

                                 PHIL
                        You've got two minutes.

           Davis settles into his seat.  Chooses his words.

                                 DAVIS
                        I can't remember her, Phil.  Not the
                        way I want to.  
                             (then)
                        I keep grasping for something that
                        makes sense... a memory, an image... 
                        something pure.  But I'm not sure
                        it's there.  I'm not sure it's here...

           He points to his head.
                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        I need your help.

                                 PHIL 
                        It's too late.  

                                 DAVIS
                        Maybe if we go back... if we start
                        from the beginning.  Maybe I'll
                        remember something new.

           Davis reaches inside his jacket pocket.  He takes out THE
           PHOTOGRAPH FROM THE PARTY.  Puts it on the table.

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Tell me about this girl. 

           He pushes it in front of Phil.  Phil doesn't want to look. 
           He tries not to.  But he can't help it... 

           It's Julia as a LITTLE GIRL.  She has a birthday cake in
           front of her.  A smile that lights up the room.  As Phil
           takes the memory in, we can see past the tough exterior.  

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Tell me, Phil... what made her happy?

           Phil tries to maintain, but his feelings for his daughter
           get the best of him.  He holds the picture in his hand.

                                 PHIL (searching)
                        She was, um... she was always...
                             (then)
                        Horses.  She loved horses.  Riding,
                        jumping... it was everything to her. 

                                 DAVIS
                        Then why did she stop?

                                 PHIL
                        She fell.  Not bad.  Some bruises.
                        But after that, she was afraid.

                                 DAVIS
                        Huh.  Horses.  I didn't know that.  
                             (then)
                        Or maybe I did.  

           Davis has his new memory.  But there's something unsettling.

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Isn't that sad? 

                                 PHIL
                        What?
                                 DAVIS
                        To go through life afraid of the
                        thing you love?

                                 PHIL
                        It's tragic.  

           Davis's wheels are turning.  He puts his hand on the proposal. 

                                 DAVIS (re: proposal)
                        This isn't a legacy, Phil.  It's not
                        Julia... it's a bank account.  

           He looks at the cover... A WOMAN ON A HORSE, SUN MELTING THE
           SKY.  Very pleasant.  Back at Phil...

                                 DAVIS (CONT'D)
                          Let's give her something real.

           INT. NJ TRANSIT TRAIN -- NIGHT

           Davis is squeezed between two passengers on the CROWDED TRAIN. 
           It rumbles along through the dark.  

           He sees JOHN IS SITTING A FEW ROWS BACK... FAST ASLEEP. 
           He's not wearing his Yankees cap.  And there's a WOMAN NEXT
           TO HIM (60's).  She reaches over and brushes the hair off of
           John's forehead.  It's his wife.

           Davis watches as she moves slightly closer to her husband. 
           Then, he turns back around.  And CLOSES HIS EYES...

           The LIGHTS FLICKER OUT...

           SUPER: TWO MONTHS LATER...

           EXT. SEASIDE BOARDWALK -- DAY

           We follow Davis down the boardwalk.  The green ocean at his
           side, hands tucked into his jacket pockets.  A few KIDS dart
           past him, headed toward the CAROUSEL...

           As he gets closer, we see BALLOONS ESCAPING INTO THE SKY. 
           Then, THE FAINT SOUND OF THE ANTIQUE ORGAN.  

           Davis turns the corner and enters...  

           INT. CAROUSEL -- CONTINUOUS

           It's a PARTY.  Young and old here to celebrate the
           resurrection of a boardwalk classic.  The ride has been
           COMPLETELY RENOVATED.  

           The NEWLY RESTORED HORSES ride up and down like porcelain
           thoroughbreds... kids SCREAMING with excitement.  The facade
           freshly painted GOLD, SILVER, RED.  A return to glory.
           Davis slips in behind the crowd and takes in this beautiful
           site.  He catches a glimpse of Ray... sitting behind the
           control panel, a SMILE FROM EAR TO EAR.  Davis can't help
           but smile.  

           Then, he looks off to the side... sitting on a bench are
           PHIL AND MEG.  Phil is LOOKING DIRECTLY AT DAVIS, his eyes
           desperately holding back emotion.  

           Phil holds his gaze on Davis for a moment, then nods.  It's
           subtle, but it says everything.  He takes Meg's hand and
           looks back at the kids... riding the horses with pure joy.

           Davis squeezes through the crowd and walks back out to the
           boardwalk.  As he disappears around the corner, we're left
           on a newly painted MURAL that reads... "JULIA'S CAROUSEL."

           And next to it is a GIANT WINDOW.  BEHIND IT... NOTHING BUT
           THE ATLANTIC OCEAN.

           EXT. SEASIDE BOARDWALK -- MOMENTS LATER

           We're with Davis again.  Walking among boardwalk amusements...

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        Dear Second Generation Vending.  The
                        last few months have been full of
                        twists and turns.  But I must say, I
                        think I've pulled through nicely. 
                        So, I guess this is the part where I
                        tell you what I've learned...

           A long beat.  Nothing coming to mind.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Okay, better yet... here's what I
                        didn't learn.  I didn't learn to
                        love.  And I didn't learn to be a
                        better person.  I certainly don't
                        know how to share or embrace my inner
                        strength. 

           Suddenly, kids start RUNNING PAST HIM.  Five, six, seven...
           they're RACING, and it's serious.  

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I guess I just feel a little bit
                        better. 

           As the last kid passes, something comes over Davis.  He starts
           RUNNING...

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I feel like myself... 
           FASTER AND FASTER... closing in on the nine year olds.  He 
           cuts straight through the middle of the pack, running AS
           FAST AS HE CAN.  HE PULLS AHEAD OF THE CROWD...

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Maybe for the first time ever.

           And blows them all away.

           EXT. DAVIS'S HOUSE -- DAY

           Davis carries his LETTER out to the mailbox.  His house is
           in utter ruin, roped off by POLICE TAPE behind him.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.)
                        This is probably going to be my last
                        letter.  But then again... who knows
                        what might happen tomorrow. 

           He arrives at the mailbox just as the MAIL TRUCK IS ARRIVING.

                                 DAVIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Warmest regards, Davis Mitchell. 
                        Period.

           He hands the MAILMAN the letter.

                                 MAILMAN (noticing)
                        Doing some renovations?

                                 DAVIS (looking back)
                        I'm thinking about it.  

           The mailman gives Davis a STACK OF MAIL and pulls away.  

           He starts back up the driveway, flipping through his mail. 
           He stops on one letter.  From Second Generation Vending
           Company.   A moment of truth.  

           He tears it open.  An OFFICIAL DOCUMENT... WE SEE THE WORDS... 

           "Dear Mr. Mitchell.  We have reviewed your claim and concluded
           that you're entitled to a full refund.  Sorry for the
           inconvenience.  Sincerely, Richard Miller.  Customer Service."

           He looks in the envelope.  There's a CHECK... for 75 CENTS.  

           CUT TO BLACK.
