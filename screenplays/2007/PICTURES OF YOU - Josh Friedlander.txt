           INT. SAWYER’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           The smallest bedroom in a quaint “Old Florida” style house.  
           It looks like a hurricane blew through here and no one 
           bothered to clean up.

           The clock radio plays “Everyone Loves a Loser.”

           SAWYER BLOOM, 17, slowly sits up on the edge of his bed and, 
           after a long beat, shuts off his alarm.

           He rubs his eyes and struggles to his feet.  

           Sawyer pulls back the blinds, opens the window, and takes in 
           the morning air.

           Then without warning, he proceeds to empty his bladder on the 
           bushes outside.   

           After a moment he casually looks at the CAMERA.

                                 SAWYER
                        You might be curious why I’m 
                        urinating out the window... It’s 
                        because of Rebecca.  She’s my twin 
                        sister.  She wakes up at six o’clock 
                        every morning, locks herself in the 
                        bathroom, and doesn’t come out until 
                        five seconds before we have to leave 
                        for school. Why do my parents let her 
                        get away with that?  I don’t know - 
                        Could be that they like her better.

                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM - THAT MOMENT

           REBECCA, 17, beautiful and happy, is blow-drying her hair.

                                 SAWYER (V.O.)
                        We’re only juniors and she already 
                        has class valedictorian pretty much 
                        locked up.  She’s head of the varsity 
                        cheerleading squad and president of 
                        the student council.  She obviously 
                        got all the good DNA.  

           INT. SAWYER’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sawyer ties his shoes and grabs his book bag.
                          (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                 SAWYER
                        By the way, my name is Sawyer.  
                        That’s my first name.  My last name’s 
                        Bloom.  My parents named me Sawyer 
                        because my father’s a big Mark Twain 
                        fan.  He actually wanted to call me 
                        Huckleberry - as if I don’t have 
                        enough problems. Luckily my mom put 
                        her foot down.

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Sawyer grabs two Pop Tarts as they spring out of the toaster.  
           He breaks them up in a bowl and pours milk over them.

                                 SAWYER
                        I live in the town of Crystal Bay.

           NOTE:  Periodically, still photographs will be superimposed 
           over a portion of the screen, much like the "picture in 
           picture" function on a television.  

           The photos will only remain on screen for several seconds and 
           will serve to punctuate elements of Sawyer's stories.  Here's 
           how it will be used...

           PICTURE:  A postcard of a sunset on a tropical beach.  It 
           reads "Crystal Bay, Florida Wish you were here!"

                                 SAWYER
                        It’s a small resort community on the 
                        west coast of Florida.  Back in the 
                        1920’s rich people started coming 
                        here to escape the cold winters up 
                        north.  We still do okay from 
                        November to April, but the rest of 
                        the year there are barely enough 
                        tourists to keep the businesses open.  
                        My parents own The Bait Bucket, a 
                        bait and tackle shop down by the 
                        marina.  It’s a little weird, because 
                        I’m pretty sure neither of them has 
                        ever been fishing.

           CHUCK BLOOM, 40, unshaven, shuffles in, half awake.

                                 CHUCK
                        Morning kiddo.

                                 SAWYER
                        Morning dad.
                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                 CHUCK
                        I’m glad to see you’re enjoying a 
                        healthy breakfast.

           Chuck eyes the coffee maker, distraught that it’s empty.

                                 CHUCK
                        There’s no coffee in the coffee 
                        maker.
                      (yelling)
                        Laura, there’s no coffee in the 
                        coffee maker.

           LAURA BLOOM, 38, (obviously where Rebecca got her looks) 
           enters in her bathrobe.

                                 LAURA
                        It’s not magic, honey.  You’ve gotta 
                        put the grounds and the water in 
                        there before the coffee will come 
                        out.

                                 CHUCK
                        Why did we have to buy the one with 
                        the timer?!  What good is the timer 
                        to me if no one prepares the thing 
                        the night before?  Sawyer, I’m 
                        declaring this your responsibility.  
                        Would you please make sure we have 
                        coffee every morning?!

                                 SAWYER
                      (to us)
                        I don’t even drink coffee.

           Rebecca enters and heads for the coffee maker.

                                 REBECCA
                        You don’t have to take me to school.  
                        I just talked to Kim and she and 
                        Rachel are gonna come pick me up.  
                        There’s no coffee.

                                 LAURA
                        Is it alright if Sawyer gets a ride 
                        with you and your friends?

                                 REBECCA
                        Be realistic mom.

                        Sawyer, your father and I have a 
                        hundred pounds of cubed squid being 
                        delivered to the store in twenty 
                        minutes.  Would you mind riding your 
                        bike to school so that he and I can 
                        be on time to meet the shipment?

                                 SAWYER
                        So when Becky needs a ride, no 
                        problem.  When it’s just me - I’m on 
                        my own.

                                 LAURA
                        Becky doesn’t have a bike. 

                                 SAWYER
                      (disbelief)
                        She has a car!  How ‘bout if I take 
                        that?

                                 LAURA
                        You can’t take her car.

                                 SAWYER
                        Why not?

                                 REBECCA
                        Because it’s mine.

                                 LAURA
                        You’re not insured to drive her car.  
                        What if you kill somebody?

           EXT. SAWYER’S HOUSE/NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

           Sawyer jumps on his bike and peddles off his driveway.

                                 SAWYER
                        Did you know that it’s possible to 
                        get so frightened that all the hair 
                        on your body falls out and it never 
                        grows back?...  If you think I’m 
                        kidding, ask Coach Schechter the 
                        Driver’s Ed teacher at my high 
                        school.  

           PICTURE: COACH SCHECHTER, 28, a long haired woman with a big 
           toothy smile. 
                                       (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                 SAWYER
                        She took Becky out for her practice 
                        exam and something horrible must have 
                        happened because the woman is 
                        completely bald now.  She’s barely 
                        thirty years old and she doesn’t even 
                        have any eyebrows.  

           NEW PICTURE: Miss Schechter, depressed and totally hairless.

                        I guess the one thing my sister can’t 
                        do perfectly is drive a car.  The 
                        thing is my dad bought her a classic 
                        Volkswagen convertible for her sweet 
                        sixteen.  So now it just sits there 
                        in the driveway.  I have my license. 

           PICTURE: Sawyer’s driver’s license.  His photo looks like he 
           was caught completely offguard.

                                 SAWYER
                        You’d think my parents might offer to 
                        let me use the car.

           INT/EXT. CRYSTAL BAY HIGH SCHOOL - DAY - ESTABLISHING

           It’s a small town school but every variety of teenager is 
           here: Jocks, Goths, Geeks, Skaters, Stoners.  They hang out 
           in the parking lot, the library and the commons area.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Sawyer is at his locker collecting books before the first 
           bell of the day.  His friend ANDREW comes over.  Andrew seems 
           slightly beaten down by the whole teenage experience.

                                 ANDREW
                        Do you ever wonder how cool your 
                        parents were in school?  I mean are 
                        you gonna be honest with your kids 
                        and tell them how unpopular you were?

                                 SAWYER
                        We’re not unpopular, Andrew.  We’re 
                        just... unnoticed.
                      (pointing o.c.)
                        That’s unpopular.

           Andrew looks and sees a KID in his underwear with his pants 
           pulled over his head.  Two JOCKS are pushing him around.

                        You’ve gotta look at high school like 
                        prison.  As long as you’re not 
                        getting raped in the shower, things 
                        are okay.

           Sawyer’s other friend, MICKEY, rushes over.  Mickey is 
           slightly perverted and eternally optimistic.

                                 MICKEY
                        I learned something this morning 
                        that’s going to change my entire 
                        life.

                                 SAWYER
                        We just got here.  We haven’t even 
                        been to class yet.

                                 MICKEY
                        I didn’t learn it in school.  I saw 
                        it on TV.  It’s called subliminal 
                        foreplay.  It’s all about using 
                        certain words to seduce a woman 
                        without her knowing it.  Check this 
                        out.  Pretend you’re a girl and I’m 
                        telling you a story.  Listen to the 
                        magic words.  Ready?

                                 SAWYER
                      (halfheartedly)
                        Yeah.

                                 MICKEY
                        I’m not fucking around here.  This is 
                        serious.  Are you ready or not?

                                 SAWYER
                        I’m ready.

                                 MICKEY
                        Okay:  It was really hot in sex 
                        education class.  The girl with the 
                        locker below me...  See how below me 
                        sounds like blow me?  Anyway.  The 
                        girl with the locker below me started 
                        breathing heavy.  She had to go down 
                        to the nurse’s office.  The nurse put 
                        a wet towel on her head.  By the time 
                        she came back, class was over.  She 
                        was excited cause she had missed a 
                        really hard quiz.  Or you could say 
                        it was a really long and hard quiz.  
                        Is that amazing or what?

                        It’s like guaranteed to work.  The 
                        girl will be sucking on your love pop 
                        before she knows what came over her.

                                 SAWYER
                        My love pop?

                                 ANDREW
                        I don’t know, Mickey, that seems like 
                        cheating.  I want a girl who wants me 
                        cause she really wants me.

                                 MICKEY
                        Yeah but that’s never gonna happen.  
                        This is science, man.  There are 
                        words that just naturally have a 
                        sexual flavor to them, and if you can 
                        sneak those words into a seemingly 
                        mundane conversation then your target 
                        will be caught offguard by the 
                        unexplained urges she’s feeling. Hey, 
                        I only told you guys about this cause 
                        I’m your friend.  If you don’t wanna 
                        use it, fine.  More poon for me.  

           As Mickey walks away, Sawyer and Andrew exchange a look.  
           They’re used to this kind of stuff from Mickey.

                                 ANDREW
                        I’ll see you in Algebra.

           Sawyer turns to us as he walks toward his class.

                        I have a grand total of two friends.

                        Mickey, Andrew and I have been tight 
                        since third grade.  I used to have 
                        three friends.  

           NEW PICTURE: Sawyer, Mickey, Andrew and MARCY (chubby) at 
           seven years old.

                        Marcy was always like one of the 
                        guys.  But over last summer she got 
                        her braces off, her skin cleared up, 
                        she lost weight in some areas and...

                        gained it in others, and she came 
                        back looking like a completely 
                        different person.

           TWO PICTURES: Polaroids labeled “BEFORE” and “AFTER.”  The 
           first shows Marcy (16) as a plump, pimply, metal mouth.  In 
           the second, Marcy (17) is trim, stacked and super cute.

                        Two days into the school year Eric 
                        Ryerson asked her out. He didn’t even 
                        know who she was.  He thought she was 
                        some new girl who just moved to town.  
                        The thing with Eric Ryerson is he’s 
                        blonde, blue eyed and he can throw a 
                        football like seventy yards.  If it 
                        wasn’t for his personality he’d be 
                        perfect.  I’m happy for her, but 
                        since they started dating she hangs 
                        out with his friends and I never see 
                        her anymore.  Well, I see her in 
                        class but we never talk.

           INT. CLASSROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Sawyer enters his history class.  STUDENTS mill about and 
           chat.  The teacher hasn’t arrived yet.

                                 SAWYER
                        That’s Marcy over there, with the 
                        dude who looks like Aaron Carter.

           MARCY, 17, jokes with ERIC and some other POPULAR KIDS.

           Sawyer sits down, takes out his books and quickly starts 
           doing his homework.

                        My sister is in this class and the 
                        teacher makes us sit alphabetically.

           Just then Rebecca takes the seat in front of him.

                        Why don’t you do your homework at 
                        home? It’s not like you have anything 
                        better to do.  You’re lucky I don’t 
                        tell mom about this kind of stuff.

                        Let me tell you an interesting story 
                        about how I spent my afternoon 
                        yesterday.  I spent two hours in the 
                        principal’s office.  You guys know 
                        that I can send you to the 
                        principal’s office but I bet you 
                        didn’t know that you could send me to 
                        the principal’s office.  Apparently a 
                        number of you have been complaining 
                        to your mommies and daddies that my 
                        tests are too hard.  I find this 
                        fascinating because my tests are 
                        based entirely on the lectures I give 
                        and the reading from your text book.  
                        It’s not like I’m pulling this stuff 
                        out of my ass.  But, God forbid I 
                        prepare you for how hard college is, 
                        let alone real life, so here’s the 
                        deal:  You guys are gonna make the 
                        semester exam.  It’s twenty five 
                        percent of your grade and I’m gonna 
                        let you create it.

           The class looks confused.

                                 FOLEY
                        You look confused.  I’ll explain.
                        It works like this: Each one of you 
                        is gonna make your own version of the 
                        test.  Multiple choice, true/false, 
                        short answer, it’s up to you.  Next 
                        Monday you’ll turn that in.  I’ll 
                        pick the one that I think is the best 
                        exam and that’s the one you’ll all 
                        take. The person who made the exam 
                        will hopefully get an ‘A’ and the 
                        rest of you, no matter how poorly you 
                        do, you won’t be able to blame it 
                        entirely on me.  Any questions?

           Ninety-five percent of the kids quickly raise their hands.  
           Mister Foley looks completely defeated.

           EXT. SCHOOL COMMONS AREA - DAY

           Sawyer, Mickey and Andrew eat lunch at a picnic table.  
           SEVERAL DOZEN STUDENTS eat and talk around them.
                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)

                        How’s the subliminal foreplay going?

                                 MICKEY
                        The problem is, if I get some girl 
                        all juiced up here at school what am 
                        I gonna do?  I can’t bang her right 
                        there in front of the whole class.

                                 SAWYER
                        Why don’t you save it for the Sadie 
                        Hawkins dance Friday night?

                                 MICKEY
                        Yes!  That’s perfect.  That dance is 
                        like a pussy smorgasbord.

                                 ANDREW
                        I hate the Sadie Hawkins dance.  At 
                        least when we go to regular dances 
                        without dates people might think 
                        we’re just keeping our options open.  
                        You go to Sadie Hawkins by yourself 
                        it’s obviously because no girl asked 
                        you.  Why does Sadie Hawkins have a 
                        dance named after her anyway?  Didn’t 
                        she have like one hit song when we 
                        were five years old?

                                 SAWYER
                        That’s Sophie Hawkins.
                      (singing with Mickey)
                        Damn, I wish I was your lover.

                                 MICKEY
                        What are you guys doing after school?
                        Let’s go to the beach and see if 
                        there are any French girls who don’t 
                        realize it’s illegal to go topless 
                        here.

                                 SAWYER
                        I’m always up for that.

           A beautiful hand comes down on Sawyer’s shoulder.  His 
           friends are caught totally off guard.  

           Sawyer turns to see NATALIE and GRETCHEN.  They are the 
           enigmatic hot girls that any good high school should have.

                                 NATALIE
                        Hi Sawyer.
                                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                 SAWYER
                        Hi.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        I’m Gretchen.  This is Natalie.

                                 NATALIE
                        He knows who we are.

           Natalie bends over, revealing lacy Victoria’s Secret 
           cleavage, and whispers in Sawyer’s ear.

                                 NATALIE
                        Sawyer, could we talk to you in 
                        private?

                                 SAWYER
                        Well, I... I’m not done with my 
                        cheese sticks.

                                 NATALIE
                        Meet us in the parking lot in five 
                        minutes.

           The girls walk away.

                                 MICKEY
                        Holy shit.

                                 SAWYER
                        What do you think they want?

                                 ANDREW
                        Maybe they’re gonna ask you to the 
                        Sadie Hawkins dance.

                                 SAWYER
                        Seriously, what do you think they 
                        want?

           EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - FIVE MINUTES LATER

           Sawyer talks to us as he walks towards the parking lot.

                                 SAWYER
                      (secretive)
                        I have to admit, I’m a little 
                        nervous.  Okay, here’s a story about 
                        Natalie and Gretchen.  
                                 (MORE)

                        No one’s ever asked them if this 
                        really happened and they’ve never 
                        admitted to it, but supposedly last 
                        Spring Break, they borrowed 
                        Gretchen’s dad’s car one night 
                        without him knowing and went to the 
                        beach to try and meet some college 
                        guys.

           PICTURES:  A “SLIDESHOW” of drawings illustrates the story 
           that Sawyer tells.  Each drawing is labeled “ARTIST’S 
           RENDERING”

                                 SAWYER
                        They were partying, drinking, 
                        whatever, and when it was time to 
                        leave they realized they had parked 
                        in a no parking zone and her dad’s 
                        car had been towed.  Now it costs 
                        like a hundred and fifty dollars to 
                        get your car out of the impound and 
                        they didn’t have any money.  So they 
                        decided to raise the cash by going 
                        around to guys and offering to show 
                        their tits for a couple of bucks.  
                        And it was working, I mean those 
                        girls are hot, who wouldn’t pay for a 
                        quick peek at their pups.  Anyway, 
                        supposedly, they were only about 
                        twenty dollars short when a cop 
                        caught them.  So now they’ve got an 
                        impounded car and they’re about to be 
                        arrested for indecent exposure and 
                        possibly prostitution.  They decide 
                        there’s only one way out of this:  
                        They basically told the cop they’d do 
                        anything, anything if he’d help them.  
                        So they took him to a secluded area 
                        of beach and tag teamed him until the 
                        sun came up.  No charges were filed 
                        and they got the car back.  Did that 
                        really happen?  I don’t know, but it 
                        has created a mystique.

                                 GRETCHEN (O.C.)
                        Sawyer!

           Sawyer turns to see Gretchen and Natalie peeking out the open 
           side door of an ugly 1970’s conversion van.  

           They wave him over.  With some trepidation Sawyer looks 
           around and then enters the van.  Gretchen closes the door.

           Wood paneling and brown shag carpet.  Natalie and Gretchen 
           sit on the bed.  Natalie motions for him to sit between them.

                                 NATALIE
                        Sit down.  It’s okay.

           Sawyer complies.  He feels a sexual tension but he can’t tell 
           if it’s real or if it’s all in his pants.

                                 SAWYER
                        Isn’t this Kyle Sugarman’s van?

                                 GRETCHEN
                        He’s okay with us using it.

                                 NATALIE
                        I know we don’t know you very well 
                        but we were wondering if you’d do 
                        something for us. If you decide to do 
                        it you can’t tell anyone. It has to 
                        be a secret between the three of us.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        And Kyle.

                                 NATALIE
                        We don’t have to tell Kyle.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        He let us use the van.  He’s gonna 
                        ask.

                                 NATALIE
                        It’ll be our secret, Sawyer.  Can we 
                        trust you?

                                 SAWYER
                      (cotton mouthed)
                        I think so.

           Natalie leans in and puts her hand on his knee.  

                                 NATALIE
                        We need to be sure that we can trust 
                        you.

                                 SAWYER
                      (swallows hard)
                        You can.

           Natalie’s hand inches higher up his thigh.  Long beat. 
                                                                 (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                 NATALIE
                        Okay look, we all know that Mister 
                        Foley’s gonna choose your sister’s 
                        test to be the semester exam.  It’s 
                        obvious.  She’s the best student in 
                        the class.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Teacher’s pet, the bitch.  No 
                        offense.

                                 NATALIE
                        It’s twenty-five percent of our grade 
                        Sawyer, and you live with her. You’re 
                        gonna have access to it before she 
                        turns it in. You could just go on her 
                        computer and print us out a copy...

                                 GRETCHEN
                        There’s no harm in it really.

                                 NATALIE
                        We know it’s a big thing to ask but 
                        it truly would mean a lot to us.  And 
                        we would repay you... somehow.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        I’d do anything to keep from going to 
                        summer school.  Anything.

           Sawyer looks at us, wide-eyed.

           INT/EXT. ANDREW’S CAR/BEACH DRIVE - DAY

           Andrew is behind the wheel.  Mickey’s shotgun and Sawyer is 
           in the back.  They’re cruising toward the beach.

                                 MICKEY
                        Don’t leave out any details.  I wanna 
                        hear exactly what happened. 

                                 SAWYER
                        Nothing happened. They want me to 
                        steal my sister’s exam for Foley’s 
                        class.

                                 ANDREW
                        Are you gonna do it?

                                 SAWYER
                        I don’t know.
                                         (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                 MICKEY
                        What did they offer to do in return?

                                 SAWYER
                        They just said they’d repay me 
                        somehow.  

                                 MICKEY
                        They were leaving you room to 
                        negotiate.  You shoulda thrown your 
                        arms up and yelled “THREESOME.”  
                        These are the girls who submitted to 
                        a police gangbang to get out of a 
                        parking ticket.

                                 SAWYER
                        That’s a rumor.  That isn’t even the 
                        rumor, that’s your demented version 
                        of the rumor.  There’s no proof that 
                        they’re willing to exchange sex for 
                        personal favors.

                                 MICKEY
                        You could be the one to find out.

                                 ANDREW
                        I think you should do it even if 
                        there is no sex.  It’s beneficial 
                        just in terms of what it could do for 
                        you socially.

           They roll up to a stoplight next to the beach.  Mickey spots 
           a HOT GIRL on rollerblades standing across the street, 
           adjusting her bikini top.

                                 MICKEY
                        Oh shit, look at her.

                                 ANDREW
                        Don’t do it.

                                 MICKEY
                        I have to.
                      (yelling at the girl)
                        I have a ten inch penis!

           Mickey and Sawyer quickly duck down.  When the Hot Girl looks 
           over she sees Andrew alone in the car.  He smiles sheepishly.  
           She flips him off.

                                 ANDREW
                        Thanks a lot guys.
                                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)           The light changes and Andrew drives on.

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           The guys walk onto the sand with their towels and a frisbee.  
           The area is rife with PASTY OVERWEIGHT TOURISTS.

                                 MICKEY
                        Looks like it’s fat Canadian day at 
                        the beach.

           Amid all the sunblock slathered blubber Sawyer spots two very 
           tan BIKINI-CLAD BLONDES engaged in lively conversation.

                                 SAWYER
                        Right there.  Check that out.

                                 MICKEY
                        Are they French?

                                 ANDREW
                        They’re definitely speaking in a 
                        foreign tongue.

                                 SAWYER
                        It doesn’t sound French.

                                 ANDREW
                        I think they’re Nordic.

                                 MICKEY
                        Even better.

                                 SAWYER
                        I guess we found our spot.

           Sawyer spreads his towel right under a palm tree.

                                 MICKEY
                        What if they don’t speak any English? 
                        How am I gonna practice my subliminal 
                        foreplay?

                                 SAWYER
                        You can just sit and stare at them 
                        like I plan on doing.

                                 MICKEY
                        That’s for pussies.  C’mon Andrew, 
                        throw the frisbee in their general 
                        direction.  I wanna go say hello.  
                                (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)           Mickey and Andrew start tossing the frisbee back and forth, 
           working their way towards the girls.  Sawyer sits on his 
           towel and watches.

           Andrew overthrows and hits a Nordic girl in the face.  

           Sawyer cringes and lies back on the towel.  He feels 
           something under his back, near the base of the palm tree.

           Sawyer reaches under the towel and pulls out 

           A DISPOSABLE CAMERA.  

           There’s no personal information on it but there are two 
           pictures left on a roll of thirty-six.  

           He glances at a nearby FAMILY. 

                                 SAWYER
                        Excuse me, is this your camera?

           The Husband shakes his head.  Sawyer gets up and heads for 
           the Lifeguard Tower.  He passes his friends who are being 
           berated by the Nordic Girls.

           AT THE LIFEGUARD TOWER

           Sawyer gets the LIFEGUARD’s attention.

                                 SAWYER
                        I found this over by that palm tree.  
                        You know if anyone lost a camera?

                                 LIFEGUARD
                      (into bullhorn)
                        Anyone around here lose a camera?
                      (no response)
                        Finders keepers, dude.

           Sawyer stares at the camera, intrigued.

           EXT. SAWYER’S HOUSE - MORNING

           A stream of urine sprays out of Sawyer’s window, surprising 
           his OLD NEIGHBOR who is gardening nearby.

                                 SAWYER (O.C.)
                        Sorry, Mrs. Ferguson.

           INT. SAWYER’S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Sawyer finishes emptying his bladder and turns to us.
           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 SAWYER
                        At least once a week I almost pee on 
                        the old woman who lives next door.  I 
                        keep hoping that she’ll complain to 
                        my parents and they’ll be forced to 
                        tell my sister to let me use the 
                        bathroom.  But Mrs. Ferguson never 
                        says a word.  She secretly likes it, 
                        I think.

           Sawyer grabs the found camera off his dresser and shoves it 
           in his backpack.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Sawyer, camera in hand, walks down the empty hall.  The 
           muffled sound of classes can be heard behind closed doors.  

           He slowly opens a door marked “Journalism - Crystal Bay High 
           Gazette.”    

           INT. JOURNALISM CLASSROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Sawyer eases in.  Marcy is alone, sitting at a desktop 
           computer.  She’s consumed by her work.

                                 SAWYER
                        Marcy.

                                 MARCY
                      (startled)
                        Sawyer.  How are you?
                      (she hugs him)
                        I feel like we never talk any more.

           He smiles, glad for the warm reception.

                                 SAWYER
                        That’s probably because we never talk 
                        anymore.

                                 MARCY
                        I hope you don’t think I avoid you.  

           Sawyer can’t help but to stare at her chest.

                                 SAWYER
                        No.  You have a boyfriend now.  I’m 
                        happy for you.  You always liked 
                        Eric.
                                        (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                 MARCY
                        I don’t know if I always liked him.  
                        I mean, I didn’t know him.  I always 
                        thought he was cute.

                                 SAWYER
                        The way I remember it, you used to 
                        day dream that he would take you to 
                        prom.

                                 MARCY
                        And you’d take Renee Lovaglio.

                                 SAWYER
                        Unfortunately she moved away before I 
                        ever got the nerve to talk to her.

                                 MARCY
                      (self conscious)
                        Sawyer, you keep looking at my boobs.

                                 SAWYER
                        I’m sorry.  It’s just that they’re 
                        new.  I’m not used to them.

                                 MARCY
                      (shy)
                        I didn’t buy them or anything.  
                        They’re real.

                                 SAWYER
                        I know.  I just meant...  You... 
                        blossomed.  I’m sure I’m not the only 
                        one who’s noticed.

                                 MARCY
                      (smiling; awkward moment)
                        So, what’s up?  Are you skipping, 
                        English?

                                 SAWYER
                        No.  I got a bathroom pass.  I came 
                        to ask you a favor.  I know that you 
                        know how to use the darkroom and I 
                        found this camera on the beach.

                                 MARCY
                      (taking the camera)
                        You found it?

                                 SAWYER
                        Yeah, and I’m curious about the 
                        pictures.  
                                 (MORE)

                        Do you think it would be unethical to 
                        maybe develop them and take a look?

                                 MARCY
                        Well it could be somebody’s really 
                        private personal stuff.  Could be 
                        like compromising sexual photos.  Did 
                        you consider that?

                                 SAWYER
                        I did consider that.  It’s a big 
                        reason why I’m curious.

                                 MARCY
                        I don’t know, I wouldn’t want some 
                        stranger looking at my private 
                        personal moments without me knowing.  

                                 SAWYER
                        C’mon, Marcy.  What kind of a 
                        journalist are you gonna be if you 
                        have so much respect for people’s 
                        privacy?

                                 MARCY
                      (disappointed in herself)
                        I know.  I have to get over that.
                      (caving in)
                        Alright, I’ll do it.  Meet me back 
                        here after school.

                                 SAWYER
                        Excellent.  I’ll see you later.

                                 MARCY
                      (inspecting camera)
                        Wait.  There’s two pictures left.  
                        Might as well use them.

           She stands next to him and holds the camera out, pointing 
           back at them.  She puts her arm around him.

                                 MARCY
                        Okay, ready.  Serious.

           They both make stern faces.  She snaps a picture.

                                 MARCY
                        And goofy.

           She fish hooks his mouth with her free index finger and he 
           sticks his finger in her nose.  She takes the last picture.
                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)

DARKROOM - DAY

           Marcy is in the process of developing the pictures on four by 
           six photo paper.  Sawyer messes with some equipment he 
           probably shouldn’t be touching. 

                                 SAWYER
                        How’s it coming?

                                 MARCY
                        We’ve got one with nipple. 

                                 SAWYER
                        Female nipple?

                                 MARCY
                        Why would I mention male nipple?

           Marcy hangs a few pictures on a clothesline.  Sawyer steps 
           over and begins to inspect the pictures.  

           He sees a CUTE ASIAN GIRL, 19, in a bedroom, opening her 
           towel and flashing a breast.

                                 SAWYER
                        I’m already glad we did this.

                                 MARCY
                        Seems like they’re just pictures of 
                        some girls on vacation.

           Another picture is of a CHUBBY REDHEAD packing a suitcase.  
           Interested he looks over Marcy’s shoulder at the picture in 
           the solution.

           Before Sawyer’s eyes, the image on the photo paper takes 
           shape.  It is the most beautiful girl he’s ever seen.  

           Sawyer’s DREAM GIRL.  She’s a little older than Sawyer.  
           Maybe nineteen.  She has kind eyes and a smile that makes him 
           feel like the world is a perfect place.

                                 SAWYER
                        That girl is incredible.

                                 MARCY
                        She’s pretty.

                                 SAWYER
                        Pretty?  She’s spectacular.
                                   (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)           Marcy pulls the photo out of the solution and hangs it on the 
           line.  Sawyer never takes his eyes off of it.  He stares at 
           his Dream Girl in awe.  Completely transfixed.  Mouth agape.

           Marcy goes back to work.

                                 MARCY
                        You’re overreacting a little bit.

                                 SAWYER
                      (didn’t hear her)
                        What?

           Marcy continues to work while Sawyer stares at the photo.

                                 MARCY
                        Sawyer can I talk to you for a 
                        minute?

                                 SAWYER
                        Yeah.

                                 MARCY
                        Could you stop drooling over the girl 
                        and look at me?

                                 SAWYER
                      (complying)
                        Is something wrong?

                                 MARCY
                      (beat; unsure)
                        No.
                      (deep breath; blurts out)
                        I’m not ready to have sex yet but I 
                        wanna give Eric a blow job.

                                 SAWYER
                        Oh.  Well, I... I think that would be 
                        a nice gesture.

                                 MARCY
                        Yeah, the thing is, I’ve never given 
                        a blow job before and I’m not exactly 
                        sure what to do.

                                 SAWYER
                        Well, Marcy, just between us, I’ve 
                        never had a blow job.  I can’t really 
                        offer any advice.  I’ve seen a few in 
                        porno movies but I wasn’t watching 
                        with an eye on technique.
                                                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 MARCY
                        See, I’ve never even seen a porno.  
                        I’m completely at a loss.  I mean I 
                        understand the concept, but...
                      (beat)
                        I was thinking, maybe I could 
                        practice on you.  Just a couple of 
                        times until I get the hang of it.

           Sawyer has no idea what to say.  He’s suddenly nervous.

                                 SAWYER
                        Uhhh...Uhhh... bu... wo...wo...

                                 MARCY
                      (confused)
                        Yeah.  You’re right.  I don’t know 
                        why I even brought it up.  I’m sorry.  
                        It’s ridiculous.

           Sawyer feels like he dodged a bullet.

                                 MARCY
                      (flustered)
                        ...but, you know, I don’t wanna be 
                        bad at it.  And you’re my friend.  I 
                        can trust you.  You’re not gonna tell 
                        anybody.  I know Eric’s gonna tell 
                        everyone.  That’s what guys do.  I 
                        don’t want a reputation for giving 
                        lousy head.  I have enough pressure 
                        on me, already.  I know he’s gotten 
                        blow jobs before.  It’s not like I 
                        can fake my way through it.

                                 SAWYER
                        Wouldn’t it be cheating though, 
                        technically?

                                 MARCY
                        Technically, you could say that.  But 
                        you and I have always been close and 
                        the way I see it I’m doing it for 
                        Eric’s benefit.

                                 SAWYER
                        That’s one way of looking at it.
                      (beat)
                        Couldn’t you just rehearse on a 
                        banana or something? 
                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                 MARCY
                        I tried that. But a banana can’t tell 
                        me if I’m doing it right.  It’s not 
                        like I’m asking you to give me one of 
                        your kidneys.  I just wanna... forget 
                        it!  You’ve gotta be the only guy on 
                        the planet who’d try to talk his way 
                        out of a blow job!

                                 SAWYER
                        I’m not trying to get out of it.  I 
                        just wanna make sure that you’re 
                        thinking clearly.  When would you 
                        wanna do this?

                                 MARCY
                        I wanted to do it to him Friday, 
                        after the Sadie Hawkins dance.

                                 SAWYER
                      (shocked)
                        Friday!  This is Wednesday.  That’s 
                        not very much time.

                                 MARCY
                        That’s why I brought it up.  I mean 
                        I’m not doing anything now. 

                                 SAWYER
                        Now!

                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SAWYER’S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           Sawyer closes and locks the door.  Marcy paces.

                                 SAWYER
                      (nervous)
                        Are you sure about this?

                                 MARCY
                      (scared)
                        No.
                      (he unlocks the door)
                        Yes.

           He locks the door again.

                                 SAWYER
                      (awkward)
                        How do you wanna start? Do you wanna 
                        take my pants off or should I do it?
                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                 MARCY
                        I’ll do it.

                                 SAWYER
                        Should I stand, sit, lie down?

                                 MARCY
                        What’s better?

                                 SAWYER
                        I don’t know. I think I’d like to 
                        sit.

                                 MARCY
                        Okay, but you can’t look at me.
                      (beat)
                        This is crazy.  I can’t do it.

                                 SAWYER
                        I understand.

                                 MARCY
                      (convincing herself)
                        No, I can do it!  I can!

                                 SAWYER
                        Okay.  Relax.

           She sits him back on the edge of the bed.  

                                 MARCY
                        Are you sure you’re fine with this?  
                        You’re not gonna think less of me?

                                 SAWYER
                        Noooo.

           Marcy kneels in front of him.  She takes her time, hesitant.  
           She slowly undoes his pants and pulls them down.  Her eyes go 
           wide.

                                 MARCY
                        Oh!  It’s hard already.  I wasn’t 
                        expecting that.
                      (eyeing it; nervous)
                        I thought it’d be more scary looking.  
                        It’s actually kinda cute.

                                 SAWYER
                        Cute is not a word that...

                                 MARCY
                        Sorry.  Alright, here it goes.

           his lap.  Almost immediately he lets out a yell.

                                 SAWYER
                        Don’t chew!

                                 MARCY
                        I wasn’t.

                                 SAWYER
                        I thought I felt teeth. 

           She tries again, making loud sucking noises.

                                 SAWYER
                        Okay. I think you’re sucking too 
                        hard.

                                 MARCY
                        Maybe I should stop.

                                 SAWYER
                        It’s up to you.  I’m just here to 
                        help.

           She goes back down.  Sawyer scrunches up his face.

                                 MARCY
                        Am I hurting you?

                                 SAWYER
                        No.

                                 MARCY
                        Then why are you making that face?

                                 SAWYER
                        Because I don’t think this is gonna 
                        take very long.

           After about ten more seconds Sawyer has the look of release 
           and Marcy gags.

                                 MARCY
                        Oh my god, that was so gross.
                      (beat)
                        Is it alright if we do it again?

           EXT. SAWYER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The front door opens and Marcy exits followed by Sawyer. They 
           both look a little dazed.

                        I can’t come back tomorrow cause I’ve 
                        gotta finish the layout for the front 
                        page before we go to press.  Maybe I 
                        can practice one more time Friday 
                        right after school.

                                 SAWYER
                        I’ll be here.

           Marcy waves and gets in her car.  Sawyer turns to us.

                                 SAWYER
                        Six times.  I went from absolutely no 
                        sexual contact ever in my life to 
                        half a dozen blow jobs in a four hour 
                        period.  Including a break to have 
                        dinner with my family... It’s been a 
                        good day.

           PICTURE MONTAGE

           The pictures feature three nineteen year old girls on 
           vacation in Crystal Bay.  The DREAM GIRL appears in the bulk 
           of the pictures.  She’s clearly close friends with the CHUBBY 
           REDHEAD and less friendly with the CUTE ASIAN GIRL.  

           The pictures lead chronologically from the girls packing 
           their bags, to driving to Crystal Bay, to vacationing 
           (sunbathing, shopping, partying.)  

           INT. SAWYER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The pictures are lined up on Sawyer’s floor.  Sawyer goes 
           through the photos that don’t feature his Dream Girl, removes 
           them and puts them in his night stand.

           He lies on the bed on his stomach and peers down at the 
           remaining pictures on the floor.                                    

           He’s completely MESMERIZED by his Dream Girl.  His gaze moves 
           from picture to picture.

           INT. SAWYER’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Sawyer’s asleep in the same position we last saw him.  His 
           head hangs limply over the edge of the bed.  The pictures are 
           still spread on the floor.  Sawyer wakes with a start, 
           looking disoriented.

SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

           Sawyer, Mickey, and Andrew walk towards Andrew’s car.

                                 MICKEY
                      (annoyed)
                        So you brought twenty pictures of the 
                        same girl and left the one with the 
                        nipple at home?!

                                 SAWYER
                        You’ve seen nipples before, Mickey.  
                        I wanted you to see how incredible 
                        this girl is.

                                 MICKEY
                        She’s hot.  But what the hell do you 
                        mean I’ve seen nipples before?!  Like 
                        once I’ve seen a pair of tits the 
                        wonder is gone.  Do you understand 
                        that one of the few things that makes 
                        life worth living is the infinite 
                        variety of breasts and nipples? The 
                        fact that it’s impossible to look at 
                        a girl with her clothes on and have 
                        any idea what she looks like naked.  
                        Say something Andrew.

                                 ANDREW
                        I think she’s very pretty.

                                 MICKEY
                        About tits, Andrew, I meant say 
                        something about tits.  Pay attention.

                                 SAWYER
                        Look at this picture.  You’re telling 
                        me this girl is not perfect.

                                 ANDREW
                        I think she’s very pretty.

                                 MICKEY
                        She’s hot.  I’ve seen better though.  

           Mickey continues to flip through the pictures.

           He holds up a photo of Sawyer’s Dream Girl and the Asian 
           friend, all wet, coming out of the ocean in bikinis.

                                 MICKEY
                        I bet you spanked it to this one.

                                 MICKEY
                        Is it the Asian chick who shows her 
                        tit?  We could go to the beach after 
                        school.  Maybe they’re still around.

                        Mickey, they’re out of town girls on 
                        vacation.  We’d never find them.

                                 MICKEY
                        You are such a pussy.  You’ve got a 
                        perfect opportunity here.  You walk 
                        right up to them. “Hi, ladies.  I 
                        found your camera on the beach 
                        yesterday.  I just wanted to be a 
                        good samaritan and return your 
                        pictures.”  Next thing you know 
                        you’re getting a thank you fuck.  

                                 SAWYER
                      (dry)
                        A thank you fuck, really?  I had no 
                        idea it was that easy to get laid.

                                 MICKEY
                        I bet you didn’t know there are only 
                        five reasons why a girl will have sex 
                        with you.  One - sympathy - you only 
                        have six months to live and she feels 
                        sorry for you.  Two - revenge - her 
                        boyfriend pissed her off and she uses 
                        you to get back at him.  Three - 
                        random drunken horniness - that’s 
                        self explanatory.  Four - gratitude - 
                        e.g. you return her cherished 
                        vacation photos and your nobility 
                        must be rewarded.  Or five - you 
                        trick her - meaning you either use 
                        subliminal foreplay or you lie to 
                        create a sense of sympathy, gratitude 
                        or desire for revenge.  Those are the 
                        only known reasons.

                                 ANDREW
                        What about love?

                        Don’t be so naive, Andrew.

                      (facetious)
                        I appreciate your life lessons, 
                        Mickey, I really do.  But I have a 
                        hard time believing that returning 
                        some pictures is gonna make a girl 
                        who ordinarily wouldn’t look at me, 
                        suddenly lie down, spread her legs, 
                        and beg me to nail her out of undying 
                        gratitude.  

                                 MICKEY
                        Whatever.  Pussy.

           Mickey walks off.  After a silent moment...

                                 ANDREW
                        Sawyer, you ever think you might be 
                        gay?

                                 SAWYER
                      (confused)
                        No. Why? Do you think I might be gay?

                                 ANDREW
                        No. I think I might be gay.

                                 SAWYER
                        Oh.  Well I’ve thought before that 
                        you might be gay.  But I don’t seem 
                        gay, do I?

                                 ANDREW
                        No.  But you’re saying that I do 
                        seem gay?

                                 SAWYER
                        Not obviously gay, but the 
                        possibility had occurred to me.  Does 
                        Mickey call me a pussy because he 
                        thinks I’m gay?

                                 ANDREW
                        No he calls you a pussy because he 
                        thinks you have no gonads.

                                 SAWYER
                        I have gonads.  

                        Just because I’m not willing to make 
                        a fool of myself, trying to have sex 
                        with every girl I see, that doesn’t 
                        mean I don’t have gonads.

                        You don’t even try to have sex with 
                        girls that are throwing themselves at 
                        you.  Remember that girl at the 
                        Halloween party?

                                 SAWYER
                        I remember her.  She had a beard.

                                 ANDREW
                        That was part of her costume.  She 
                        was Abraham Lincoln.  

                                 SAWYER
                      (defensive)
                        I don’t know that that wasn’t a real 
                        beard.  
                      (beat)
                        You’re one to talk.  I’ve never seen 
                        you try to hook up with any girls at 
                        school.

                                 ANDREW
                        True.  And I have dreams about Jude 
                        Law.  Graphic dreams.  Because I’m 
                        probably gay.  That’s what I was 
                        trying to tell you but you’re too 
                        busy worrying about yourself.

                                 SAWYER
                        I’m sorry, Andrew I didn’t mean to--

                                 ANDREW
                        It’s okay.  I mean I’m not saying I 
                        am gay.  I’m just saying I might be.  
                        I just don’t know.  It’s possible 
                        that I am.  Look at Mickey.  There’s 
                        no grey area.  He’s clearly not a 
                        homo.

                                 SAWYER
                        Don’t use Mickey as a role model.  
                        He’s so heterosexual it’s ugly.

                                 ANDREW
                        So you’re saying most people are at 
                        least a little queer.

                                 SAWYER

LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Sawyer sits on the couch staring at a picture of his Dream 
           Girl.  He’s oblivious to the fact that Rebecca is standing 
           over his shoulder.

                                 REBECCA
                        Who is that?

                                 SAWYER
                        I don’t know.

                                 REBECCA
                        Then why do you have a picture of 
                        her?

           Marcy enters, cutting off the conversation.  She’s carrying 
           her backpack.

                                 MARCY
                        Hi.  Hi Becky.

                                 REBECCA
                        Hey, Marcy.  You guys studying 
                        together?

           Sawyer and Marcy exchange a look.

                                 MARCY
                        Yeah, sort of.  Did you start working 
                        on the test for Foley’s class?

                                 REBECCA
                        I finished it already.

                                 SAWYER
                      (surprised)
                        You finished it?

                                 MARCY
                        C’mon, Sawyer. We better get to work.

           She pulls him off the couch.

           INT. SAWYER’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sawyer locks the door and sits on the edge of the bed.  Marcy 
           pulls a packet of paper out of her backpack.

                                 MARCY

           hand corner.  The cover has big bold letters that read:   
           “How to Give the Ultimate Blow Job.”

                        I think you’re going to notice a huge 
                        improvement.

           She drops the booklet on Sawyer’s messy floor and kneels in 
           front of him.  He lies back on the bed as she undoes his 
           pants.  We hold on the look of intense pleasure on his face.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Sawyer walks Marcy out.  Laura irons a skirt.

                                 MARCY
                        Hi, Mrs. Bloom.

                                 LAURA
                        Hi, Marcy.  Would you like to stay 
                        for dinner?

                                 MARCY
                        I’d love to but I have to go get 
                        ready for the dance.

                                 LAURA
                        Are you two going together?

                                 SAWYER
                        She has a boyfriend, mom.

                                 MARCY
                        I’ll see you tonight.

                                 SAWYER
                        Good luck.

                                 MARCY
                        Bye, Mrs. Bloom.

                                 LAURA
                        Say hi to your parents for me.
                      (Marcy leaves)
                        She’s grown up to be a very pretty 
                        young lady.  

                                 SAWYER
                        I’m gonna go get ready.

                        Your sister is already in the 
                        bathroom.  I don’t wanna hear any 
                        arguing.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Sawyer knocks on the bathroom door.

                                 REBECCA (O.S.)
                        I’m in here.

                                 SAWYER
                        I have to get ready for the dance too 
                        you know.

                                 REBECCA (O.S.)
                        Get real, Sawyer.  You don’t even own 
                        a hairbrush.

           Sawyer steps away from the door and addresses us.

                                 SAWYER
                        She’s such a bitch.  Maybe Mickey is 
                        right.  Maybe I need to show some 
                        balls.  Let’s see what Gretchen and 
                        Natalie are willing to do for a copy 
                        of my sister’s exam.

           INT. REBECCA’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sawyer sneaks into the room, floppy disk in hand, and 
           carefully closes the door.  He darts over to her desktop PC 
           and turns it on.  

           He double-clicks through well organized folders and is about 
           to open the file labeled “Midterm History Exam” when...

                                 LAURA (O.S.)
                        Beck, I’m gonna put some of your 
                        laundry away!

           As the door begins to open, Sawyer dives on the floor behind 
           the bed.  

           Laura enters with a laundry basket of neatly folded clothes.  
           As she heads toward the dresser, sure to spot Sawyer, he 
           manages to slither under the bed.

           It’s dusty and crammed with old magazines and clothes. 
                                       (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)           Sawyer is praying that he doesn’t get caught when he realizes 
           that he’s holding onto a “BACK MASSAGER.”  Disgusted he drops 
           it and wipes his hand on a teddy bear.

           He watches his mom who is just about done with the laundry 
           when she drops a pair of socks right in front of him.  He 
           cowers as she bends down to pick them up.  

           She exits.  With a sigh of relief he climbs out from under 
           the bed and heads back over to the computer.

           He pops his floppy disk into the drive, right clicks and 
           chooses “Send File to Floppy.”  The disk drive comes to life 
           and then gives him a “Write-protect error.”  

           Shit.  He pulls the disk out and is nervously trying to move 
           the write-protect tab when he drops it on the floor.  

           As he’s crouched down, the door starts to open again.  Sawyer 
           throws himself under the desk.  Rebecca enters, in her robe, 
           with big-old curlers in her hair.

                                 REBECCA
                        Mom can I...

           Rebecca realizes her mom isn’t there and walks away.

                                 REBECCA (O.S.)
                      (calling out)
                        Mom can I borrow your beige slip.

           Sawyer gets out from under the desk.

                                 SAWYER
                        Fuck this.

           He shuts down the computer and heads for the door.  Just as 
           he reaches for the handle it begins to open.  Sawyer runs 
           into the closet and pulls the louver door closed.  

           Becky comes in, closes the door, and tosses the beige slip on 
           the bed.

           IN THE CLOSET

           Sawyer briefly peeks out through the louvers.  He’s trapped 
           like a rat in a cage.

           INTERCUT

           Becky checks herself in the mirror.  She squeezes the one 
           tiny little zit on her otherwise flawless face and then heads 
           over and turns on her stereo, loud.  
                                                (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)           Sawyer shakes his head, annoyed that he’s gotten himself into 
           this predicament.

           Suddenly and without warning, Rebecca pulls off the robe and 
           lets it drop to the floor.  

           Sawyer pulls back from the louvers and cringes.  He got a 
           split second full frontal of his sister.  She proceeds to 
           examine her body in the mirror.  

           Hoping she’s gone he takes another quick look.  He rubs his 
           eyes as if that might erase the image.

                                 SAWYER
                      (to himself)
                        Go back to the goddamn bathroom.

           Rebecca begins to remove the curlers from her hair. 

           Disgusted, Sawyer is afraid he’ll be stuck like this forever.  
           She starts dancing to the music.

                                 SAWYER
                      (to himself)
                        Put some fucking clothes on already.

           He stands there for a good long time and then peeks again.  

           There’s no sign of her.  He strains to see the parts of the 
           room that might be out of view.  

           Then suddenly she steps right in front of the closet, still 
           naked as a jay-bird.  

           She pulls the closet door open.  Sawyer closes his eyes and 
           braces himself.  Rebecca SCREAMS at the top of her lungs.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Sawyer sits alone on the couch, talking to us.

                                 SAWYER
                        The second she opened the closet I 
                        knew I was fucked.  If I tell my 
                        parents the truth, that I was there 
                        to steal the test, then I’m a thief 
                        and a cheater.  They’ll never trust 
                        me again.  If I don’t say anything, 
                        they’re gonna think I’m a perv.  I 
                        could bullshit them, but I’m bad at 
                        it.  It takes me at least an hour to 
                        come up with a decent lie; 
                                 (MORE)

                        so chances are the lie won’t work and 
                        they’ll just think I’m a liar and a 
                        perv.

           Chuck enters, looking really distraught.

                                 CHUCK
                        Your mother is in the bathroom 
                        vomiting up her heart!  I was a 
                        seventeen year old boy once, Sawyer.  
                        I know what goes through your sick 
                        little mind.  But this is a whole new 
                        level of depravity.  Your sister will 
                        quite possibly be scarred for life.

                                 SAWYER
                        She wasn’t too upset to go to the 
                        dance.

                                 CHUCK
                        You think she’s having a good time at 
                        that dance.  She’s putting on a brave 
                        face.  This is the kind of thing that 
                        could turn her off men completely.  
                        She could very easily become a 
                        lesbian because of you.

                                 SAWYER
                        Dad, I wasn’t trying to see her 
                        naked.  That’s twisted.  Don’t you 
                        think that I know that that’s 
                        twisted.  Maybe you and mom are the 
                        ones with the sick minds for even 
                        thinking that I would do something 
                        like that.

                                 CHUCK
                        Don’t try to make us the bad guys on 
                        this one, Sawyer.  This scenario is 
                        so off the charts fucked up that they 
                        don’t even contemplate it in any of 
                        your mothers goddamn parenting books.  
                        If you think that you have a good 
                        explanation for invading your sisters 
                        privacy, I’m ready, let’s here it. 

           There’s a long beat as Sawyer considers his options.

                                 SAWYER
                        Can’t you just trust that there was 
                        nothing demented going on?

SAWYER’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sawyer lies on his bed.  Chuck and Laura collect up his TV 
           and his video game system.

                                 LAURA
                        You’re grounded for the rest of your 
                        life.  No TV, no video games, no 
                        telephone.
                      (she takes the phone)
                        Straight home from school, in your 
                        room.  No hanging out with your 
                        friends, no going out on the 
                        weekends.

           They march out and slam the door.  Sawyer looks to us, 
           depressed.

                                 SAWYER
                        The rest of my life?  Isn’t that a 
                        little harsh?  Isn’t there a three 
                        strikes rule? This is only the second 
                        time I’ve ever been grounded.  The 
                        first time was for convincing Andrew 
                        that he could get superpowers by 
                        drinking cat pee - when we were eight 
                        years old.   They can’t ground me for 
                        life on a second offense.  

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           A SERIES OF SHOTS

           Sawyer marks a line on the wall for Day One of his grounding.

           Sawyer spins a basketball on his finger.

           Sawyer spreads the pictures of his Dream Girl on the bed.

           Sawyer plays the guitar he hasn’t touched since third grade.

           Sawyer tosses grapes up in the air and catches them in his 
           mouth.  He leans back too far and his chair falls over.

           Sawyer sits on the bed gazing at the pictures.

           Sawyer marks a second line on the wall for Day Two of his 
           grounding.

           Sawyer draws his Dream Girl based on a picture.  We reveal 
           the sketch - it’s terrible.

           shadow of his penis on the wall.

           INT. SAWYER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Sawyer is in bed again, still staring at a picture of his 
           Dream Girl on the beach.  Suddenly she starts to move.  She 
           licks her lips and then turns and walks toward the ocean.  

           The next thing Sawyer knows, he sees himself in the picture, 
           walking after her.  PUSH IN on the picture and

                                            MATCH CUT TO:

           EXT. BEACH - DAY - DREAM SEQUENCE

           The beach is deserted save for Sawyer and his Dream Girl.  
           She stands at the edge of the water, breathing in the ocean 
           air.  

           Sawyer walks up near her, watching her intently.  She doesn’t 
           notice him as she slowly walks out into the waves and dips 
           herself under. 

           Sawyer gazes over every inch of her, marveling at the way her 
           bikini is clinging to her wet body.  She seems to be walking 
           right for him.  

           Sawyer tenses up, but she passes by as if he isn’t there.  He 
           follows her up the beach.

           The Dream Girl lies down on a beach lounger.  Sawyer stands 
           right in front of her but he’s invisible to her.  

           He waves his hands trying to be noticed but she’s oblivious 
           to his existence.  She reaches into a cooler and pulls out a 
           cherry popsicle.

           Sawyer is transfixed as she slides the popsicle in and out of 
           her mouth.  In and out...

                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SAWYER’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Sawyer awakens with a start.  The picture is stuck to his 
           cheek.  He peels it off and then with a look of disgust he 
           peeks into his underwear.  

           Sawyer grabs a tissue, reaches into his shorts and proceeds 
           to clean himself off.

CRYSTAL BAY HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

           Sawyer is chaining his bike to the bike rack when Andrew 
           approaches.  Andrew seems more depressed than usual.  They 
           head for the school.

                                 SAWYER
                        Hey.  How was the dance?

                                 ANDREW
                        I didn’t go.  Didn’t you go?

                                 SAWYER
                        No, I got grounded.

                                 ANDREW
                        What for?

                                 SAWYER
                        I don’t wanna talk about it.  Why 
                        didn’t you go?

                                 ANDREW
                        I was too depressed.  I came in 
                        early this morning and talked to my 
                        guidance counselor.  He said it was 
                        normal for kids my age to be confused 
                        about their sexuality and to have 
                        weird fantasies. Then he said a lot 
                        of kids know that they're gay but 
                        they're afraid to face it.  Often 
                        because they think they're family 
                        won't approve.  Which could be my 
                        case.  My dad is a huge homophobe.  
                        My mom has a gay brother and until I 
                        was twelve I thought his name was 
                        Uncle Fruitcake.  Then it's also 
                        possible that I'm trying to convince 
                        myself that I'm gay because it's the 
                        one way I could really get back at my 
                        father.  Did you know that there's a 
                        school club for homosexuals?  

                                 SAWYER
                        Isn't that called Drama?  

                                 ANDREW
                        Very funny.  It's a real support 
                        group.  I'm gonna go to a meeting.  
                        Would you come with me?
                                                (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                 SAWYER
                      (sympathetically)
                        Andrew, I'm not gay.  I don’t have a 
                        lot going for me.  Please let me hold 
                        on to the fact that at least I'm 
                        still perceived as heterosexual.

                                 ANDREW
                        Is it that horrible for people to 
                        think that you're gay?

                                 SAWYER
                        Not if you are gay.  But if you're 
                        not, it really hurts your chances of 
                        ever getting a date with a member of 
                        the opposite sex.  

                                 ANDREW
                        What if I go to the meeting and then 
                        it turns out I'm not gay?  Maybe I 
                        should try to have sex with a guy and 
                        see if I like it.

                                 SAWYER
                        You could do that, but maybe, if 
                        you’re on the fence, you should try 
                        to have sex with a girl and make sure 
                        you don't like it.

                                 ANDREW
                        If I could get a girl to have sex 
                        with me I would have done it already.  

                                 SAWYER
                        Well that's not a very gay thing 
                        to say.

                                 ANDREW
                        I know.  I'm so confused.

           Sawyer is suddenly hit in the chest by a ROCK.  Hurt, he 
           looks around to see who threw it and sees Mickey hiding 
           behind some bushes.  He waves them over.  

                                 SAWYER
                        You hit me with a rock.  What the 
                        fuck is wrong with you?

                        show your face here.

                        What are you talking about?

                                 MICKEY
                        You don’t know?  Everyone at the 
                        dance heard what you did Friday 
                        night.  That’s some sick shit Sawyer, 
                        even by my standards.  It’s your twin 
                        sister, man.  You’ve gotta draw the 
                        line somewhere.  She is incredibly 
                        hot though.  How did she look?

                                 SAWYER
                      (mortified)
                        She told everyone?

                                 MICKEY
                        I heard from Larry Finkelstein.  He 
                        said she caught you inside her 
                        closet, watching her and whacking off 
                        with a pair of her panties.

                                 SAWYER
                        No?!  C’mon!  That did not happen!  
                        C’mon!  Shit!  I was trying to steal 
                        the fucking history test.  She came 
                        in the room, I had to hide, and she 
                        caught me.

                                 MICKEY
                        Yeah, that’s not the version that’s 
                        going around.

                                 ANDREW
                        I thought I had problems.

                                 SAWYER
                        She promised my parents she wouldn’t 
                        tell anyone.

                                 ANDREW
                        Don’t worry, it’ll be rough for a 
                        couple years, but you can always go 
                        to an out of state college.

                                 SAWYER
                        Save yourselves.  Seriously, stay as 
                        far away from me as you can.

                        What?

                                 MICKEY
                        The subliminal foreplay works.  I 
                        made out with Carla Maplethorpe and 
                        squeezed her bare tit.  Her bare tit, 
                        Sawyer.  Hard nipple touched the palm 
                        of my hand.

           Sawyer hangs his head.  He can’t believe how screwed he is.

           EXT. SCHOOL COMMONS AREA - DAY

           Sawyer sits alone under a tree and eats his lunch.  Everyone 
           he sees appears to be talking about him and snickering.  
           Marcy comes up and crouches next to him.

                                 MARCY
                        Heard any good rumors lately?

                                 SAWYER
                        I heard there’s some deviant at our 
                        school who tried to have sex with his 
                        sister.

                                 MARCY
                        Oh, I heard he was just touching 
                        himself while he peeked in her 
                        window.

                                 SAWYER
                        I wasn’t peeking in the window, I was 
                        in the closet.  I have a perfectly 
                        good explanation.  

                                 MARCY
                        I know you’re not a pervert.  I don’t 
                        even want an explanation.  I just 
                        wanna thank you.  Things went really 
                        well with Eric.  I couldn’t have done 
                        it without your help.

                                 SAWYER
                        It was my pleasure, no pun intended.  
                        Probably the last pleasure I’ll ever 
                        have.

           Eric looms over them.

                                 ERIC

                        You shouldn’t be seen around him.  
                        He’s a piranha.

                                 MARCY
                      (rolling her eyes)
                        You mean pariah.  

                                 ERIC
                        No I don’t.  I don’t even know what 
                        that is.

                                 MARCY
                        I know him, Eric.  He didn’t do what 
                        people are saying.

                                 ERIC
                        I know his sister, Marcy.  She 
                        wouldn’t make that up.  Say good-bye 
                        and let’s go. 

           Eric walks away.  Marcy looks torn.

                                 SAWYER
                        Don’t worry about it.

                                 MARCY
                        I’ll talk to you later.

           INT. SAWYER’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Based on the markings on the wall it’s day nine of Sawyer’s 
           life sentence.  He’s standing at his bedroom window watching 
           the rain. 

           Looking miserable, he walks over to his bed, picks up a 
           picture of his Dream Girl and stares at it.

                                 SAWYER
                      (to us)
                        I know it’s pitiful to be obsessed 
                        with a girl in a picture.  So don’t 
                        look at me like that, okay.  You’re 
                        just making me feel worse.

           EXT. SAWYER’S HOUSE - MORNING

           It’s a beautiful morning.  The sun is shining, birds are 
           chirping, a bee is pollinating a hibiscus flower beneath 
           Sawyer’s window.  

           Suddenly a stream of urine disrupts the bee’s ritual. 
                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)           INT. SAWYER’S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Sawyer is yawning and peeing.  We hear the BUZZ of the bee 
           and without warning Sawyer lets out a SCREAM.  

           He stumbles backwards into the room, spraying urine all 
           around as he writhes in pain.  Finally, he begins to calm 
           down, breathing heavily he looks down at his crotch.

                                 SAWYER
                        Stung my dick.

           He lays back on the floor.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Laura strolls down the hall and knocks on Sawyer’s door.

                                 LAURA
                        Honey, you’re gonna be late for 
                        school.

                                 SAWYER (O.S.)
                        I’m not feeling well.

           Laura opens the door.

           INT. SAWYER’S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Sawyer is in bed with the covers pulled up to his neck when 
           Laura enters.  He seems to be in pain.

                                 LAURA
                        What’s wrong?

                                 SAWYER
                      (lying)
                        I think I have a light case of ebola.  
                        I better stay home today.

           Laura catches a whiff of something pungent.

                                 LAURA
                        Do you smell something?

                                 SAWYER
                        Fresh air?

                                 LAURA
                        No, it smells like... like pee.  
                        Sawyer, did you wet the bed?

                        Mom, I’m seventeen years old.  I 
                        don’t wet the bed anymore.

                                 LAURA
                        Well I smell pee.

                                 SAWYER
                        I think I have a fever.  Maybe I had 
                        the sweats last night.  Maybe that’s 
                        what you smell.

           Rebecca enters.

                                 REBECCA
                        Mom, we gotta go.  
                      (catches a whiff)
                        Smells like pee in here.

                                 LAURA
                        Sweetie, wait outside, your brother’s 
                        not feeling well.

                                 REBECCA
                        He has to go to school, we have 
                        midterms today.

                                 LAURA
                        Is that what this is about?  You’re 
                        trying to get out of taking your 
                        tests?

                                 SAWYER
                        I’m sick.  I can’t get out of bed.

                                 REBECCA
                        Maybe if you studied a little bit you 
                        wouldn’t have to feign illness.

                                 SAWYER
                        Mom, I genuinely have something wrong 
                        with me.  

                                 REBECCA
                        Oh, it was obvious from the day you 
                        were born that you have something 
                        wrong with you.

                                 LAURA
                        Rebecca, please.  Sawyer you look 
                        fine.  Now get up and get ready for 
                        school.

           hangs on for dear life.

                                 SAWYER
                        No!

                                 LAURA
                        Sawyer!  Let go of the blanket!

           Chuck enters as Laura and Sawyer struggle for the blanket.

                                 CHUCK
                        What the hell are you people yelling 
                        about?!

                                 LAURA
                        Your son has midterms today but he’s 
                        refusing to get out of bed.

                                 SAWYER
                        I never miss school!  Can’t I be sick 
                        one day?!

                                 CHUCK
                        Goddammit, Sawyer, get up!

           Chuck grabs Sawyer’s blanket and rips it away, crashing into 
           the wall and falling over in the process.  

           Laura and Rebecca shudder with shock and disgust when they 
           get a look at Sawyer’s... 

                                            SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING

           Mickey and Andrew are amazed by the abnormally large bulge in 
           Sawyer’s jeans.  Sawyer tries to shield the problem with some 
           school books.  

                                 MICKEY
                        A bee sting.  How come I never 
                        thought of that?

           Mickey pokes it with a pencil.

                                 SAWYER
                        I didn’t do it on purpose.  It hurts 
                        like a bitch.

                                 MICKEY
                        Still, you’ve got porn dick.  Look at 
                        the size of that thing.

                        If I were you I wouldn’t be hiding 
                        it, I’d be doin’ the elephant walk up 
                        and down the halls.

                                 ANDREW
                        Do you think it’ll stay like that?

                                 SAWYER
                        Christ, I hope not. 

           The school’s FIRE ALARM begins to blare.  The kids glance at 
           it and then go about their business.

                                 ANDREW
                        You’re lucky your throat didn’t close 
                        up.  You could die from that.

                                 MICKEY
                        I’m gonna rub some honey on my cock 
                        and go hump a beehive.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                      (over the PA system)
                        This is not a drill.  Please evacuate 
                        the school in an orderly fashion.  I 
                        repeat, this is not a drill. Get out!

           EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

           Several hundred STUDENTS rush out of the building. 

           There’s a murmur of excitement but the school doesn’t seem to 
           be on fire.  

           Sawyer still holds his books in front of him, blocking his 
           swollen genitalia.  Mickey can’t resist drawing attention to 
           his friends crotch.

                                 MICKEY
                        C’mon Sawyer this is too good to keep 
                        to yourself.  Hey Natalie...

                                 SAWYER
                        Mickey, don’t.

                                 MICKEY
                        Natalie, you wanna see a really big 
                        dick?

                        That was cheap.  But I set you up for 
                        it, you couldn’t resist.  I’m not 
                        referring to the metaphorical dick.  
                        I’m being literal.  Check this out.  
                        Show her Sawyer. There’s nothing to 
                        be embarrassed about.  There’s no 
                        shame in being extraordinarily well 
                        hung.

           Mickey pulls Sawyer’s books away for a second, giving 
           Natalie, Gretchen and several of their friends a quick 
           glimpse.  They can’t believe their eyes.

                                 NATALIE
                        Oh, my god.  That is not real.

                                 MICKEY
                        Impressive, isn’t it.

           Meanwhile the PRINCIPAL, frumpy and in her late forties, 
           angrily paces the frontline with a BULLHORN.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Quiet down!  Quiet down!  One of you, 
                        in your infinite wisdom, apparently 
                        thought that pulling the fire alarm 
                        would somehow unburden you from the 
                        pressure of midterm examinations.  
                        All you have in fact accomplished is 
                        to cause your fellow classmates to 
                        have to remain in school for an extra 
                        hour so that the tests can be 
                        completed.  Rest assured that the 
                        responsible party will be...

           Just then the Principal notices the group of kids that are 
           ignoring her and taking an atypical interest in Sawyer.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        What is going on over here?

           She moves a few kids out of the way and spots Sawyer’s bulge.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Do you think that that’s funny young 
                        man?  What is that bulge in your 
                        pants?

           The kids begin to chuckle.

                        Take it out, I wanna see it.  Show it 
                        to me right now.  

           Students AD LIB things like “Whip it out!”  She steps towards 
           him.  Sawyer doesn’t know what to do.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        I am not in the mood for any games.  
                        I want what you’ve got in your pants.  

           The kids cheer.

                                 MICKEY
                        You’re all witnesses.  She’s sexually 
                        harassing him.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Quiet.
                      (in Sawyer’s face)
                        If you don’t do as I say this will be 
                        a day you will not forget.  I demand 
                        that you pull it out and put it in my 
                        hand. 

           Sawyer steps back.  The Principal lunges and grabs Sawyer’s 
           package.  He tenses up with pain and embarrassment.  

           She slowly realizes that it’s attached and sees her career 
           flash before her eyes.

                                 MICKEY
                        I don’t think I’m gonna take my 
                        midterms today.  I think I’m gonna go 
                        to the police and tell them how 
                        Principal Miller tried to give my 
                        best friend a hand job in front of 
                        the whole school.

           INT. SAWYER’S BEDROOM - DAY

           On day eighteen of his grounding Sawyer is reading “The 
           Catcher in the Rye” when there’s a knock at his window.  

           It’s Marcy.  Her eyes are red and puffy like she recently 
           finished a good cry.  Sawyer opens the window.

                                 SAWYER
                        Hi.

                                 MARCY
                        Are you busy?

           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                 SAWYER
                        Just reading.  You wanna come in?

                                 MARCY
                        I don’t wanna get you in trouble.

                                 SAWYER
                        Don’t worry about it.
                      (sympathetically)
                        You look like you’ve been crying.

           He helps her climb through the window.  She sighs and tries 
           to stifle more tears.

                                 MARCY
                        Yeah.

                                 SAWYER
                        Is it Eric?  What did he do?  I’ll 
                        kick his ass.

           She almost laughs.

                                 SAWYER
                        Is that funny?  You think I can’t 
                        kick his ass?

                                 MARCY
                        I’m a geek, Sawyer.  I may have 
                        changed physically last summer but 
                        I’m not meant to be popular.  I told 
                        Eric I wasn’t ready to have sex, that 
                        I wasn’t going to change my mind and 
                        he should stop trying to get me to do 
                        it.  So he broke up with me.  He said 
                        I wasn’t mature enough for him.  I’m 
                        not mature enough for a guy who 
                        thinks it’s entertaining to wipe his 
                        boogers on the nozzle of a water 
                        fountain and then laugh at the next 
                        person who drinks from it.

                                 SAWYER
                        I’m sorry, Marcy.  Honestly, being 
                        popular and having members of the 
                        opposite sex lusting after you 
                        doesn’t sound like such a horrible 
                        thing.

                                 MARCY
                        I feel phony around those people.  I 
                        just wanna be myself.

                        I can’t believe I blew him.  You’re 
                        bigger than he is, by the way.  Not 
                        that I was comparing.

                                 SAWYER
                        You mean I’m bigger than him 
                        everyday, or just because of the 
                        bee sting?

                                 MARCY
                        Even without the swelling.

                                 SAWYER
                      (hugs her)
                        I’m sorry your love life is screwed, 
                        but I’m glad to have my friend back.

                                 MARCY
                      (sobbing uncontrollably)
                        I was always your friend, Sawyer.  
                        I’m so sorry I wasn’t around.  I’m 
                        a horrible person.

                                 SAWYER
                        No!  Don’t cry.  I didn’t mean it 
                        that way.

           They continue to hold each other as she cries on his 
           shoulder.  After a long beat:

                                 SAWYER
                        Marcy, I think I’m in love with the 
                        mystery girl in the pictures from the 
                        camera I found on the beach.  
                      (she stops crying)
                        But I don’t wanna talk about it. 

                                 MARCY
                        You’re in love with her?

                                 SAWYER
                        I said I don’t wanna talk about it.

                                 MARCY
                        Then why did you bring it up?

                                 SAWYER
                        So you could tell me that I’m 
                        pathetic.

                        It’s not pathetic.  It’s romantic, 
                        Sawyer.  Maybe you have some kind of 
                        connection with her.  Maybe you’re 
                        meant to be together.

                                 SAWYER
                        Like you thought you were meant to be 
                        with Eric?  Some things are just 
                        better off being fantasies.

                                 MARCY
                        I don’t believe that. Even though 
                        Eric turned out to be a selfish, semi-
                        retarded, jock-hole. 
                      (beat)
                        I think you should try to find her.

                                 SAWYER
                        You’re emotional right now.  You’re 
                        not thinking clearly.  It’s 
                        impossible that a girl like that 
                        would have anything to do with me.

                                 MARCY
                        The only thing that makes it 
                        impossible is the fact that you 
                        won’t try.  Remember the summer we 
                        were nine years old?  You thought 
                        it was impossible to hold your breath 
                        for a minute.  We were in my pool 
                        everyday trying as hard as we 
                        could... and what happened?

                                 SAWYER
                        I got the worst sunburn of my life, 
                        which will eventually lead to skin

                        And by the end of the summer you 
                        could hold your breath for a minute 
                        and eight seconds.  I don’t know what 
                        happened to you, Sawyer.  Sometime 
                        between when we were nine, and this 
                        moment right now, you decided that 
                        things just weren’t meant to go 
                        your way.      

                                 SAWYER
                        I’ll tell you what happened.  I got 
                        realistic.

                        There are people like my sister who 
                        get to be beautiful and smart and 
                        adored by the masses.  When she’s 
                        older she’ll be rich and successful 
                        and happy.  But we can’t all have it 
                        all.  Some of us are just meant to be 
                        ordinary.  

                                 MARCY
                        That’s a brilliant fucking cop-out.  
                        Don’t dare for a shot at happiness.  
                        You’re destined to be average.

                                 SAWYER
                        Nowhere is it written that you can’t 
                        be happy and be average.  Content 
                        with mediocrity.  That’s the key.  
                        I’ve come to the conclusion that most 
                        people are miserable because their 
                        reach exceeds their grasp.

                                 MARCY
                        Wrong, most people are miserable 
                        because their whole life they take 
                        the easy way out.  Then they look 
                        back at all the opportunities they 
                        squandered and it makes them sick.  
                        You know what my grandfather told me 
                        when he was dying? He said “When your 
                        time comes, Marcy.  As you're taking 
                        your last breath.  If you're lucky 
                        enough to have a moment to reflect on 
                        your life - you won't regret the 
                        things you did, you'll only regret 
                        the things you didn't do.”

                                 SAWYER
                        That’s a nice theory but didn’t you 
                        come here full of regret for trying 
                        to be popular and for blowing Eric?

                                 MARCY
                        It hurts a little right now because 
                        it didn’t work out the way I hoped, 
                        but I got a chance to be popular.  I 
                        don’t have to spend the rest of my 
                        life wondering what it would’ve been 
                        like.  I did it and it’s not for me.  
                        You can’t let the girl in the 
                        pictures be another Renee Lovaglio.  
                        Renee is gonna haunt you until the 
                        day you die because you didn’t have 
                        the guts to ask her out.

                        She moved away and you never got a 
                        chance to see if she liked you.

           Sawyer ponders this.

                                 SAWYER
                        This girl is so far beyond me, Marcy.  
                        I just don’t see the point in setting 
                        myself up for that kind of rejection.

                                 MARCY
                        Obviously no one wants to be 
                        rejected, but stop being negative for 
                        one second.  What if she’s just 
                        sitting in her room, staring at the 
                        ceiling, and waiting for you?

                                 SAWYER
                        That’s not likely.

                                 MARCY
                        Not likely, no.  But it’s not 
                        impossible.

                                 SAWYER
                        Even if I wanted to look for her, I 
                        have no idea who she is, or where she 
                        is, or how to find her.

                                 MARCY
                        Start with the pictures.  There have 
                        to be clues in the pictures.  I’ll 
                        help you.  We’ll do it together.

                                 SAWYER
                        You’re forgetting the fact that I’m 
                        not allowed to leave my bedroom.

                                 MARCY
                        If you want her, Sawyer, you can’t 
                        let little things like that stop you.  

           Sawyer realizes that she’s right.

           MONTAGE

           SCHOOL HALLWAY - SLO-MO: Sawyer marches down the hall with 
           Marcy, Andrew and Mickey.  They’re on a mission.

           JOURNALISM CLASS - The kids spread the pictures on a drafting 
           table and study them carefully.

           (cid:13)           Marcy hangs a few of the pictures at the corresponding 
           locations on the map.

           SAWYER’S BEDROOM - Sawyer sneaks in his window.

           BEACH, SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS - Mickey and Andrew show 
           pictures of the Dream Girl to locals and tourists.  No one 
           recognizes her.

           SAWYER’S BEDROOM - The next day Sawyer sneaks out his window.

           MOTEL ROW - The kids all pop into different motels to see if 
           the managers recognize the Dream Girl.  No one does.

           JOURNALISM CLASS - On the other side of the dry erase board 
           the kids keep track of all the clues they amass.

           MAIN STREET AND BEACH - Mickey puts up posters of the Dream 
           Girl on light poles and in store windows.  It read: “If 
           you’ve seen this girl Call Mickey 555-9718.”

           JOURNALISM CLASS - Sawyer removes a picture from the DRY 
           ERASE BOARD of a HANDSOME GUY with his arm around the Dream 
           Girl.  The guy holds up a Daiquiri glass that reads “TEQUILA 
           BREEZE BEACH BAR”

           TEQUILA BREEZE BEACH BAR - An outdoor bar.  Sawyer shows the 
           picture to some PATRONS.  No dice.  He then shows it to the 
           FEMALE BARTENDER. She doesn’t recognize the Dream Girl but 
           she does recognize the Handsome Guy.

           END MONTAGE...

           EXT. TEQUILA BREEZE BEACH BAR - THAT MOMENT

           Sawyer gives the FEMALE BARTENDER a surprised look.

                                 SAWYER
                        You know this guy?

                                 FEMALE BARTENDER
                        Sure.  That’s Danny.  He’s a local.  
                        He’s in here all the time.

                                 SAWYER
                        You don’t know the girl though?

                                 FEMALE BARTENDER
                        No. Don’t recall ever seeing her.

                                 SAWYER
                        Can you tell me where I could find 
                        Danny?

RUNDOWN APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           A popular dwelling for beach bums and surfers.  Sawyer climbs 
           off his bike and drags it up the stairs to Danny’s apartment.  

           Through the torn screen door Sawyer sees that the front door 
           is open.

                                 SAWYER
                        Hello?

                                 DANNY (O.S.)
                        Hello.

                                 SAWYER
                        I’m looking for Danny.

                                 DANNY (O.S.)
                        That’s me.  Come on in.  Careful with 
                        the screen door.  It’s a little 
                        tricky.

           Sawyer pulls on the screen door but it seems to be jammed so 
           he pulls a little harder.  

           BLAM!  The whole thing comes off the hinges and Sawyer almost 
           goes with it over the railing behind him.  The door lands on 
           some dead shrubs below.  

                                 SAWYER
                        Jesus.  I dropped your door over the 
                        side.

                                 DANNY (O.S.)
                        Don’t worry about it.  Fuckin’ 
                        maintenance guy needs to do something 
                        about that thing.

           INT. DANNY’S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT

           Sawyer steps into the dingy little apartment.  

           DANNY, 22, looks even better in person than he did in the 
           picture.  Blonde, tan, and muscular.  He’s in his boxers in 
           the kitchen, staring into the fridge.

                                 DANNY
                        I overslept.  You know what time it 
                        is?

                                 SAWYER
                        Almost four o’clock.

                        Shit, I shoulda gotten up an hour 
                        ago.  You want a beer.

                                 SAWYER
                        No thanks.
                      (Sawyer reconsiders)
                        On second thought I would.

                                 DANNY
                      (pops open the bottle)
                        Last one.  We’ll share.

                                 SAWYER
                        That’s okay.  Never mind.

                                 DANNY
                        What do you want, like a dime bag?

                                 SAWYER
                        What?

                                 DANNY
                        How much weed do you want?

                                 SAWYER
                        Oh, I’m not here for drugs.

           A NAKED GIRL appears from the hallway.

                                 NAKED GIRL
                        Danny there’s no toilet paper.

           She notices Sawyer but does nothing to cover herself.

                                 NAKED GIRL
                        I didn’t know you had company.

                                 DANNY
                      (confused)
                        I don’t know who the fuck this dude 
                        is.

                                 SAWYER
                        I’m Sawyer.

                                 NAKED GIRL
                        There’s no toilet paper and I really 
                        have to pee.

                                 DANNY
                        I don’t know, use your sock.

                        That’s gross.

           Disgusted, she marches back into the bedroom.

                                 DANNY
                        Thank god.

                                 SAWYER
                        For what?

                                 DANNY
                        I’m sober and she’s still hot.  What 
                        do you want if you’re not here for 
                        weed?

           Sawyer holds up the picture of Danny and the Dream Girl.

                                 SAWYER
                        I’m looking for this girl.

                                 DANNY
                        I’ve never seen her before.

                                 SAWYER
                        What do you mean?
                      (re:picture)
                        That’s you. You’re standing right 
                        next to her. 

                                 DANNY
                      (agitated)
                        What is she your sister or something?  
                        Are you here to throw down?

                                 SAWYER
                        Throw down?  I’m just looking for 
                        this girl.  

                                 DANNY
                        I don’t want any trouble.

                                 SAWYER
                        Do you know her or not?

           Danny sits on the couch and loads up his pipe.

                                 DANNY
                        I vaguely remember she came into the 
                        Tequila Breeze with a couple of 
                        friends: A sweet Asian and some tubby 
                        chick.

                        We exchanged glances, I bought her a 
                        few drinks and we came back here.   
                      (remembering)
                        Heather.

                                 SAWYER
                        Her name’s Heather?

                                 DANNY
                        Isn’t it?  I was calling her Heather 
                        all night.
                      (beat)
                        Maybe it wasn’t Heather, maybe that’s 
                        why she started getting a little 
                        weird.

                                 SAWYER

                        When I kissed her, she started crying 
                        and said she wanted to go for a walk.  
                        I’m a gentleman, so I tagged along.  
                        She didn’t say a word for like an 
                        hour and then suddenly she was all 
                        over me like she was cock starved. 

                                 SAWYER
                        Did you have sex with her?

                        We made out and she rubbed my 
                        schnauzer through my pants.  Next 
                        thing I know she started crying again 
                        and said she wanted to go back to her 
                        motel. Chick was a couple a eggs 
                        short of an omelette.

                        weeks ago.  She was an out of state 
                        college bitch here on vacation.

                        just didn’t click, ya know?  I 
                        dropped her off and that was that.

           EXT. BEACH WALK - DAY

           Marcy, Mickey and Andrew are sitting at a picnic table near

                        just getting started.

                        You weren’t able to find anything?

                        I found the guy from the picture at 
                        the bar.

                                 MARCY
                        That’s great.

                        How could you wanna throw in the 
                        towel now?  We’re getting somewhere.

                                 SAWYER
                        You wanna know what I found out?  She 
                        goes to college in some other state.
                        While in Crystal Bay she met a 
                        complete loser in a bar and almost 
                        slept with him.  He said she was 
                        “weird.”  He said she alternated 
                        between being sexually aggressive and 
                        crying uncontrollably.

                        How is that bad?  Everyone knows that 
                        crazy chicks are the best in bed. 

                                 ANDREW
                        I didn’t know that.

                                 MARCY
                        Me either.

                                 SAWYER
                        Mickey, I’m not going through all 
                        this trouble to get laid.

                                 MICKEY
                        You’re not?  What the fuck are we 
                        doing it for then?

                                 SAWYER
                        I don’t know.

                                 MARCY
                        Sawyer, you can’t let one guys 
                        opinion change your mind about her.  
                        One man’s crazy bitch is another 
                        man’s dream girl, right?

                                 SAWYER
                        The final nail in the coffin is that 
                        her name is Heather for God’s sake.  
                        There’s no way I’m meant to be with a 
                        girl named Heather.

                        We’re not quitting!  We’ve only been 
                        looking for three days.  Now we know 
                        her first name and that she goes to 
                        college -- somewhere.  We have to 
                        take a closer look at the pictures.  
                        There must be more clues.

                                 SAWYER
                        I’ve been staring at those pictures 
                        for weeks.

                                 MARCY
                        You’ve been staring at Heather for 
                        weeks.

                        It’s almost dinner time.  My parents 
                        are gonna notice that I’m gone.

           Sawyer walks away.  Marcy is disappointed in him.  Mickey 
           shrugs as if he expected Sawyer to give up.

           INT. SAWYER’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Sawyer climbs in his window and is immediately struck with a 
           sense of dread.  His room is completely CLEAN.  He sits on 
           his bed and looks around in disbelief.

           Chuck and Laura enter, visibly upset.

                                 LAURA
                        I waited in here for four hours to 
                        confront you about why you weren’t 
                        home.

                                 CHUCK
                        Did you forget that you’re grounded?

                                 LAURA
                        As the hours passed I got more and 
                        more upset.  You know that when I get 
                        upset I clean.

                                 SAWYER
                        I can explain.

                                 LAURA
                        Do you sneak out of here to perform 
                        oral sex on tourists for money?

                                 SAWYER
                        What?

           She pulls Marcy’s “How to Give the Ultimate Blow Job” 
           pamphlet from behind her back.

                                 LAURA
                        I found this on your floor.

                                 SAWYER
                        I don’t perform oral sex on tourists 
                        for money!

                        Are you performing oral sex on

                        No one.

                                 LAURA
                        Then how do you explain the 
                        instruction booklet?
                      (no answer)
                        There has to be an explanation.  Huh?  
                        What is it?  They’re not handing 
                        these out at school, correct?

                                 CHUCK
                        There has to be some reason why you 
                        have to know how to give a blow job.

                                 LAURA
                        Please don’t call it that in front of 
                        him.

                                 CHUCK
                        Him hearing the words blow job are 
                        the least of our problems right now.  

                                 LAURA
                        We’re on your side, Sawyer.  We’re 
                        just worried about you.

                                 SAWYER
                        There’s nothing to worry about.

                                 CHUCK
                        How can you say there’s nothing to 
                        worry about?  I was dreading the day 
                        I might have to have the blow job 
                        talk with my daughter.  I never 
                        imagined in a million years that I’d 
                        be having it with my son.

                                 LAURA
                        We’re making an appointment for you 
                        to see a psychiatrist.  If you can’t 
                        share with us, maybe you’ll be able 
                        to share with a stranger.

                                 SAWYER
                        Mom, there’s really nothing to share.

                                 LAURA
                        Then why do you have the blow job

                      (lying)
                        Myself!  Okay, I blow myself!

           Laura covers her mouth, almost vomits, and rushes out of the 
           room.  Chuck looks dazed.

                                 CHUCK
                        Where did we go wrong?

           He stumbles out of the room.  Sawyer looks at us.

                                 SAWYER
                      (angry)
                        That went well.  I told you I’m a bad 
                        liar.  Auto-fellatio!  That was the 
                        best I could come up with?  I 
                        couldn’t tell them it was Marcy’s 
                        pamphlet.  Imagine if it got back to 
                        her parents that she was practicing 
                        oral sex on me.  So now my parents 
                        think I spy on my sister when she’s 
                        naked and then come back to my room 
                        and suck my own dick.

           Sawyer pulls his closet open and begins dumping his neatly 
           organized belonging back onto the floor.

           INT. JOURNALISM CLASSROOM - EVENING

           Marcy spreads Heather’s vacation pictures on the desk.

           She chooses a picture of Heather getting a speeding ticket 
           from a Cop.  Marcy scans the picture into the computer.

           INTERCUT

           Sawyer continues to disorganize his room. He pulls clothes 
           out of the closet and tosses them onto the floor.

           Meanwhile... Marcy uses the computer to zoom in on the 
           picture of Heather.  Marcy tries to read the speeding ticket 
           that the Cop is handing Heather but it’s too pixelated.

           Marcy scans in another picture but finds no clues.  

           Sawyer empties drawers onto the floor.  Marcy scans another 
           picture and another before noticing...

           In one of the photos the Chubby Girl wears a T-shirt with two 
           GREEK LETTERS on it.  She zeros in on the letters.
                                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)           Sawyer has totally undone his mother’s cleaning.  He looks at 
           himself in the mirror and then looks at the picture of 
           Heather that he has stuck on the mirror.  

           He takes the picture off, stares at it for a moment and then 
           TEARS it in half and throws it away.

           Marcy finds the greek letters in the dictionary. OMEGA CHI. 
           Marcy goes to Yahoo and types: “Omega Chi sorority.”

           She links to the Omega Chi homepage.  She clicks on the 
           “Chapter Directory” and sees a list of over ONE HUNDRED 
           colleges that have Omega Chi chapters.

           Slightly disheartened she finds the “Member Search” function 
           and types in “Heather.”

           She’s completely disheartened to find that there are ONE 
           HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN HEATHERS all around the country who are 
           members of the sorority.

           Sawyer climbs out his window.

           Marcy goes back to the pictures, scanning another one in.

           Sawyer wanders the streets toward the beach.

           Marcy continues through the pictures, one by one.

           Sawyer sits on the BEACH, waiting for the sun to set.

           Marcy looks at a picture of Heather and her two friends on a 
           snorkeling trip.  She zooms in on the sail of the boat and 
           sees that it says: “SKIPPER STEVE’S BOAT RENTAL.”  Bingo.

           Sawyer watches the sun slowly disappear into the ocean.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. SAWYER’S HOUSE/NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

           Sawyer walks up the street towards his house.  Marcy’s car is 
           parked at the curb and Marcy sits alone on the hood.

                        My mom found the ultimate blow job 
                        pamphlet on my floor.

                                 MARCY
                        I’m sorry.

                        It’s not your fault.  If the room 
                        wasn’t such a mess I would’ve 
                        realized you left it there.

                                 MARCY
                        What did you tell her?

                                 SAWYER
                        I told her that I had it because I 
                        like to blow myself.

                                 MARCY
                      (laughs)
                        Sorry...  Why did you say that?

                                 SAWYER
                        I didn’t want to get you in trouble 
                        and that was the first thing that 
                        came to mind.

                                 MARCY
                        Thank you for looking out for me.

                                 SAWYER
                        That’s what friends are for.

                                 MARCY
                        Exactly.  Which is why I’m not 
                        letting you give up on Heather.

                                 SAWYER
                        Marcy, we looked for her.  She goes 
                        to college in another state.  I’m a 
                        seventeen year old high school 
                        student who doesn’t even have a car. 

                                 MARCY
                        I think I know how to find her.

                                 SAWYER
                      (half sure)
                        Forget it.

                                 MARCY
                        I can’t.  And neither can you.  I 
                        went and scanned the pictures into 
                        Photoshop and looked at them more 
                        carefully.  

           Marcy hands him the picture in which the Chubby Girl is 
           wearing the sorority T-shirt.

                        Check out the Chubby Girl’s T-shirt.  
                        You know what that writing is?

                                 SAWYER
                        It looks like it says “OX.”

                                 MARCY
                        No, those are greek letters.  That’s 
                        a sorority T-shirt.  Omega Chi.  I 
                        looked it up online.  Unfortunately 
                        there are Omega Chi chapters at over 
                        a hundred colleges.  And there are a 
                        hundred and seventeen girls named 
                        Heather who are members of Omega Chi.  

                                 SAWYER
                      (disinterested)
                        So what do we do, make a hundred 
                        phone calls asking to speak to a girl 
                        named Heather and then ask if she 
                        lost a camera?

                                 MARCY
                        I’ve got something even better.

           She hands him the picture of the three girls on the 
           snorkeling trip.

                                 MARCY
                        The boat the girls took out to go 
                        snorkeling was rented from Skipper 
                        Steve’s Boat Rental.  I called 
                        Skipper Steve and he requires a major 
                        credit card and a photocopy of your 
                        driver’s licence to rent from him.  
                        We can go see him tomorrow.

                                 SAWYER
                        I can’t be in love with a girl in a 
                        picture, Marcy.  I’ve never been in 
                        love.  My first time can’t be with a 
                        photograph.  

                                 MARCY
                        Then don’t call it love, Sawyer.  
                        You’re infatuated, enamored, 
                        captivated.  Whatever it is, you 
                        should try to talk to her.  
                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                 SAWYER
                        Has it occurred to you that you’re 
                        intent on helping me find Heather as 
                        a way to avoid how you’re feeling 
                        about the Eric situation?

                                 MARCY
                        There is no Eric situation. That 
                        story has a beginning, middle, and 
                        end. The Heather story is stuck, 
                        because the hero of the story - that 
                        would be you - refuses to take 
                        action.

           Sawyer lets this sink in.

           INT. SKIPPER STEVE’S BOAT RENTAL - DAY

           SKIPPER STEVE is a pudgy guy in his early forties.  He’s 
           sitting behind his desk making a fishing lure.  He looks up 
           with a friendly smile as Sawyer and Marcy enter.

                                 SKIPPER STEVE
                        Welcome to Skipper Steve’s Boat 
                        Rental.  I’m Skipper Steve.  What can 
                        I interest you in today?

                                 MARCY
                        My name is Marcy.  I spoke to you 
                        last night about what you require to 
                        rent a boat.

                                 SKIPPER STEVE
                        You shoulda mentioned to me that 
                        you’re under eighteen, Marcy. I can’t 
                        rent to you without an adult present. 

                                 MARCY
                        We don’t actually wanna rent a boat.  
                        We just want information about 
                        someone you rented to in the past.

           He looks at them confused.

                                 SAWYER
                        I can explain...

                                 SKIPPER STEVE
                        You’re Laura’s kid.

                                 SAWYER
                        Yeah.  Sawyer.
                                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 SKIPPER STEVE
                        How’s your mom?

                                 SAWYER
                      (caught off guard)
                        Okay, I guess.

                                 SKIPPER STEVE
                        We went to high school together.  
                        Came this close to asking her to the 
                        prom, but your dad beat me to it.
                      (regretful)
                        I blew that one.  Things good between 
                        her and your dad?

                                 SAWYER
                        I guess so.

           Skipper Steve is lost in memories of the past.  After a 
           moment he snaps out of it.  

                                 SKIPPER STEVE
                        So what is it you kids want?

                                 SAWYER
                        I’m looking for a girl...

                                 SKIPPER STEVE
                        You got an awfully cute girl right 
                        here.

                                 SAWYER
                        I know I do, but I’m looking for a 
                        specific girl.  I found a camera on 
                        the beach.

           Sawyer hands Skipper Steve the picture of Heather and her 
           friends on the Skipper’s boat.

                                 MARCY
                        Sawyer’s infatuated with the girl in 
                        the middle.  Do you remember them?

                                 SKIPPER STEVE
                        Yeah, I took this picture.  They 
                        rented a boat from me, maybe a month 
                        ago.  So you want me to check my 
                        records to find out who she is?

                                 SAWYER
                        If you would.
                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                 SKIPPER STEVE
                        Sure.  Just tell your mom I did you a 
                        solid, huh?

           ANGLE ON FILING CABINET

           Skipper Steve’s pudgy fingers thumb through the files.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Skipper Steve pulls some paperwork out of a folder and hands 
           it to Sawyer.

                                 SKIPPER STEVE
                        Here it is.

           Marcy grabs it away, excited. 

                                 MARCY
                      (reading)
                        Heather Logan, 417 Blue Lakes Road...

           She stops, disappointed.

                                 SAWYER
                        What?

                                 MARCY
                        Pinewood, Idaho.

                                 SAWYER
                        Idaho?  

           Sawyer looks at the photocopy of Heather’s license.

                                 SAWYER
                        Do people really live in Idaho?

           Marcy finds a phone number written on the paperwork.

                                 MARCY
                        There’s a phone number.  You should 
                        call her.

           Marcy tries to hand him her cell phone.

                                 SAWYER
                        Are you kidding me?  I’m not gonna 
                        call her now.

                                 MARCY
                        Why not?

                        I can think of a dozen reasons 
                        starting with the fact that I’m a 
                        complete stranger and she’s in IDAHO!

                                 SKIPPER STEVE
                        You can’t procrastinate these kinds 
                        of things, kid.  You can’t waste time 
                        considering your options and planning 
                        what you’re gonna say.  That’ll just 
                        make you nervous and then you’ll 
                        never call.

                                 SAWYER
                        I’m already nervous.

                                 MARCY
                        If you don’t wanna do it, I’ll do it.

                                 SAWYER
                        And say what?

                                 MARCY
                        Whatever comes to mind.

                                 SAWYER
                        I’d rather you didn’t.

                                 MARCY
                      (dials)
                        It’s ringing.

           She tries again to hand Sawyer the phone.  He refuses.

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        Hello.

                                 MARCY
                        Hi, may I speak with Heather?

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        Heather is at school.

                                 MARCY
                        Oh.  When might be a good time to 
                        call back?

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        She’s away at school.  In Virginia.

                        I’m sorry.  I didn’t realize.  Do you 
                        have a number where I could reach 
                        her?   

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        Her cell number is on the fridge.  
                        Hold on a second.

           Marcy smiles and nods at Sawyer.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Sawyer sits at the kitchen table staring at a scrap of paper 
           that reads “Heather’s cell 208-555-1009.”

                                  SAWYER
                      (to us)
                        What would you do in my situation? I 
                        know that it’s easy to pass judgement 
                        from where you’re sitting, but what 
                        would you really do? If you were at 
                        the mall or at a club, at work or in 
                        school and you saw a girl... or a 
                        guy, and something about them shook 
                        you, would you do something about it? 
                        It’s happened to everybody. Did you 
                        walk right up to them or did you let 
                        them get away?  Did you try to be a 
                        rock star? Did you try to be 
                        President? Did you try to get a poem 
                        in the school literary magazine? Were 
                        you the prom queen? Did you dance 
                        with the prom queen? Did you try?

           Sawyer takes a long moment.  He breathes deeply and picks up 
           the wall phone.  Almost immediately he hangs up.

           Another deep breath, he picks up the receiver again and dials 
           several digits before quickly hanging up again.

                                 SAWYER
                        Just do it, you pussy.

           He grabs the receiver and dials the whole number.

                                 HEATHER’S VOICE
                        Hello?

           Before Sawyer can speak, Rebecca strides into the kitchen.  
           Panicked, he hangs up.
                                       (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                 REBECCA
                        You're grounded, you're not supposed 
                        to be using the phone.

                                 SAWYER
                        I was calling mom.

                                 REBECCA
                        Is she making dinner tonight?

                                 SAWYER
                        I don’t know.  I didn’t talk to her.

           Rebecca scowls.  The phone rings.  Sawyer glances at it.

                                 REBECCA
                        Who is it?

                                 SAWYER
                        Wrong number probably.

                                 REBECCA
                        Why don’t you look at the caller ID 
                        and see?

           Humoring her, he checks the caller ID.  It’s Heather.

                                 SAWYER
                        Yep, wrong number.

                                 REBECCA
                        How do you know?  Maybe it’s for me.

                                 SAWYER
                        No, it isn’t.

           Rebecca quickly picks up the phone.  Caught off guard, Sawyer 
           grabs her arm before she can put the receiver to her ear.

                                 REBECCA
                        What the fuck are you doing?

                                 HEATHER’S VOICE
                        Hello?

                                 SAWYER
                      (quickly)
                        You have the wrong number.  Please 
                        hang up and try your call again.

           Sawyer releases Rebecca’s arm and she puts the phone to her 
           ear.  Sawyer’s panic level doubles.
                                         (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 REBECCA
                        Hello?

                                 HEATHER’S VOICE
                        Hi, this is Heather.  Someone just 
                        called me from this number.

                                 SAWYER
                      (whispers)
                        Hang up.

           Annoyed, Sawyer tries to grab the phone.

                                 REBECCA
                        That must have been my brother.  He 
                        said he was calling my mom but I 
                        could tell something was up.

                                 SAWYER
                      (whispers)
                        It was an accident.  I mis-dialed.

                                 REBECCA
                        Is this Heather Lawrence?

                                 HEATHER’S VOICE
                        No.

                                 SAWYER
                      (whispers)
                        Hang up!

                                 REBECCA
                        Heather Marcus?

                                 HEATHER’S VOICE
                        No.

                                 SAWYER
                      (whispers forcefully)
                        Hang up!!

                                 REBECCA
                        Do you even go to Crystal Bay High?

                                 HEATHER’S VOICE
                        No.  I vacationed in Crystal Bay.  
                        Who is this?

                                 SAWYER
                        Please, hang up!
                                         (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 REBECCA
                        Let me get to the bottom of this.  
                        Why did you call this girl?
                      (to Heather)
                        My brother is a little freak.  He may 
                        be stalk--

           Sawyer grabs Rebecca and wrestles her to the ground.  She 
           drops the phone as they struggle.

                                 HEATHER’S VOICE
                        Hello... Hello...

           Sawyer straddles Rebecca.  He raises his fist.  He seems like 
           he’s reached his breaking point and he’s going to hit her.

           Rebecca flinches.  After a moment Sawyer realizes he can’t do 
           it and lowers his fist.  

           Rebecca immediately PUNCHES him in the mouth.

                                 SAWYER
                        What did you do that for?

                                 REBECCA
                        You were gonna hit me.

                                 SAWYER
                        No I wasn’t.  You deserve to be hit.  
                        I probably should have hit you, but I 
                        wasn’t gonna do it.

           Sawyer puts the receiver to his ear.  Busy signal.

                                 REBECCA
                        Who was it?

                                 SAWYER
                        None of your business.

           Sawyer picks up the caller ID and erases Heather’s number.  
           Rebecca shakes her head and goes into the living room.  

           Sawyer plops down in a seat at the table, staring at nothing.  

           This is the moment of truth.  Is he going to take a chance?  
           Long beat, then Sawyer rises and marches out.

           INT. SAWYER’S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Sawyer strides into his room.  He empties his backpack onto 
           the bed.  He grabs Heather’s PICTURES and drops them into the 
           bag.  He then grabs some clothes and stuffs them in.

LIVING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Backpack slung over his shoulder, Sawyer walks up to the key 
           rack.  Rebecca, watching TV, sees him.

                                 REBECCA
                        What are you doing?

                                 SAWYER
                        I’m borrowing your car.

                                 REBECCA
                        Like hell.

           He grabs a set of keys and heads out the door.  

           EXT. SAWYER’S HOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Sawyer jumps in Rebecca’s VW and starts the engine.  Rebecca 
           follows him outside.

                                 REBECCA
                        Get out!  I’m calling dad!  Where do 
                        you think you’re going?!

           The car lurches out of the driveway and speeds off.

           A SERIES OF SHOTS

           Sawyer cruises on the highway with the top down.  Eighteen 
           wheelers whiz by him.

           Sawyer stands on the side of the road, looking at a map.

           Sawyer sits in the VW and carefully places the PICTURES in a 
           photo album.

           Sawyer stops at a diner after dark and gets approached by a 
           Truck Stop Hooker.

           Sawyer drives past a sign welcoming him to Virginia.

           EXT. SORORITY ROW - NIGHT

           The VW creeps along the street as Sawyer tries to find the 
           right house. 

           He comes upon the OMEGA CHI sorority and finds the kind of 
           party you see in the movies.  Music BLARES and DRUNKEN 
           COLLEGE KIDS spill out the front door onto the lawn.

           Sawyer parks.  He watches the party for a moment.  He looks 
           over to the passenger seat at the PHOTO ALBUM.  Deep breath.

           INT. SORORITY HOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Sawyer squeezes between PARTY GOERS and enters the house.  
           It’s unlike anything he has ever experienced.  

           MOVING 

           He wanders around, looking for Heather.  People drink, some 
           smoke pot. 

           He eventually spots EILEEN.

           PICTURE: Eileen (Heather’s cute Asian friend), in a bedroom, 
           opening her towel and flashing a breast.

                                 SAWYER
                        Excuse me, I’m looking for Heather.

                                 EILEEN
                        I think she’s upstairs.

                                 SAWYER
                        Thanks.

           Sawyer heads up the stairs.  

           INT. SORORITY HOUSE SECOND FLOOR - THAT MOMENT

           There aren’t any revelers up here.  In fact it’s pretty quiet 
           except for:

                                 EX-BOYFRIEND 
                        When did you become such a fucking 
                        slut?!  We break up and you have to 
                        fuck the next guy you see?!

                                 HEATHER 
                      (drunk)
                        I didn’t fuck the next guy I saw.  I 
                        fucked the next guy I wanted to fuck.

           Sawyer peeks around the corner just in time to see HEATHER 
           VOMIT on her EX-BOYFRIEND’s shoes.

                                 EX-BOYFRIEND
                        Beautiful.  Your parents would be so 
                        proud of you right now.  We’ll finish 
                        this when you’re not such a mess.  
                        Try to keep your legs crossed tonight 
                        if you can.

                        That’s not your business anymore.

           The Ex storms past Sawyer and disappears down the stairs.  
           Heather sits on the floor and leans against the wall.  She 
           looks sad and a little out of it.

                                 SAWYER
                      (to us)
                        I think we caught her at a bad time.

           Sawyer remains in the shadows, watching her for a moment.  
           She’s clearly having a bad night but he decides to approach.

                                 SAWYER
                        Heather?

                                 HEATHER
                        Yeah.

                                 SAWYER
                        Are you okay?

                                 HEATHER
                      (snippy)
                        I’m fine.

                                 SAWYER
                        You’re sitting in vomit.

                                 HEATHER
                        Do I know you?

                                 SAWYER
                        No.  

                                 HEATHER
                        The party’s downstairs.  There’s 
                        really nothing to see here.

           Heather looks down and does not make eye contact with Sawyer 
           for the rest of the scene.  Long Silence.

                                 SAWYER
                        Are you sure you’re okay?

                                 HEATHER
                        I’m sure I don’t wanna talk to you 
                        about it.

                                 SAWYER
                        Yeah.  I’m not trying to annoy you--
                                         (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                 HEATHER
                        Try harder.

                                 SAWYER
                        Obviously this is a bad time but I 
                        came a long way...

                                 HEATHER
                        Would it be rude for me to ask you to 
                        please fuck off?

                                 SAWYER
                        It’s a little rude.

                                 HEATHER
                        How ‘bout pretty please?  Fuck off!

           Sawyer stares at her for a moment and then places the photo 
           album on the floor a couple of feet in front of her.  He 
           slowly walks away.

           EXT. SORORITY HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Depressed, Sawyer exits the house and walks slowly to the VW. 
           He stops at the car and looks back at the house thoughtfully.

           After a beat he climbs in and turns the key but it won’t 
           start.  He tries over and over but it’s no use.  

           Sawyer gets out, opens the hood and takes a look at the 
           engine.  He has no idea what he’s looking at.  He closes it, 
           and tries to start the car again.  Nothing.

           He punches the dashboard, leans back and closes his eyes. 

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. VOLKSWAGEN - MORNING

           Sawyer is sound asleep in the driver’s seat.  Suddenly 
           there’s a KNOCK on the window and he’s startled awake. 

           Heather’s beautiful and apologetic face is staring at him.  
           She wears shorts and a tank top and carries a garbage bag 
           full of beer bottles.  Sawyer rolls down the window. 

                                 HEATHER
                        Hi.  I was just cleaning up a little 
                        and I noticed your car.  Saw the

                        being a bitch to you last night.

Partly because he’s still hurt but 
           mostly because he can’t believe she’s so close to him.

                                 HEATHER
                        I’m really sorry.  I was drunk and 
                        arguing with my ex-boyfriend right 
                        before...  I’m usually not like that.

           He gives a slight nod.

                                 HEATHER
                        You spoke at the party so I know 
                        you’re not mute.  Did you find my 
                        camera in Crystal Bay?

                                 SAWYER
                        Yeah.

                                 HEATHER
                        I really am sorry.  I was incredibly 
                        rude to you.  You can tear into me if 
                        you want.  Call me names, spit on me.  
                        You can’t spit on me.  But I will 
                        accept a tongue lashing.

                                 SAWYER
                        That’s okay.

                                 HEATHER
                        Really, I would feel better.  I 
                        deserve it.

                                 SAWYER
                        I spent most of the night cursing 
                        you.  I got it out of my system.

SORORITY HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

           Heather prepares an elaborate breakfast.  Sawyer sits on a 
           stool at the counter which is littered with alcohol bottles 
           from the night before.  

           He watches her, mesmerized as she talks in a very friendly 
           and open manner.

                                 HEATHER
                        I didn’t think I’d ever see those 
                        pictures.  I was so upset when I 
                        realized I had lost the camera.  You 
                        have no idea how much this means to 
                        me.  Joanie, she’s the redhead in the 
                        pictures, she and I have been best 
                        friends since third grade.

                                 HEATHER
                        We’ve always done everything 
                        together.  She came to me two months 
                        ago and told me she was dropping out 
                        of school and going to Europe.  She 
                        said that college wasn’t for her and 
                        she only enrolled here because that’s 
                        what I was doing.  She wants to 
                        wander the globe.  For a second I 
                        thought about going with her. Anyway, 
                        the trip to Crystal Bay was sort of 
                        our last hurrah. I miss her a lot.  
                        I’m sorry, you’re not interested in 
                        all that.

                        No.  Yes.  I am.

                                 HEATHER
                        How did you find me?

                                 SAWYER
                        Uhhh...  My friend Marcy works at our 
                        school paper.  I had her develop the 
                        negatives.  She figured we could find 
                        you by getting clues from the 
                        pictures.

           Heather’s cell phone rings.  She looks at the Caller ID.

                        Oh my God.  Leave me alone.
                      (to Sawyer)
                        A week before Joanie told me she was 
                        going, I found out my boyfriend had 
                        cheated on me.  He was back in Idaho 
                        and we tried to do the long distance 
                        thing after high school.  He slept 
                        with Annette Marcus and then felt the 
                        need to call and confess immediately 
                        afterwards.  He claimed he was lonely 
                        and had a moment of weakness. Instead 
                        of feeling devastated, I was totally 
                        relieved.  He came all the way here 
                        to try and win me back, which would 
                        be nice if I wanted him back, but 
                        since I don’t it’s really just been 
                        annoying and depressing.  I was 
                        hoping he would finally get the hint 
                        when I went to Crystal Bay but he 
                        didn’t.  That’s what you walked in on 
                        last night, me telling him for the 
                        two hundredth time to go home and get 
                        on with his life and that I need to 
                        sow my wild oats.  If I even have any 
                        wild oats.  I’m babbling.

                        that this kid came eight hundred 
                        miles to return some pictures?

           Sawyer immediately feels nervous.

                                 HEATHER
                        I think it was incredibly sweet of 
                        him.  Those pictures mean a lot.

                        you ever seen a heterosexual man with

                        return the pictures.

                        Okay, am I the only one who thinks 
                        his behavior violates some kind of 
                        stalking law?

                        He doesn’t look like a stalker.  He 
                        has friendly eyes.

                        I don’t know.  The way he arranged 
                        the pictures so carefully in the 
                        photo album is a little creepy.

                        You’re all just so used to guys being 
                        dicks, that when one does something 
                        genuinely nice you don’t know how to 
                        react.

                        Nice would have been calling to tell 
                        you he had your pictures.  Nice would 
                        have been dropping the pictures in 
                        the mail.  Driving fourteen hours to

                        Maybe he was bored in Crystal Bay, 
                        and had nothing better to do.  Maybe 
                        he was passing by this way anyway.  
                        Or maybe he has a friend that goes to 
                        this school.

                        I am not naive.  Contrary to your

                        Yeah, you’ve been around the block in 
                        Idaho.  Seriously, what’s happening 
                        on that block?  I thought one of the 
                        reasons we went to Crystal Bay was to 
                        party and forget your ex-boyfriend.  
                        It took ‘til the end of the trip for 
                        you to go home with a guy and you 
                        didn’t even sleep with him.

                        felt like you were the most

                        Wow.  That was an unexpectedly candid

                        what they want and people who accept 
                        whatever life offers them.  I’ve been 
                        staring at those pictures of you for 
                        a month.  I’m infatuated.  As 
                        pathetic as I feel telling you that, 
                        I’d be even more pathetic if I didn’t 
                        tell you.

                        you want you can’t only go after what 
                        you know you can get. You have to go 
                        after the things you probably can’t 
                        get; because the only way you’ll know 
                        for sure is if you try.

                        Thank you for letting me down gently.
                      (stands)
                        Have a nice... life.

                      (surprised)
                        Is that it? 

                                 SAWYER
                        I think so.

                                 HEATHER
                        You’ve been infatuated with me for a 
                        month, you went to all kinds of 
                        trouble to figure out who I was, you 
                        came all this way and that’s it?  
                        That was pretty half-hearted.  I mean 
                        I respect the effort on the first 
                        half but you have no follow through.

                                 SAWYER
                        I needed to prove to myself that I 
                        could look in the eyes of a beautiful 
                        girl who is seemingly unattainable 
                        and tell her that I’m attracted to 
                        her.  I did it.  I don’t expect you 
                        to be interested in me.  You’re way 
                        out of my league. 

                                 HEATHER
                        You don’t even know me.  Maybe you’re 
                        out of my league.

                                 SAWYER
                        C’mon, you’re an incredibly hot 
                        college girl.  I’m, at best, average 
                        looking, and barely passing Algebra 
                        Two. At least I know I took a chance.

                                 HEATHER
                        Can I tell you something?  I think 
                        you’re about to squander a major 
                        opportunity.  Look at it from my 
                        perspective.  This mysterious younger 
                        guy shows up at my sorority.  I treat 
                        him like shit because I’m drunk and 
                        angry at my ex.  Then I realize that 
                        he brought me something I thought I 
                        had lost forever.

                        Pictures of me and my best friend on 
                        our last vacation together. So I’m 
                        feeling guilty and grateful.  Next I 
                        find out that this mysterious guy has 
                        been staring at these pictures and he 
                        can’t stop thinking about me.  Now 
                        I’m feeling guilty and grateful and 
                        desired.  Not desired in a drunk frat 
                        boy, ‘I wanna nail you before I throw 
                        up and pass out’ kinda way.  But 
                        desired in a romantic ‘of all the 
                        girls I’ve ever seen there’s 
                        something about you that made me 
                        drive a thousand miles, to risk 
                        potential embarrassment and 
                        heartbreak just to let you know how 
                        you make me feel’ kinda way.  Now I 
                        don’t wanna mislead you. Even if you 
                        turn out to be the greatest guy ever, 
                        I don’t want a boyfriend, but... Have 
                        some faith in yourself.  Figure that 
                        I’m going to like you a little more 
                        every minute that you’re here.  And 
                        stay for a while.

           Heather smiles.  She motions with her head, inviting Sawyer 
           back in the house, then she walks inside.  Sawyer doesn’t 
           move for a very long time.  Finally he goes into the house.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. REBECCA’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Rebecca sleeps peacefully.  Her eyes open as soon as her 
           alarm clock sounds.

           INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

           Half awake, Rebecca stumbles out of her bedroom and makes her 
           way to the bathroom door.  It’s closed.  She tries the knob 
           but it’s locked.  She looks confused.

           INT. BATHROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Wrapped in a towel, Sawyer brushes his teeth.  He casually 
           rinses and spits.

                                 SAWYER
                        I’m in here.

                        Sawyer?
                      (calling out)
                        Mom, Sawyer’s back!
                      (to Sawyer)
                        Sawyer, I have to pee really bad.

                                 SAWYER
                        Sucks doesn’t it?  I suggest going 
                        out the window.

           Laura and Chuck arrive outside the door.  They seem relieved 
           that Sawyer is back.

                                 CHUCK
                        Sawyer?

                                 LAURA
                        Baby, are you home?

                                 SAWYER
                        Yes, mom.  I’m home.

                                 LAURA
                        We were so worried about you.  Open 
                        the door.

           Sawyer opens the door.  His mom hugs him.

           INT. VOLKSWAGEN - DAY

           Sawyer drives.  Mickey rides shotgun.  Andrew is in the back.  
           They’re all wearing their beach clothes.

                                 ANDREW
                        So they gave you the car?

                                 SAWYER
                        They said I can use it until my 
                        sister passes her driving test.

                                 ANDREW
                        And you got out of being grounded?

                                 SAWYER
                        I had a long talk with my parents.

                                 MICKEY
                        Forget about that.  I wanna hear 
                        about Heather.  Did you bang her? 

                                 SAWYER
                        It wasn’t about sex, Mickey.

                        You didn’t even talk to her, did you?  
                        You probably just left the pictures 
                        on the door step and ran away.  I 
                        mean no offense when I say: “Once a 
                        pussy, always a pussy.”

                                 ANDREW
                        He was gone for four days.  Even if 
                        you include driving time that leaves 
                        three days unaccounted for.

                                 ANDREW
                        You did have sex with her.

                                 SAWYER
                        I didn’t say that.

           Sawyer smiles.  Mickey and Andrew look stunned.

           I/E. VOLKSWAGEN/BEACH DRIVE - CONTINUOUS

           Sawyer and the guys cruise along.  It’s a busy day.   

                                 MICKEY
                        I want details.  I want very, very 
                        specific details.

                                 SAWYER
                        I’m sorry but some things just have 
                        to be private.

                                 MICKEY
                        You son of a bitch.  I can’t believe 
                        you got laid before me.  

                                 SAWYER
                        I didn’t say I got laid. 

                                 ANDREW
                        But you didn’t say you didn’t.  You 
                        would say if you didn’t.  You 
                        wouldn’t take credit for something 
                        that didn’t happen.

                                 MICKEY
                        I can’t believe you got laid before 
                        me.  I woulda bet two inches of dick

                        I even thought Andrew would come out 
                        of the closet before you got any.

                                 ANDREW
                      (to Sawyer)
                        You told him that I might be gay?!

                                 SAWYER
                        No.

                                 MICKEY
                        What do you mean might be gay? There 
                        is no mystery, Andrew. You’re gay.

                                 ANDREW
                        Are you sure?

                                 SAWYER
                        You’re gonna take his word for it?  
                        That’s really something you need to 
                        figure out for yourself.

                                 ANDREW
                        Maybe I’m bi. That’s possible, right?

                                 MICKEY
                        That’s it.  I’m getting laid today.  
                        No more fucking around.  Find a god 
                        damn parking spot.  There’s gotta be 
                        some bitch on the beach who’ll have 
                        sex with me.

           Mickey spots a Pretty Girl in a bikini.  With her back to the 
           guys, she’s buying a frozen lemonade from a STREET VENDOR.

                                 MICKEY
                        Check that out.  Hottie at four 
                        o’clock.

                                 ANDREW
                        That’s ten o’clock.

                                 MICKEY
                        Whatever, homo.

                                 ANDREW
                        That’s not funny.  

           Sawyer rolls to a stop in traffic.  Mickey looks at the girl 
           and then at Andrew, slyly.

           the car.  The pretty girl turns to look and we realize that 
           it’s Marcy.  

           She sees Sawyer and smiles.  Sawyer is surprised.  

                                 MARCY
                      (calling out;playful)
                        I know for a fact that that’s not 
                        true.

           Mickey and Andrew are still ducking down.

                                 MICKEY
                        What did she say?

                                 SAWYER
                        Park the car for me.

           Sawyer gets out and darts across the street.

                                 MICKEY
                        But I don’t know how to drive stick.

           EXT. BEACH WALK - THAT MOMENT

           Sawyer joins Marcy.  She hugs him.  They walk.

                                 MARCY
                        When did you get back?

           He steals a sip of her frozen lemonade.

                                 SAWYER
                        This morning.

                                 MARCY
                        How did it go?

                                 SAWYER
                        It went well.

                                 MARCY
                        So it was worth it.  What happened? 
                        Are you gonna see her again?

                                 SAWYER
                        No.  Marcy, I really appreciate 
                        everything you did for me.  I will

                        Good.

           They stare at each other for a moment.

                                 MARCY
                        Sawyer, I have to get something off 
                        my chest.

                                 SAWYER
                        Okay.

                                 MARCY
                        You know when we were younger I had a 
                        huge crush on you.

                                 SAWYER
                        You did?

                                 MARCY
                        Yeah. I mean, I’ve been totally over 
                        it for years but I feel like a bit of 
                        a hypocrite.  I was pushing you so 
                        hard to talk to Heather when I never 
                        had the guts to tell you how I felt.

                                 SAWYER
                        But you’re completely over me now?

                                 MARCY
                        Yeah.  You can only torture yourself 
                        for so long.

                                 SAWYER
                        Now that you’re hot and everything, 
                        you no longer have any interest.

                                 MARCY
                        Does that bother you?  Now that I’m 
                        thin and I have breasts are you 
                        interested in me?

                                 SAWYER
                        No.  We’re best friends.

           Mickey and Andrew arrive.

                                 MICKEY
                      (to Marcy)
                        God damn you look good in that 
                        bathing suit.  Is it okay if I 
                        picture you when I masturbate?

                        You sure know how to charm a girl.

           As Mickey, Andrew and Marcy continue walking and joking, 
           Sawyer turns to us.

                                 SAWYER
                        You’re probably curious what really 
                        happened with Heather. I know I would 
                        be curious if I were you...  I’m not 
                        gonna tell.  Mark Twain once said: 
                        “All you need in this life is 
                        ignorance and confidence, and then 
                        success is sure.”  What he meant was, 
                        people who think too much and worry 
                        too much don’t take chances.  And if 
                        you don’t take chances you’ve already 
                        failed.

           Marcy approaches Sawyer.  She seems to notice us.  She looks 
           into CAMERA, confused.

                                 SAWYER
                        What are you looking at?

                                 MARCY
                        I don’t know. I thought I saw 
                        something.

           She tries to look closer.  Sawyer joins her, squinting at us.

                        I don’t see anything.
                      (he winks at us)
                        C’mon.

           Sawyer puts his arm around Marcy as they walk away from us, 
           down the beach.  

                                 MARCY
                        Now that you know that I once liked 
                        you, you’re gonna be fine just being 
                        friends?

                                 SAWYER
                        Of course.  I value what we have.

                                 MARCY
                        Me too.  We wouldn’t wanna ruin it.

                                 SAWYER
                        No.  Although then I would have a 
                        best friend who also gave me oral.

                        So you would be my boyfriend just so 
                        you could get blow jobs?

                                 SAWYER
                        I didn’t mean it that way.  What I 
                        meant was the only difference between 
                        being your best friend and being your 
                        boyfriend is the... Never mind, I’m 
                        digging myself a hole. You wanna go 
                        to the movies tonight?

                                 MARCY
                        You mean as friends.

                                 SAWYER
                        Yes as friends. What’s the 
                        difference?

                                 MARCY
                        According to you the difference is 
                        when the movie’s over you don’t get a 
                        blow job.

                                 SAWYER
                        That’s okay because I’m looking for a 
                        girl who’s ready to go all the way.

                                 MARCY
                        So you’ll wanna date me when I’m 
                        ready to have sex?

                                 SAWYER
                        Maybe.  As long as you don’t practice 
                        with Mickey first.

                                                           FADE OUT.
