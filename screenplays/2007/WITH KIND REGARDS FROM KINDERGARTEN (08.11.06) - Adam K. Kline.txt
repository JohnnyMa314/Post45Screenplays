                         "WITH KIND REGARDS FROM KINDERGARTEN"

                                                               FADE IN:

           INT. MADELINE'S HOUSE - MORNING

           A thirty-something couple, MADELINE'S MOM and DAD, frets
           silently in the kitchen of their comfortable suburban
           home. The Mom stands, arms crossed, while the Dad paces in
           obvious distress, glancing nervously at his watch. Both
           are dressed for work.

           When the doorbell rings, the couple races frantically for
           the front door, nearly tripping over each other in the
           process.

           They open the door to reveal MADELINE'S GRANDMOTHER and
           GRANDFATHER. Both appear terribly worried, though it's
           somewhat more profound in the case of the Grandmother,
           largely because she's younger and more energetic than her
           husband.

           (NOTE: Madeline's Grandfather, while handsome and
           endearing, appears very old indeed.)

           The younger couple has clearly called the older one for
           help.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        What is it?  What's wrong? Where's
                        Madeline?

                                 MOM
                        Upstairs.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Chicken pox.

           Madeline's Mom and Dad suddenly seem rather embarrassed.

                                 MOM
                        No.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Inflammatory bowel syndrome? I
                        shouldn't be surprised. Your bowels
                        were unusually fiery at that age.

                                 MOM
                        No.
                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Well, if she's lost that doll
                        again, I say good riddance. Blonde
                        bimbo. And poor Ken. This is a
                        progressive household.  If Ken
                        thinks he'd be happier with another
                        Ken...

                                 MOM
                        She's afraid of kindergarten.

           The Grandmother and Grandfather allow their surprise to
           register, then smile knowingly at each other and breathe a
           collective sigh of relief. As his wife heads nonchalantly
           for the kitchen, the Grandfather plants himself in a
           comfortable armchair to listen.

                                 MOM
                        Mom! This is day one! Clock's
                        ticking!

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        One's first encounter with
                        kindergarten is an intimidating
                        prospect.  Some of us soil
                        ourselves at the very thought...

           The Grandmother looks over the tops of her glasses at her
           daughter.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        ... As I recall.

           Madeline's Mom frowns with shame, and the Grandfather
           smiles wryly.

                                 DAD
                        I can't understand it. She's tested
                        in all the highest percentiles.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Well for heaven's sake, she's just
                        a little girl.

                                 MOM
                        A little girl with school today.

                                 DAD
                        All the highest percentiles. The
                        pediatrician was very impressed.

           The Grandmother summons her patience and rolls her eyes
           just slightly.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Alright. If we're going to do this,
                        we're going to do it my way. And if
                        you don't like my methods, just
                        stand aside and keep quiet.  I'm a
                        fully licensed grandmother, and I'm
                        not to be trifled with. You.

           The Dad straightens in military fashion, confused but more
           than ready to obey.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        I need tempting smells wafting
                        invitingly up the stairs. This
                        means pancakes.  This means bacon.

           Madeline's Dad is briefly at a loss, but then it occurs to
           him:

                                 DAD
                              (enthusiastically)
                        We have soysage.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Soysage?

                                 DAD
                        It's soy... sausage. Soysage.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Amateur!  Car. Store. Bacon. Now.
                        Go.

           The Grandmother shoos her son-in-law out the door, then
           turns to her daughter.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        You.  Water.  Boil. Tea. Black
                        darjeeling if you've got it, dear.

                                 MOM
                        My job is to make you tea?

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        My way or the highway! Oh, and just
                        a hint of lemon, sweetheart.

                                 MOM
                        Yes, mother.

           The Grandmother spins to face her husband.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        And you!

           The Grandfather is fast asleep in his comfy chair, snoring
           heavily.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                              (softening)
                        You... sleep comfortably. Snore if
                        you like.

           The Grandfather scratches himself in rather an unseemly
           fashion.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        And feel free to scratch where it
                        itches. I'm going in.

           INT. MADELINE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Madeline's room reflects the typical tastes and toys of a
           six-year-old, including a vacuous Barbie and effeminate
           Ken. Madeline, however, is nowhere to be seen, as she's
           constructed an impressive fortress of pillows and blankets
           on her bed.

           When there's a knock at the door, Madeline's eyes appear
           just briefly from within the fort, then disappear. The
           Grandmother waits politely, then enters. She pulls a
           child's chair to the bedside and lowers herself comically,
           careful not to spill her cup of tea.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        What a pity Madeline isn't here.

           Madeline's eyes appear again.

                                 MADELINE
                        Hello.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Oh my goodness! There's someone
                        here after all.

                                 MADELINE
                        It's me.  It's Madeline.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        So you claim. But I'm not so sure.
                        The Madeline I know is a great
                        proponent of hugs.

           Madeline scurries out of the fort, hugs her Grandmother,
           and quickly scurries back in. Grandmother waits a beat
           before speaking, choosing her words with care.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        I understand that someone has her
                        very first day of school today.

           Madeline peeks her head out, and there she remains for the
           duration of the conversation.

                                 MADELINE
                        I'm not going.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        I see.

                                 MADELINE
                        Mom and Dad will drop me off, and
                        I'll be all alone. Without any
                        friends or anything.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Such a dreary outlook. It seems
                        like rather an adventure to me.

                                 MADELINE
                        Well you see, I'm a pessimist,
                        which is a person who assumes the
                        worst.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        That's a very big word for such a
                        little girl.

                                 MADELINE
                        I'm a pessimist. I heard Dad tell
                        Mom.
                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Then it must be true.

                                 MADELINE
                        I'm afraid so.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        You know, I would imagine that a
                        little girl with such a remarkable
                        vocabulary would know the true
                        meaning of the word "kindergarten."

                                 MADELINE
                        Of course!  It's German. It means
                        "children's garden." But we drove
                        by my kindergarten yesterday, and
                        there wasn't a garden anywhere. The
                        garden was a ruse, which is a way
                        to fool someone.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Oh, I'm terribly sorry. But that's
                        not right at all.

                                 MADELINE
                        Oh yes it is. I have conducted
                        extensive research.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Ah. Well, since you know so much,
                        you certainly have no interest
                        whatsoever in a secret.

                                 MADELINE
                        Is this some sort of ruse?

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Certainly not. I'm your
                        Grandmother.

                                 MADELINE
                        Well, maybe you should tell me the
                        secret.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        And why should I?

                                 MADELINE
                        Because I love secrets!
                                 GRANDMOTHER
                              (conspiratorially)
                        So do I!  And this particular
                        secret, I must say, is an awfully
                        good one indeed.

                                 MADELINE
                        Tell!

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                              (nearly whispering)
                        "Kindergarten" is a name, the name
                        of a very special man: Karlheinz
                        Copernicus Indergarten, or K.
                        Indergarten. You see? And Mr. K.
                        Indergarten was responsible for the
                        very first school for children your
                        age.

                                 MADELINE
                        I don't believe you.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        We have established that you are a
                        pessimist.  Now shall I continue or
                        not?

                                 MADELINE
                        Yes, but please understand that I
                        have reservations.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Oh, my dear Madeline. Everyone has
                        reservations about kindergarten --
                        at first.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. VILLAGE (PRE-1920'S) - MORNING

           As the Grandmother's tale begins, we're given a visual
           tour of an anonymous, European village by the sea,
           sometime in the early 1900's.

           (NOTE: the village is an amalgamation of the most
           wonderful sorts of small European towns: partly British,
           partly German, et cetera.  Everyone speaks English, but
           the village is not necessarily in England.)
           SERIES OF SHOTS

           A) Ships of various sizes approach a bustling harbor.

           B) Horse-drawn carts and carriages clatter pleasantly on
           clean cobblestone streets.

           C) Children smell hot goodies from a tiny bakery.

           D) Old, bearded men grin at each other as they sneak an
           early pint of dark beer.

           E) A delighted boy tosses a stick for a friendly dog twice
           his size.

           DURING THE ABOVE:

                                 GRANDMOTHER V.O.
                        It was in the old country, in a
                        little village by the sea, where
                        horses' hooves clippety-clopped
                        along the most magnificent
                        cobblestone streets. The smell of
                        fresh boysenberry scones was in the
                        air, and twinkly-eyed old men were
                        clinking pints at the pub.
                        Everywhere you'd turn, there was a
                        big, slobbery dog with a stick just
                        right for throwing. And in the
                        midst of it all was Miss
                        Understood's Preparatory School and
                        Home for Orphaned Children, which
                        was a modest sort of school, but
                        cheerful and cozy all the same.

                                 GRANDMOTHER (V.O.)
                        And this is where the village
                        children came to learn, you see.
                        And oh, the lovely Miss Understood.
                        Such a generous soul -- and quite a
                        gifted teacher of young minds,
                        though stymied occasionally by the
                        hardships of translation.

           INT. ORPHANAGE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           MISS UNDERSTOOD, a kindly and rather attractive young
           schoolteacher, goes from bed to bed, rousing the children
           with her signature mix of German proverbs and their often
           muddled translations.

           (NOTE: Miss Understood maintains a thick German accent
           throughout.)

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Der frühe Vogel erhält die
                        Endlosschraube, children! The early
                        nerd gets the worm!

           Two kids look at each other and shrug.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           A) We see the largest, most perfect oak tree imaginable.

           B) Two fat men walk by the tree's trunk, which dwarfs
           them.

           C) A group of old people in lawn chairs doze, breathing as
           one.

           D) A strapping young man pats the tree lovingly.

           DURING THE ABOVE:

                                 GRANDMOTHER V.O.
                        But in all the village -- and
                        indeed for miles and miles well
                        beyond that --one marvel surpassed
                        all else -- even the scones. And
                        that was the tree, great, great
                        grand-daddy to every ancient oak as
                        far as the eye could see -- and
                        farther. Its trunk was as thick as
                        twenty fat men, and it had been
                        that way as long as even the eldest
                        villagers could remember.  Older
                        folks would snooze beneath its
                        bows, and even brave men found a
                        certain reassurance in its
                        strength. But the children loved it
                        best, and with good reason. For the
                        lowest branches formed a sort of
                        stair, positively irresistible to
                        anyone with an inclination to
                        climb.  And because the tree was
                        conveniently located at the very
                        center of the park, at the very
                        center of town, directly across the
                        street from Miss Understood's
                        school, this stair saw a great deal
                        of traffic indeed.

           Children sprint toward the tree from every direction,
           crying with glee as the giant oak glows in the sun.

           Miss Understood appears at the door of her school and
           orphanage, a delighted six-year-old boy holding each of
           her hands. One is KARLHEINZ INDERGARTEN, the other LEOPOLD
           CROAK.

                                 GRANDMOTHER (V.O.)
                        But among all the village children,
                        there were none who loved the tree
                        more than Karlheinz Indergarten and
                        Leopold Croak.  The two were the
                        closest of friends, and in the
                        devoted care of Miss Understood.
                        For both had lost their moms and
                        dads. But when the sun shone on
                        their mighty tree, they hadn't a
                        care in the world. For while there
                        were many things the children
                        didn't have, what they did have was
                        the greatest thing of all. And that
                        was imagination.

           Miss Understood stoops to eye-level with the boys.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Und so. What is your tree today? An
                        enchanted castle, perhaps?

           As the boys eye the tree, it transforms before them,
           becoming a massive medieval castle, complete with moat. A
           WIZARD on the ramparts raises an eyebrow in question, as
           if to inquire, "Will this do?"
                                 KARLHEINZ
                        No, not today.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Hmm. Then it must be a Himalayan
                        peak, shrouded in mystery und fear.

           As the boys again eye the tree, it becomes a mountain of
           epic proportion, bombarded by a horrific blizzard. From a
           narrow rope near the summit hangs a SHERPA, laden with
           gear, who smiles and beckons the children with a wave.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        I don't think so.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Then there can be only one answer!
                        It is a giant, my dear ones!  Und
                        his belly craves ze bones of two
                        little boys!

           As Karl and Leopold stare up at the tree, it morphs into
           an enormous GIANT, with wicked-looking boots and a cruel,
           studded club.  The giant roars with rage, stomping about
           and shaking the earth, then looks almost bashfully at the
           boys, as if he's begging them to come play -- or
           auditioning.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        No.

           Karl and Miss Understood turn to look at Leopold.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        It's a pirate ship.

           Karl follows Leopold's gaze and sees a vast expanse of
           ocean before him, with a perfect pirate ship floating in
           the middle.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Well shiver me timbers.

           As the two boys sprint across the lawn toward the tree,
           Miss Understood looks toward the harbor -- and the real
           ocean. Far away, she sees a dark storm brewing -- and
           frowns.

           EXT. PIRATE SHIP - CONTINUOUS
           Karl and Leopold, now clad in perfect pirate gear, ascend
           a rope ladder and board their warship. Once on deck, Karl
           assumes the role of captain.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Avast, me hearties! You there!
                        Slack off the main-sheet! Let over
                        the jib! Take in the boom-tackles!
                        Coil the halyards and gasket the
                        foresail!

                                 LEOPOLD
                        I'll not, Cap'n, until you've found
                        your manners.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Scurvy dog!  Obey, or you'll have
                        no grog tonight!

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Ain't seen land for weeks, Cap'n,
                        nor treasure neither. And there's
                        talk you ain't fit to lead.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Impudent wretch! Why, I'll lash ye
                        to the mizzenmast and tan your
                        mutinous hide!

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Me and the crew thinks otherwise,
                        Cap'n.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        What crew?

           An entire crew of hardened, fearsome pirates appear at
           Leopold's back, courtesy of the boys' exceptional
           imaginations.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        This crew.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Motherless devils! To the death!

           Karl draws his sword, even as Leopold and the crew cry
           their battle cries.
           As pirates storm the upper deck, Karl swings on a loose
           rope, in pursuit of Leopold. Lightning flashes above, and
           the rain begins.

           As Karl chases Leopold, he's forced to deal with the
           pirates, grown and muscular men. But with skillful
           swordplay, Karl knocks the men overboard or evades their
           attacks completely --never actually killing anyone.

           Karl and Leopold scale the rigging and fight courageously.
           At one point, they both pause to watch a butterfly float
           between them -- a sign of reality, within the tree itself.

           They continue their swashbuckling in the grand style of
           Errol Flynn and again pause, as the two step carefully
           over a robin's nest, filled with bright blue eggs --
           another sign of reality.

           As the rain intensifies, Karl dispatches more pirates, all
           the while herding Leopold toward the dreaded plank.

           Finally, with dozens of pirates incapacitated and moaning,
           Karl forces Leopold onto the plank, driving him toward its
           edge. The plank wobbles and bows, and Leopold struggles to
           maintain his balance. The rain washes over them in
           torrents.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Now yield, brazen scum, or face the
                        terrors of the deep!

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Never!

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Rain drenching her, Miss Understood stands at the edge of
           the park, calling desperately for the children to come in.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Come in, children, come in!
                        Irgendein Tor in einem Strum! Any
                        wart in a storm!

           But her voice barely reaches them above the storm, the
           words carried through the wind as only a baleful wailing.

           EXT. PIRATE SHIP - CONTINUOUS

           The wailing sound reaches the boys.
                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Do ye hear the sirens' cries? They
                        call for thy doom!

           Leopold backs toward the edge of the plank as Karl mounts
           it, brandishing his sword before him. And with a final
           thrust, Karl knocks Leopold's sword from his hand. Leopold
           stares down at the waters beneath him, teeming with
           sharks.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Cap'n, I am defeated. And I hereby
                        swear allegiance, with apologies
                        for me and my mates. It's just, I
                        miss me girl, Cap'n. And the little
                        ones at home.

           The scene immediately returns to reality, and the two boys
           stand several yards apart on a thick tree limb. Karl
           wields a stick, which he's been using as a sword, and
           lowers it.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        A girl?  Yuck!

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Sorry. It just slipped out.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Doesn't matter. That was a good
                        one!

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Aye aye, Cap'n. It surely was.

           As the two friends smile at one another, a massive bolt of
           LIGHTNING strikes Leopold with a thunderous CRACK,
           knocking him to the ground far below.

           Karl is shocked and frightened, unsure of what to do. He
           gazes down at his unconscious friend and struggles not to
           cry, even as Miss Understood comes rushing to Leopold's
           side.

           INT. PIMPLEDINK'S CLINIC - LATER

           Karl and Miss Understood, their faces fraught with worry,
           sit in a corner of DR. PIMPLEDINK'S small examining room.
           Dr. Pimpledink, the town's rotund and largely ineffective
           physician, is a kind and caring man -- with a touching
           bedside manner.

           Karl attempts a reassuring smile at Leopold, who sits
           without expression on an examining table.

           Pimpledink listens at Leopold's chest with a stethoscope.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        Mm hmm.

           Pimpledink peers down Leopold's throat with a tongue
           compressor.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        Mm hmm.

           Pimpledink tests a variety of Leopold's reflexes and
           performs assorted physical exams. When finished, the
           doctor turns to the pair in the corner with pride and
           relief.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        Ah ha. Yes.  Healthy as a horse!

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Und you are certain?

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        He's well within all the highest
                        percentiles for a boy his age. I'm
                        very impressed.

           Miss Understood approaches Leopold and looks hard into his
           eyes.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        He looks... different.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        Mmm?

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        He looks... older.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        Well. Yes.  Hmm. Perhaps there is
                        something… half a moment.
           Pimpledink rustles through a drawer and removes a stack of
           papers, then sits next to Leopold.

           When he holds up a sheet, we see that it's a Rorschach
           test, obviously shaped like a butterfly.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        Tell me, Leopold, my young friend.
                        What do you see?

           All wait in suspense while Leopold considers.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        An ink blot.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        I see. And this one?

                                 LEOPOLD
                        An ink blot.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        Yes... and this one.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        An ink blot.

           Pimpledink frowns with sadness and concern. He strides to
           a cabinet and removes a large, leather-bound medical
           journal, which he rustles through, pointing at passages
           with his fingers, mumbling, and continuing to frown in
           distress.

           Pimpledink sighs, eyes Leopold doubtfully, and turns to
           Miss Understood.

           When he pulls the schoolteacher into the hall, Karl can
           both see and hear them through a crack in the door.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        I'm afraid this is rather grave. It
                        appears... well you see... it
                        appears this little boy has lost
                        his imagination.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        But you will fix him.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        Oh no. It's impossible to fix a
                        broken imagination. The condition
                        is quite incurable, I'm afraid.

           INT. ORPHANAGE BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Miss Understood watches as the children prepare for bed,
           poking each other and otherwise stalling as children do.
           Leopold, however, simply puts on his nightshirt, crawls
           into bed, and stares blankly at the ceiling.

           Karl turns to Miss Understood with a questioning look, and
           Miss Understood attempts a reassuring smile,
           unsuccessfully.

           INT. ORPHANAGE DINING HALL - MORNING

           Miss Understood watches as all her children eat their
           porridge at breakfast. Most are giggling and otherwise
           horsing around, which Miss Understood tolerates. But
           Leopold eats like some sort of automaton, staring blankly
           at the wall.

           Karl, never touching his own food, watches Leopold with a
           mix of fear and despair, which Miss Understood notes with
           concern.

           EXT. ORPHANAGE - LATER

           As children run and frolic in the park, Leopold stands
           calmly by himself, doing nothing.

           Miss Understood watches as Karl, hesitant and afraid,
           approaches his friend.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Hello.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Hello.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Would you like to play in our tree
                        today?

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Why?
           Karl turns to Miss Understood. Things are not going as he
           had hoped.  But she nods her encouragement, so Karl tries
           again.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Well, it needn't be just a tree,
                        you know. It might be a circus
                        tent. Or a great wooly mammoth. Or
                        an impenetrable bank, far away in
                        the wild American West. Would you
                        like to rob a bank with me?

           Karl and Miss Understood await Leopold's response.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        But it's just a tree.

           Leopold turns to Miss Understood.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        May I practice my arithmetic?

           Miss Understood is on the verge of tears and can't speak,
           but she nods her head, and Leopold calmly walks inside.
           The woman turns to Karl, who looks back at her in tragic
           dismay.

           INT. ORPHANAGE - LATER

           As a light rain falls outside, Karl sits quietly, forlorn.
           Miss Understood also sits, watching Karl. A light knock at
           the door sounds, and Miss Understood walks to the far end
           of the room to answer.

           She admits an elderly CLOCKMAKER, with his hands in his
           pockets.  They speak in low tones, clearly about Karl,
           then approach him.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Karl, I have someone I'd like you
                        to meet.

           Karl says nothing, and Miss Understood stands aside.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        Hello, Karl.

           Karl still says nothing, and the Clockmaker looks at Miss
           Understood questioningly before speaking again.
                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        Karl, I wonder if I might see your
                        hands. You know, you can tell a lot
                        about someone by looking at their
                        hands.

           Karl slowly presents his hands, uncaring.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        Ah. Slender fingers. This is good.
                        And very clean. These are good
                        hands, very good.  These are hands
                        a boy can be proud of.

           Karl looks at his hands, then at the Clockmaker.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        I am a great expert on hands. And
                        perhaps you wonder why.

           Karl says nothing. The Clockmaker removes his hands from
           his pockets to reveal gnarled, immobile fingers. His hands
           are riddled with savage arthritis.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        Because mine no longer work.

           Karl gazes at the old man's hands and hesitates before
           speaking.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        I've lost my best friend.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        It isn't easy to be without a
                        friend. Perhaps what you need... is
                        a new one.

           The old man extends a gnarled hand to Karl, and Karl looks
           to Miss Understood for guidance.

           She nods, approving the friendship, and Karl places his
           perfect, tiny hand in the Clockmaker's.

           EXT. ORPHANAGE - LATER

           Miss Understood and Leopold watch in silence as the
           Clockmaker and Karl ride away.  As the old horse carries
           them into the distance, Karl turns to look once more upon
           his teacher and friend.  Miss Understood waves to him
           sadly, but Leopold does not.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                              (to herself)
                        Zeit heilt alle Wunden. Time heals
                        all wounds.

           EXT. CLOCKMAKER'S WORKSHOP - MORNING

           The Clockmaker's workshop is far, far away from Karl's
           village, perched atop a hill in the country  with nothing
           else in sight. A tiny dirt road winds through the trees to
           its front door.

           During this shot, we can hear clocks TICKING.

           (NOTE: this shot merely serves to show that Karl is
           tremendously far from home.)

           INT. CLOCKMAKER'S WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Little Karl sits at the Clockmaker's workbench, atop a
           tall stool. All around him, covering every inch of the
           walls, are innumerable clocks, ticking away.

           A tall grandfather clock makes an especially impressive
           tick-tock, and Karl watches the pendulum, mesmerized. When
           the Clockmaker enters and sits on his own stool, he smiles
           at Karl's interest.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        A most impressive chronometer. Very
                        big, for very important people.
                        Very important people always think
                        bigger is better.  "Time is money,
                        time is money.  Look, everyone!
                        Look at me! Look how important I
                        am!"

           Karl says nothing.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        But time is not money.

           The Clockmaker struggles to open a drawer with his
           arthritic hands, so Karl helps him. Inside are
           wristwatches, each with the back removed to show their
           tiny moving gears. In fact, the entire velvet-lined drawer
           seems alive with movement.
           Karl carefully picks one up, and the two regard its
           intricacies.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        Time is magic.

           The Clockmaker places Karl's little hand in his own, which
           seems infinitely larger in comparison.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        And bigger is seldom better.  It's
                        the little things that have the
                        most potential.

           The Clockmaker gestures to a small, brown paper package,
           which Karl unwraps.  In it is a small leather case, and
           engraved in the leather are the letters "K. Indergarten."
           The boy opens the case to reveal a set of tiny jeweler's
           tools.

           Karl looks up at the Clockmaker with just a hint of
           pleasure, and we feel a renewed sense of hope.

           The bell rings at the front of the shop, and the
           Clockmaker walks through a narrow hallway to the front
           counter, where a wealthy, elderly woman awaits -- MRS.
           PERCY GOODNIGHT. On the counter she places a marvelously
           ornate clock, suitable for the mantel in a highly affluent
           home.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        Mrs. Goodnight. Good morning.

                                 MRS. GOODNIGHT
                        Is it?

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        Good?

                                 MRS. GOODNIGHT
                        Morning.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        It is indeed.

                                 MRS. GOODNIGHT
                        I wouldn't know.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        This is something we shall have to
                        remedy.

                                 MRS. GOODNIGHT
                        Such is my hope. Sir Percy insists
                        upon a highball at precisely five
                        o'clock.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        And your clock is not precise.

                                 MRS. GOODNIGHT
                        Precisely.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        Then it's time I got to work. Good
                        day, Mrs....

                                 MRS. GOODNIGHT
                        Good day.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        ... Goodnight.

           Mrs. Goodnight exits the shop, and the Clockmaker chuckles
           to himself. He then winces in pain, rubbing his hands. He
           nobly ignores the hurt and picks up the clock.

           But as he turns, his awkward hands suffer another painful
           SPASM, and he drops the clock, which SHATTERS in thousands
           of pieces, ruined irreparably.

           The Clockmaker gazes at the tiny cogs and gears, then
           looks up to find Karl peeking at him from the doorframe of
           the workshop.

           The Clockmaker and Karl regard each other, and the
           Clockmaker stares sadly at his hands, then bows his head,
           defeated, and ascends the stairs to his bedroom -- to
           mourn the cruelty of age.

           Karl looks down at his feet, where one of hundreds of tiny
           cogs has rolled. He picks it up, and his eyes narrow
           slightly in thought.

           INT. CLOCKMAKER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

           The following morning, the Clockmaker awakens to the sound
           of an unfamiliar chime. Lying in bed, he squints in
           puzzlement.
                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        I don't know that chime.

           The Clockmaker puts on his spectacles and slippers in
           something of a rush, curiosity driving him downstairs.

           INT. CLOCKMAKER'S WORKSHOP - MORNING

           The Clockmaker creeps into the workshop, where Karl is
           seated astride his stool.  Before Karl is Mrs. Goodnight's
           clock, repaired in full.  With his tiny tools, Karl seems
           to be putting the finishing touches on the job.

           The six-year-old has performed the impossible, and the
           Clockmaker is dumbfounded. He slowly sits on his own
           stool, his eyes never leaving Karl.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        You have done this?

           Karl beams and nods, then continues with his minor
           tinkering.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        And how exactly? Tell me at once.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        I had to take apart some other
                        clocks first, to see how they
                        worked.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                              (amazed)
                        What!

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Please don't be angry! I put them
                        back together!

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        Which clocks?

           Karl points to half a dozen incredibly complex clocks as
           he speaks.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                              (bashfully)
                        This one.  And this one. And this
                        one. And these.
           The ticking of the clocks seems louder as the Clockmaker
           considers things. He nearly speaks, then thinks better of
           it. Instead, he rises. And from a secret hiding place, he
           struggles to withdraw an ornate wooden box, which he
           places before Karl.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        Open it.

           Karl opens the box to reveal the most spectacularly
           intricate pocket watch ever conceived. The entire back is
           clear, encased in crystal, so that Karl can appreciate the
           inner workings in all their splendor. Obviously, it is the
           old man's greatest treasure.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        My masterpiece.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        It's perfect!

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        Ha! No, nothing is perfect. But it
                        is very close.

           Karl inspects the timepiece very closely.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        It's wonderful. It's the most
                        wonderful thing imaginable.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        No, Karl.

           The Clockmaker touches Karl's forehead, pointing at his
           brain.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        This is.

           INT. CLOCKMAKER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Several years pass. And when the Clockmaker arises this
           time, it's apparent that he's aged. He yawns, stretches,
           and goes downstairs.

           INT. CLOCKMAKER'S WORKSHOP - MORNING

           When the Clockmaker enters the workshop, an older Karl,
           now roughly ten, is seated astride his stool, smiling
           somewhat deviously. Karl has his hands cupped, hiding
           something.

           The old man smiles back, knowing something's up, and sits.

           Karl grins wide and uncups his hands. There on his palm
           sits a perfect CLOCKWORK BUTTERFLY, its wings moving and
           contracting slowly, its antennae quivering just the
           slightest bit.

           The Clockmaker gasps in wonder.

           The butterfly lifts into the air and flits about the room,
           to the old man's delight. And eventually, it lands
           directly on the Clockmaker's nose. Again, its wings pulse
           slowly.  Then, suddenly, they stop. And the butterfly
           falls to the workbench, seemingly dead.

           The Clockmaker looks at Karl, wondering if this is part of
           the plan. Karl holds up a tiny key and frowns as he uses
           it to wind the butterfly.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        She has to be wound, of course. I
                        don't really like that. That can be
                        improved upon.

           The butterfly comes alive again.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        Nonsense!  She is wondrous, Karl.
                        She is astonishing. She is
                        beautiful beyond compare.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Thank you.

           The butterfly flits between them as they talk.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        You know, a boy with such a gift as
                        yours could be a very important
                        person --if he wanted.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        I don't think I'd like that very
                        much at all.  I just... I just like
                        to make things.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        Good! Very good! That is just what
                        a true artist should say!

           Karl looks humbly and gratefully at the old man.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        Karlheinz Indergarten. The artist
                        of the beautiful.

           INT. CLOCKMAKER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Again, several years pass. The Clockmaker is now very old
           indeed, and his movements cause him more pain than in the
           past. Still, he certainly is happy.

           INT. CLOCKMAKER'S WORKSHOP - MORNING

           When the old man enters the workshop this time, a teenage
           Karl sits astride his customary stool, an ornate box
           before him.

           The Clockmaker sits and raises an eyebrow, as if to ask,
           "May I?" Karl smiles and nods his consent.

           When the old man opens the box, he reveals a perfect metal
           ROBIN'S NEST, with five perfect eggs in it.

           And as he watches, the eggs begin to quiver, then hatch.

           Within moments, five baby ROBINS are blinking in the
           sunlight and chirping hesitantly. Then they begin to
           clamor for food.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        I believe they want their
                        breakfast!

           Karl smiles and raises a finger, as if to say, "But of
           course! Wait just a moment!"  And the old man gasps in
           delight as Karl opens a small drawer at the front of the
           box, which contains silver, wriggling WORMS. He removes
           several and carefully feeds them to the chicks.

           Once fed, the chicks begin to sing.

                                 ROBINS
                          Tenderloin, truffles, and goose pate,
                          Caviar and crème brulee,
                          Thank you, no, but don't be hurt,
                          Just bring us a fresh patch of dirt.
                          Worms, marvelous worms!
                          Squiggly and wriggly and squirming!
                          Worms, marvelous worms!
                          Their meat is the treat that we're
                          yearning!

           Karl feeds the birds a few more worms.

           One of the robins then performs a session of solo
           chirping, while the others offer harmony.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        It is the most magnificent thing I
                        have ever seen. It is perfect.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Nothing is perfect.  But it is very
                        close.

           INT. CLOCKMAKER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Years pass.  And when the Clockmaker arises this time,
           it's clear that he probably doesn't have much time left.

           INT. CLOCKMAKER'S WORKSHOP - MORNING

           The old man slowly enters the workshop, and Karl helps him
           onto his stool, then seats himself on his own. Now in his
           early to mid-twenties, Karl is a handsome man, though shy
           and rather thin.

           The Clockmaker waits expectantly, and Karl grins.

           There is no box, and Karl holds nothing in his hands. Then
           his shirt pocket quivers slightly. There's something
           inside.

           Over the edge of the pocket appears a clockwork mouse --
           PIM. The Clockmaker's eyes widen in wonder.

           Pim, endowed with remarkably human qualities, is a
           masterpiece of perpetual motion. He smiles at the old man,
           then scurries out of the pocket and down Karl's arm to the
           workbench.

           To the Clockmaker's amazement, Pim performs a series of
           charming stunts to demonstrate his agility and talents.
           Pim dances -- first ballet, then tap. Pim lifts objects
           twice his size. Pim wields his tail like a saber, making
           dramatic lunges and thrusts.
           When finished, he bows low before the old man, who returns
           the bow from his seat.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        His name is Pim.

           The Clockmaker rises slowly and kisses Karl's forehead.

                                 CLOCKMAKER
                        Magical, Karl. A magical little
                        mouse. And now... you must excuse
                        me... I'm feeling rather...
                        unwound.

           He then turns and walks slowly into the hallway. Karl,
           concerned, watches as the old man ascends the stairs to
           his bedroom.

           INT. CLOCKMAKER'S WORKSHOP - MORNING

           The next morning, Karl sits at the workbench fixing a
           clock. Pim aids him by handing him various parts and
           tools. After a few moments, Karl stops abruptly and looks
           at the grandfather clock.

           INSERT - GRANDFATHER CLOCK

           which reads just after eleven o'clock.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Karl walks into the hall and slowly approaches the stairs.
           He looks up, then ascends.

           INT. CLOCKMAKER'S WORKSHOP - LATER

           Karl sits sadly on his stool and stares at the
           Clockmaker's stool, which is of course empty. The old
           man's time has finally come, and Karl cries lightly.

           Pim stares woefully at Karl, understanding completely.

           Suddenly, all the clocks in the workshop strike five
           o'clock at once. They all chime in a myriad of different
           ways, and by the time the din has ended, so have Karl's
           tears.

           Karl rises and begins to pack a few small items in a
           satchel.
                                 KARLHEINZ
                        It's time I went home.

           Pim nods and begins to pack Karl's jeweler's tools in
           their leather case.

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE NEAR VILLAGE - DAY

           As he approaches the town, Pim in his breast pocket, Karl
           stops in dismay.  In the distance, a thick black SMOG
           hangs above his village, and dark towers belch FLAME and
           SOOT into the air.

           Pim looks questioningly at Karl, as if to say, "Surely we
           aren't going there!" But Karl musters his courage and
           strides ahead.

           EXT. VILLAGE - LATER

           As Karl and Pim walk slowly through the streets, it
           registers that the town has been completely overrun by the
           industrial revolution.  Gone are the bakeries and pubs.
           Gone are the horse-drawn carriages and friendly mutts.
           All have been replaced by factories, billowing
           smokestacks, and loud motorcars.

           Pim is visibly frightened by the chaos. And Karl, needing
           a dose of reassurance himself, seeks out his orphanage --
           and the tree.

           (NOTE: Pim hides effectively from people and animals
           throughout. He is only seen when he chooses to be seen.)

           EXT. ORPHANAGE - LATER

           The tiny orphanage remains, sandwiched between two
           towering industrial plants, but it shows substantial
           neglect. No longer is it a cheerful home for children;
           rather, it is frightening and inhospitable.

           When Karlheinz turns to face the park and its wonderful
           tree, he discovers that no grass or smaller trees remain.
           Surrounded by enormous buildings on every side, the park
           is bathed in darkness. And only a few sad leaves cling to
           the once-mighty oak.

           A large, MANGY DOG approaches, and Karl offers him a crust
           of bread. The dog, mad with starvation, seizes the crust
           aggressively, nearly taking Karl's hand with.
           Pim gives the dog a disciplinary look, as if to scold him,
           and the dog looks at Pim apologetically before slinking
           off. The dog knows he was impolite.

           As Karl stands in despair, a familiar voice welcomes him
           home.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        My dear Karlheinz. You have
                        returned to me.

           Mirroring the disrepair of her orphanage, Miss
           Understood's hair has turned gray. And her face is lined
           with worry. But of course, she retains her pluck.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Hello.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Und you are glad to be home!

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Everything is dead...

           Karl glances at the tree.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Or dying.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Yes, it is hard for things to grow
                        here now.  So much darkness. Und
                        filth.  This is not good for trees,
                        you know...

           Miss Understood glances back at the orphanage.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        ... Or children.

           Miss Understood grasps Karl's hand, attempting to lighten
           the mood.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        But there are good things, too. Our
                        town is very rich! Und all the
                        world knows of us. You have heard
                        of Emma Cuddles?

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        No, I...

           Karl points at his wristwatch.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        ... Haven't had time.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        She is our ambassador to the world.
                        Und she is everywhere. Very popular
                        in America.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Well, I should like to meet her
                        sometime.

           In the background, we see a YOUNG GIRL, rather shabbily
           dressed. She is frightened -- and seems to be running from
           something.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        She is a doll, Karl. Und she is
                        quite remarkable.  You see, this
                        Emma Cuddles, she is made to love
                        ze children.  Und so, whenever a
                        little girl or boy is present, this
                        Emma Cuddles hugs them.  I don't
                        know how they do it, these
                        engineers und technicians, but it
                        is very impressive.  A most unique
                        doll. Ze parents like her very
                        much.

           The young girl in the background runs closer, hiding
           behind whatever she can, her eyes searching warily for
           something.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        And the children? Do they like her
                        as well?

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Mmmm, I suppose so. In their way.
                        But I am lucky, you know. I have
                        many children to hug.  Und this is
                        a feeling that is real. I feel it
                        in my heart.  This Emma Cuddles...
                        I do not think she has a heart.
                                 KARLHEINZ
                        I think she sounds rather scary.

           Karl and Miss Understood notice the young girl, who
           doesn't acknowledge them. And just as she's running past,
           an EMMA CUDDLES doll steps out from behind a pile of
           debris, blocking her path. The doll is unbelievably
           creepy, sinister in every respect.

           Karl recoils at the sight of Emma Cuddles, just as anyone
           would.

                                 EMMA CUDDLES
                        Hug me.

           The little girl screams, terrified, and runs off. Emma
           Cuddles totters after her, arms outstretched.

                                 EMMA CUDDLES
                        Hug me! Hug me! Hug me!

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           A) A little girl stands atop a dresser, screaming, while
           Emma Cuddles climbs toward her, demanding hugs.

           B) A little boy struggles to keep his closet door closed,
           screaming all the while, while Emma Cuddles pounds the
           door from within, demanding hugs.

           C) A little boy uses a chair to pin Emma Cuddles to a
           wall.  He screams while she demands hugs.

           D) Two Emma Cuddles appears over the top of a crib and
           demand hugs. The twin infants within scream bloody murder.

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Perhaps you are right -- a little
                        scary.  But ze parents like them,
                        und ze parents have made us very
                        rich.

           Karl looks at the patches on Miss Understood's dress, then
           at her ancient shoes. Miss Understood laughs.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Well, not me!  But they have made
                        him very rich, und for that I am
                        very proud.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        And who is him?

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Why, our Leopold, of course!

           Miss Understood points to one of the larger industrial
           buildings. The enormous letters on its side read
           "Cuddlecom Inc."

           And as Karl FOLLOWS Miss Understood's gaze, we ZOOM in on
           the massive window above the letters, where Leopold stands
           in his boardroom, gazing down at them. Behind Leopold is
           GROD, his ape-like manservant and guard.

           Karl gasps.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        He is a very important person. Very
                        good with numbers. But of course,
                        Geld kauft nicht Glück. Money can't
                        fry happiness.

           Miss Understood turns and walks away, unable to maintain
           her thin veneer of optimism.

           EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - NIGHT

           Karl walks despondently down a dark, narrow street and
           stops outside a ramshackle little building, with boards
           nailed across the windows.

           He surveys the building grimly, and Pim looks upon it with
           considerable doubt.

           Karl looks up and down the street, then enters, closing
           the door behind him.

           EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - MORNING

           As downcast factory workers walk in droves toward the
           industrial plants, they stare in wonder at the building
           Karl entered. Transformed during the night, it is now neat
           and tidy.  Emblazoned on the storefront window, in bright
           golden letters, are the words "K. Indergarten Clock &
           Watch Repair."
           (NOTE: against the drab grays and blacks of the town, the
           golden letters shine with a remarkable brightness.)

           Karl exits his shop, locking the door behind him. He holds
           a small sandwich, wrapped in brown paper, and a very
           large, impressive-looking BOOK.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - LATER

           Karl sits on a rickety park bench, quietly eating his
           meager cheese sandwich before the dying tree.  As he does
           so, he reads his book, though we cannot tell what the book
           is titled or about.

           But even as Karl reads, a movement catches his eye. He
           looks up and stares into the shadows and alleys -- and
           spies a child.

           As Karl looks more carefully, he sees dozens of children
           in similar hiding spots.

           The children are quiet, expectant. They seem to be
           awaiting something.

           The towering buildings enclose the circular park in a sort
           of massive cylinder that allows no light to enter. But as
           Karl gazes skyward, the sun reaches its zenith. And with
           the sun directly above the tree, it is suddenly bathed in
           sunshine.

           The children cry out as one and sprint to the tree,
           climbing its branches.

           The tree's few remaining leaves become more vibrant with
           the sun's nourishment. Karl can see them react visibly to
           its rays.  And perhaps the tree appreciates the children's
           touch as well.

           (NOTE: the tree is not a magic tree exactly, but its
           anthropomorphic qualities are sometimes exaggerated in
           certain characters' eyes.)

           Karl turns and looks back at the orphanage, where Miss
           Understood surveys the recess.  When Karl catches her eye,
           she smiles a genuine smile, and he smiles back.

           But even as Karl smiles, the sun continues across the sky
           -- and is soon hidden from view behind the town's tallest
           spire.  As Karl watches the sun duck behind the building,
           he spies a young girl in a window near the top.
           The girl is AGATHA, and her long, dark hair hides much of
           her face.  As Karl stares up at her in curiosity, she
           notices his gaze and draws the white blinds abruptly. Karl
           does not know what to make of this.

           The park now bathed in gloomy darkness, the kids slowly
           trudge back to the shadows, and the tree seems to shrink
           somewhat in sadness.  A SINGLE LEAF falls slowly to the
           ground.

           As Karl watches the leaf's descent, he sees one of the
           children, TOBY, retreating toward a narrow alley. But
           before he quite reaches it, a FACTORY WORKER steps in his
           path. His scarred face seems especially cruel, and Toby is
           very scared.

                                 FACTORY WORKER
                        And whaddya got for me today,
                        insect?

                                 TOBY
                        Nothing, I swear!

                                 FACTORY WORKER
                        Is that a fact?

           The young man picks up Toby and shakes him violently. We
           hear the slight JINGLE of a bit of change.

                                 FACTORY WORKER
                        Nothin' don't jingle.

                                 TOBY
                        I earned it!  I pulled weeds for a
                        lady!

                                 FACTORY WORKER
                        Now I know you're lyin'. Weeds
                        don't grow here.  Nothin' does.

                                 TOBY
                              (defiantly)
                        You don't know everything!

                                 FACTORY WORKER
                        I know this...

           Holding Toby upside down, the factory worker shakes the
           few coins from his pockets, then tosses Toby to the
           ground. The man picks up the change and pockets it.
                                 FACTORY WORKER
                          Now you got nothin'.

           Having witnessed the entire exchange, Karl and Pim are
           aghast. But of course, neither Karl's personality or build
           would permit a physical encounter with the ruffian. Karl
           watches as the man strides off toward a factory, while
           Toby runs into the orphanage -- where he clearly lives.

           Karl slams shut his book, and with a look of resolve on
           his face, he hurries after the factory worker.

           EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           Not wishing to be seen, Karl follows at a distance,
           keeping close to the walls.  The factory worker walks with
           a purpose, and he sure does look tough.

           But just as the man turns into a narrow alley, he strides
           directly into an enormous spider web, which covers his
           entire face and upper body.  The spider, a huge specimen
           and decidedly creepy, scuttles across the man's head.

           Karl watches intently, from a distance, as the man freaks.
           Clearly arachnophobic, the factory worker screams like a
           little girl, then flails and dances comically as he tries
           to rid himself of the spider.

                                 FACTORY WORKER
                        Giant spider!  Giant spider!

           As the man continues his spasms and contortions, Karl's
           face suddenly glows with inspiration, and he hurries off,
           Pim in tow.

           INT. ORPHANAGE BEDROOM - MORNING

           Toby awakes before the other children. He yawns and sits
           up. And then Toby spies the PACKAGE, sitting on his shabby
           bedside table.

           The package is wrapped neatly in brown paper. Toby,
           unaccustomed to presents of any sort, lifts the package
           and shakes it lightly, which tells him nothing. But the
           card does.  Toby removes the tiny card from its envelope.

           INSERT - CARD

           which reads "With kind regards from K.  Indergarten" in a
           magnificently delicate, flowing script.
           BACK TO SCENE

           Toby unwraps the package, careful not to wake the other
           children.  Within is a curious child's vest, made entirely
           of silver -- almost like a piece of armor, but intricately
           wrought and far less substantial in weight.  On the chest
           is a small button.

           INSERT - SILVER BUTTON

           which reads "Press here."

           BACK TO SCENE

           Toby frowns with confusion.

           EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - LATER

           Toby walks down a street crowded with workers. He nimbly
           pushes through, and as he does, the wicked factory worker
           spies him, grins, and decides to follow.

           Toby turns into a dark alley, and as he nears the other
           end, the factory worker steps out from a shadow.  Toby
           stops in his tracks, then begins to back away. The man
           advances.

                                 FACTORY WORKER
                        Alright, insect. Let's have it.

                                 TOBY
                        I haven't any!

                                 FACTORY WORKER
                        Tsk, tsk.  I'd have thought you'd
                        learned your lesson by now. One
                        oughtn't to lie to one's elders.

                                 TOBY
                        Leave me alone!

           The factory worker lunges at poor Toby and grabs him by
           the collar, lifting him into the air with one enormous
           arm. He's grown impatient -- and shakes the boy more
           roughly with each word.

                                 FACTORY WORKER
                        Now you listen to me. Hand it over,
                        or I will squash you like a bug.
           Frightened and nearly helpless, Toby desperately reaches
           beneath his tattered jacket and finds the silver button,
           which he depresses.  It makes a very satisfactory sound.

           As the factory worker gasps in amazement, Toby's back
           sprouts eight enormous, jointed SPIDER LEGS, turning him
           into an arachnid.

           The legs are metal and powerful, and suddenly, Toby towers
           over the man.  Somehow, Toby has complete control over his
           new appendages.

           The terrified factory worker, backing up, stumbles and
           falls.  Toby, rather amazed himself, looks on his legs
           with wonder -- and at the fear they've inspired in the
           bully.

                                 TOBY
                              (triumphantly)
                        Ha ha!

                                 FACTORY WORKER
                              (losing his powers
                               of reason)
                        Giant spider. Giant spider.

           The factory worker rises and lunges to his left. Toby,
           supremely agile, scuttles to block his passage. The man
           lunges to his right, with the same result.

                                 TOBY
                        Now then, you villain! Let's see
                        who jingles!

           Screaming with fright, the worker turns and flees down the
           alley. Toby, in hot pursuit, leaps from wall to wall as
           the two disappear in the distance.

           As Toby and his former tormentor fade away, we FOCUS on a
           SHINY LITTLE FLY, which clings to one of the walls in the
           alley. The fly has borne witness to the encounter.

           At first, the fly appears quite normal. Then its eyes
           focus mechanically, and as it moves, we realize that the
           fly is obviously one of Karl's inventions.

           INT. INDERGARTEN CLOCK & REPAIR SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Karl wears a complex set of goggles and earphones, both
           beautifully wrought. In his hands are a series of
           complicated controls.  Obviously, the fly, under Karl's
           control, has allowed him to witness Toby's triumph
           remotely.

           Karl raises his arms in triumph.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Ha ha!

           Pim shares Karl's feeling of triumph, running in circles,
           then raising his tiny arms in victory.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - LATER

           The next day, Karl sits in the park, again eating his
           humble sandwich and reading his enormous book.  As he
           reads, he absently watches the children enjoy their few
           brief moments of pleasure in the sun.

           Karl also notices that high in her spire, Agatha also
           watches the children play.  She looks terribly sad.

           Karl returns his gaze to the children and notes that one
           little boy, STUART, is positively filthy. He's covered in
           dirt and grime. As Karl watches, Miss Understood appears
           and grabs Stuart by the ear.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Aha! Got you! Und you will bathe
                        this very instant, little piggy!

                                 STUART
                        No!  Anything but that!

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Piggy has been rooting in ze mud,
                        und we must clean him!

                                 STUART
                        But the beast! The beast!

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Poor little piggy doesn't like ze
                        water.

                                 STUART
                        Please!  Please don't make me!

           Miss Understood speaks to Karl as she passes him, hauling
           Stuart off toward the orphanage.
                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        I run his bath, I make ze suds, I
                        go away. Und he scream und wail und
                        run off, every time. Understood
                        does not understand.  If only I
                        could be ze fly on ze wall, just
                        once!

           As Miss Understood drags Stuart away, Karl's eyes narrow.
           He slams shut his book and hurries off.

           INT. ORPHANAGE BATHROOM - LATER

           Stuart, wearing only a towel around his waist, stands
           before a decrepit bathtub and glances around nervously.

           Stuart fearfully eyes a crack in the wall.

           Just as he's about to step into the water, now bubbly with
           soap, Stuart hears a sound. Over the edge of the tub
           appears a massive WHITE ROACH, perhaps a foot in length.

           Stuart cries out in dismay and backs to the far corner of
           the tiny bathroom, his eyes wide with terror.

           As he watches, the roach creeps down into the tub and
           disappears beneath the suds.

           Stuart musters his courage and, holding a plunger before
           him, approaches with caution. Stuart peers over the edge
           at the quiet waters below.

           He holds the plunger in his small hand, poised to strike.
           Moments pass as tension mounts.

           And suddenly, the roach emerges from the depths, inches
           from poor Stuart, and hisses horribly.

           (NOTE: the roach's mandibles should be monstrous,
           reminiscent of some creature from science fiction -- or
           prehistoric times.  Coupled with the roach's hiss, this
           moment should come as a truly chilling scare.)

           Stuart drops the plunger, terrified beyond reason.

           The roach casually slides back beneath the water even as
           Stuart runs screaming from the bathroom.
           Miss Understood, folding laundry in the hallway just
           outside, watches as Stuart runs screaming by her, his
           towel dropping comically in the process.

           She looks upward and raises her arms, as if to say, "What
           must I do to get this child clean?"

           The bathroom seems quiet and empty for a moment. Then with
           a mechanical buzzing sound, Karl's tiny fly lifts from the
           wall and exits through the bathroom window.

           INT. ORPHANAGE BEDROOM - MORNING

           The next morning, Stuart awakens before the other
           children. And he's quite surprised to find a small PACKAGE
           on his bedside table.

           He removes a small envelope from the brown paper package
           and pulls the card from within.

           INSERT - CARD

           which reads "With kind regards from K.  Indergarten" in
           the same magnificently delicate, flowing script.

           INT. ORPHANAGE BATHROOM - LATER

           Stuart creeps into the bathroom and shuts the door. Ever
           so carefully, he approaches the tub and turns on the
           water.

           He adds a healthy dash of soap, watches the tub fill, and
           turns the spicket off.

           Stuart then places a small, metal WHALING SHIP,
           spectacularly detailed, atop the water -- his gift from
           Karlheinz.

           As Stuart backs away from the tub, he hears the awful
           scuttle of his nemesis. And soon enough, the great white
           roach appears at the tub's edge, before sliding down into
           the water.

           As it does, the whaling ship comes alive, and tiny figures
           -- the CREW -- emerge from below decks.

           The tiny men lower small boats and row into the middle of
           the tub.  Each boat is led by a man armed with a tiny
           harpoon.
           The whaling ship itself is clearly led by a tiny figure
           with a beard and a wooden leg -- the CAPTAIN. He surveys
           the horizon with grim patience, one hand at the ship's
           wheel.

           Suddenly, the waters stir slightly, and the men grow
           alert. But the water calms, and they wait, tension
           mounting.

           Stuart is breathless with anticipation.

           When the roach leaps from the depths, one tiny HARPOONER
           yells shrilly.

                                 HARPOONER
                        She breaches!

           And as the roach sails through the air, the men throw
           their harpoons. Stuart holds his breath as the battle
           rages.

           Each harpoon is tied to a rope, and the ropes hum as the
           beast heads for the bottom. Men toss water on them to keep
           them from burning up with friction.

           The monster's strength is prodigious. Boats are capsized.
           The whaling ship spins in a whirlpool.

           But even as the roach wreaks havoc on the tiny men, the
           Captain leaps from the deck of the ship and spears the
           beast through its head, killing it once and for all.

           The great white roach quivers in its death throes, then
           lies still.

           The men recover, hauling each other back into their boats.
           And they sing a cadence as they begin to process the
           leviathan.

                                 CREW
                          The sea she was a-boiling,
                          Yo ho, yo ho.
                          Our pants we were a-soiling,
                          Yo ho, yo ho.
                          But then the man with the mighty lance,
                          He slew the beast,
                          so let's change our pants,
                          And drink rum, rum, rum, rum,
                          Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho.
           The Captain, wiping his tiny brow, salutes Stuart from the
           back of the dead beast, and the boy proudly salutes him
           back, beaming with delight.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - LATER

           Seated on his regular bench, reading his massive book,
           Karl looks up to see Stuart striding by. The little boy
           glistens with cleanliness, and his hair is neatly combed.
           He smiles wide and waves at Karl, who smiles back, giving
           him a little nod.

           Miss Understood appears behind Karl as Stuart runs off to
           play.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        I knew there was a little boy under
                        all ze grit und grime!

           Karl watches as Miss Understood walks off to see to a
           group of children, and Karl shuts his book. When he does,
           he discovers that WILLIAM is seated next to him. The
           book's immense size had hidden him from view.

           William is morose.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Ah!  Hello.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Hello.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        You don't seem overly happy on
                        this... dark, foreboding afternoon.

                                 WILLIAM
                        That's because I'm sad.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        I see. Yes, this is beginning to
                        make sense.  So by that logic, if
                        we were to somehow render you un-
                        sad, it stands to reason that you
                        might regain your happiness.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I suppose it's possible.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Assuming my calculations are
                        correct.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Correct.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Indeed. Now. Our first step should
                        be to identify the root cause of
                        these detestable sorrows. Only then
                        are we able to determine and
                        prescribe a proper cure.

           William suddenly erupts with emotion.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Everyone has a monster under their
                        bed but me!

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        I'm sorry?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Everyone!

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        But monsters are abominable
                        creatures, with fangs.

                                 WILLIAM
                        And talons.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        And scales.

                                 WILLIAM
                        And horns.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        And pointed tails and forked
                        tongues.

                                 WILLIAM
                        And everyone has one but me!

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        I see.

           Miss Understood begins to round up the children for class.
                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Come, children! Setzen Sie sich
                        nicht weg bis morgen, was Sie heute
                        tun können.  Don't put off 'til
                        yesterday what you can do tomorrow!

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        It appears our cure shall have to
                        be postponed.

                                 WILLIAM
                        That's okay. Some problems just
                        don't have a cure.

           Karl doesn't know how to respond, and William walks off
           dejectedly.

           Ruminating on William's final words, Karl looks up to the
           tall spire, where Agatha looks down from her window.

           The two regard each other, and Agatha waves to Karl
           hesitantly. He returns the wave.

           INT. INDERGARTEN CLOCK & REPAIR SHOP - MORNING

           Karl sits at the counter, tinkering with a clock, when in
           rushes Dr. Pimpledink.  Older and significantly fatter,
           Pimpledink still bumbles about, but he's obviously
           remained a kind and gentle soul.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        Mr. Indergarten! I have a medical
                        emergency of the most dire breed.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        What's wrong?

           Pimpledink withdraws parts of his broken pocket watch.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        My timepiece is in... time pieces.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        I shall have to operate.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        By all means, proceed!
           Karl smiles and begins the procedure. Pimpledink watches
           closely as pieces fit together very precisely. And as Karl
           works, the doctor grows rather downcast.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        You know, I envy you, Karl
                        Indergarten.

           Karl pauses to briefly look up, but he doesn't respond.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        Deep within the bowels of your
                        patients, cogs and wheels all fit
                        together as they should. Oh, you
                        may adjust them slightly, perhaps
                        oil them from time to time. And
                        everything works very neatly. But
                        people, Karl. People are very
                        different. One simply never knows
                        what makes them tick.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        I've often wished I could... fix
                        people.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        Imagine! A little girl who's
                        allergic to everything!

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Everything?  No one is allergic to
                        everything.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        The smell of marbles gives her
                        migraines.  New pajamas cause her
                        pain.  Crayons make her muscles
                        cramp, and lentils make her lame.
                        Knickers make her lymph nodes
                        swell, fresh honey gives her hives.
                        Kittens constipate her. It's true,
                        I swear. No lie.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Birthday cake and candles?

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        Meningitis, I'm afraid.
                                 KARLHEINZ
                        And storybooks with pictures?

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        They make her heartbeat fade.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        And you, Doctor? Surely she is not
                        allergic to the sweet scent of care
                        and concern!

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        Much to my dismay, I give her a
                        fever of one hundred and three. The
                        only thing she can possibly stomach
                        is a cup of cucumber tea.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        But there must be something you can
                        do!

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        I've tried pills, potions, lotions,
                        syrups, tonics, injections, and
                        infusions.  I've consulted an
                        acupuncturist, an aromatherapist,
                        and an exorcist.  I have written to
                        esteemed physicians from every
                        corner of the globe, and only one
                        prescribed a solution: to remove
                        her sense of smell.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Then it must be done, at once!

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        The technology is not yet available
                        to us. But he suggested that she be
                        frozen in a cryogenic chamber until
                        such time as it is.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        How awful!

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        Her case has been the bane of my
                        career. And the stress! I shouldn't
                        wonder if I end up in hospital!
                        Imagine explaining to the most
                        powerful man in the city that his
                        daughter's health is hopeless!

           Karl drops the tool he's been using.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        What... is your patient's name?

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        Agatha.  Agatha Croak. And her
                        condition is quite incurable, I'm
                        afraid.

           Karl hands the timepiece, now repaired, to Pimpledink, who
           shakes his head in woe. Karl stands aghast as Pimpledink
           exits his shop, and Pim comes out of hiding, having heard
           every word.  Needless to say, Karl is shocked to hear that
           Agatha is Leopold's daughter.

           INT. AGATHA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Agatha, the little girl in the spire, sits on the edge of
           her bed in a room completely devoid of furnishings, toys,
           or anything comforting. All that there is, is white: her
           hospital bed and its single sheet, the drapes at the
           window, the floor and ceiling.

           Agatha herself is thin, pale, and sad; but her eyes are
           bright.

           As Agatha sits quietly on her bed, she notices a bit of
           sunlight creep across the floor, and she rushes to the
           window.

           Far, far below, the sun is making its brief appearance in
           the village park, and the children are delightedly
           sprinting for the tree.

           Agatha watches them play, her face and hands pressed
           against the window. The sight excites her and breaks her
           heart all at once.  She watches, enraptured, until the
           park fades again into darkness. And as it does, there's a
           knock at the door.

           A small panel slides back in the door to reveal a thick
           glass window, through which conversations can be held.

           There stands Leopold, with the massive Grod behind him.
           (NOTE: when Leopold speaks, his voice is not villainous so
           much as devoid of emotion. His logical tone, however, is
           cold  and leaves us with little doubt that he is Karl's
           nemesis.)

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Good morning, Agatha.

                                 AGATHA
                        Is it?

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Morning?

                                 AGATHA
                        Good.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Indeed it is.  Our stock values
                        have soared with the news that
                        Cuddlecom Incorporated will soon
                        release a new and improved Emma.  I
                        forecast that gross income will
                        nearly triple in the first quarter
                        alone.

                                 AGATHA
                        Oh.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        I should think you'd be pleased.

                                 AGATHA
                              (sadly)
                        I am.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        You've been watching those filthy
                        children again, haven't you?

                                 AGATHA
                        Only a little bit. I only peeked.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        I suspected as much. And this
                        saddens you, does it not?

           Agatha begins to well up with emotion.

                                 AGATHA
                        Oh, father!  You can't imagine how
                        sad it makes me!

                                 LEOPOLD
                              (dryly)
                        No. I cannot.

           Leopold walks away, and Grod stares coldly at Agatha
           before shutting the door's small panel with a snap.

           Agatha returns to the window and gazes down at Karl's
           customary park bench, but Karl isn't there.

           As Agatha turns away and sighs, Karl's tiny mechanical fly
           rises from the windowsill and buzzes off.

           EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE VILLAGE STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           Karl's fly veers away from Agatha's window and seems to
           head toward home. But as it does, it must fight against
           light gusts of wind.

           INT. INDERGARTEN CLOCK & REPAIR SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Karl, wearing his goggles and earphones, attempts to
           control the fly as Pim watches.

           EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE VILLAGE STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           The fly seems to make some headway, until a strong gust
           blows it directly through an open window -- and into the
           boardroom of Cuddlecom Incorporated.

           INT. INDERGARTEN CLOCK & REPAIR SHOP - CONTINUOUS

                                 KARL
                        Oh dear.

           INT. CUDDLECOM BOARDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The fly lands at one end of an impossibly large conference
           table and looks around, its mechanical eyes focusing on
           different objects.

           First, the fly looks at the men assembled around the
           table: well-dressed businessmen, all in their late middle
           age. The men are absolutely quiet.

           The fly then looks to the boardroom walls, which are lined
           with shelving, floor to ceiling.  And on the shelves are
           hundreds of dolls -- apparently an enhanced new version of
           Emma Cuddles.

           The dolls' unnerving eyes stare blankly, cold and
           unblinking -- much like those of Leopold himself.

           When Leopold enters with Grod, the assembled men
           straighten and stiffen. As Leopold speaks, he strides
           around the room.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Gentlemen.  Public reaction to
                        Cuddlecom's recent technological
                        advances has proven overwhelming,
                        particularly among the American
                        populace, our primary target
                        demographic. And market research,
                        as you well know, never lies.

           The men nod their heads and murmur appreciatively.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Progress, gentlemen, equals profit.
                        But in our quest for progress,
                        calculated sacrifice is of
                        paramount importance. Our current
                        manufacturing capabilities are, I
                        regret to inform you, hopelessly
                        inadequate.  And in order to meet
                        consumer demand, expansion is
                        essential. And so I am pleased to
                        announce plans for a new facility,
                        state-of-the-art in every
                        conceivable respect.  This plant
                        will dedicate itself entirely to
                        the production of our new
                        prototype, and it is my hope that
                        we shall complement our global
                        marketing campaign with output of
                        similarly epic proportion.

           The men applaud politely.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Of course, real estate within the
                        district is at a premium, and I
                        have no wish to forestall progress.
                        Progress waits for no man.
           Leopold walks to the window, his hands behind his back,
           and gazes down at the park.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        And so we shall break ground on
                        virgin soil, wasted to date on idle
                        recreation.  Here, we shall erect
                        our monument to the icon that is
                        the consumer.

           The men glance at each other nervously. A BALD BUSINESSMAN
           summons his courage and speaks.

                                 BALD BUSINESSMAN
                        But Mr. Croak.  Surely in the
                        interest of public relations, we
                        might reconsider -- and perhaps
                        build on the outskirts of town, in
                        a sort of... a sort of sub-urbia.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Continue.

                                 BALD BUSINESSMAN
                        Well, you see, the park... it's the
                        only place left for the children.
                        My own daughter plays there, you
                        know.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Does she?

                                 BALD BUSINESSMAN
                        Yes, sir.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Let it never be said that Cuddlecom
                        should ever shirk the needs of our
                        precious local adolescents. But
                        when, gentlemen, when does progress
                        ever allow for playtime?  My plans
                        do not ignore the children.  Nay,
                        they play a role of enormous
                        import. Indeed, the children are
                        our future!

           Grod cracks his knuckles from directly behind the bald
           businessman.
                                 BALD BUSINESSMAN
                        I quite agree, sir.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        I debated the outsourcing of labor
                        to other towns -- and in fact,
                        other countries.  But gentlemen, we
                        have too long ignored an untapped
                        indigenous resource.

           The bald businessman begins to understand, and his face
           grows concerned.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        There is no lesson greater than to
                        learn the value of a hard-earned
                        dollar. And thus I propose that we
                        staff our glistening new facility
                        entirely with children.

           The men again glance nervously at one another.

                                 BALD BUSINESSMAN
                        But...

                                 LEOPOLD
                        They're cheaper!

                                 BALD BUSINESSMAN
                        But...

                                 LEOPOLD
                        They're meeker!

                                 BALD BUSINESSMAN
                        But...

                                 LEOPOLD
                        And most of all, they do what
                        they're told.

           Grod suddenly lifts the bald businessman from his chair
           and tosses him like a rag doll through a shaft.

           Leopold approaches the head of the table and leans upon it
           with both hands.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Questions?
           The remaining men glance nervously at each other, then
           simultaneously applaud.

           Grod then notices Karl's tiny fly, sitting inches from
           Leopold's hand.

           Grod raises one enormous paw -- and SQUASHES the fly with
           a thunderous crack.

           INT. INDERGARTEN CLOCK & REPAIR SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Karl removes his goggles and earphones, dumbstruck.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Oh, Pim! This is all my fault!

           Pim shakes his head in disagreement.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Oh, but it is. It was I who made
                        him walk the plank.

           Pim cocks his head, not quite understanding. His whiskers
           twitch charmingly.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Well, come on!

           Pim races up Karl's arm and into his pocket.

           Karl draws the blinds and, gathering his tools, opens a
           mysterious trapdoor at the back of the shop. He steps in.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Perhaps you'll have a romance with
                        a sewer rat.

           Pim grimaces and hides low in Karl's pocket.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Some rats are evil, Pim. I won't
                        argue that.  But they're almost
                        never born that way.

           Karl descends and closes the trap door dramatically.

           EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - MORNING

           The following morning, Leopold walks through town,
           impeccably dressed as always.  Grod follows menacingly.
           The bald businessman that dared to disagree with Leopold
           hides from his sight -- and Grod's -- but it's obvious
           that word of Leopold's insidious plot has spread. Men move
           out of his way, but with disgust. Women hide their
           children behind their backs.  One especially courageous
           man considers a confrontation, but a look from Grod sends
           him packing.

           Leopold notes these reactions calmly, logically. He checks
           his WRISTWATCH, which is gold and expensive.

           As the pair stride through town, headed for some factory,
           the voice of Leopold's old mentor rings out above the
           crowd, furious.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Leopold Croak!

           The assembled crowd parts ways to allow Miss Understood
           passage.  When she enters the ring of villagers, she
           appears older, more disheveled, and positively fuming. She
           wields a yardstick in her hand.

           Leopold and Miss Understood stand far apart, at opposite
           ends of the street -- like gunslingers at high noon.

           As Miss Understood speaks, she walks slowly and with
           purpose toward her former student.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Und so. You would put ze children
                        to work.

           Leopold speaks for the benefit of the crowd, whereas Miss
           Understood is focused exclusively on him.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        I would give them opportunity. A
                        chance at a fair wage, a better
                        life.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Und their schooling?

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Education is a negligible
                        commodity.  In this day and age,
                        it's profit-sharing that these
                        children need.
           Miss Understood is now quite close to Leopold, and her
           voice softens.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Und your tree, Leopold? Do you care
                        nothing for your tree?

                                 LEOPOLD
                        It stands in the way.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Of what, my child? I do not
                        understand.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Of progress.

           Miss Understood allows this to sink in, and her anger
           mounts.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Never... in all my years... have I
                        ever punished a child with ze
                        stick. Und heaven help me, you
                        shall be ze first.

           Miss Understood slaps Leopold's hand smartly with the
           ruler.

           (NOTE: given the crowd and the gravity of the situation,
           the little slap is comically anti-climatic.)

           Leopold recoils only slightly. It wasn't really all that
           painful anyway.  Nonetheless, Grod steps toward Miss
           Understood with wicked intent.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Und this is how I taught you? To
                        hide behind your ape?

           Not wishing to be publicly embarrassed, Leopold puts a
           hand on Grod's arm, signaling that he back off.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Grod.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Good. Very good. Und now, ze
                        blitzkrieg.
           Miss Understood again smacks Leopold's hand smartly with
           the ruler: slap!

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Now you listen to me...

           Miss Understood strikes two quick blows: slap, slap!

                                 LEOPOLD
                        I put this town on the map.

           Miss Understood strikes three quick blows: slap, slap,
           slap!

                                 LEOPOLD
                        And I will not be cowed by a
                        haggard old crone with a stick.

           At this insult, Miss Understood goes ballistic. Wielding
           the yardstick with both hands, she attacks as if she's
           holding a broadsword.  She hits Leopold on the head and
           shoulders, and he attempts to protect himself with his
           arms, backing up all the while.

           Grod seems unsure of what to do, then resolves himself to
           action and moves toward Miss Understood.

           At that moment, the action SLOWS as Miss Understood's
           yardstick comes down directly on Leopold's expensive gold
           wristwatch, which SHATTERS. Though the sound is but a
           small one, it stops everyone in their tracks.

           The crowd gasps in unison.

           As action RESUMES at a normal pace, all is silent.

           Leopold looks down at his wristwatch, and though he
           remains calm (as he always does), it's clear that he's
           more than miffed.  He looks from his watch to Miss
           Understood.

           Miss Understood is breathing heavily -- more heavily than
           seems healthy.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        der Apfel fällt nicht weit von den
                        Baum...
           Miss Understood's breathing grows more labored, and she
           drops the yardstick, though her eyes remain fixed on
           Leopold -- with love.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        The apple... doesn't fall far...
                        from me.

           Miss Understood collapses in the street.

           Dr. Pimpledink comes rushing through the crowd to the
           schoolteacher's side. He takes her pulse at her wrist,
           then listens at her chest. All are silent as Pimpledink
           conducts his tests.  Then he looks up and speaks.

                                 DR. PIMPLEDINK
                        It's her heart. Quite incurable,
                        I'm afraid.

           Leopold, all business, glances at his ruined watch, then
           speaks quietly to Grod.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Progress favors the strong.

           As Leopold and Grod walk by Miss Understood, Grod looks
           down and laughs wickedly.

           INT. INDERGARTEN CLOCK & REPAIR SHOP - LATER

           Karl is just shutting the trap door when Leopold enters
           his shop.  Karl looks as if he hasn't slept, but Leopold's
           entrance shocks him mightily nonetheless. The menacing
           shape of Grod looms outside the storefront window,
           gigantic.

           Karl considers speaking, then decides against it. He can't
           be sure whether Leopold recognizes him or not -- or if
           he'd care if he did.  Karl bows his head humbly and moves
           behind the counter, where Leopold places his watch.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Irreparable, I suspect.

           As Karl inspects the watch, Leopold moves about the shop,
           looking at the clocks on the wall.

           (NOTE: the ticking of the clocks can be used to fine
           dramatic effect within this scene.)
                                 LEOPOLD
                        An exact science, time. From a
                        numerical perspective.

           Karl glances up, but says nothing.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        I am a devout student of precision.
                        I find that while few appreciate
                        its subtleties, most will pay
                        handsomely for its benefits.

           As Leopold continues to tour the shop, Pim emerges from
           hiding, looking vexed. Pim has decided to hate Leopold,
           and he makes a motion as if rolling up his sleeves for a
           fight.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Truth be told, our professions are
                        not so very different. We are
                        both... vendors of precision, shall
                        we say.

           Pim moves toward Leopold, fully prepared to fight him.
           Karl remains absorbed in his work.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Soon enough, the world shall meet
                        the successor to Emma Cuddles,
                        courtesy of Cuddlecom Incorporated.
                        And my technicians assure me that
                        she shall surpass every consumer
                        expectation.

           Karl glances up and spies Pim, advancing confidently
           toward Leopold.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Every toy store on the planet will
                        be mobbed.

           Pim picks up one of Karl's tools, which he wields like a
           spear.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Every wallet will be emptied.

           Pim approaches Leopold's hand, now resting on the counter,
           and raises his weapon to strike.
                                 LEOPOLD
                        And every last ear on earth shall
                        echo with the name...

           Just as Pim is about to stab Leopold, Karl sweeps him into
           a drawer -- and shuts it quickly.

           Leopold turns to face Karl, who smiles innocently. Their
           faces are mere inches apart.

                                 LEOPOLD
                              (beat)
                        ... Emma Obeys.

           Karl returns to his work and is immediately absorbed.
           Leopold, meanwhile, spies the mysterious leather-bound
           tome that Karl has been reading throughout the film.  He
           turns the cover toward him, and we see its title.

           INSERT - BOOK COVER

           which reads "Anatomy of the Human Brain."

           BACK TO SCENE

           Leopold opens the book and begins to page absently through
           it as he speaks. Within the book are detailed medical
           illustrations of the brain and its many parts.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Her intelligence, while admittedly
                        artificial, remains sublime -- a
                        testament to the irresistible force
                        of modernization.

           Leopold turns a page.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        As our advertising suggests, she is
                        an absolute marvel...

           Leopold again turns the page of the book.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        ... obedient to her master in every
                        conceivable respect -- without
                        concern for consequence.

           Leopold slams the book shut.
                                 LEOPOLD
                        Just as the consumer is obedient to
                        me.

           Karl glances at the book, then at Leopold. Leopold glares
           intensely at Karl, who is unable to hold his gaze.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        So tell me, can it be fixed?

           Karl, eyes downcast, slides the golden watch across the
           counter. Leopold inspects it, and it seems even better
           than before. Even Leopold is slightly taken aback that the
           watch has been repaired in mere minutes.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Hm. Imagine that.

           Leopold slides a large gold coin across the counter and
           exits.

           Karl opens the drawer, and Pim bounds out, swinging his
           fists and dancing around like a boxer -- until he realizes
           that Leopold is gone.

           Karl locks the door, draws the shades, and places the
           "closed" sign in the window. Pim runs for the trap door
           and struggles mightily to open it, but of course it's far
           too heavy.

           When Karl does open the door, Pim bounds down the stairs,
           and Karl quickly follows, glancing mysteriously from side
           to side before closing the door with a resounding thud.

           INT. AGATHA'S ROOM - MORNING

           The following morning, Agatha awakes to the sound of
           trucks and machinery.  She hurries to the window and gazes
           down at the park.

           Giant trucks haul trailers bearing huge machines of
           destruction: backhoes, bulldozers, and the like. Surveyors
           take stock of the park while men begin to unload the
           machines.

                                 AGATHA
                        Oh no!  No!
           Agatha watches as the workmen prepare for the park's
           demise. And then she spies her father, moving among the
           men.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Leopold walks among the workmen with Grod and one of the
           new dolls, Emma Obeys.  Clearly more sophisticated than
           Emma Cuddles, Emma Obeys is like an android, moving
           robotically at Leopold's side.

           As the three walk across the building site, amazed workmen
           stand aside to let them pass, staring at Emma Obeys.
           Though decidedly creepy, she truly is amazing to them --
           though hardly impressive when one considers Karl's
           marvelous inventions.

           Leopold notes their amazement with satisfaction and
           decides to give them a demonstration.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        My goodness, progress does make one
                        rather thirsty. Emma, would you be
                        so kind?

           To the workmen's increasing amazement, Emma totters over
           to a canteen and pours Leopold a cup of coffee. She begins
           to bring it to him.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Ah ah! You know how I take it, Emma
                        -- like our future together.

           Emma Obeys mixes lots of sugar into the cup, then brings
           it to Leopold, who drinks.

                                 LEOPOLD
                              (to himself)
                        Sweet.

           Never taking his eyes from Emma, the FOREMAN approaches.

                                 FOREMAN
                        Should be ready by tomorrow,
                        governor. Got the lads workin'
                        triple shifts.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        That is satisfactory. And what time
                        might we commence?
                                 FOREMAN
                        Well before dawn, Mr. Croak, if you
                        like.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Excellent.  Time is money, you
                        know.

                                 FOREMAN
                        Yes, Mr. Croak.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Tomorrow dawns a new day in the
                        global economy.  Make a note of
                        that, Emma. We shouldn't want to
                        miss our appointment with...
                        destiny.

           Emma produces a small pad and a tiny pencil -- and begins
           scribbling. The workmen gasp in amazement.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Plastics, gentlemen! We shall forge
                        our future in plastics!

           INT. AGATHA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Agatha continues to stare down at the park in dismay. And
           as she surveys the park's impending doom, she spies
           Karlheinz, hiding in the shadows of an alley.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Karl gazes on his tree, now on its last leg, and sighs.
           Only a single leaf remains. Then he looks up at Agatha.

           INT. AGATHA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Agatha waves sadly to Karl.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Karl stares up at Agatha, and the sight of her breaks his
           heart. He wipes a solitary tear from his eye and walks
           away, retreating into the alley.

           EXT. VILLAGE ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
           As Karl walks through the alley, a chill wind picks up,
           and he pulls his collar high against the cold. Everything
           about Karl and the alley speak of defeat and gloom.

           Suddenly, as Karl rounds a corner, he's hit in the face by
           an enormous pair of LADY'S UNDERPANTS, caught by the wind.

           Karl pulls the underwear off his head and inspects them.
           And as he holds the massive bloomers, a very fat, very
           cross WASHERWOMAN waddles out of her back yard (little
           more than a patch of dirt) and snatches them away.

                                 WASHERWOMAN
                        Degenerate!

           Karl shrugs innocently. But as the washerwoman returns to
           her work, she grabs two CLOTHESPINS and affixes the
           underwear to her clothesline.

           Karl focuses on a clothespin, and his eyes blaze with the
           fires of inspiration.

           The washerwoman turns and gives Karl a dirty look. He
           blows her a kiss and hurries off.

           EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - NIGHT

           FOCUS on a sewer grate, where water and detritus trickle
           into the sewers below.

           (NOTE: the sound of water trickling into the sewer should
           indicate a cavernous space.)

           As people's feet walk by, we hear the faint sounds of
           metalwork -- light hammering and such. Faint lights
           flicker from the grate as well.

           Pim appears from below and peeps through the grate,
           keeping watch. He looks both ways, grinning mischievously.
           He then slips and falls, and it's several seconds before
           we hear the splash.

           INT. SEWER - CONTINUOUS

           Karl stands in a cavernous section of the village sewers,
           surrounded by sheets of metal, large cogs and wheels, and
           miscellaneous tools of every sort. A few candles light the
           space.
           Pim has fallen in a pool of water. He crawls out and
           shakes himself.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Do be careful, Pim!

           Karl and Pim stand together and gaze up at something we
           cannot see. The angle should indicate that they're looking
           at something enormously tall.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        We're almost done.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - MORNING

           Very early the following morning, long before dawn,
           Leopold's construction workers assemble at the park.  Men
           oil the bulldozer and backhoe engines, and men with
           assorted hand tools mill about in readiness.

           A light rain is slowly turning the dirt to mud.

           Leopold, Grod, and Emma Obeys appear before the crowd, and
           Leopold seems especially regal. Grod holds an umbrella
           over the man.

           As Leopold reaches the edge of the park, the foreman
           approaches with a shovel, offering it to him. Leopold
           looks at the man as if he's lost his mind.

                                 FOREMAN
                        It's custom, governor. The chief
                        always breaks ground first. Can't
                        imagine what the men would think if
                        we did otherwise.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Neither can I.

           Leopold grasps the shovel and steps into the park. He
           pauses --and stares at the sorrowful tree, a mere shadow
           of its former self. Leopold raises the shovel high in the
           air -- and impales the earth with his thrust.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Let the future begin!

           Bulldozers and backhoes burst to life, roaring and
           rumbling deafeningly. The ground seems to shake with the
           noise.
           INT. ORPHANAGE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           In the far corner of the children's bedroom, William
           suddenly awakes with a start. He waits, then shrugs it off
           and tries again to sleep.

           William's bed shakes perceptibly.

           William gasps, now fully awake, and sits bolt upright. He
           waits.

           The bed shakes again, more noticeably than before, and
           William's eyes widen.

                                 WILLIAM
                              (whispering)
                        There's a monster under my bed.

           William waits again, and sure enough, the floorboards
           suddenly crack, and his bed is lifted several inches off
           the ground.

                                 WILLIAM
                              (loudly)
                        There's a monster under my bed!

           The other children awake in wonder, even as the walls
           begin to shake.  William looks as if he's riding a bronco,
           trying desperately to hold on to his bed. He couldn't be
           happier.

                                 WILLIAM
                              (triumphantly)
                        There's a monster under my bed!

           William is finally tossed from the bed, but he leaps right
           up. The other children pull him to safety.

           The children gasp as a phenomenally huge CLOCKWORK DRAGON
           bursts through the floor -- and ceiling -- and towers
           above them all. Its size dwarfs everything we've seen in
           the film thus far. It is huge beyond reason.

           The dragon suddenly ducks its mammoth head to eye-level
           with William. The other children cower before its fearful
           fangs, horns, talons, and tongue. But William is beside
           himself with joy.
           The dragon winks slyly at William, then leaps into the
           sky, spreading its wings far above.  Shingles and other
           harmless debris rain down upon the children.

           As they stare up, a small card floats down with the
           debris, and William catches it. He removes the tiny card
           from its envelope.

           INSERT - CARD

           which reads "With kind regards from K. Indergarten" in the
           same magnificently delicate, flowing script.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Miss Understood appears at the children's side, clothed in
           her tattered nightgown, robe, and slippers.  She appears
           to have largely recovered from a health standpoint, but
           she's terribly confused by what has just transpired, much
           to our amusement.

           EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE VILLAGE STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           The clockwork dragon soars high above the village,
           glistening even in the dark sky. It gazes down at the park
           -- and the tree.

           The bulldozers have begun their assault on the park,
           tearing up the earth. They advance steadily toward the
           tree.

           As the dragon dives downward, hurtling toward the park,
           lightning flashes, illuminating it.

           The workmen point upwards at the dragon in fear, running
           this way and that.

           Leopold, Grod, and Emma Obeys stare up at the dragon,
           unmoved.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK  - CONTINUOUS

           The dragon lands amidst the bulldozers with a thud that
           shakes the earth, positioning itself between the machines
           and the tree.

           Men quickly abandon their shovels and machines and run
           screaming from the job site.
           The dragon eyes the machines, assessing their size and
           weight. And with a swish of his colossal tail, he strikes
           one of the bulldozers, sending the huge vehicle hurtling
           into a factory on the opposite side of the park. His
           strength is tremendous.

           With a blow from his mighty paw, he dispatches another
           machine similarly.

           Leopold stands beneath Grod's umbrella, frowning but
           otherwise calm.

           An unmanned bulldozer plods steadily toward the tree.

           EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           Pim exits Karl's shop and sprints up the street, a tiny
           brown paper package tied to the end of his tail.

           The village is still bathed in darkness, and as Pim runs
           past a dark hole in a wall, FELINE EYES appear.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           The dragon slowly approaches a tall crane. Lunging
           forward, it snaps the crane in its powerful jaws, then
           crushes a truck beneath its foot.

           The unmanned bulldozer continues toward the tree, as yet
           unnoticed by the dragon.

           EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           Pim stops running for a moment to get his bearings. He
           looks directly at Agatha's spire and makes straight for
           it.

           As he does, a lean and mangy ALLEY CAT springs onto Pim's
           path. The clockwork mouse spins on a dime and heads
           another direction.

           As the cat chases Pim at breakneck speeds, the commotion
           awakens other cats, who join the chase.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           The dragon dispatches the few remaining trucks and
           machines, crushing them or sending them hurtling into the
           factories surrounding the park.
           The dragon notices the unmanned bulldozer just as its
           blade is bearing down upon the dying oak.

           With shocking speed, the dragon swishes its tail and sends
           the bulldozer hurtling into the building directly behind
           Leopold, Grod, and Emma Obeys.

           Glass and debris rain down on their umbrella, but they
           remain strangely calm.

           EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           Pim looks up to see that he's headed away from Agatha's
           spire, so he executes a series of acrobatics to redirect
           himself.

           The cats slide and tumble in the rain but keep up the
           chase, the fastest of them nearly nipping at Pim's tail.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           The dragon surveys the park, having done its job. It looks
           one way, then another. And then it spies Leopold.

           Its eyes narrow, as do his.

           With slow and colossally heavy steps, the dragon
           approaches Leopold.

           EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           Pim gazes up at Agatha's tower, which is now quite close,
           and takes a wrong turn.

           Pim sprints to the end of the alley, which is a dead end.
           His little claws can find no purchase on the walls, which
           are wet with the downpour.

           The cats slowly approach, looking especially ugly in the
           rain.  Lightning FLASHES forebodingly, and thunder
           RUMBLES.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           The dragon walks up to Leopold and stares down at him.
           Leopold seems not the slightest bit intimidated.

           The dragon quickly lowers itself, close to the ground, and
           looks Leopold square in the face.
           EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           The cats advance on Pim, who holds his brown paper package
           protectively.

           As they approach, a shadowy form leaps high over the cats
           -- and skids to a stop before Pim.

           We recognize the MANGY DOG to whom Karl fed a crust of
           bread upon his return to the village. Pim had scolded him
           at the time, and now the favor is returned.

           The dog turns to face the cats, snarling a vicious snarl.

           The cats, with confidence in numbers, withdraw their claws
           and grin.

           The beginnings of a bark rumble in the dog's throat.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           The dragon assesses Leopold and raises its neck again.

           EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           The rumble in the dog's throat mounts ever closer to its
           fruition.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           With the speed of a viper, the dragon's head swoops to
           within inches of Leopold's face, and it roars the loudest
           roar ever roared.

           EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           The dragon's roar commences just as the dog has chosen to
           bark.  But the dragon's roar is so impossibly loud that it
           drowns out all other sound.

           The cats stare at the dog in shock, thinking the roar is
           his.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           The roar continues, sound waves washing over Leopold,
           Grod, and Emma Obeys like a tempest.

           EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - CONTINUOUS
           The dog continues to bark, inaudibly, and the cats
           continue to stare at him, aghast.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           The dragon's roar continues unabated, and as it does,
           factory windows begin to vibrate.

           And one by one, they start to shatter.

           As the dragon's roar reaches its crescendo, all the
           windows pop, and countless tons of shattered glass tinkle
           to the ground.

           The dragon's roar ends abruptly.

           EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           The dog stops barking simultaneously. It eyes the alley
           cats doubtfully, wondering what will happen next.

           The alley cats slowly retract their claws and back away,
           terrified.

           The dog turns to Pim, who bows low in thanks. He offers
           his hand, and the dog lifts his paw, which Pim shakes.
           And with a wave, Pim scurries off with his package.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Leopold smoothes his hair and straightens his tie as the
           dragon awaits his response.  It's Leopold's move.

           Calmly collecting himself, Leopold finally appears ready.
           He turns to Emma Obeys.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Emma?  Attack.

           The doll immediately obeys, tottering toward the dragon.

           The dragon looks at Leopold as if to say, "You must be
           joking." And with a tremendous stomp, he squashes Emma
           Obeys with finality.

           Leopold breathes in a deep breath of air and yells.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        I said attack!
           As the bewildered dragon looks to every side, Emma Obeys
           dolls flow from the broken factory windows in hordes. They
           are innumerable, ant-like, and awful. They sprint for the
           dragon and begin to cover him, ripping at his armor with
           their tiny hands.

           The dragon comes to his senses and shakes them off, then
           swings his tail.  The true battle has begun, and the rain
           intensifies.

           EXT. AGATHA'S TOWER - CONTINUOUS

           Pim looks up, standing at the base of Agatha's tower. As
           he does, Emma Obeys dolls begin to smack the building
           around him, dispatched by the dragon.

           Pim squeezes under the door, his package in tow.

           INT. AGATHA'S TOWER - CONTINUOUS

           Pim stands before a winding staircase that seems
           practically infinite. His shoulders droop with fatigue,
           but he musters his energy and mounts the steps.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           As the dragon writhes and fights, thousands of the dolls
           are crushed, dismembered, and sent flying into the sea and
           countryside. But even as he kills one, five more spring to
           take its place.

           Swarming over the dragon, the dolls' tiny hands slowly
           begin to do their damage, tearing the dragon apart, piece
           by little piece.

           INT. AGATHA'S TOWER - CONTINUOUS

           Pim drags himself over the top step and collapses, leaning
           on the brown paper package.

           Pim then notices an elevator, which he could easily have
           taken had he noticed it at ground level. Pim rolls his
           eyes at his own stupidity.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Leopold watches grimly as the fight continues. As he does,
           dolls fly by him at hundreds of miles an hour, courtesy of
           the dragon. But he and Grod remain immobile, even as the
           carnage mounts around them.
           INT. AGATHA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Agatha stands at her window, staring down at the battle.
           It's not quite morning, but the sound has awoken her. She
           stands in her nightgown, watching, when she hears a little
           noise behind her.

           Pim squeezes under the door, then pulls the tiny package
           under as well.

                                 AGATHA
                        Hello!

           Pim bows low, charming as always. He then presents the
           package to the girl.

                                 AGATHA
                        Oh, but I mustn't! I'm allergic to
                        brown paper packages tied up with
                        strings!

           Pim cocks his head, then removes a tiny card from the
           package, which he offers to Agatha.

           Agatha turns rather green.

                                 AGATHA
                        I'm so sorry. Notecards make me
                        nauseous.

           Pim won't take no for an answer.

                                 AGATHA
                        Well, alright. But I can tell you,
                        cucumber tea isn't very pleasant
                        coming up.

           Agatha takes the card and reads aloud -- slowly, as a six-
           year-old would read.

                                 AGATHA
                        With kind regards from...
                        kindergarten.

           Pim holds the package aloft, and Agatha burps, holding
           back her nausea as best she can.

                                 AGATHA
                        I've never gotten a present before.
                        Well, not one I ever got to open.
           Agatha unwraps the package, and whatever is inside makes
           her face glow with a golden radiance. A smile spreads
           slowly across her face.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Still swinging its tail and squashing Emma Obeys with both
           its feet and jaws, the dragon watches as infinite dolls
           continue to stream from the factory windows. In every
           direction lie thousands of the things, dead or dying, but
           the dragon knows it's hopeless.

           With a final burst of strength, the dragon spreads its
           wings and leaps into the air, still covered in thousands
           of plastic dolls. He twists and turns, attempting to shake
           them loose, but they cling to him, ripping away at his
           metal flesh.

           As Leopold watches, LIGHTNING STRIKES the dragon, setting
           the dolls ablaze.

           Horrifically, the burning dolls take no notice of the
           flames, but continue to tear at the dragon's hide.

           The searing heat intensifies, and the dragon begins to
           MELT in agonizing fashion. Molten metal drips from every
           pore.

           The dragon's contortions take it over the harbor, and
           suddenly, its eyes fade, and its clockwork ceases to
           function.  It drops into the harbor, dead.

           EXT. ORPHANAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Now in shambles, the orphanage still offers enough shelter
           for Miss Understood to protect the children, but William
           breaks free from her grasp and runs outside, weeping at
           his monster's demise.

                                 WILLIAM
                        No!

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           From across the park, Grod hears William's heartrending
           cry and points at him mockingly, laughing as only Grod can
           laugh.

           EXT. ORPHANAGE - CONTINUOUS
           William sees Grod laughing, and his sorrow changes visibly
           to anger.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Leopold surveys the damage that's been done. Emma Obeys
           dolls lie in heaps, and the factories are badly damaged.
           Many dolls totter about without limbs or heads, but many
           are still intact as well. The construction machines are
           ruined beyond repair, and the tree remains -- defying him.

           As Leopold walks through the battlefield, he picks up a
           small piece of the dragon and looks on it, confused. It is
           intricate and marvelous.

           The rain abates, slowing to a drip, as the sun dawns on
           the village.

           And as Leopold studies the piece of clockwork, a child's
           hand grasps his.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Agatha!

           Agatha peers up at her father, smiling. On the end of her
           nose is a marvelously ornate, golden clothespin -- Karl's
           handiwork.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        But your allergies!

                                 AGATHA
                        But I'm absolutely fine, father,
                        for I cannot smell a thing!

           (NOTE: Agatha's voice, with the clothespin in place, is
           nasally in a cute, endearing way.)

           Leopold is dumbfounded.  He seems moved, more moved than
           we have ever seen him. But he quickly recovers himself,
           again cold and emotionless.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Well, you are about to learn a
                        valuable lesson, Agatha: progress
                        in the face of adversity.

                                 AGATHA
                        I'm so glad that I'm here with you.
                                 LEOPOLD
                        Indeed.  Your timing is impeccable.

                                 AGATHA
                        Like clockwork!

           The word hits Leopold like a ton of bricks, and he drops
           Agatha's hand to stare at his watch.  He knows who made
           the dragon.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Clockwork!

           Agatha watches, confused, as Leopold walks over to Grod.
           He speaks in low tones and points to his watch.

           Grod smiles wickedly and nods, cracking his knuckles. And
           Grod lumbers off toward Karl's shop.

           Knowing Grod to be evil, Agatha begins to put two and two
           together. The watch, the mouse, the dragon, her
           clothespin: all must have come from the same man -- from
           "Kindergarten," as she thinks of him.

                                 AGATHA
                              (alarmed)
                        Where is he going?

                                 LEOPOLD
                        To remove an obstacle...

           Leopold turns and eyes the tree malevolently.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        ... just as we are going to do.

           As workmen begin to reappear, Leopold takes charge,
           heading for the tree.  In the opposite direction, Grod has
           already disappeared from sight.

           Agatha looks back and forth, torn between the tree and
           Karl.  But she can't take a chance.

           She runs after Grod as fast as she can.

           INT. INDERGARTEN CLOCK & REPAIR SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Karlheinz sits at his workbench, using an enormous
           magnifying glass to work on some tiny object.  His medical
           journal on the human brain sits open at his side. As Karl
           stares down at his work, his focus and concentration are
           tremendous.

           We see, through the magnifying glass, that the object of
           Karl's attention is a tiny mechanical bug -- smaller than
           a mosquito.

           Karl finishes his task, then uses tiny tweezers to place
           the bug in a curious container, next to dozens of other
           bugs of similar size and shape. Though the bugs are tiny,
           each is remarkably complex and ornate.

           The container, a GOLDEN ORB, is lined with plush velvet,
           and it's obvious that each mechanical insect has its own
           little place within the design of the fabric.  Though
           we're well aware of the speed at which Karl works, it's
           obvious that this must surely be his greatest invention of
           all.

           Karl gazes down at the bugs.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                              (softly)
                        It's the little things that have
                        the most potential.

           Karl closes the orb, which clicks shut with a very
           satisfactory sound.  And just as he does, Pim comes
           rushing in through a chink by the door.

           Pim is terribly alarmed.

           Pim tugs on Karl's shirt, then begins to pantomime, doing
           an impression of Grod. Karl furrows his brow and tries to
           interpret as Pim uses two pencils as stilts.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Gargantuan.

           Pim leaps down, then cleverly simulates amputation of his
           own tail.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Gruesome.

           Pim does his best Frankenstein imitation.

                                 KARLHEINZ
                        Goon.
           The door to Karl's shop bursts asunder to reveal Grod. Too
           large to fit through the doorframe, Grod pounds each side
           with a club-like fist, splintering the wood to allow him
           entrance.

           Pim, terrified, leaps into Karl's shirt pocket. Karl has
           no such place to hide.

           Karl's first concern seems to be for the golden orb, which
           he scoops up in his hands.

           Grod advances on Karl, and Karl tries to make a break for
           the door. But the huge man is surprisingly quick, and in
           one flowing movement, he strikes Karl hard in the face,
           then backhands him on the upswing.  Karl's body flies into
           a wall, and he collapses, unconscious.

           The golden orb rolls under a bookshelf, out of sight.

           Grod produces a length of rope, which he uses to bind
           Karl's entire body in a sort of cocoon. But as he's
           absorbed in the task, Pim creeps from Karl's pocket and
           sneaks away to hide.

           Grod ties off the rope and easily hoists Karl to his
           shoulder. He turns to exit the shop.

           Agatha stands in the doorframe.

                                 AGATHA
                        Put him down this instant.

           Grod advances toward the door.

                                 AGATHA
                        My name is Agatha Croak, and you
                        are in the service of my father!

           Grod's advance hastens.

                                 AGATHA
                        I will not let you take
                        kindergarten!

           Grod looms over Agatha and makes a move as if to strike
           her. Agatha stands her ground, but she closes her eyes in
           fear.

           Just before Grod's hand smacks Agatha's face, it stops --
           and removes the golden clothespin from Agatha's nose.
           Agatha's eyes open in alarm, and she breathes in a
           multitude of scents. She is almost immediately
           incapacitated, and she falls to the floor of the shop,
           twitching.

           EXT. INDERGARTEN CLOCK & REPAIR SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Grod exits the shop, carrying Karlheinz, and smiles
           cruelly as he tosses Agatha's clothespin high onto a
           nearby rooftop. He then strides off toward the docks.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

           The clothespin lies on the rooftop for several seconds.
           But even as we wait, we hear a metallic scuttling sound.

           Toby, clad in his spider vest, stoops and picks up the
           clothespin, which he examines with interest.

           EXT. INDERGARTEN CLOCK & REPAIR SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           The door to Karl's shop in pieces, light streams out onto
           the street.  Although it's morning, the perpetual soot and
           smog cast their usual pall over the village. Agatha
           writhes just within the shop.

           From the shadows and alleys appear children, one by one,
           who approach the shop with caution.

           As they do, we realize that each child bears some device
           that Karl has made.  He didn't just help a few kids; he's
           helped them all somehow.

           As this charming realization sinks in, Toby scuttles down
           a wall, and his spider legs retract. Stuart joins him, a
           satchel over his shoulder, and the two enter Karl's shop.

           INT. INDERGARTEN CLOCK & REPAIR SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Toby places the clothespin back on Agatha's nose, and she
           slowly revives. The two boys help her to her feet. As
           Agatha comes to her senses, she remembers the ordeal and
           cries out.

                                 AGATHA
                        Kindergarten!

                                 STUART
                        You're the girl in the tower.
                                 TOBY
                        You're allergic to everything.

                                 AGATHA
                        Yes!  Especially little boys with
                        no sense whatsoever!

           Toby and Stuart exchange glances.

                                 STUART
                        Your voice sounds funny.

                                 AGATHA
                        Don't you see? They've taken him!
                        And now it's all up to us!

           Just then, the three hear a sound and turn. It's Pim, and
           he's rolling the orb out from under the bookshelf.

                                 AGATHA
                        Hello again!

           Pim wastes no time but rolls the orb to Agatha's feet and
           points at it imploringly. Agatha stoops to pick it up.

                                 AGATHA
                        There's an inscription.

           Agatha and the boys pause to read the inscription, which
           we do not see.

                                 AGATHA
                              (to herself)
                        The tree.

           Agatha seems to understand everything at once, and she
           takes charge. She runs outside the shop, followed by Pim.
           The boys look at each other and follow in a rush.

           EXT. INDERGARTEN CLOCK & REPAIR SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           The assorted other children are meeker than these three,
           and they watch as the leaders make their quick decisions.

                                 AGATHA
                        I must get to the tree at once, if
                        only there's still time!

           Toby's spider legs sprout out of his back, and he looks
           down at Agatha.
                                 TOBY
                        Leave that to me.

           Agatha nods and turns to Stuart.

                                 AGATHA
                        It's up to you to save
                        kindergarten.

                                 STUART
                        All by myself?

           Pim scurries up Stuart's leg and chest to his shoulder,
           where he presents himself to the group.

                                 AGATHA
                        Of course not!

           Stuart looks doubtfully at Pim, who hops around excitedly,
           hungry for action.

                                 AGATHA
                        Well, come on! We haven't time for
                        hugs and kisses!

           Toby and Stuart grimace at the thought.

                                 STUART AND TOBY
                        Thank goodness!

           Toby scoops up Agatha and places her astride him. She
           holds the orb protectively.  As soon as she's secure, Toby
           scurries up the side of a building and hops away over the
           rooftops.

           Stuart turns to Pim.

                                 STUART
                        Which way?

           Pim shrugs, and a small voice suddenly speaks.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        To the sea!

           Stuart and Pim look down at Stuart's satchel, which hangs
           near his waist.  From within peeks the whaling ship
           Captain, the tiny metal man who killed the roach. The
           Captain is peering toward the harbor with his telescope.
           The other children, small and frightened, watch as Stuart
           sprints for the docks.

           EXT. HARBOR - CONTINUOUS

           Grod stands before a large steamer, which is clearly
           preparing to depart.  Cargo is being loaded and secured,
           and the ship's crew are releasing the vessel from its
           moorings.

           As the ship slowly pulls away, Grod tosses the unconscious
           Karlheinz into a lifeboat hanging at the back of the ship,
           where he lands amid the life vests. And there he remains
           as the steamer puts to sea.

           Grod wipes his hands, his dirty business finished.

           We hear something WHISTLE through the air.

           Grod looks down at his leg, where something is sticking.
           He pulls it out with two massive fingers and inspects it:
           a miniature harpoon.

           Grod turns to find a rather frightened Stuart and Pim
           standing a few yards behind him. But the whaling ship
           Captain stands atop Stuart's satchel, undaunted. Clearly
           it was he who through the harpoon.

           Grod gives Stuart a look as if to say, "You've just made a
           very unwise decision." And he moves toward the boy with
           malice in his eyes.  Then he stops.

           Behind Stuart, William appears atop a stack of wooden
           crates. William regards Grod coldly.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Get him.

           Stuart looks up at William and points hesitantly at
           himself, as if to ask, "Who, me?" William continues to
           stare coldly at Grod and screams with rage.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I said get him!

           All around William appear hordes of Emma Obeys. They
           assemble around the little boy, and Grod's eyes widen in
           fear. The dolls stare, unblinking. And then, moving as a
           single unit, they descend and attack.
           Grod kicks and crushes a few of the frontrunners, but when
           the wave of dolls hits him, it hits him hard.

           Grod is soon invisible under the dolls, but he's strong
           enough to lumber off, even under the weight of so much
           plastic. William is still furious and shakes his fist.

                                 WILLIAM
                        That's for my monster!

           The dolls assault Grod with their little fists as he
           disappears in the distance, a moving mound of Emma Obeys -
           -with many more chasing behind.

           The menace dispatched, William and Stuart stare out at the
           steamer, now fading into the horizon.

                                 STUART
                        We're too late.

           Pim scurries into Stuart's satchel, and the little boy
           understands his meaning. He opens the bag and removes the
           whaling ship, where preparations for the journey are
           already under way.

           Tiny men scale the rigging as Stuart places the boat in
           the ocean.  The sails unfurl. Pim and the Captain stand on
           the deck and look up at the boy.

                                 STUART
                        You must save kindergarten.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Aye. That we will.

           Stuart is sad to see his little ship go, but he knows it's
           the only way.

                                 STUART
                        Well then... good luck.  I'll...
                        I'll miss you, Captain.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Captain?  I'm only the first mate,
                        my boy.  You're the Captain!

           Humbled but intensely pleased, Stuart gazes on the Captain
           with love, then gathers himself dutifully and salutes.
           The Captain and Pim return the salute with considerable
           pride, and the tiny vessel sets sail on the rolling ocean.
           As it does, the crew sings a cadence.

                                 CREW
                          Adventure lies before us,
                          Yo ho, yo ho.
                          The salt air washes o'er us,
                          Yo ho, yo ho.
                          We leave behind our hearth and house,
                          To brave the waves
                          with a clockwork mouse,
                          And drink rum, rum, rum, rum,
                          Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho.

           Pim stands at the front of the ship, whiskers twitching.
           He stares into the distance, intent on finding his master.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Leopold has assembled the workmen around the tree, where
           he stands holding an AXE.  Though his plans have been
           forestalled, he will not allow them to be thwarted. The
           workmen listen politely as Leopold speaks from among the
           wreckage.

           In the background, we see Toby and Agatha come into view
           atop a building. And as Leopold begins his speech, they
           scuttle down.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Commerce!

           It's intensely quiet -- eerily so. The universe seems to
           hang on Leopold's every word.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        It is both our master... and our
                        slave. We enter the world with
                        nothing... and spend the remainder
                        of our lives scraping and
                        struggling to rectify this fact.
                        Indeed, when primitive man first
                        stood upright, it was not to taste
                        the breeze or hum some witless
                        ditty. It was to consume, to seek
                        tools and possessions: the
                        instruments of progress.  And
                        somewhere, deep in his
                        subconscious, a voice commanded,
                        "Let nothing stand against you. For
                        possession is your birthright, as a
                        man!"

           The workmen look on, not fully understanding.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Today we have seen hardship.
                        Today, those who would stand
                        against us sought to tear asunder
                        the very fabric of society itself.
                        But progress is a machine far
                        greater than any we have seen
                        today.  And progress will not be
                        waylaid by any force or scheme.
                        Progress is our god, gentlemen! And
                        with this stroke, I pay tribute to
                        its power!

           Leopold raises the axe to swing, his eyes cold and
           unfeeling.

           He brings the axe down -- and suddenly swings wide,
           looking rather foolish in the process. The axe buries
           itself harmlessly in the ground.

           Agatha has stepped between her father and the tree.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Agatha! What is the meaning of
                        this?

           Agatha holds the orb before her, offering it to Leopold.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        I have no time for baubles!

           Agatha comes close to her father and takes one of his
           hands. She places the orb in it, then looks up, into her
           father's eyes.

           Leopold studies the orb with mild interest.  It has an
           irresistible quality to it.

                                 LEOPOLD
                        What is it?

                                 AGATHA
                        A gift.  From a friend.
                                 LEOPOLD
                        A friend? I have no...

           Leopold catches himself and glances at the workmen, not
           wishing to admit his lack of friends in their presence.

           Leopold holds the orb to his face and discovers the
           inscription.

           INSERT - ORB

           which reads "To my dear friend Leopold. With kind regards
           from K. Indergarten."

           BACK TO SCENE

           Leopold studies the orb at length, then opens it. The man
           stares down at the tiny insects, confused.

           The insects then begin to come to life. They stand up and
           stretch their wings, then take to the air, one by one.

           Soon enough, dozens of tiny machines are hovering in a
           small cloud before Leopold.

           Leopold frowns, and Agatha smiles.

           THE SWARM DARTS into Leopold's NOSTRILS -- and is gone.

           Leopold pulls at his nose, making guttural sounds and
           grimacing, as if in pain. Agatha is frightened rather
           badly and backs away from the man.

           INT. LEOPOLD'S HEAD - CONTINUOUS

           We follow the insects as they swim through the passages
           within Leopold's head -- headed for his brain.

           The machines congregate in a specific region of the brain,
           then begin to transform and unite. Each becomes a sort of
           cog in an intricate little machine.

           And once the machine is complete, it begins to FUNCTION.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Leopold reels, staggers, and blinks wildly. Before him is
           the tree. And even as he gazes into its branches, the tree
           transforms, growing, blooming, and bearing fruit.
           Fairies dance among its leaves, SINGING some otherworldly
           song.

           The beauty of the tree and the volume of the fairies' song
           increase in intensity, and Leopold's eyes grow wide in
           wonder.

           Karlheinz has given Leopold an ARTIFICIAL IMAGINATION, to
           replace the one that was lost.

           Leopold is suddenly overcome, and as his eyes roll back
           into his head, he collapses.

           INT. PIMPLEDINK'S CLINIC - LATER

           (NOTE: everything about this scene should mirror Leopold's
           earlier visit to Pimpledink's clinic -- when he was a
           boy.)

           Agatha and Miss Understood, their faces fraught with
           worry, sit in a corner while Dr. Pimpledink examines
           Leopold.

           Agatha attempts a reassuring smile at her father, who sits
           without expression on an examining table.

           Pimpledink listens at Leopold's chest with a stethoscope.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        Mm hmm.

           Pimpledink peers down Leopold's throat with a tongue
           compressor.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        Mm hmm.

           Pimpledink tests a variety of Leopold's reflexes and
           performs assorted physical exams. When finished, the
           doctor turns to the pair in the corner with pride and
           relief.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        Ah ha.  Yes.  Healthy as a horse!

           Miss Understood raises an eyebrow, remembering the last
           time they were here.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Und you are certain?
                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        Perhaps... a final test.

           Pimpledink rustles through a drawer and removes a stack of
           papers, then sits next to Leopold.

           When he holds up a sheet, we see that it's a Rorschach
           test, obviously shaped like a butterfly.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        Tell me, Mr. Croak. What do you
                        see?

           All wait in suspense while Leopold considers.

                                 LEOPOLD
                              (beat)
                        A monarch butterfly, in the
                        springtime, wearing a hat.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        And this one?

                                 LEOPOLD
                        Siamese rhinoceri, conjoined at the
                        horn and having a spat.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                              (excitedly)
                        And this one?

           Leopold studies the ink blot for some time, and his face
           seems to soften as the image takes shape before him.

                                 LEOPOLD
                              (slowly)
                        Two little pirates, climbing a
                        tree. One is Karlheinz, the other
                        is me. One is struck down, his mind
                        rendered lame. The other's heart
                        breaks.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        But he wasn't to blame.

           All are silent until Pimpledink can control himself no
           longer. He rises excitedly and pulls Miss Understood into
           the hall, where Agatha can see and hear them through a
           crack in the door.
                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Und what is your prognosis, doctor?

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        But don't you see? He's regained
                        his imagination!

           Pimpledink leans toward the crack in the door, where he's
           well aware that Agatha is listening. He speaks with
           unbridled glee.

                                 PIMPLEDINK
                        And the condition... is quite
                        incurable, I'm afraid.

           Pimpledink winks at Agatha, who leaps to her feet and runs
           to embrace her father. He returns the embrace as if he's
           never had one before, hugging Agatha tightly and smiling
           the smile of one who has been pulled, last minute, from
           the abyss.

           EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - LATER

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           A) The factories and smokestacks are torn down and hauled
           away.

           B) Leopold and other villagers scrub clean the cobblestone
           streets.

           C) Tempting smells waft from bakeries.

           D) Pim's savior, the mangy dog, sits contentedly before a
           hearth, a sleeping child leaning against him.

           E) Two old men toast each other with pints of good, dark
           beer.

           DURING THE ABOVE:

                                 GRANDMOTHER V.O.
                        And that is how Karlheinz
                        Copernicus Indergarten came to save
                        his best and oldest friend, Leopold
                        Croak.  But Leopold was not the
                        only village resident to regain
                        what he had lost.  No, indeed. For
                        with his considerable fortune,
                        Leopold sought to right all the
                        wrongs he'd caused.  The factories
                        were torn down, the cobblestones
                        scrubbed clean. The bakeries were
                        rebuilt, and stray dogs were given
                        homes.  And within the cozy village
                        pub, twinkly-eyed old men were
                        highly encouraged to wet their
                        whistles, for it had been a long,
                        dry spell.

           INT. AGATHA'S NEW BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Agatha stands before a mirror, her long hair hiding most
           of her face. She picks up her golden clothespin and
           regards it, then uses it to tie back her hair, revealing a
           very pretty little girl indeed.

           DURING THE ABOVE:

                                 GRANDMOTHER V.O.
                        Agatha's recovery came as quite a
                        surprise to Dr. Pimpledink, but as
                        a grandmother, I can tell you this
                        much: pollution isn't good for
                        anyone, little children most of
                        all. Smog and soot and ghastly
                        fumes of every sort -- why, it's a
                        wonder anyone stayed well in such a
                        place.  And no pill or potion can
                        ever boast the healing properties
                        of crisp, clean air --
                        complemented, of course, by a
                        considerable dose of playtime.

           EXT. VILLAGE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Agatha runs toward the tree, which has recovered in the
           most magnificent way even Leopold could have imagined. As
           children play in its bows, he studies its health and
           smiles.

           DURING THE ABOVE:

                                 GRANDMOTHER V.O.
                        And play she did.  For the tree had
                        made the most dramatic recovery of
                        all.  Leopold himself had nursed it
                        back to health, often comparing
                        notes with the children on its
                        progress.  In fact, the oak's
                        progress, Leopold and Agatha
                        agreed, was far more interesting
                        than the progress one sees on a
                        flow chart, or in some corporate
                        presentation.  And so in some ways,
                        the progress of the village moved
                        backwards, rather than ahead,
                        depending on how you look at it.
                        But all agreed that they had gone
                        in the right direction.

           EXT. ORPHANAGE - LATER

           Still in its same spot across from the tree, Miss
           Understood's school is rebuilt in grand fashion.  On the
           day of the unveiling, a thick ribbon is strung across the
           door, and a cloth hangs over the sign above it.

                                 GRANDMOTHER (V.O.)
                        There was just one way that the
                        village was profoundly amended.
                        Miss Understood's Preparatory
                        School & Home for Orphaned Children
                        was rebuilt -- and at her
                        insistence, renamed.  But when at
                        last the unveiling was at hand,
                        dear Miss Understood refused. That
                        honor she bestowed on a favorite
                        former pupil.

           Miss Understood hands a cord to Leopold. And holding his
           breath, he pulls it.

           INSERT - SIGN

           which is in two sizes of font. In small letters above, it
           reads "WITH KIND REGARDS FROM." And in large letters
           beneath, it reads "KINDERGARTEN."

           BACK TO SCENE

           Leopold embraces Miss Understood, lifting her into the
           air. Agatha dances around them, and the crowd cheers.

           When things die down just slightly, Leopold puts Miss
           Understood back down, and she gazes up at him.

                                 MISS UNDERSTOOD
                        Ende gut, alles gut!

           Before Miss Understood can offer a muddled translation,
           Agatha jumps in.

                                 AGATHA
                        All's well that ends well!

           Our view gradually rises to a bird's eye view of the
           village, and Karl's clockwork butterfly flutters past.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MADELINE'S ROOM - MORNING

           Madeline stares at her Grandmother, and the Grandmother
           stares back.  The Grandmother is pleased with herself and
           delighted by the story, but Madeline is a tough read.
           Several moments pass as the old woman awaits a reaction,
           until finally, she can no longer wait.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        And what do you think of that?

                                 MADELINE
                        I think it's the greatest secret
                        I've ever heard.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Well, that will teach you to doubt
                        your Grandmother!

                                 MADELINE
                        But I don't believe it.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        What?

                                 MADELINE
                        It was a very good story. Very
                        creative. But the fact remains that
                        I'm a pessimist.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Yes, as your father said.

                                 MADELINE
                        So it must be true.  I suppose I
                        just can't help it.
                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Madeline, you're a tough nut to
                        crack.

                                 MADELINE
                        I'm not a nut! I'm a little girl!

           The Grandmother lunges at Madeline and tickles her a bit.
           Madeline screams and giggles.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        As a matter of fact, you're totally
                        nuts!

           The two regain their composure, smiling.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        But I love you just the same.

                                 MADELINE
                        I love you, too, Grandma.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Very well then. I'll inform the
                        troops that my mission has failed.

                                 MADELINE
                        Grandma?

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Yes, dear.

                                 MADELINE
                        What happened to Karlheinz?

           The Grandmother smiles, her back to Madeline.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        That is a different secret
                        altogether.

           The Grandmother exits the room, leaving Madeline to
           wonder.

           INT. MADELINE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The Grandmother descends the stairs to the kitchen, where
           Madeline's parents wait anxiously. She looks at each of
           them, then walks to the table, where a delicious breakfast
           is spread before her.
                                 MOM
                        Well?

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        I'm afraid you'd better call the
                        school.

                                 MOM
                        On her very first day?

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Unfortunately, someone has led
                        Madeline to believe...

           The Grandmother looks over her spectacles at Madeline's
           father.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        ... that she is a pessimist.

           The mother and grandmother both eye the father accusingly.
           He attempts a half-hearted grin and shrugs, knowing he's
           at fault.  He lifts a platter and offers it to the women.

                                 DAD
                        Bacon?

           INT. MADELINE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           There's a light knock at Madeline's door, and she retreats
           into her fort.

           After several seconds, her Grandfather enters and sits on
           the child's chair, placing one hand on her bed.

                                 GRANDFATHER
                        I understand that someone has her
                        doubts regarding kindergarten.

           Madeline peeks her head out.

                                 MADELINE
                        I don't want to go. They'll drop me
                        off, and I'll be all alone, without
                        any friends or anything!

                                 GRANDFATHER
                        I quite understand.

                                 MADELINE
                        You always understand, Grandpa.

           The Grandfather smiles, and his eyes twinkle a bit.

                                 GRANDFATHER
                        It isn't easy to be without a
                        friend.

           Madeline shakes her head in agreement.

                                 GRANDFATHER
                        So perhaps what you need... is a
                        new one.

           As Madeline stares at her ancient grandfather, not quite
           knowing what he means, there's a slight movement in his
           shirt pocket.

           And as Madeline stares in amazement, a familiar clockwork
           mouse suddenly bursts out of the pocket and sprints down
           his arm to the bed.  The mouse bows low to the little
           girl, charming as always.

                                 MADELINE
                        Pim!

           And just like that, Madeline is no longer a pessimist,
           thanks to Mr. Karlheinz Indergarten himself.

                                                              FADE OUT.

                                         THE END
