           EXT. SUBURBAN SOCCER FIELD (1979) - TORONTO - DAY 

           SLOW-MOTION. SILENCE. Elaborately padded teams of Seven- 
           Year-Old’s play in the mud, serious and focused. Parents 
           cheer. One holds an era-appropriate VCR recorder. 

           It’s cold. Steam rises from the kids as they run, kick, 
           cluster. The ball hits someone’s hand. A Referee blows 
           her whistle. Coaches wave their teams to the sidelines. 

           And we hear a FRIENDLY VOICE, a young man’s voice.

                                 FRIENDLY VOICE
                        At some point in your childhood, your 
                        parents probably said something to you 
                        along the lines of...

           A GOOD MOTHER kneels in front of her muddy YOUNG BOY. 

                                 THE GOOD MOTHER 
                        You can do anything you want.

           A GOOD FATHER stands behind her.

                                 THE GOOD FATHER 
                        Anything.

           Scared, the Boy turns back to the field where the Referee 
           sets the ball down for a penalty kick. 

                                 FRIENDLY VOICE
                        Now, see, that’s not exactly true.

           The Boy carefully back counts steps from the ball. A Girl 
           Goalie waits, chewing gum, tough.

           Behind him, the Boy’s teammates watch: skinny, fat, dark, 
           light, a handicapped kid, a girl in a head-scarf.

                                 FRIENDLY VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Sure, early on, the system is fixed to 
                        celebrate varying abilities. 

           The Boy eyes the ball intensely, bites his bottom lip.

                                 FRIENDLY VOICE (CONT’D)
                        But the not-so-pleasant reality is... 

           Whistle. He runs at the ball, hard, determined.

                                 FRIENDLY VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Most of us do not achieve our dreams. 
           He kicks too early, over zealous, clipping the ball. It 
           trickles to the Girl Goalie’s feet. She smirks.

                                 FRIENDLY VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Most of us are not destined for greatness. 

           The Good Mother forces an encouraging smile.

           INT. KITCHEN (1972) - DAY 

           The Good Mother shows the BABY BOY flashcards.

                                 MRS. REIDY
                        Klimt. Gustav Klimt.

           The Baby ignores her. Burps.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY (1979) - DAY 

           The YOUNG BOY (7) sits outside a principal’s office.

                                 A GOOD FATHER (O.S.)
                        We’re academics! How can he hate reading? 

           INT. STATION WAGON (1984) - DAY 

           The Good Father waits, impatient. The ADOLESCENT BOY (12) 
           gets in the car wearing a wig/costume from “Godspell”. 

                                 THE GOOD FATHER
                        Let’s go! We have to pick up cash for the 
                        Horn Tutor before Young Entrepreneurs. 
                                 (realizing)
                        Where’s your hockey bag?!

           EXT. DRIVE-WAY - DAY

           The Boy bikes off loaded down with newspapers. His bags 
           are far too full. He wobbles. Wobbles. Falls.

           INT. KITCHEN ALCOVE - DAY 

           The Boy rolls dice. He’s playing Monopoly with his parents 
           and IRRITATING BROTHER. He hits a hotel-laden property.

                                 THE IRRITATING BROTHER
                        I win! I win! Yes! I’m a Monopoly God!
           The Brother does a dance. The Boy grows furious, starts 
           throwing Monopoly bills at his Brother. They fight with 
           colored money. It fills the alcove like confetti.

           EXT. YARD - DAY

           A pile of leaves. A rake. The Boy lies in the grass and 
           listens to a BOOK-ON-TAPE, holds the cassette box... 

                                 YOU CAN BE RICH!

           The wind scatters a few leaves. He doesn’t notice. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           An EARNEST TEACHER stands in front of her Ernest Class.

                                 EARNEST TEACHER
                        Everybody write down your Life Goal. 

           The children put pen to paper.

                                 EARNEST TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        What you want to be. Or what you want to 
                        achieve. How you are going to be great.

           CLOSE on The Boy. He happily writes out his life goal. 

                                 FRIENDLY VOICE 
                        Thing is, for greatness to mean anything, 
                        most of us can never know it.

           We hold on the class a moment. Young. Hopeful. Doomed.

                                 FRIENDLY VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Just look around you. Here. 

           The screen flares to BRIGHT WHITE.

                                 FRIENDLY VOICE (CONT’D)
                        The biggest movie theaters hold roughly 
                        400 patrons. Even if it’s a lot less in 
                        your theater, look around. Go on. Look. 

           Nothing but WHITE to illuminate the theater. 

                                 FRIENDLY VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Statistically speaking, no one in here is 
                        going to win a Nobel Prize. Statistically, 
                        none of you will win a Super-Bowl ring. Or 
                        an Oscar. Pulitzer. Grammy. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRIENDLY VOICE (CONT’D)
                        You will not be the CEO. You will not be 
                        President. At best, one of you will see 
                        enough income to qualify as a high-net-
                        worth individual. 

           Silence. Still WHITE.

                                 FRIENDLY VOICE (CONT’D)
                        One. Maybe.

           The voice grows whispered, intimate, filtered from some 
           back corner of the theater.

                                 FRIENDLY VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Now, some you are telling yourself this 
                        doesn’t matter: you’ve got Jesus or good 
                        looks or a superior library. But one of 
                        you is thinking: “I’m gonna be the rich 
                        guy.” And to that person I say: there’s a 
                        job for you in pharmaceutical sales.

                                                                 CUT TO:

                                      [Main Title]

           OPENING CREDITS play over PHOTOGRAPHS of attractive young 
           men and women smiling at the camera. Pharmaceutical sales 
           representatives. Good suits. They’re all very clean and 
           generic. Each has a big American smile. A bit forced. Too 
           solicitous. Too nice. Too ambitious.

                                                                FADE IN:

           INT. FIRST CLASS AIRLINE CABIN (1997) - NIGHT

           The Boy’s become a young corporate guy. His name is JAMIE 
           REIDY (26). Talker. Charmer. Salesman. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
           leans past him to close his window shades.

                                 JAMIE
                        Thank you.
                                 (then)
                        Listen, I spoke with the other First Class 
                        passengers. They said they’re cool, if you 
                        want to take a break. Keep me company.

           She smiles. The cabin’s EMPTY. Shades down. He playfully 
           pats the seat beside him. She considers. Sits.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Yes. Now, I’m glad I didn’t go economy. 
                        I’d be stuck in a middle seat next to a 
                        fat guy and a girl with bladder issues. 
           She titters flirtatiously. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        When did flying become a trailer for Hell? 
                        Angry flight attendants. Idiots who won’t 
                        check their bags. Little kids kicking your 
                        seat. Usually a minority. So you feel bad 
                        saying anything. Not that its a race thing

           She laughs. Then silence. Eyes meet. A MOMENT. Strangely, 
           he reaches over and starts to unbutton her blouse. Just 
           as strangely, she lets him. He reaches into her bra and 
           fondles her breasts. They don’t kiss.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        That was...do the nipple...kinda racist.

                                 JAMIE
                        What?

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Minority children...harder...can’t behave? 

                                 JAMIE
                        How can I be racist? I’m Canadian.

           They hear the forward plane DOOR OPEN. She jumps up.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Crap!

           An MIDDLE-AGED BLACK MAN enters, catches her buttoning 
           and tucking. He holds a McDonald’s bag. 

                                 MIDDLE-AGED BLACK MAN
                        Ms. Blake. Mr. Reidy.
                                 (they don’t look at him)
                        Somebody wanna tell me what the hell’s 
                        going on in here?

           We realize he’s their boss. We realize they’ve been role 
           playing. We realize they’re in big trouble.

           INT. MALL ATRIUM - ATLANTA - NIGHT

           An American Airlines DEMO CABIN sits in the middle of the 
           atrium; it’s a section of a 767 jetliner on a stage.

                                 THE GOOD FATHER (O.S.)
                        You just quit the airline?! Like that?!
           INT. AIRPORT GATE - TORONTO - DAY

           Depressed, Jamie leafs through BusinessWeek [Dot Boom!]. 

                                 JAMIE
                        I was under-challenged.

           MR. REIDY, now older, sits beside him, half watching a TV 
           scroll [CBC coverage of Clinton’s second inauguration]. 

                                 MR. REIDY
                        Without even talking to a head hunter?

           MRS. REIDY stands over in a flow of deplaning passengers, 
           happily peering down a jetway. 

                                 JAMIE 
                        They had me driving around the country to 
                        demo the new first-class cabin. At malls. 

                                 MR. REIDY
                        Don’t be a quitter.

                                 JAMIE 
                        The job had like zero mobility, Dad. I 
                        was barely making my car payments. 

                                 MR. REIDY
                        Your problem is you focus on success. On 
                        the prize, not the process...cultivate a 
                        passion for excellence.

           Jamie gives his Father a look. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Nobody in the real world is passionate 
                        about excellence -- they’re passionate 
                        about pretending to be passionate...so 
                        they can get promoted.  

                                 MRS. REIDY (O.S.)
                        Here they are! 

           Two Grand-Kids run squealing to her, followed by Jamie's 
           brother, JOSH (28) and his Prada Wife, FARRAH (28). They 
           have ski tans. Jamie waits but his Father goes over. 

           A happy reunion. Josh is dot-com rich. He’s both nebbishy 
           and hedonistic -- tries to affect slacker cool. Jamie can 
           hear his NIECE keep repeating...
                                 JAMIE'S NIECE
                        Daddy made us fly commercial! 

           Josh now sees his Brother, who gives him a big what-the-
           fuck gesture. Jamie waves, sighs, stands. 

           INT. MR. REIDY'S CAR - TRAVELING - DAY

           Dad drives. Josh and his Son are up front, everyone else 
           is crammed in the back. Josh shows off. Jamie endures. 

                                 JOSH
                        The guy from Forbes who covered the sale 
                        loved me. I did this riff he’s gonna run. 
                        How in the 80’s, we made money with greed. 
                        And in the 90’s, we made money from hype. 
                        But in the new millennium, it’ll all be 
                        about fear. How all profitable economic 
                        activity will one day be fear-based. Risk 
                        Management. Hedge Funds. The tyranny of 
                        share-holder value. I kept saying, “Fear 
                        is the new greed. Fear is the new greed!” 

           Chuckles. The Reidy’s delight in Josh’s success. 

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        The guy loved me. Loved.

           Jamie snorts cynically. Josh covertly flips him off, while 
           scratching his scalp. Mrs. Reidy senses unpleasantness.

                                 MRS. REIDY
                        Did they ask you to stay on, Josh?

                                 JOSH
                        Larry knows I don’t roll that way. I got 
                        his money. I only wanna work with people 
                        who think “corporate” is a dirty word.

           His Son boos at “corporate”. Laughs. Jamie rolls his eyes. 

                                 MRS. REIDY
                        Well, we’re very proud of you. 
                                 (then)
                        Both our boys.

                                 JAMIE
                        Thanks for the token mention, Mom.

                                 MR. REIDY
                        Jamie left the airline. 
           Josh lowers his visor and uses its mirror to eye Jamie.

                                 JOSH
                        What’s next, Bro?

                                 JAMIE
                        I’m weighing some options.

                                 JOSH
                        Like? 

                                 JAMIE
                        Like pharmaceutical sales. For example. 

                                 FARRAH
                        Oooh, my roommate from college is a drug 
                        rep at Pfizer. She makes terrific money. 
                        I’m sure she could get you an interview.
                                 (leaning to see him)
                        Move to Chicago and you guys can date.

           Jamie sees Josh shake his head in the mirror. Farrah sees 
           it, too. Reaches up. Pokes Josh.

                                 MRS. REIDY
                        I don’t like the sound of “drug rep”? 

                                 JOSH
                        They’re those suits you see in doctors 
                        offices. With roller bags. Pfizer gives 
                        them a car. They drive around, detail 
                        doctors on a couple drugs, leave samples. 

                                 JAMIE
                        It’s the only entry-level job in America 
                        that pays over a hundred K a year. 

                                 JOSH 
                        Nothing says success like a roller bag.

           Mr. Reidy shoots Josh a look.

                                 MR. REIDY
                        Pfizer’s a great company. Great new drug 
                        pipeline. Great profit profile.

                                 JOSH
                        If you can get the job. You’re not a 3M.

                                 MRS. REIDY
                        What’s a 3M?
                                 JOSH
                        Minorities. Military. Mormons. Drug reps 
                        work in the field alone. No direct over- 
                        sight. Pfizer wants people who will...
                                 (covers his son’s ears)
                        ...do what their told.

           The boy pushes his Dad’s hands away. 

                                 JAMIE’S NIECE
                        Pfizer wants you to do what you’re told!

           Everybody LAUGHS. Everybody but Jamie.

                                 MRS. REIDY
                        Well, you can always move back home.

           INT. BORDER’S BOOK STORE - DAY

           The Business Motivation section. Jamie is looking at “The 
           Seven Habits of Highly Effective People”. 

           A Sales Girl passes pushing a cart.

                                 JAMIE
                        Do you have this on tape? Abridged?

           She shakes her head. Moves away. A contemptuous SNORT. 
           Jamie can see Josh through books in the next aisle. 

                                 JOSH
                        Dude, this Pfizer thing isn’t some girly 
                        marketing gig. It’s hard-core sales. You 
                        will have a quota. Pfizer will have some 
                        office collating your road receipts, just 
                        to make sure you’re out in the field. You 
                        can’t do your usual thing: make everybody 
                        love you then get bored. Stay focused.

           Irritated, Jamie remains quiet and continues browsing. 

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        Hey...

           Jamie has to find Josh’s face in a book clearing.

                                 JAMIE
                        What?

                                 JOSH 
                        We’re living during the greatest creation 
                        of legal wealth in human history. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOSH  (CONT'D)
                        I don’t want a Brother who’s a five-
                        figure loser. 
                                 (then)
                        Don’t embarrass us.

                                 JAMIE
                        Shut up.

           Jamie steps away.

                                 JOSH (O.S.)
                        Claw your way up to six-figure mediocrity.

                                 JAMIE
                        Fucktard.

                                 JOSH (O.S.)
                        Quitter.

                                 JAMIE 
                        Eat me. I’m not a quitter. Jesus.

           Josh doesn’t say anything else. 

           CLOSE on Jamie. He pretends to browse on, but we can feel 
           his humiliation; he burns with competitive pique. 

           INT. SHERATON HOTEL SUITE - CHICAGO - DAY

           Jamie sits on a huge sofa. He’s across from BRUCE CALLER 
           (39), a suburban dad with a very precise haircut wearing 
           a Polo shirt and sport coat. Bruce always wears Polo. 

           He’s giving Jamie's CV a final read through.

                                 JAMIE
                        I thought the opening was in Chicago?

                                 BRUCE 
                        South Bend. That’s a college town. Great 
                        for Zoloft. The heart of Michiana. 

                                 JAMIE
                        What’s Michiana?

                                 BRUCE
                        Southern Michigan and Northern Indiana. 
                        We call it Michiana. My girls love it. 
                        Bitchin’ air quality. Easy mall access. 
                        Who needs major-market traffic? 

           Jamie can feel something hollow in Bruce’s protestations. 
                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        Everybody’s always all, “I want Chicago. 
                        Get me Chicago.” And I’m like, “Yo, hold 
                        up, you work out of your car.” 
                                 (lying)
                        You couldn’t give me Chicago.

           Bruce tosses the CV onto the coffee table. 

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        Cool. Okay, Jamie, tell me your flaws?

                                 JAMIE 
                        Like the fact I’m too driven and don’t 
                        know when to quit and can be hard on 
                        colleagues who won’t share my passion?

           A cliché litany of false negatives. Bruce gets it. Grins.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Bruce, here’s the thing about me: I want 
                        to make money. My Dad’s been teaching 
                        finance for thirty years. A lot of his 
                        students go on to become millionaires. 
                        But, when he retires, his pension will be 
                        worth maybe 40,000 a year. Worse, my 
                        obnoxious Brother started a dot com to 
                        deliver pet food over the internet. Now, 
                        he’s got a therapist who specializes in 
                        “wealth adjustment” -- one adjustment, of 
                        course, being her fee. Hire me. I’ll make 
                        Pfizer money. So I can make us money. 
                                 (dangerously)
                        All I ask is, when they give you Chicago, 
                        take your best rep with you.

           Bruce stares, perfectly still. 

           Then, slowly, he smiles a big, goofy smile. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           An all-American BLACK GUY (26) speaks directly at us.

                                 BLACK GUY
                        Hello. I’m Matt Terry.

           INT. MARRIOTT HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM - NEW JERSEY - DAY

           Jamie shakes Matt’s hand. 
                                 JAMIE
                        Hi there, Matt. Jamie Reidy. 

           Jamie introduces himself through a room of 150 Attractive 
           Young People. Dockers World. Khaki’s. Golf shirts. Button-
           downs. Everyone seems highly invested in social skills.

           These are PFIZER TRAINEES. We see a lot of Minorities and 
           Mormons and Military Types. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Hi, there. I’m Jamie...Yo, Jamie Reidy... 
                        God Bless, Jamie...Jamie...Semper Fi....

           A microphone TAP. Everyone finds a seat. 

           TRAINER GINA (32), a bobbed, pixie of a woman with a neck-
           scarf, waits at a podium with a Pfizer logo. She’s joined 
           by a man who looks like a football coach, PHIL (60).

           She lets her audience settle, then holds up a white pill. 

                                 GINA 
                        This is not a pill. No. This is tens of 
                        millions of dollars in research. This is 
                        thousands of hours of hard labor. This, 
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, is software.

           The gravitas in her voice straightens Jamie's posture.

                                                      A FEW QUICK SCENES:

           1. HOTEL ROOM. Jamie shows off for his new study group. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Off-label uses for Zoloft: alcoholism, 
                        Bulimia, PMS, smoking, social anxiety...

                                 GINA (O.S.) 
                        Your training will last six weeks.

           2. PARKING LOT. Half the Trainees hold burning matches -- 
           pretending they’re doctors -- and the other half pitch 
           them, trying to finish before their “doc” gets burned.

                                 GINA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Each one of you will leave here a fully-
                        qualified health-care professional. 

           Jamie doesn’t quite make it. Curses. Gina watches.
           3. JAMIE’S ROOM. Trainees gather for a party. Jamie holds 
           forth as he spins a beer can on ice piled in his sink -- 
           a trick for cooling warm beer in less than two minutes.

                                 GINA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Your job will be to go fight illness.

                                 JAMIE
                        Health care industry is worth two trillion 
                        a year. Two trillion. The top ten pharma 
                        companies make more money than all 490 of 
                        the other Fortune 500 companies combined! 
                                 (tosses a beer to Matt)
                        There! Warm to cold in 90 seconds!

           Jamie spins another can. Matt opens his beer. Tests it.

                                 MATT
                        Unbelievable! I love corporate culture!

           4. CONFERENCE ROOM. Phil lectures on “Field Etiquette”. 

                                 GINA (O.S.)
                        Your job will be to go share technology.

                                 PHIL
                        You will see competitors in the field.
                        Accepted industry etiquette is one drug 
                        rep goes in the back office at a time. A 
                        word of caution, people,...

           Jamie looks up from furious note-taking. 

                                 PHIL (CONT’D)
                        Competing reps are not your friends.

           5. HOTEL BATHROOM. Jamie lights a match, does a practice 
           a pitch in the mirror. Quick. Efficient.

                                 JAMIE
                        Hello, Doctor. Did you know prescribing 
                        Zithromax for ear infections reduces 
                        diarrhea in pre-teens 33%? That’s 33% 
                        less four AM phone calls to you from...

           The floor’s covered in matches. He’s been at this awhile.

           6. JAMIE’S ROOM. Everyone sits around, laughing and drunk. 
           Jamie's the life-of-the-party, loading a CD, integrating a 
           quiet guy in the corner. 

                                 GINA (O.S.)
                        Your job will be to go save lives.
                                 JAMIE 
                        And Jared here, lucky bastard, will be 
                        selling Lipitor...in Palm Beach. 

           The Palm Beach Rep takes a shy bow to general hooting.

                                 BRASSY TEXAS GIRL
                        They gave me Zyrtec and Zoloft. Which is 
                        a tragedy, cause I don’t have allergies 
                        and I’m so not ready to give up sex.

                                 A FEW PEOPLE IN UNISON
                        “Sexual dysfunction is a non-issue with 
                        Zoloft, Doctor.”

           Laughs. It’s their stock answer about Zoloft and sex.

                                 MATT
                        How about you, Reidy?

                                 JAMIE
                        Zoloft and Zithromax. In Michiana. 

           Stunned silence. Someone makes a “reject” buzzer sound. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Screw you guys. A smaller market means an 
                        easier quota. A bigger bonus. And a quick 
                        promotion. I’ll beat all your asses.

                                 BRASSY TEXAS GIRL
                        Oh, Honey. Why wait?

           Oohs. Whistles. Jamie starts the CD. Dances.

           7. PARKING LOT. The match game. Jamie pitches. Finishes. 
           No one else is even close. Gina’s watching. Nods.

                                 GINA 
                        Good job, Reidy. 

           8. HOTEL ROOM. Jamie on a carpet. Post-coital. Gazing up.

                                 GINA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Your job will be to make a better world.

                                 A FEMALE WHISPER
                        What are you thinking about?

                                 JAMIE
                        Money.

           Gina laughs. They’re nude on the floor. 
                                 GINA 
                        Seriously.

                                 JAMIE
                        I am serious.

           9. INTERSTATE. A brand new White Chevy Lumina zooms thru 
           the farmland of CENTRAL MICHIANA.  

           10. CONFERENCE ROOM. Back to the first day of training... 

           Gina finishes welcoming the new Trainees.

                                 GINA 
                        A better world. That’s why we’re here.
                                 (then)
                        Welcome to Pfizer.

           Everyone nods. Inspired. Proud.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A GOLF BALL is sliced off its tee.

                                 BRUCE (O.S.) 
                        N-i-i-i-ce.

           EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY 

           Bruce and Jamie stand behind DR. KNIGHT (36) in the tee 
           box. Jamie gives Bruce a look; it was a horrible shot.

           EXT. NINTH GREEN - DAY 

           Jamie holds the flag. Dr. Knight putts, successfully. 

                                 BRUCE
                        Dr. Knight sees a lot of otitis media.

           He pulls on his ear to make sure Jamie gets the Latin.

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        Kids are petri dishes. I know, I have two 
                        myself. But a kid who doesn’t get sick is 
                        not building an immune system. I tell my 
                        wife: expose them. You want them putting 
                        stuff in their mouths. Hell, send them to 
                        the office, they can lick sick kids. 
                                 BRUCE
                                 (putting)
                        Just good parenting.

                                 DR. KNIGHT 
                        She babies them.

           Bruce’s putt stops ten feet from the cup. Dr. Knight gets 
           a page. Furtively, Bruce taps his watch to cue Jamie.

                                 JAMIE 
                        Hey, you know what’s great for keeping 
                        Moms’ calm? Zithromax. It causes 33% less 
                        diarrhea in pre-teens. That’s 33% less 
                        panicked four AM calls for you, Doctor.

           Dr. Knight reads his page, not listening, rolls his eyes 
           at it. Bruce nods for Jamie to keep at him.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        How are your patients enjoying Zoloft?

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        They aren’t. I never write it.

                                 JAMIE
                        Really? Any particular reason why not?

                                 DR. KNIGHT 
                        Yeah, I don’t want Trey Hillman beating 
                        the shit out of me.

           Jamie looks to Bruce, who shakes his head. “Don’t ask.”

           EXT. PARKING LOT OF COUNTRY CLUB - DAY 

           Changed into their suits, Jamie and Bruce carry golf bags 
           to the Lumina. Bruce keeps his voice low.

                                 BRUCE
                        Trey Hillman. Lilly’s Prozac Rep in this 
                        district. He’s top ten. Nationally. Has 
                        been for like twenty years. He’s got...
                                 (a quick look around)
                        ...serious anger issues. So, they won’t 
                        promote him. No one else will hire him. 
                        He’s the reason we never break 95% of 
                        quota on Zoloft. You need to zero in on 
                        his business and take him down.
                                 (then)
                        Quietly.
           INT. JAMIE’S LUMINA - TRAVELING - DAY

           Jamie and Bruce wait in traffic. Like a lot of people who 
           work in calm suburbs, Bruce takes traffic personally.

                                 BRUCE
                        I won’t even tell you what Hillman did to 
                        your predecessor. Go around. 

           Jamie looks down the road’s shoulder: full of pot holes.

                                 JAMIE
                        We’ll blow the shocks.

                                 BRUCE 
                        Jamie, what’s the difference between a 
                        company car and a four-wheeler? 
                                 (Jamie doesn’t know)
                        A company car can go anywhere.

           Jamie pulls out. Rain drops land on the windshield. 

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        Rain. Cool. Rain’s a terrific sales tool.

           EXT. VA HOSPITAL - DAY

           Rain. An old red-brick hospital. Rusting fire escapes. 

                                 BRUCE (O.S.)
                        VA Hospital. They have a No Reps policy. 

           INT. JAMIE'S LUMINA - DAY

           Jamie and Bruce idle in the VA Hospital parking lot.

                                 BRUCE
                        We’re not allowed inside. But...

           Bruce pulls out two umbrellas from the backseat.

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        There’s no rule against giving doctors a 
                        dry walk to their car. 

           EXT. VA HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAY

           Rain. Jamie and Bruce chat under massive Zoloft umbrellas 
           at the end of an empty sidewalk up to the hospital. 
                                 BRUCE 
                        Always lead with the pen. Gifts establish 
                        a feeling of reciprocity. 
                                 (he sees something)
                        Uh-oh. Nine o’clock.

           Bruce gestures to a Distinguished Man with an Abbott Labs 
           umbrella. He waits at the end of another sidewalk.

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        Abbott Labs. Their antibiotic used to be 
                        gold standard before Zithro.

           They watch the ABBOTT LABS REP, stoic in the rain. 

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        Look at him. Oh, yeah, he can smell it. 
                        VA Hospital like this. Old guys smoking 
                        through Trache holes. Immune systems shot 
                        ten ways to Sunday. Man, that’s just sad. 

                                 JAMIE
                        He’s only doing what we’re doing.

           Bruce gives Jamie an indignant look. 

                                 BRUCE 
                        You wanna go ask him to lunch, Jamie?
                                 (a beat)
                        Abbott tells docs that Jim Henson was on 
                        Zithromax when he died of pneumonia.

                                 JAMIE
                        Is it true? 

                                 PHIL 
                        No. Zithro didn’t even get FDA approval 
                        til ‘93. Jim Henson died in like 1990.

           A beat.

                                 JAMIE
                        Maybe he was in a drug trial.

           Bruce turns exasperated to the new recruit, but... 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Here comes one.

           A Big Doctor With A Shaved Head hurries down the sidewalk 
           with a metal file poorly sheltering him from rain. 
                                 BRUCE
                        Cool. Relax. Smile. Mentally prepare an 
                        Initial Benefit Statement. 

           Jamie holds a pen out to the approaching Doctor.

                                 JAMIE
                        Hi, there. I’m Jamie Reidy from Pfizer. 
                        If you allow me to walk you to your car, 
                        Doctor, I’d like to tell you how--

           The Doctor BONKS Jamie on the head with the metal folder, 
           not hard, but definite enough to hurt. He hurries on. 

                                 BRUCE
                        Thank you for your time, Doctor!

           Jamie can see the Abbott Labs Rep shaking his head.

           EXT. PARKING LOT OF MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY

           CLOSE on Jamie’s face, focused, hardened -- he bites his 
           bottom lip in concentration, just like as a boy. He 
           carries a stack of Starbucks. Bruce holds the umbrella. 

           A PERFECT WOMAN walks toward them in the rain. Gorgeous.

                                 BRUCE 
                        Merk. They’re usually pretty arrogant.

           She gives them a tight smile. 

           Then, surprisingly,...

                                 JAMIE 
                        Hey, Lisa. 

           Her smile goes wide and bemused. She gives Jamie's arm a 
           politician’s touch as she passes and struts away. 

                                 BRUCE 
                        You know her?

                                 JAMIE
                        Nope.

           INT. ELEVATOR IN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY 

           Bruce and Jamie ride up in the huge elevator alone.
                                 JAMIE 
                        No woman wants to be some random Lisa. If 
                        every time I see her, I say, “Hey, Lisa”, 
                        sooner or later, she’ll stop me and say, 
                        “Look, I’m not Lisa. It’s Kennedy.” Then 
                        I’ll do a big apology and admit I wasn’t 
                        sure but I wasn’t risking it -- this Lisa 
                        was way too mad at me for not calling. 

           INT. HALLWAY IN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY 

           Bruce and Jamie come off the elevator, go down the hall.

                                 JAMIE
                        From then on, Kennedy will know I dated 
                        someone who looks just like her. Almost 
                        like a version of her...who I rejected. 
                        She’ll start to develop this unconscious 
                        fear of me, a need to win my approval. 

           Bruce stares with awe at his protégé. Laughs. 

                                 BRUCE
                        Yes! That’s what I’m talking about! I am 
                        so gonna live vicariously through you.

           He opens the door into an...

           INT. OB/GYN PRACTICE - DAY 

           Bruce and Jamie enter. The waiting room is in chaos. The 
           Staff is stressed. Bruce nods Jamie back out.

           INT. ANOTHER OB/GYN PRACTICE - DAY

           Bruce and Jamie enter. The waiting room is less full. But 
           Two Reps already wait. Bruce nods Jamie back out.

           INT. YET ANOTHER OB/GYN PRACTICE - DAY 

           Bruce and Jamie enter. Empty. Except for a Rep, who also 
           brought Starbucks. Bruce nods Jamie back out.

           INT. STILL ANOTHER OB/GYN PRACTICE - DAY 

           Bruce and Jamie sit under a Mother and Child Painting. 
           Jamie picks up a Vogue Magazine [Lady Di/”1961-1997”]. 
                                 BRUCE 
                        Sick people touch those all day.

                                 JAMIE
                        What can I catch in a Gyno office?

                                 BRUCE
                        I don’t know. Chlamydia. Yeast.

           A HEAVY MAN comes out of the back office. He freezes when 
           he sees Bruce. His old suit is wet; his hair, greasy.

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        Jerry.

           JERRY (50’s) looks wounded. His lip almost quivers.

                                 JERRY
                        You said you’d call.

                                 BRUCE
                        I will.

           The tone says this isn’t the place to discuss it. Jerry 
           doesn’t move, just stands there for few awkward seconds, 
           then goes out, his detail bag catching on the door.

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        Neuroscience. Our decent drugs went off-
                        patent. They all want to transfer.

                                 RECEPTIONIST’S VOICE
                        Next!

           Jamie goes the reception desk. A TOUGH RECEPTIONIST hands 
           him printouts and does a quick, rote spiel.

                                 RECEPTIONIST 
                        The doctor only sees new Reps who bring 
                        in a lunch. Here’s a list of available 
                        dates. First one is in five weeks. And a 
                        list of approved food vendors. No sushi. 
                        No salads. Leave your samples with me.

                        Should I go back and introduce myself? 

           The Receptionist gives him a look. Staffers chortle. He 
           turns to Bruce, who winks encouragement. 
                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Look, this if my first day. That’s my 
                        District Manager. If you could get me 
                        sixty seconds with her...

           She stares at him, ice cold, immovable. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Stop. Just stop. You’re gonna like me. I 
                        mean, sooner or later, everybody does. 
                        You know why? Cause I’ll do whatever it 
                        takes to make that happen. I’m very 
                        trainable. You will give up some love. 

           He gives her an impish look. The air has turned sexual; 
           she can’t help but turn and grin at the others.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        C’mon. Let me organize the sample closet. 

           INT. SAMPLE CLOSET - DAY

           Jamie organizes a small room full of tiny boxes. Bruce 
           briefly pokes his head in. A huge thumbs up. 

                                 BRUCE 
                        Make sure our stuff is at eye level.

           Jamie removes the Prozac and puts Zoloft in its place. He 
           looks down at his competitor’s boxes. Small. Vulnerable.

           Jamie takes a deep breath and makes a bad decision.

           He crouches and sticks the Prozac samples way at the back 
           of a bottom shelf, hard to find. We hear DISTANT THUNDER.

           EXT. RURAL STORAGE FACILITY - NIGHT

           The Lumina is backed up to an open storage garage full of 
           Jamie's Pfizer boxes (giveaways, brochures, etc.)

           Bruce and Jamie stand in the glow of the tail lights. 

                                 BRUCE 
                        Prescriber profiles will start coming in 
                        from the pharmacies next week. Every week, 
                        you’ll get a printout telling you every 
                        script written by every doc in your area. 
                        In a few weeks, we’ll have lunch to review 
                        your first monthly sales report. Now... 
                        Nobody out here breaks 95% of quota on--
                                 JAMIE
                        I will. 

                                 BRUCE 
                        Okay. Cool. Great attitude. I support 
                        your success in the organization. 

           There’s something perfunctory in this, as if Bruce can’t 
           yet believe Jamie won’t disappoint him.

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        You need Dr. Knight. He’s your district’s 
                        big fish. Get him writing Zoloft. Just do 
                        it when Trey Hillman isn’t looking.
                                 (a forced chuckle)
                        Alright. Cool. Good selling, Jamie.

                                 JAMIE
                        Thanks, Bruce.

           Bruce hugs him. Awkwardly. False start. Clashing arms. He 
           walks away. Jamie starts to replenish his trunk. 

                                 BRUCE (O.S.)
                        Hey, Jamie?

           Jamie peers into the dark, can’t really see much. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Yeah, Bruce?

                                 BRUCE (O.S.)
                        I want Chicago. Get us Chicago. 

           There’s desperation in his voice.

                                 JAMIE
                        Done.

           A weary beat. Then footsteps walking away.

                                                      A FEW QUICK SCENES:

           1. JAMIE'S KITCHEN. Push in on a Pfizer wall clock. “6:08 
           a.m.” Jamie sits in his suit. Making a long “To Do” list. 

           2. BREAK ROOM. Push in on Jamie flirting with Nurses over 
           lunch. Dr. Knight enters. Grabs one of Jamie's sandwiches. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Dr. Knight. Listen, I was.... 

           The doctor ignores him. Exits.
           3. FARMHOUSE. Push in on Jamie, leading with a pen, as he 
           approaches an Older Man chopping wood in a lab coat.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Dr. Hancock? Jamie Reidy. From Pfizer.

                                 DR. HANCOCK
                        Oh. Don’t get many drug reps out here.
                                 (then)
                        Did you bring lunch?

           4. VA HOSPITAL. Drizzle. Push in Jamie under an umbrella. 

           5. APARTMENT COMPLEX MAILBOXES. Push in on Jamie ripping 
           open an envelope. He wears a robe, boxers. He soon finds 
           Dr. Knight’s name, tracks to his Zoloft numbers: zero. 

                                 JAMIE 
                        Shit!

           6. SAMPLE CLOSET. Push in on empty shelf labeled “Zoloft” 
           -- the other anti-depressants are fully stocked. 

           Jamie considers his empty shelf. This is very strange.

           7. ANOTHER SAMPLE CLOSET. Push in on an empty Zoloft bin. 
           Jamie checks his competitor’s bins. They’re all full. 

           A BUSY NURSE comes in to get something.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Wow. You guys sure go through the Zoloft. 

                                 BUSY NURSE
                        Dr. Keet isn’t big on SSRI’s. Another rep 
                        is probably stealing it.

           Jamie nods casually. She leaves. Furious, he opens his 
           detail bag and dumps all the Prozac into it.

           8. JUNKY PARKING LOT. Dollar Store. Dumpster smack in the 
           middle. Push in on Jamie. He reaches in his trunk and 
           takes handfuls of PROZAC SAMPLE BOXES out of his bag. He 
           tosses them in the dumpster. He’s taken a lot of Prozac. 

                                                                 OUT TO:

           A wind gust SNAPS a banner: “Depression Awareness Day”.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY

           Student Council Types pass out Zoloft caps and T-shirts.
           INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Jamie's in front of an assembly of TENTH GRADERS. Guys 
           slouch. Girls try to look burnt out. 

                                 JAMIE
                        High school sucks. Look at any cool rock 
                        star or actor or entrepreneur, they all say 
                        pretty much the same thing: “Dude, I hated 
                        high school”. High school’s depressing. 
                        That’s why serious depression affects one 
                        in six American teenagers. So, you guys 
                        need to know the Depression Warning Signs.

           Bullet points appear on a PowerPoint screen behind him.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Lack of enthusiasm or motivation.

           A Bored Slacker shifts in his seat. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Feelings of worthlessness.

           A Tracy Flick chews on a pencil, feeling worthless.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Persistent sadness.

           A Smiley Cheerleader checks if anyone’s looking at her.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Daily irritability.

           A Teacher in the Back swallows.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Play that involves excessive aggression.

           An Oblivious Jock finger thumps the Kid in Front of him.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        And recurring thoughts of death.

           A Goth Girl smirks defensively.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        One in six of you guys. 

           Jamie sees the room has gone absolutely still; everyone’s 
           staring, convinced they have it. 
                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Think about it.

           Jamie nods gravely. Tough love, Kids.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

           Pleased with himself, humming, Jamie hauls a large bag of 
           Zoloft swag and the depression-day banner to his car. 
           He’s puzzled to find two identical Luminas parked alone.

           He scans the lot. A sea of metal, weirdly free of humans, 
           making the isolated twin cars all the more creepy. He has 
           to remotely open his trunk to make sure which car is his. 

           He loads the bag and banner.

                                 A MALE VOICE 
                        Hey.

           He spins to find a HIP MAN IN A SUIT.

                                 JAMIE
                        Oh...Hi.

           The Hip Man punches him in the stomach, hard. Jamie goes 
           down. The man stands casually over him, as if waiting out 
           a tantrum. This world-weary soul is TREY HILLMAN (41).

           Jamie writhes in pain. Trey kneels beside him.

                                 TREY 
                        Damaged cells are releasing arachidonic 
                        acid. Your body’s converting it into 
                        prostaglandin, triggering a jamboree of 
                        enzymes necessary for pain. It’ll take 
                        about a minute for the acid to dissipate 
                        and your natural morphine to kick in.

           Jamie moans. Trey fingers his wedding ring as he waits. 

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        Do you know why I hit you?

           Jamie tries to kick back now, flailing. Trey ignores it. 

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        Well?

           Jamie shakes his head “no”. 
                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        I hate my job. You’re making it harder.
                        Don’t touch the Prozac. The other reps 
                        like to fuck with the new guy. I don’t. 
                        My interest in you is limited to making 
                        sure you leave my drugs where you find 
                        them. This job sucks enough without you 
                        turning me into a stock boy. We clear?

           Jamie doesn’t answer the question.

                                 JAMIE 
                        What makes you think it was me?

                                 TREY
                        The others know me.

           Jamie takes his time pulling himself up.

                                 JAMIE 
                        If they “know you”, then they knew you’d 
                        come after the new guy. If, say,...one of 
                        them took your samples?

           A tense beat. Trey wonders. Jamie waits.

           Finally, Jamie gives him a half smile...

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Fine. I did it.

           Trey simply turns and goes to his car.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        This was my good suit! 

           INT. OLIVE GARDEN - DAY 

           Lunch. Jamie’s nervous. Bruce opens his SALES REPORT. 

                                 BRUCE
                        Cool. Your 94% of quota on Zoloft and 
                        106% of quota on Zithromax.

                                 JAMIE
                        Okay. Okay. That’s not bad. Right? 

           Bruce nods. It’s not bad but clearly not great. He picks 
           up Jamie's PRESCRIBER PROFILES.

                                 BRUCE 
                        Doc Knight still a goose egg on Zoloft?
           Jamie moans. 

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        Jamie, I’m gonna prove how much I support 
                        your success in the organization. 

           Bruce pulls out a CHECK.

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s see if $500 buys you some face time 
                        with Dr. Knight.

           INT. DR. KNIGHT’S NURSE’S STATION - DAY 

           Jamie stands near-by as Dr. Knight signs the sample log 
           for a surgically-enhanced female rep in a very sexy Abe 
           Lincoln costume. This is a Bristol-Myers SQUIBB REP. 

                                 SQUIBB REP
                        Thanks, doctor. Bye y’all.

           They watch her sway off down the hall.

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        Man, I love Squibb Girls. They dress up 
                        like that every, single holiday. Even 
                        Martin Luther King Day. This one has an 
                        itty-bitty T-shirt that says: “That’s not 
                        a dream, that’s a fantasy.”
                                 (then)
                        Know what I feel when I watch her walk 
                        like that? Incentivized.

           Jamie understands, pulls out the CHECK. Hands it over.

                                 JAMIE 
                        What do I do exactly?

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        It’s a shadow program. You shadow me all 
                        afternoon. Silently. 

                                 JAMIE 
                        Can I take notes?

           Dr. Knight checks Jamie's face for irony. 

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        Shadow programs aren’t really about you 
                        learning my practice. It’s just a legal 
                        way for Pfizer to give me money.
                                 (MORE)

                        If the patient asks, you’re an Intern.

           INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY

           A Twelve-Year-Old coughs. Jamie -- now in a white coat -- 
           watches Dr. Knight talk with her Yuppie Parents.

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        It’s probably viral. 

                                 YUPPIE FATHER
                        Really? I see. It’s just, the Peterson’s 
                        said you were very pro antibiotics.

           A beat. Dr. Knight forces a smile. Grabs a scripts pad.

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        Sure. Why not?

                                                               JUMP CUT:

                        We hear great things about Ritalin.

                                 DR. KNIGHT 
                        Sure. Why not?

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           A Huge Teenage Boy lowers his underwear. Dr. Knight and 
           Jamie wince. The Boy’s Tiny Mother faces away. 

                                 DR. KNIGHT (CONT’D)
                        Looks like Herpes.

           An intercom BUZZES. Dr. Knight steps out of the room for 
           a moment. Jamie's left with the Huge Boy’s penis right in 
           front of him. He tries to look doctorly. Waits. Forever.

                                 HUGE BOY’S TINY MOTHER
                        We think he got it from the gym pool.

                                 JAMIE
                        Sure. Why not?

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           Dr. Knight and Jamie enter to see a bored Hispanic Man 
           and his Pushy Wife. They only speak SPANISH. 
                                 DR. KNIGHT 
                        I am Doctor Knight. 

           He taps his name tag. He’s not big on shaking hands. She 
           gives him a Spanish magazine ad for Lipitor and points to 
           her Husband’s heart. 

           The doctor writes the script. And mutters to Jamie...

                                 DR. KNIGHT (CONT’D)
                        I’d write a lot more of these as a paid 
                        consultant.

                                 JAMIE
                        They don’t give me those kinds of funds.

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        Read the papers, Reidy. Big pharma spends 
                        five billion a year marketing to doctors. 
                        The way I see it, your job is to see how 
                        much of that you can stuff in my pockets.

           INT. DR. KNIGHT’S HALLWAY - DAY

           Dr. Knight and Jamie head for the next exam room.

                                 JAMIE
                        C’mon, Doc, I can’t just give you money.

                                 DR. KNIGHT 
                        Of course not. First, you have to fly me 
                        to Cancun some weekend. Then, I have to 
                        drop in on some bull shit peer-to-peer 
                        conference. Then, you can give me money.

           He’s scanning a patient file from the door holder.

                                 DR. KNIGHT (CONT’D)
                        This can’t be right. Janice?!
                                 (he gets her attention)
                        A 24-year-old needs a Parkinson’s drugs?!

                                 JANICE
                        Beth wrote that one up!

                                 JAMIE
                        Let me talk to Bruce--

           Dr. Knight doesn’t listen, just turns into the...
           INT. EXAM ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Dr. Knight and Jamie enter to find a pretty young woman, 
           MAGGIE MURTOCK (24), sitting on the exam table. Maggie 
           has art-girl hair and a tendency to chatty indiscretion. 

           She also has stage one Parkinson’s Disease.

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        I’m Dr. Knight.

           He taps his name tag. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Maggie Murtock. 

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        Your file says “kind of an emergency”?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I know your Lilly Rep. He asked Janice to 
                        squeeze me in. My apartment was burgled 
                        yesterday. They took my Parkinson’s meds.

           She holds out her LEFT HAND so they can see her tremor. 
           It’s not a bad tremor, but a noticeable one. 

           He examines her hand, flexing it to make the tremor stops 
           and counting seconds before it starts again.

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        Trey Hillman’s a great guy.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I wouldn’t say that.

           She laughs an odd laugh. Jamie's careful not to react.

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        Monotherapy?

                                 MAGGIE 
                                 (hands him a list)
                        Sinemet CR. Plus Domperidone to cut the 
                        nausea. Artane for the tremor. And Prozac 
                        so I’m not too bummed about having a 
                        major degenerative disorder at 24.

                                 JAMIE
                        Zoloft has a slower metabolic breakdown.

           They both look at him. 
                                 MAGGIE 
                        Who is he?

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        Intern. 

           Dr. Knight has Maggie by the elbow, bends her left arm, 
           tests for cogwheel rigidity.

                                 DR. KNIGHT (CONT’D)
                        Young-Onset Parkinson’s is pretty rare. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah, they first thought it was just an 
                        essential tremor, then Wilson’s Disease, 
                        then Huntington’s. I did tests for PSP, 
                        MSA, syphilis...I was really glad for a 
                        negative on that one. Sadly, I’d rather 
                        have an incurable disease than feel like 
                        a 19th-century slut. It’s a girl thing. 
                        Let’s see, then, there was a brain-tumor-
                        week, very scary, then six months chasing 
                        obscure dystonias, but... 

           She does a little “ta-da” gesture.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s good, old-fashioned Parkinson’s. 

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        Don’t you have a Neurologist?

           There is a note of suspicion in his voice. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        We broke up.

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        I’m guessing you don’t have insurance.

           She reaches into her jeans, pulls out folded bills, waves 
           them. He does his best fake smile yet.

                                 DR. KNIGHT (CONT’D)
                        Sure. Why not?

           He takes out his pad and starts writing.

                                 DR. KNIGHT (CONT’D)
                        Anything else I can do for you?
                                 MAGGIE
                        There’s a weird blotch on my breast. I’m 
                        getting hypochondriacal about it.

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        Okay. Let’s have a look.

           Maggie takes her T-Shirt off. Jamie gets nervous. He has 
           no idea where to look, feigns interest in seeing exactly 
           what Dr. Knight writes for scripts. He changes her anti-
           depressant to Zoloft. Gives Jamie a covert wink.

           The doctor puts the scripts on the table next to Maggie. 
           As she gets her bra off, Jamie turns away.

           Jamie wanders over to the window, pretends to be lost in 
           thought as he gazes out into the parking lot. But he can 
           see Maggie in the window’s reflection, can’t help look as 
           Dr. Knight examines a spot on her breast, touches it.

           She turns to see Jamie watching. He looks off. 

                                 DR. KNIGHT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        That’s a spider bite.

           EXT. PARKING LOT TO DR. KNIGHT’S BUILDING - DAY

           The Lumina waits beyond a cluster of other cars. As Jamie 
           rolls his bag to it, he’s SMACKED in the head by a purse.

                                 JAMIE
                        Jesus!

           Maggie has come up from behind a pick-up. 

                                 MAGGIE 
                        You’re a drug rep?! You let me take my 
                        shirt off, you fucking creep!

           He holds one eye, peers out at her with the other. She 
           pulls the bag back for another swat.

                                 JAMIE
                        Wait! Wait. I’m hurt.

           It takes her a moment to calm herself. Since she’s angry, 
           the tremor is worse that before.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Your buckle got my eye.

           An awkward pause. 
           She’s not sure if she believes him.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You okay?

                                 JAMIE
                        Yeah.

           He makes a show of gingerly touching the eye’s corner. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Who said I was a drug rep?

                                 MAGGIE 
                        You have a detail bag! Drive a Lumina! 
                        Look where you parked. That’s classic 
                        drug rep parking. “See, everybody, I’m 
                        leaving the good spaces for patients!” 

           The car’s parking is oddly polite.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Pop the trunk. Go on. Let’s see inside.

           And his silence is damning. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I could sue you.

                                 JAMIE
                        Your doctor would say you consented. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        And you?

           He shrugs sheepishly. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Augghhh!

           She thinks a long moment, and lets herself deflate.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t sue you, anyway. You’d just raise 
                        drug prices on people like me. 
                                 (then)
                        I couldn’t sue anybody. I’d feel...petty. 
                        That’s my problem. That normal level of 
                        mean necessary to get anywhere in life, I 
                        don’t have it. I find it embarrassing. My 
                        survival instincts are blunted by some 
                        obviously freakish concern for others. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        You know, on planes, that sign asks you 
                        to wipe the sink for the next passenger? 
                        I do that. You don’t, do you? Of course 
                        not. No one does. I do. I wipe the sink. 

           She’s ready to leave him, still...

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Apologize. Would you do that? It won’t go 
                        any further than us. Just once, I want to 
                        hear somebody in medicine apologize.

                                 JAMIE
                        I was only doing my job.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Of course.

           She digs around in her bag, takes something out from the 
           bottom of it. FLASH. She takes his picture. 

           He watches her walk away. Her arm doesn’t swing -- her PD 
           now visible; her vulnerability, obvious and sad. 

                                 JAMIE 
                        Shit.

           EXT. VA HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAY

           Rain. Jamie waits for business under his umbrella. A dark 
           figure appears behind him. With a Prozac umbrella. 

           We fear violence until we see...Trey carries a plate of 
           home-made cookies, cling-wrapped. 

                                 TREY
                        Pfizer.

           He passes Jamie, walks right up the sidewalk. 

                                 JAMIE
                        How’s that fist? My vital organs didn’t 
                        leave a mark, I hope.

           Trey stops. Turns. Considers. 

           He can see something of himself in his young competitor.

                                 TREY
                        The umbrella thing doesn’t work.
                                 (then)
                        Come on. I’ll introduce you.
           Jamie's not sure. Trey walks on, a receding opportunity. 
           Jamie looks to the watching Abbott Labs Rep, a man going 
           nowhere, just an old guy stuck out in the rain.

           The Zoloft umbrella chases after the Prozac umbrella.

           INT. VA HOSPITAL LOBBY - DAY

           Paint peels. Plants die. This facility is much different 
           than the pastel-hued offices of Memorial. This place has 
           one essential function: people come here to die. 

           Trey’s a fast walker. Jamie keeps nervously in step.

                                 JAMIE 
                        You always bring food?

           Trey gives him a look.

                                 TREY 
                        Pharma Sales is like dating -- they want 
                        you to buy them dinner and they want you 
                        to pretend not to expect anything for it. 
                                 (then)
                        Nobody going Dutch gets laid.

           They approach security doors and a READING RECEPTIONIST. 
           She waves with her pinky, buzzes the doors open.

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM OF VA HOSPITAL - DAY

           Clutter suggests a lull in chaos. Trey leaves the cookies 
           in the break area. As they walk, Jamie watches Trey greet 
           everyone. A patient yells in pain behind a curtain.

                                 JAMIE
                        I met a friend of yours, Maggie.

                                 TREY
                        Yeah, I heard. 

           On one wall is a white-board with stick-on letters: “The 
           person meanest to Dr. Clodfelter today was _______.”  In 
           the blank, a marker has scribbled, “Dr. Emir”.

           We tilt down to a man sitting at a desk, facing the wall: 
           it’s the bald man who bonked Jamie with a file that first 
           day on the job. This is DR. MANLEY CLODFELTER (37).  

           Jamie realizes this as Trey leads him to the big doctor.
                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        Dr. Manley Clodfelter, meet your Pfizer 
                        Rep, Jamie Reidy.

           Clodfelter shakes his hand with the warmest of smiles.

                                 DR. CLODFELTER
                        Nice to meet you, Jamie. Hey, Trey. I’ll 
                        be right with you guys.

           He turns back to his documents. They wait. Then, his back 
           still to them, very friendly,...

                                 DR. CLODFELTER (CONT’D)
                        If I get you to watch my Spatial Comfort 
                        Zone, that would be terrific.

           Trey points to the floor. Yellow tape marks a zone around 
           the doctor’s desk. Trey gestures for Jamie to step out of 
           the zone. They wait some more.

           Finally, Dr. Clodfelter strands and turns back to them.

                                 DR. CLODFELTER (CONT’D)
                        Done. Thank you.
                                 (holds up a box)
                        Can I offer you a pen, Jamie?

           Unsure if this is a joke, Jamie pockets a ballpoint. 

                                 TREY
                        You off yet?

                                 DR. CLODFELTER
                        Ninety seconds.

           They look up to a clock above his sign. And wait again.

           INT. ER BACK HALLWAY - DAY

           Dr. Clodfelter gives the boys a tour. Jamie reacts to a 
           pool of blood. They approach an open exam room.

                                 DR. CLODFELTER 
                        This is where we put the ones who are 
                        going to die...

           Unfortunately, the room is occupied by an Old Woman who’s 
           heard him and now looks up from her gurney, terrified. He 
           makes a “gotcha” gesture at her. 
                                 DR. CLODFELTER (CONT’D)
                        Just teasing you, Mrs. Belard.

           She forces a grin. He feels for something in the pockets 
           of a smock hanging behind the door, a lighter.

                                 DR. CLODFELTER (CONT’D)
                        The nurse will be back in a second.

           As the guys move again down the hall, he does a knife-
           across-the-neck gesture to say he wasn’t kidding. 

           Jamie can’t help looking back. 

           EXT. VA LOADING DOCK - DAY

           Rain sheets at the edge of the empty dock. Trey hands Dr. 
           Clodfelter a joint. He lights it, inhales, hands it back 
           to Trey. Jamie's now too health conscious to join in.

                                 TREY
                        Reidy met Maggie Murtock. 

           The doctor nods knowingly. 

                                 DR. CLODFELTER
                        She’s cute. You don’t see that much in 
                        the neurologically damned.

                                 JAMIE
                        She’s not exactly damned. You don’t die 
                        from Parkinson’s. Right? 

           Trey and Dr. Clodfelter exchange a look. 

           As they pass the joint back and forth...

                                 TREY
                        Parkinson’s is a shitty disease. At some 
                        point she won’t be able to dress herself. 
                        She’ll be dependent on some minimum-wage 
                        hospice worker and Velcro. She’ll develop 
                        what’s called a “Parkinson’s Face”, this 
                        scowl from weakened facial muscles which 
                        makes you look pissed off when you think 
                        you’re smiling. People avoid you. Off her 
                        meds, everyday movements get to be hell -- 
                        dialing, typing, brushing, wiping. It’s 
                        almost impossible to work. On the meds, a 
                        few normal hours have to be paid for with 
                        nasty side effects. That squirming thing 
                        we all think of as Parkinson’s? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TREY (CONT'D)
                        That’s actually a side-effect of dopamine 
                        drugs. Then, just as the life-sucks meter 
                        dips to Appalachian, the disease gets 
                        ugly. Incontinence. Dementia. Immobility. 
                        We constantly come up with new treatments, 
                        but the disease always comes back. Who 
                        knows? Maybe they’ll find a cure. Then, 
                        again, maybe she’ll get tired of being 
                        tortured by her own body and put a gun to 
                        her head. If she can find a way to aim it. 
                                 (then)
                        No, she won’t die from Parkinson’s, but 
                        she sure the fuck will die with it.

           Quiet. Rain. Some deep anger’s been released in Trey.

           Finally...

                                 DR. CLODFELTER 
                        Christ, Hillman, that’s not a disease, 
                        it’s a Russian novel.

           Jamie watches Trey as the comment punctures his pious 
           fatalism, but Trey’s lost in thought. 

           Dr. Clodfelter tosses the joint away with a distaste.

           EXT. VA HOSPITAL - DAY

           The rain’s stopped. Trey and Jamie walk back to their 
           cars. Jamie reads aloud from his new “branded” pen. 

                     “Working with Dr. Clodfelter has been one of 
                     the most rewarding experiences of my life.”  

           Trey chuckles, clearly loves the guy.

                                 JAMIE 
                        Thanks for the introduction.
                                 (a half smile)
                        What do you want for it?

           Trey stops. He doesn’t hesitate.

                                 TREY
                        Stay away from Dr. Knight. 
                                 (then)
                        I’ll give you this hospital. You can sell 
                        a lot of Zithromax here. You know that.

                                 JAMIE
                        Wow. You’re not big on corporate loyalty.
                                 TREY
                        We’re a number to them. A fraction of a 
                        number. In a PowerPoint footnote.

           This is just enough to disarm Jamie. He’s been trying to 
           convince himself of precisely the opposite.

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        Look, the only way I can stomach this job 
                        is keeping my hours down. I need Knight.

           A long beat. 

                                 JAMIE 
                        Set me up with Maggie.

                                 TREY
                        No. What are you, some kind of predator? 

                                 JAMIE
                        A dinner. All of us. She won’t even know. 

           Trey grunts indignantly. 

                                 TREY 
                        She won’t give you the time of day. 

                                 JAMIE 
                        Let’s find out. 

           EXT. SUBURBAN PORCH - NIGHT

           Jamie holds a bottle of wine and rings a doorbell. MAYA, 
           a flighty woman in granola clothes, answers...

                                 MAYA
                        Oh. Shit, you must be Jamie. Trey didn’t 
                        call? He cancelled. He has strep throat.

           EXT. DRIVING RANGE - NIGHT

           Wearing a suit, Trey swings a driver. Huge flood lights 
           illuminate the fairway. Bugs dance. A sea of golf balls. 
           Trey’s lands way down by the rusting shell of an old car.

           CLOSE on Trey, deeply unhappy despite the perfect shot.
           INT. SUBURBAN DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           A dinner party. Maya and NEAL, the hosts, sit at the ends 
           of a table flanked by FIVE GUESTS. Two Couples and Jamie, 
           who sits between Maya and an empty chair. 

           The air is awkward. Maya tries to be entertaining.

                                 MAYA
                        So. Jamie. Does Canada like us? I always 
                        think Canadians are secretly judging us. 

                                 JAMIE
                        We are. Canada is the mousy cousin your 
                        Mother makes you take to parties, waving 
                        every time you look over. Don’t trust the 
                        goofy grin, we’re counting your drinks.

           Chuckles. The kitchen door opens. Maggie enters, surprised 
           to see Jamie. GREETINGS. Maya goes to get food.

                                 NEAL 
                        Mags, you know Trey’s friend, Jamie?

                                 MAGGIE 
                                 (ignoring Jamie)
                        Where is Trey?

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           APPETIZER. Jamie eats. Alone. Maggie’s chatting with the 
           Woman beside her. Maya is likewise engaged.

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           MAIN COURSE. Jamie eats. Still ignored.

                                 NEAL
                        Jamie, buddy, how you doing down there?

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           DESSERT. Jamie waits. Maggie’s in the kitchen with Maya, 
           who peeks his way. Are they talking about him?  

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           COFFEE. Jamie takes sugar, offers the bowl to Maggie, who 
           pretends not to notice. He passes it on to Maya.

                                 JAMIE 
                        Okay. I apologize. For the other day.
           They don’t look at each other. Speak under the table talk.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not some lackey for the Man. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You’re a drug rep.

                                 JAMIE
                        Yes. Correct. Officially, I’m a lackey. 
                        But not a liar. It’s a new job. I went a 
                        little corporate. I wanna do well. 
                                 (then)
                        I have some serious ambition issues.

           She turns to him; it’s an oddly transparent thing to say. 

                                 MAGGIE 
                        Apology accepted.

           And we hear a WEIRD LAUGH.

           EXT. NEAL AND MAYA’S STREET - NIGHT

           Maggie’s laugh is guttural and indelicate. Real. She and 
           Jamie come down the street, feeling good from the wine. 

           She sees a MASSIVE SUV, runs to it, kicks its tires.

                                 MAGGIE 
                        Oooh! I hate these things! Hate! Hate!

                                 JAMIE
                        They should come with a bumper sticker: 
                        “Just because I have a small dick, doesn’t 
                        mean I can’t fuck the environment.”  

           Maggie loves this joke. Repeats it. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Did you make that up?

                                 JAMIE
                                 (hems, haws)
                        No, it’s from my friend Dede.

                                 MAGGIE 
                        Too bad. I’d have so had sex with you.  

           Her guttural laugh fills the quiet night air.
                                 JAMIE 
                        Can I ask you a question?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Sure.

                                 JAMIE
                        Does Trey have emotional problems?

           This stops her cold.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What?!

                                 JAMIE 
                        The rep rumor is he was kicked out of med 
                        school because of a breakdown.

           Maggie starts walking again. 

                                 MAGGIE 
                        Trey got his wife pregnant in high school 
                        -- he never went to college. Well, night 
                        school. Enough to get in at Lilly. Trey’s 
                        very...risk avoiding. Risk averse.

                                 JAMIE
                        Really?

                                 MAGGIE
                        You can smell the frustrated ambition on 
                        the guy from Wisconsin. 

           They stop at her car, an old Japanese import with primer 
           patches and half-peeled to-be-towed sticker.

                                 JAMIE 
                        So...

                                 MAGGIE
                        So...

           INT. LULU’S COFFEEHOUSE  - NIGHT

           Later. Maggie and Jamie are in a corner, both hold pens.

                                 MAGGIE 
                        Give it a number between zero and five. 

           She takes a stack of napkins and divides them up.
                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Five means it sounds great; zero means 
                        you’re not into it at all. Ready?

                                 JAMIE
                        Ready.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Anything Involving Furry Handcuffs.

           She gestures for him to write on a napkin. She writes her 
           number, makes a show of covering up her answer.

           She holds up a “1”. He reveals he has a “2”.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Nice. The key is to be absolutely honest. 
                        There are no wrong answers. You go. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Oral Sex With Whipped Cream.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Gutsy. 

           They write. He has a “0”. She has a “0”. Delighted grins. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I never got the whipped cream thing!

                                 JAMIE
                        Cause it’s rude. What, you can’t go there 
                        unless you pretend it’s pie? 

           Laughter. She scrutinizes him.

                                 MAGGIE 
                        A Threesome With Another Woman. 

           He hums appreciatively. Maggie writes “2”; Jamie, a “5”.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Of course.

                                 JAMIE
                        What does a two mean, exactly?

                                 MAGGIE
                        It means I’m probably lying.

                                 JAMIE
                        Spanking. The guy spanking the girl. 
           They scribble quickly. Maggie has a “3”. Jamie a “3”. The 
           sameness makes the air too charged for comment. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Video Taping Yourself Having Sex?

           Jamie shows a “2”. Sheepishly, Maggie shows a “5”. She’s 
           underlined it. Twice.

                                 JAMIE 
                        Wow. Really?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh, yeah.

           She can’t look at him, blushes, holds up a hand to cover  
           his stare. When she brings it down, their eyes hold. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Why does that embarrass you?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Game over.

           She slides the napkins away.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Tell me something you’re ashamed of -- 
                        something you never tell people. 

                                 JAMIE 
                        I was fired from my last job. 
                                 (sotto)
                        There’s no sex in “team”. 

           She smiles to say she’s intrigued but won’t pry. Not now.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        I was peeper once. In seventh grade. Went 
                        down the street to Lonna Evans house. 
                        Peeped in her window for an hour. She 
                        didn’t take any clothes off but she did 
                        pick her nose and flick it on the carpet.

           Maggie’s amused. An uneasy SILENCE descends.

                                 MAGGIE
                        That doesn’t tell me much about you. 

           Jamie thinks a moment, pulls out his wallet. Digs a dirty 
           STRIP OF PAPER from the fold, one we vaguely recognize. 

           She reads aloud a child’s loopy handwriting...
                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        “My Life Goal. By Jamie Reidy. I want to 
                        make a million dollars. Canadian dollars 
                        only! Signed, Jamie Reidy. May 7, 1984.”

           They consider the strip of paper. Jamie grows ruminative.

                                 JAMIE
                        My family’s pretty money conscious. My 
                        Brother got rich. Which just made him more 
                        of a dick. My Dad’s obsessed with the 
                        stock market. Constantly sneaks off to his 
                        computer. Not that Mom lets him invest. 
                        She’s the kind that holds up grocery store 
                        lines while she balances her check book.
                                 (then)
                        All we ever talk about is money. Careers.

           This is hard for him. Maggie’s empathetic. Then she makes 
           a sly face, holds the paper closer to a candle flame.

                                 MAGGIE
                        If I burned this...you’d be free. I could 
                        change your entire life. Right now.

           For a moment he thinks she’ll do it. She hands the paper 
           back. He puts it away, embarrassed that it matters.

                                 JAMIE 
                        Okay. Your turn.

                                 MAGGIE  
                        God, I’m a cautionary tale. I’ve got the 
                        impulse control of a ferret. Really. I’m 
                        horrible with money. I was late twice 
                        with my phone bill, which triggered some 
                        sneaky clause in my Visa contract and 
                        jacked my MAR up to like 28%. I live for 
                        Visa. I’m Visa’s bitch. And I have over 
                        12,000 dollars of medical debt. No health 
                        insurance. No dental. God, I miss dental. 
                        People with dental are glamorous. They’re 
                        my aspirational group. You have dental?
                                 (he does)
                        Sexy. What else? I’m a music snob. I like 
                        temporary, dead-end jobs. Right now, it’s 
                        a café. And I help out weekends on this 
                        church bus that takes Retirees to Ontario 
                        to buy drugs. I love old people. I guess 
                        I’m not supposed to say that. You can’t 
                        love a category. You’re not supposed to 
                        even see a category. Which is a shame. I 
                        miss categories. Where was I? 
                                 JAMIE
                        Old people.

                                 MAGGIE
                        There’s just something about older people 
                        that feels really human. Done. 

                                 JAMIE
                        I didn’t hear a lot of dark secrets.

                                 MAGGIE 
                        My Mom couldn’t remember my father’s last 
                        name. On my birth certificate it actually 
                        says, “Dave Something”. Capital S.

                                 JAMIE
                        Aren’t you Miss Something?

           She touches herself and makes a sizzling sound.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        That’s all you’ve got?

           She thinks. He looks down at her hand, shaking slightly. 
           She moves it under the table, making it a taboo topic.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Nothing? 

           Maggie stares at him a moment, a decisive moment. 

                                 MAGGIE 
                        I seduced a married man. A couple of 
                        months ago. Someone you know. 

           Jamie realizes she means Trey Hillman. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        It was just an ordinary Wednesday night. 
                        I was feeling lonely and cynical. 
                                 (then)
                        Those don’t mix well with alcohol.

                                 JAMIE
                        Could it happen again?

           She starts to lie, then looks him right in the eye. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don’t know.
           EXT. LULU’S COFFEEHOUSE - NIGHT  

           Maggie and Jamie walk to their cars without speaking. The 
           romantic tension is gone. At her car, she lingers a beat. 

           She digs in her purse for keys. Her shaking hand makes it 
           difficult. The vulnerability is painful to watch.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Well. Good night.

                                 JAMIE
                        Night.

           They go their separate ways. Both a little angry.

           EXT. TINY WHITE COTTAGE - DAY 

           LONG on a cottage facing a slow urban Avenue. A parking 
           lot beside it has one car: a white Chevy Lumina.

           A second Lumina crosses frame. Brakes. The second Lumina 
           backs into view again. And enters the lot.

           INT. THERAPIST’S WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Trey emerges from an inner office with DR. BERG, a woman 
           in her fifties. Jamie's pacing, waiting, anxious.  

                                 JAMIE
                        We need to talk.

                                 TREY 
                        Dr. Berg, this is Jamie Reidy. Jamie's 
                        your Zoloft Rep. 

                                 JAMIE
                                 (a quick hand shake)
                        Hi. Nice to meet you, Doctor.

                                 DR. BERG
                        Likewise, Jamie.

                                 TREY 
                        So?

           Jamie cuts his eyes to Dr. Berg.

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        Dr. Berg is my therapist. 
                                 JAMIE
                        Oh. Right. Sorry. Okay. 
                                 (then)
                        You cheated on your wife with Maggie?

                                 TREY
                                 (to Dr. Berg)
                        Excuse us.

           He grabs Jamie's arm and throws him into the... 

           INT. THERAPIST’S KITCHEN - DAY 

           The door swings close. Trey points menacingly in Jamie's 
           face. Jamie flips him off, shakes it for emphasis. 

           They argue in furious whispers.

                                 JAMIE
                        Why didn’t you tell me?! 

                                 TREY
                        How is it any of your damn business?! 

           Trey calms himself. Reeling. Wounded. 

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        Frankly, Pfizer, I didn’t think you’d get 
                        far enough for it to matter. 
                                 (then)
                        You’re right. You’re right. I should have 
                        told you to go fuck yourself. 

                                 JAMIE 
                        I’m taking Dr. Knight.

           Jamie holds his eyes. The game is on. He yanks the door 
           open. Dr. Berg is on the other side, eavesdropping. She 
           steps aside. Jamie hurries past.

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - DAY 

           A golf bag waits. Jamie's on a pay phone.

                                 JAMIE
                        Dr. Knight? Hi. Jamie Reidy...No, no, not 
                        a problem...If I scored Bulls tickets, 
                        I’d stand you up, too...[fake laugh]... 
                        Say hi for me. Seriously. Hillman’s a 
                        great guy...Not at all....Sure...Bye...
           EXT. PRACTICE GREEN - DAY 

           Jamie takes a practice putt. Misses. 

                                 BRUCE (O.S.)
                        What the H, Reidy? 

           Bruce has stopped on his way into the club house. 

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        Aren’t you playing a round with Knight?

                                 JAMIE
                        Someone got him Bulls tickets.

           Bruce immediately understands. Hillman. Jamie’s being out 
           played. He shakes his head with real contempt. 

                                 BRUCE
                        Do not turn in your green’s fee receipt.

           INT. CHILI’S BAR - DAY 

           On his third beer, Jamie sulks. Late Afternoon. The only 
           other patrons are a Cop Couple eating early supper with 
           their Baby. The Bartender is doing some sort of homework.

           Jamie can’t believe his luck when the beautiful Merk Rep 
           (the Perfect Woman) enters and stands down the bar. 

                                 PERFECT WOMAN 
                        Sparkling water, please. With a lime.

           She checks her watch, adorably disheveled.

                                 JAMIE
                        Hello, Lisa.

           Jamie waves. She scrutinizes him. Nods perfunctorily. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, God. Sorry. You’re not Lisa. Sorry. 
                        Thought you were someone else. 

           She shrugs. The Bartender serves her. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        I know you though. Merk, right?

           She gives the Bartender a pleading look, which he passes 
           on to Jamie, who raises his beer in apology. 
                                 VOICE ON HOSTESS SPEAKER
                        Kenny! Bree Ann needs you!

           The Bartender goes. 

           An awkward silence. Jamie can’t stand it.

                                 JAMIE 
                        Sorry. For bothering you. Before.
                                 (a beat)
                        It’s just...well, women usually like me. 
                        Women find me likable. They sense my need 
                        for universal acceptance. Not liking me 
                        would be cruel. It’s Pity Like. You know 
                        what I say to pity? I say, “Thank you.”

           She finally lets herself CHUCKLE. 

                                 PERFECT WOMAN 
                        Fine. I pity you.

                                 JAMIE
                        I appreciate that. 
                                 (he pats a stool)
                        Come see me some time.

           She considers him a moment. Looks back to the door. She 
           leaves her purse, comes to him. He extends his hand.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Jamie Reidy. Pfizer. 

           She ignores the hand, but her name is SHAWNA STONE.

                                 SHAWNA 
                        Okay, this is how it works: attractive 
                        woman date successful men. No, it’s not 
                        romantic, but that’s the market. So, 
                        right now, you’re trying to buy something 
                        you can’t afford. And all you’re offering 
                        is some cute sales talk. Sorry, I don’t 
                        do start-ups. I’m a hard equity girl. I 
                        became a rep for one reason: doctors. To 
                        meet doctors. To fraternize with doctors. 
                        To breed with doctors. So, whenever you 
                        see me in the field, just smile politely. 
                        Don’t ask for a handout. It’s awkward.

           She’s not done.

                                 SHAWNA (CONT’D)
                        Another thing. Stop telling the market 
                        our drugs killed Jim Henson.
           INT. JAMIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Sparse. Pizza boxes. A few Pfizer mugs. The kitchen table 
           is cluttered with reports. Working late -- tired, bored -- 
           Jamie transcribes field notes into a laptop.

                                 JAMIE
                        Dr. Jupta then suggested we offer frequent-
                        flyer points for scripts--

           Jamie jumps at a sudden POUNDING on his front door.

           INT. ENTRY FOYER - NIGHT

           Jamie peers through the keyhole. Puzzled, he unlocks the 
           door and opens it to reveal...

                                 JOSH
                        Farrah wants to fuck somebody else.

           Jamie's BROTHER enters in a cyclone of angry adrenaline. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Minimal. Feels like a dorm room. Cinder-block bookshelves 
           with a lot of books-on-tape, all business related.

           Jamie watches Josh pace in intense circles. 

                                 JOSH
                        She told me she’s “sexually obsessed” 
                        with some guy from Yoga. 

                                 JAMIE
                        She told you?

                                 JOSH
                        Her Sister made her, before anything 
                        could happen. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Whoa.

           Josh’s cell rings. He checks the caller ID and holds it 
           up for Jamie to see “HOME”. Josh clicks ignore. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        But nothing did happen?
                                 JOSH
                        She wants to fuck another guy! Bad enough 
                        for sibling intervention! 

           Josh is clearly in pain. Jamie goes to embrace him.

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        Dude, we’re not huggers. 

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Jamie flosses, listening to Josh’s strained and furious 
           whispers -- he’s on the phone in the Living Room.

                                 JOSH (O.S.)
                        Shut up! Shut up! Listen to me. Listen to 
                        me closely. I will never, ever thank you 
                        for being honest. Ever!...Yes! I’d prefer 
                        you lie! Lie! Lie! Lie! 

           Jamie has stopped flossing, lost in a sudden thought. He 
           stays that way, tracking down an idea, until...

           He reaches down and wipes the sink.

           EXT. MEGA-CHURCH - DAY 

           The WILLOWBEND CHURCH. Huge. Hip. Non-denominational. 

                                 JOSH (O.S.)
                        This church has a Starbucks?

           INT. ATRIUM OF MEGA-CHURCH - DAY 

           Massive. Fancy. BOOKSTORE. Food-court VENDORS. Tables in 
           the center surround a STAGE with rock instruments. 

           Sixty RETIREES mill about. Each with an overnight bag.

                                 JAMIE (O.S.)
                        Okay. That’s her.

           We move close on a huge CUT-OUT of the WillowBend Pastor 
           and his latest book: “My Bad: Sermons on Original Sin”. 

                                 JOSH (O.S.)
                        She’s hot. Great body.

           We move around the cutout to find Jamie and Josh. 
                                 JAMIE  
                        Yeah, well, that’s not everything.

                                 JOSH
                        Only fifty-one percent. 

           Josh pretends to read a brochure as they look to where...

           Maggie holds a clipboard, talks with a Woman in a Lady Di 
           sweater she’s knitted herself. An EXTREMELY HANDSOME GUY 
           approaches, rests a hand on her back, whispers in an ear. 

                                 JAMIE 
                        Who the hell is that?

           This is SANDY (28), earring, Christian music festival T-
           shirt (”Rock Against Evolution). He goes on the stage. 

           APPLAUSE. Sandy is very popular.

                                 SANDY 
                        Thanks. No. No. Stop. Hey, everybody. I’m 
                        Sandy. I’m the New Music Minister here at 
                        WillowBend. If this your first time going 
                        up with us, please check in with Maggie.

           Maggie waves an arm to be visible.

                                 SANDY (CONT’D)
                        Good. Before we load up, I need to tell 
                        you we lost two regulars this week. Mrs. 
                        Korski passed away on Monday; and Anita 
                        Jarrett, early yesterday morning.
                                 (over murmurs)
                        Let’s be sure to remember them in our bus 
                        prayers as we ride out. Thanks. Be safe. 

           Everyone mutters a return thanks. Another smattering of 
           applause. Sandy is well and truly loved.

           The Retirees move to the doors. Maggie turns to see Jamie 
           through the crowd. It takes her a moment to place him.

           He waves, embarrassed. She waves, unsure. She seems about 
           to come to him, when Sandy joins her with a problem.

                                 JOSH (O.S.)
                        She doesn’t really shake all that much. 

                                 JAMIE (O.S.)
                        It’s a resting tremor. It only happens 
                        when her muscles are at rest.
           Sandy has his hand on her again as they turn for the door.

                                 JOSH
                        You can’t cock block a minister, Bro. You  
                        could piss off God. 

           They watch Maggie and Sandy move toward the exit.

                                 JOSH (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        If she leaves without looking back, that’s 
                        God telling you to stand the fuck down... 
                        Wait for it...Wait for it...Answer is....

           Maggie exits. She doesn’t look back.

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, Bro. God likes him better than you.

                                 JAMIE 
                        Wait here.

           Jamie runs after her.

           EXT. FRONT WALK OF MEGA-CHURCH - DAY 

           Retirees board two large TOUR BUSES. Banners with a happy 
           type-face announce these are the “Rx Express”. Maggie and 
           Sandy are half way down the sidewalk.

                                 JAMIE (O.C.)
                        Maggie!

           She gestures for Sandy to walk on. 

           Jamie jogs to her. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Hi. Listen. I wanted to get your number. 

           She tilts her head and gives him a withering look.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re right. I was freaked out by the 
                        Trey thing. But it was really brave of you 
                        to tell me. Not smart maybe. But brave. 
                        And moral. And...Does he have to stare? 

           She cuts her eyes to where Sandy eyeballs them. 

                                 MAGGIE 
                        Sandy’s my Moving Guy.
                                 JAMIE
                        What’s a Moving Guy? 

                                 MAGGIE 
                        You know, a Moving Guy. 
                                 (he has no idea)
                        Every woman has a Moving Guy. A friend. 
                        With a little unspoken romantic tension. 
                        But you don’t really have much in common. 
                        You go to lunch with him, but not dinner. 
                        You’ll invite him to parties, but not 
                        dinner parties. If you’re honest, you’d 
                        admit you’re kind of keeping him in 
                        orbit, so when you need someone to help 
                        you move...or set up a new computer...

           She holds up a “just-a-second” finger for Sandy.

                                 JAMIE
                        Wow. That’s harsh.

                                 MAGGIE 
                        No, Moving Guy knows his chances aren’t 
                        good, but he’s smart. He knows women have 
                        this internal excitement-versus-stability 
                        scale. Sooner or later, the scale tips. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Moving Guy’s not smart, he’s sad.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Ah, it’s the cloak of pity that makes 
                        Moving Guy dangerous. He’s waiting for 
                        guys like you to screw up.

                                 JAMIE
                        Guys like me?

                                 MAGGIE 
                        Yep. 

                                 JAMIE
                        What kind of guy is that?

           She holds his eyes. Hesitates.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Tell me. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        The kind who doesn’t like complications. 
                        Smooth. Shiny. A little...retail. 
                                 SANDY 
                        Maggie!

           The bus is loaded and ready. She shrugs. Leaves.

                                 JAMIE
                        What does retail mean?

           Maggie waves without turning back. A bus honks. She runs.  
           Jamie sees she has a lopsided run, a Parkinson’s run.

           She boards a bus. The two buses pull away. Josh comes up.

                                 JOSH
                        You get her digits?

           Jamie shakes his head.

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        Loser. What are you gonna do?

                                 JAMIE 
                        Be here when she gets back.

           He takes the brochure from his Brother. Scans it.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Tomorrow night. Midnight.

           The buses grow small in the endless parking lot

                                 JOSH
                        Damn. Those people go for two days just 
                        save a few bucks on prescriptions?

                                 JAMIE
                        Poverty sucks, Josh.

                                 JOSH
                        Evidently.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           CLOSE on a dashboard CLOCK. It’s midnight.

           INT. LUMINA - NIGHT

           Jamie sits in his car. Drums the wheel. We see a BOX for 
           a CD he’s listening to: “Building Business Vocabulary”.

                                 VOCABULARY TAPE
                        Value Driver. Core Competencies. Wow 
                        Factor. Thought Leader. 
           Suddenly, he’s washed by HEADLIGHTS, peers into them. But 
           it’s just another car coming to pick someone up.

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           Jamie checks the clock. It’s “1:29”. Where are they? 

                                 VOCABULARY TAPE (CONT’D)

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           Later. Jamie now mouths the vocabulary phrases by heart.

                                 VOCABULARY TAPE (CONT’D)

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           Jamie’s fallen asleep. Drools. 

           The clock reads: “4:17”.

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           Dawn threatens. The car appears empty. 

           Buses RUMBLE past. Close. Jamie pops up in the back seat, 
           yanked awake, groggy. He gives his pits a smell check. 

           EXT. BUSES - DAWN

           Tired, Maggie waves good-bye to the last of the Retirees, 
           takes her clipboard to Sandy, who’s quietly petulant.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What?

           He nods across the lot...Jamie can be seen sitting on the 
           hood of her car, tucking in his shirt.

           EXT. PARKING LOT OF MEGA-CHURCH - DAWN

           Maggie walks toward Jamie in the morning mist. Neither 
           smiles. She comes to the car. Drops her bag. She looks 
           off a second to gather her thoughts.

           Then...
                                 MAGGIE 
                        Go slow. Guys always want to fall in love 
                        right away. Before you build trust -- or 
                        fight -- or pee with the door open. And 
                        talk. I’m a girl: I like details. You can 
                        tell me anything. Anything. Except your 
                        favorite bands, don’t want to know. And if 
                        you dump me, I won’t support you through 
                        it. That’s fucked up. If you end it, I get 
                        to hate you. And act all cold. And tell 
                        embarrassing stuff to mutual friends.

                                 JAMIE
                        That it?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yes. Thank you. 

           A beat. She rubs her arms. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Why am I mad at you already?! 

                                                      A FEW QUICK SCENES:

           1. MAGGIE’S TRIPLEX. Maggie and Jamie fall against her 
           front door, kissing passionately. She manages to get out 
           her keys, opens the door, flips on the light...SHRIEKS. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Did you see that?! Was that a mouse?! 

           2. HOME DEPOT. Later. Jamie scans a diverse wall of mouse 
           traps. Maggie finds a CUTE COTTAGE, a catch-and-release 
           trap, “Humane House”. Jamie smirks, but takes it to check 
           out anyway. She bounces happily after him.

           3. JAMIE'S LIVING ROOM. That night. Maggie plays CD’s for 
           Jamie, educating him. She holds one reverently.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I think you’re ready for...Uncle Tupelo.

           3. DENNY’S. Breakfast. Maggie’s book (”Infinite Jest”) 
           and Jamie's book-on-tape (”Who Moved My Cheese”) are on 
           the table. They’re hoarse from a long night of talking. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        My BA’s in Cultural Studies. We learned 
                        how to be unemployable. And how to resent 
                        it. Wait...Don’t you have to go to work?
                                 JAMIE
                        Nope. They let me set my own hours.

           4. JAMIE’S BEDROOM. Afternoon. Great sex. Maggie’s near 
           orgasm. Her tremor hand shutters wildly. 

           5. APPLEBEE’S. Wearing a suit, Josh chats in the take-out 
           line with a SQUIBB REP in sexy Halloween costume. 

                                 JOSH
                        My Brother’s a Pfizer Rep. He’s got a new 
                        girl so I’m helping him out. Delivering 
                        lunches. Getting gas receipts. His DM has 
                        no idea. I’m glad to do it. I’m staying 
                        at his place for awhile. Separated. You?

           6. GAS STATION. A credit card -- “Jamie Reidy” -- slides 
           in and out of the pump. Turning from blowing leaves, Josh 
           tanks the Lumina. He’s talking loud on his cell phone.

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        No, not a “little crush”. Obsession. You 
                        called it an obsession.

           7. ANOTHER GAS STATION. Light snow. Again, Josh tanks the 
           Lumina. Again, he’s on his cell phone.

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        Counseling? Okay, here’s some counseling: 
                        stop being be a bitch! Oh, wait, did I 
                        use “you language”? I’m so sorry, let me 
                        re-phrase. I feel...stop being a bitch! 

           8. STILL ANOTHER GAS STATION. Deep snow. Josh tanks the 
           Lumina. He’s on his cell phone per usual.

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        I know I’ll win custody! I’m rich!

                                 A FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Excuse me?! Sir?!

           It’s a WOMAN WITH A STATION WAGON at the adjacent pump. 

                                 STATION WAGON WOMAN
                        Sorry, but it’s really dangerous to use a 
                        cell phone while pumping gas. 

           She points to a “Baby on Board” sticker. Her eyes widen 
           in horror. She ducks. A gas cap sails over her.

           9. JAMIE’S LIVING ROOM. Josh watches TV. Jamie sneaks in 
           wearing a towel, gets a VIDEO CAMERA from the TV cabinet.
                                 JOSH 
                        Oh, Man...Yuck! Use her place already!

           10. GOLF COURSE. Closed for Winter. Pristine snow. Quiet. 
           Laughter. Yells. Jamie chases Maggie over the fairway. 

           11. NOTRE DAME FOOTBALL GAME. Dr. Knight blows his hands 
           to keep warm. Someone hands him a steaming coffee. 

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        Fourth and goal. What do you say we up 
                        our wager to 300?

           Trey sits beside him -- his grin says, “Sure. Why not?”

                                                                 OUT TO:

           INT. MEN’S ROOM IN OLIVE GARDEN - DAY 

           Furious, Bruce splashes water on his face. Jamie stands 
           behind him. Christmas Muzak plays.

                                 BRUCE 
                        You’re 81% off quota on Zoloft! Eight. 
                        One. Twelve points down, Jamie?!

                                 JAMIE
                        Bad. Yes. But my Zithro’s up four--

                                 BRUCE
                        So?! 

           Bruce realizes he’s being indiscreet. Lowers his voice. 

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        Average patient will need 20 antibiotic 
                        scripts in a lifetime. He’ll take Zoloft 
                        every single day. Until he dies!
                                 (venomous)
                        Which one should be your priority?! Which 
                        one justifies all the gas you burn?!

           Jamie goes silent. Bruce dries his face.

           A hard beat. 

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        Chicago’s opening up. Phil said all four 
                        of his other DM’s want the job. There’s a 
                        list. I’m the third name on it. Third!
                                 (turning to him)
                        How are you going to support me on this?
                                 JAMIE
                        Dr. Knight. Help me land Knight. Give him 
                        an unrestricted educational grant.

           Bruce considers. This is a big ask. Somewhere out in the 
           resturant, a waiter chorus of Happy Birthday starts.

           INT. DR. KNIGHT’S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY 

           Dr. Knight purses his lips.

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        There’s no paper work?

           Jamie shakes his head -- he sits across a chaotic desk.

                                 JAMIE
                        We give you a check. You write Zoloft. 
                        We’re paying you to educate yourself.

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        On what?

                                 JAMIE
                        On how to get paid to educate yourself.

           Dr. Knight laughs. Thinks. Makes a unsure clicking sound.

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        I really want to take your money.
                                 (fishing)
                        Hillman says he can’t guarantee his drug 
                        won’t effect sexual desire. Can you?

           The good doctor is seeking absolution. 

           CLOSE on Jamie. Wheels spin. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Sexual dysfunction is a non-issue with 
                        Zoloft, Doctor. 

           Dr. Knight nods. DEAL. 

           We hold on Jamie's big, forced, false smile. 

           EXT. SKETCHY SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

           A SMILEY FACE on a water-tower. Shadowed. Ominous. 
           The tower stands at the end of a row of 50’s TRIPLEXES. A 
           silhouette stands an upper window of the last building. 

           INT.  MAGGIE’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jamie turns from the window, feeling dirty. Dinner dishes 
           are still on the table. Maggie’s fallen asleep on the 
           sofa and lights from a Christmas tree play over her face. 

           Jamie wanders the room, aimlessly examining her things...

           A PAINTING. Two crudely-painted circles. One labeled “Her 
           Fantasy”; the other “His Fantasy”. The thin section where 
           the circles overlap is marked “Love”. A shelf of foreign 
           travel GUIDES. PHOTO BOXES, each dated. He takes the most 
           recent box down. Carefully lifts the lid... 

           SNAPSHOTS of Maggie’s everyday life. Friends. Signs. Cars. 
           Meals. Service People. (Think early Stephen Shore.)

           He finds a shot of himself, the one taken the first day 
           they meet outside Dr. Knight’s office. He turns it over; 
           on the back is scribbled: “Sleazy Drug Rep -- 5/20/97”.

           Jamie considers the photo; its label clearly bothers him. 

           He puts the box away and goes to sit beside Maggie. She’s 
           so still. Beautiful. Vulnerable. Real. 

           He wakes her, gently, watches her tremor hand start to 
           shimmer. Happy to find Jamie in her dreams, Maggie holds 
           her hand up to his face. He starts to kiss it. 

           INT. MAGGIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jamie and Maggie have slow sex. Long gazes. Timid love.

           Suddenly, out in the living area, they hear a loud CLACK, 
           followed by chaotic series of scary SCRAPING SOUNDS. 

           INT. MAGGIE’S HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Jamie and Maggie warily open the bedroom door, listen as 
           the noise gets closer...moving in fits and starts... 

           A MASSIVE RAT turns the corner, dragging the Humane House 
           after it, tail caught in the trap door. Maggie GASPS.

                                 JAMIE
                        Jesus!
           The House was designed for mice, the rat drags it easily. 
           It scampers into the bathroom. Disappears. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Shit!

           Jamie tip-toes to the bathroom and quickly pulls the door 
           shut. Nerves give way to laughter.

                                 MAGGIE 
                        We have to help it...

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           We hear the shower curtain collapse. Maggie winces at the 
           closed bathroom door. Jamie yells from within...

                                 JAMIE
                        Fuck, I’m bit! Fuck!

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           Maggie has the door cracked, peeking inside, jumping up 
           and down. We hear a pot slamming tile.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Kill it! Kill it!

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           Jamie collapses at the door. Rips off kitchen gloves. One 
           of his middle fingers has a ripped gash. Serious blood.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God! Oh my God!

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM OF VA HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Dr. Clodfelter examines Jamie's wound. Maggie and Trey 
           watch. Clodfelter and Trey wear Santa outfits from some 
           interrupted Christmas event. Trey still holds a beer.

                                 TREY
                        Rat bite. That’s gross.

           Maggie gives him a warning look. 

                                 DR. CLODFELTER
                        Careful. Don’t bleed on me.

                                 JAMIE
                        Will I need rabies shots?
                                 TREY
                        I’d be more worried about Rat Fever, 
                        Murine Typhus, Hepatitis E.

                                 MAGGIE
                        He’s making those up. There’s no such 
                        thing as Hepatitis E.

           Dr. Clodfelter yells to a RESIDENT across the ER.

                                 DR. CLODFELTER
                        Dr. Takwah! Main source of Hepatitis E in 
                        this country is...?!

                                 RESIDENT
                        Rodents!

           Maggie shrugs for Jamie. He mouths a “thank you”. Maggie 
           sweats. Trey notices. Jamie notices him noticing.

           An SQUEAMISH NURSE walks by...

                                 SQUEAMISH NURSE
                        That the rat bite?

           They all “yeah” in unison.

           EXT. VA HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Jamie and Maggie come though rattling automatic doors. He 
           has a thickly bandaged finger. She yawns, exhausted. 

           As they go down the sidewalk, Trey emerges behind them.

                                 TREY
                        Pfizer! Got a second?!

           They share a weary glance. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        At least you’ll already be in the ER.

           INT. ENTRY AREA OF VA HOSPITAL - NIGHT 

           Trey’s waiting as Jamie re-enters. They stand just inside 
           the doors -- which occasionally creak open, apparently of 
           their own mysterious accord. 

                                 TREY
                        You need to be more responsible.
                                 JAMIE
                        What are you talking about? 

                                 TREY
                        Maggie’s over medicating.
                                 (no response)
                        The sweats. The drowsiness. 
                                 (no response)
                        Have you bothered to learn anything about 
                        this disease?

           They can see Maggie outside, down at the walk, hugging 
           herself against the cold wind. Tiny. Exposed. 

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        The tremor’s there every second of every 
                        day, reminding her she’s fucked. So she 
                        tries to suppress it. But PD drugs have 
                        to be properly titrated. You don’t get to 
                        take a lot of pills and hope it goes away 
                        -- it’s not going anywhere.

           Jamie hates getting this from Trey, both the exaggerated 
           concern of it and the possibility he may be right.

                                 JAMIE
                        I was there when Knight wrote her scripts; 
                        he seemed to think the dosage was normal.

                                 TREY
                        He’s a family practitioner, Pfizer. I sent 
                        her to him because he’s a drug whore. 

           Jamie reels. 

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        Maggie’s future is a fucking terrifying 
                        place. Personally, I don’t think you’ll 
                        be around for much of it. But, for right 
                        now, you’re in a position to help. 
                                 (he’s not asking)
                        Make her face this disease.

           Jamie says nothing.

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        You hear me knocking? 

                                 JAMIE 
                        Yeah. Here’s what I think...I think you 
                        like it that Maggie’s sick. I think it 
                        makes going home to your wife tolerable.
           Their eyes lock. This might get ugly. Neither flinches. 

           Finally, Jamie turns, goes out the rattling doors. 

                                 TREY 
                        Does she tape the sex? 

           Jamie doesn’t stop. 

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        Ask yourself why she photographs things! 

           INT. JAMIE'S LUMINA - TRAVELING - NIGHT

           Jamie drives, letting his eyes worry over to Maggie. She 
           appears to sleep but her tremor hand shakes. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Maybe you should reduce your drug load.

           She hums a non-committal hum.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Parkinson’s is a serious disease.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’ll put that on my tombstone. “Fine. So, 
                        Parkinson’s is a serious disease.”

           They ride a silent moment. She keeps her eyes closed.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Trey’s one of those people who everything 
                        he says is really smart -- you just never  
                        know if it’s really true.

           He can’t help smile. She peeks. Pretends to sleep again. 
           Jamie rubs his bandaged hand on her face. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 JAMIE
                        Giving you rat cooties.

           She rubs the back of her left hand on his arm, up, down.

                                 MAGGIE
                        There. Now, you have Parkinson’s.

                                 JAMIE
                        I wish it was that easy.
                                 MAGGIE
                        No, you don’t.

           Maggie doesn’t say anything else, just retreats back into 
           her thoughts. And Jamie drives on. 

           EXT. JAMIE'S APARTMENT DOOR - NIGHT

           Jamie and Maggie stop at his front door, puzzled. They 
           hear SEX SOUNDS coming from inside.

           INT. JAMIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jamie and Maggie enter from the Foyer. A door down the 
           hallway SLAMS SHUT. A sex tape is playing on TV. There’s 
           a Vaseline jar and wads of tissue on the coffee table. 

           Then they see the worst of it: Jamie's video recorder is 
           hooked up to the TV -- playing their sex tape.

           INT. ECONOMY CLASS AIRLINE CABIN - TRAVELING - DAY

           Josh is on the aisle. Jamie reads a book on Parkinson’s. 

                                 JOSH 
                        You said she was “thinking” about coming 
                        for Christmas. So, just, chill.

                                 JAMIE
                        Chill?! My brother was masturbating while 
                        watching me have sex?!

                                 JOSH
                        Who looks at the guy? I was focusing her!

                                 JAMIE
                        Her?! Oh, you mean my girlfriend?!

                                 JOSH
                        Not her her! Her body parts! 

           A Woman in Front of them turns around.

                                 JAMIE
                        Hi, there. Thanks for contributing.

           She turns away. 

           A few amazingly weird seconds. 
                                 JOSH 
                        Does video make everything look bigger?

           Jamie drops the book.

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        Seriously, cause at first I was thinking 
                        you should get to the gym. But at one 
                        point there I was like...whoa. 

           Jamie waits. Nothing else. As he goes back to the book...

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        You think Dad is big? He was we when were 
                        kids, but everything is big to kids.
                                 (no response)
                        Fine. Sorry. Okay? I’m freaking out about 
                        seeing Farrah. My self-esteem is down. I 
                        need you not to have a big penis right now.

           INT. MR. REIDY’S CAR - TORONTO - DAY 

           Tense silence. Mr. Reidy drives. The seating arrangement 
           is the same as last year: Josh and his son in the front, 
           and Jamie, Mom, Jamie's Niece and Farrah in the back. 

           Only Jamie is not depressed, speaks more-or-less to Dad.

                                 JAMIE
                        I’ve pretty consistently busted quota.

                                 MRS. REIDY
                        Burst, Honey.

                                 MR. REIDY
                        Good. Your quota is everything. It lets 
                        them see that you eat, sleep, and breath 
                        for Pfizer Pharmaceuticals.  
                                 (then)
                        You won’t be just a drug rep for long.

           Jamie's a bit wounded by the implied contempt.

                                 MR. REIDY (CONT’D)
                        Takes a big man to start at the bottom.

                                 JAMIE
                        Yeah.

           Jamie goes completely silent. A long, miserable beat.

           Mrs. Reidy can feel the disappointment.
                                 MRS. REIDY
                        We’re real proud of you.
                                 (then)
                        Both our boys.
                                 (then)
                        And Farrah, too.

           INT. REIDY DINING ROOM - DAY 

           The Reidy Christmas Dinner. Horrible. Josh and Farrah are 
           ready to kill each other. Mrs. Reidy is fake smiling. 

           Jamie's Nephew starts to cry. Farrah rubs his back as she 
           glares at Josh. Jamie's Niece is next -- her Father pulls 
           her close. Then Farrah starts to sniffle. 

           As Josh fights a tear, we realize the family will soon be 
           under the same roof again. Still, no one dares speak. 

           EXT. APARTMENT BALCONY - LANSING - DAY

           A bundled FLIP-FLOP WOMAN waters plants. She sees someone 
           down below, leans around a broken satellite dish. 

                                 FLIP-FLOP WOMAN (O.S.) 
                        Darryl! Wasssuuuup?! Christmassss! 

           She woo-hoo’s in that sad, random, party-girl way. 

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        They were all crying?

                                 JAMIE (O.S.)
                        Yeah.

           INT. MAGGIE’S MOM’S KITCHEN - DAY 

           On the wall phone behind a messy bar, Maggie watches her 
           MOTHER (45) through a sliding glass door. 

                                 JAMIE (O.S.)
                        How was Christmas in Lansing?

                                 MAGGIE
                        We sat around drinking Fanta Vodkas and 
                        listening to classic rock radio. Now, my 
                        Mom’s on the balcony watering her pot.

                                 JAMIE (O.S.)
                        Festive.
           INT. REIDY UTILITY ROOM - DAY 

           Laundry. Jamie's on the house phone. He’s holding the 
           Parkinson’s book; it’s full of post-it notes.

                                 JAMIE
                        Pfizer’s got some guy going around the 
                        country, doing field interviews for a new 
                        division. He sent me an e-mail. Wants to 
                        meet. He’s coming to South Bend in a 
                        couple weeks. He’s gotta be in Chicago. 
                                 (carefully)
                        For the National Parkinson’s Convention.

                                                  INTERCUT AS THEY SPEAK:

           Jamie’s very tentative.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        I thought we could maybe go up for it. The 
                        Convention. For the weekend.
                                 (no response)
                        If it wouldn’t, you know, freak you out.

           Maggie stares straight ahead. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Maggie?

           Silence. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Maggie?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.

                                 JAMIE 
                        You okay?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.

                                 JAMIE
                        Say you’ll come.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Don’t try to close me.

           Silence. 

           She takes a deep breath.
           INT. HYATT LOBBY - CHICAGO - DAY 

           The National Parkinson’s Convention. AVERAGE AMERICANS. A 
           few with tremors, various kineses, shuffling gaits. 

           Moving through the crowd, Jamie scans a program.

                                 JERRY’S VOICE
                        Reidy!

           Jamie passes Jerry, the unpleasant Neuroscience Rep.

                                 JAMIE
                        Hey, Jerry. 

                                 JERRY 
                        The Urology Guy’s coming to South Bend. I 
                        heard you got an interview. 

           Jamie plays dumb and keeps moving. 

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Mention me!

           INT. HYATT MEZZANINE BAR - DAY

           Maggie sits alone with the bags. She watches CNN on a bar 
           TV [Clinton denies sexual relations with “that woman”]. 

           She’s feeling jittery, out-of-place. She’s relieved when 
           Jamie hurries up the stairs. He hands her THINGS.

                                 JAMIE 
                        Room card. We’re in 3241. All access pass 
                        ...Rock on! Boring booklet. Program.

           He shows her the program; he’s going to make this fun.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Next series starts in ten minutes. 
                        I’m going to the caregivers session.

                                 MAGGIE
                        “T-L-Me: Caring for Caregivers”.

                                 JAMIE
                        I’m hearing good buzz on “Young Onset Med 
                        Management” and “Nutrition Matters”. 

           She grabs the program with a pained grunt.
                                 MAGGIE 
                        I’ll do “Healing with Humor.” 

           INT. “CARING FOR CARE-GIVERS” SESSION - DAY 

           Mostly spouses. Jamie has a pad out. The CHEERY SEMINAR 
           LEADER writes letters on a white board...H-O-P-E.

                                 CHERRY SEMINAR LEADER
                        This is our care-givers mantra. H is for 
                        honesty. O is for optimism. P is for 
                        patience. And E...is for the E in hope. 

           The faulty parallelism screws up Jamie's neat notes.

           INT. “HEALING THROUGH HUMOR” SESSION - DAY 

           Maggie sits alone in a back row, anxious, taking in every 
           single twitch, tic and tremor in the room. 

           A NONDESCRIPT WOMAN with dyskinesia -- bobbing, squirming 
           -- steps to the mic. She looks the audience over.

                                 NONDESCRIPT WOMAN
                        Fuck soup.

           Shocked titters. It takes a couple of jokes for the crowd 
           to warm, as if everyone needs permission.

                                 NONDESCRIPT WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Fuck shoelaces. Fuck jewelry. 
                                 (then)
                        I feel better. Is it hot in here, or is 
                        it just my Levodopa? God. Shake and Bake. 
                        Look at you people. You’re like one giant 
                        Talking Heads Tribute Band. 

           Maggie cackles her weird laugh. She’s the only one.

                                 NONDESCRIPT WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Let’s try again. You’re like a choir from 
                        a crystal meth detox. 

           A smattering of chuckles.

                                 NONDESCRIPT WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Fine. You’re Don Knotts in “The Ghost and 
                        Mr. Chicken.” 

           Everyone laughs, applauds. The Comedian shakes her head.
           CLOSE on Maggie: this may just be camp enough to enjoy.

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           Maggie’s having a good time.

                                 NONDESCRIPT WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        I always used to say, I hate my body. “I 
                        hate my body.” What, it was listening?

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           Maggie’s having a great time.

                                 NONDESCRIPT WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Why can’t this disease make you sexier? 
                        Like heroin. My friend, Rumi, had breast 
                        cancer. Man, they gave her great tits. 
                        She had crap! Now, Pam Tits! For free!

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           The Comedian cocks an ear and shushes the crowd.

                                 NONDESCRIPT WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Wait. Wait. 

           She listens carefully.

                                 NONDESCRIPT WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Never mind. Sorry. 
                                 (then)
                        I thought there was a cure coming.

           This resonates. The room EXPLODES. Maggie’s on her feet.

           INT. “CARING FOR CARE-GIVERS” SESSION - DAY

           Jamie's at the coffee table. Nodding at everybody. Trying 
           too hard. He waits on non-dairy creamer from a CALIFORNIA 
           MAN with a fancy watch and country-club clothes.

                                 CALIFORNIA MAN
                        Your wife?

                                 JAMIE
                        Girlfriend. Stage One. You?

                                 CALIFORNIA MAN
                        Wife. Since ‘73.
                                 JAMIE
                        Any advice?

           The Man glances at him, goes back to fixing his coffee.

                                 CALIFORNIA MAN 
                        You don’t need my advice.

                                 JAMIE
                        I’m very trainable.

           There’s something too slick about this kid.

                                 CALIFORNIA MAN
                        My advice is to go upstairs, pack your 
                        bags and leave a nice note. Go find 
                        yourself a healthy woman. I love my wife. 
                        I do. But I wouldn’t do it over again.

           His voice is guileless, flat with heartache.

                                 CALIFORNIA MAN (CONT’D)
                        The thing nobody tells you: this disease 
                        will steal everything you love in her. 
                        Her mind. Her body. Her smile.
                                 (a beat)
                        Don’t listen to me. I’m a grumpy bastard.

           He leaves Jamie with a quick, guilty pat.

           INT. JAMIE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY 

           Jamie sits in an arm chair, shell-shocked.

           Maggie’s filthy bag is on the bed, messy, its contents 
           strewn. She has a lot of medicine. On the luggage rack, 
           his own bag is still neatly packed, ready to go....

           He’s startled by the sound of the DOOR opening. 

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        What a great fucking idea!

           Maggie enters, elated. He gives her a salesman’s smile.

                                 JAMIE
                        Hi, there. 

           EXT. MAGGIE’S TRIPLEX - SOUTH BEND - NIGHT

           The Lumina rolls to stop out front. The doors don’t open.
           INT. JAMIE'S LUMINA - NIGHT

           Jamie’s distant. Maggie’s watchful. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        What’s wrong? You haven’t said two words 
                        since we left the hotel.

                                 JAMIE
                        I just need more prep for this meeting. 

           She reaches out and gently strokes his hair.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s okay. I’m not mad. Look at me.

           He shows her his eyes; there’s a flash of angry guilt in 
           them. She withdraws her hand. Her defenses go up. 

                                 JAMIE 
                        I’ve slacked off a lot. At work. Since we 
                        started. I need to focus. Drill down.

           They both know he’s lying. An ugly beat. 

           Everything changes.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s a lot, Maggie.

           Stillness.

           Maggie’s fighting tears now. She opens the door and gets 
           out. Slams it shut.

           Jamie waits. The back door opens. She grabs her bag. And 
           he flinches as she slams it, too. 

           INT. MAGGIE’S LIVING ROOM - DAWN

           Maggie hasn’t slept. Red-eyed, she gets a box from a high 
           shelf, rummages, finds a dirty CASSETTE and old WALKMAN.

           EXT. MAGGIE’S TRIPLEX - DAWN

           Maggie comes out in sweat pants, wearing headphones. She 
           starts the tape. MUSIC. Warbled. Tinny. It’s Cindi Lauper 
           -- recorded off the radio years ago, a guilty pleasure. 
                                 THE TINNY SONG
                        Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick... 

           Maggie jogs off down her street, lined with dirty snow. 

           EXT. MAGGIE’S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAWN

           A junky avenue. Light poles. Wires. Signs for the usual 
           loans, lubes, liquor. Maggie runs. 

                                 AND THE SONG GOES 
                        Sometimes you picture me. I’m walking too 
                        far ahead. You’re calling to me, I can’t 
                        hear what you’ve said. You say, “Go slow, 
                        I fall behind.” The second hand unwinds.

           She runs down a FRONTAGE ROAD. Cars whizz pass. 

                                 AND THE SONG GOES (CONT’D)
                        If you’re lost, you can look and you will 
                        find me. Time after time. 

           She moves in front of an abandoned STRIP MALL. 

                                 AND THE SONG GOES (CONT’D)
                        If you fall, I will catch you. I will be 
                        waiting. Time after time.

           The jogs through the DOLLAR STORE PARKING LOT with the 
           large dumpster in center of it. 

                                 AND THE SONG GOES (CONT’D)
                        If you’re lost, you can look and you will 
                        find me. Time after time.

           She slows. Stops. Stares at nothing; her face, blank.

                                 AND THE SONG GOES (CONT’D)
                        If you fall, I will catch you. I will be 
                        waiting. Time after time.

           She’s hardening her heart.

                                 AND THE SONG GOES (CONT’D)
                        Time after--

           Maggie clicks the song abruptly OFF. 
           INT. COURTYARD BY MARRIOTT ROOM - SOUTH BEND - DAY

           We push in SLOWLY on Jamie being interviewed, not really 
           listening, lost in an unexpected misery. 

                                 SOME MAN  (O.S.)
                        We got early third-stage approval for the 
                        new PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil citrate.

           Closer. Jamie barely seems to breathe.

                                 SOME MAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I’m out on the road talking to reps. The 
                        best. For a new Urology division. 

           Closer. Jamie looks down at his left hand. Still.

                                 SOME MAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Set up just to market our ED drug. Local 
                        man will answer to Bruce -- until we can 
                        hire a Urology DM out here. Reidy?

           This gets Jamie's attention.

                                 JAMIE
                        Yes. Brian. ED.

           Sitting across a table from Jamie is a corporate player 
           named BRIAN (33). This guy is no mere suit. 

                                 BRIAN
                        Erectile Dysfunction. Huge market. Not to 
                        mention the off-label potential for a pill 
                        that gives men rock-hard erections. And 
                        cuts the refractory period in half -- like 
                        when a second girl crawls into bed.

                                 JAMIE
                        An pill? For erections? 

           Brian considers the local talent. He went to Wharton for 
           this? He leans in and gestures Jamie closer.

                                 BRIAN
                        It’s not just a pill. It’s a revolution.
                                 (then)
                        We’re calling it “Viagra”.

                                                      A FEW QUICK SCENES:

           1. OB/GYN’S OFFICE. Packed. The door fly opens. Jamie. A 
           changed man. The Tough Receptionist jumps to her feet.
                                 TOUGH RECEPTIONIST
                        He’s here!

           Other Reps watch stunned as Jamie goes straight on back.

           2. MEMORIAL HOSPITAL ATRIUM. Jamie flirts with a Nurse. 
           Two Young Doctors nervously approach him.

                                 YOUNG DOCTOR
                        Mr. Reidy? Can we buy you lunch?

           3. GOLF COURSE. Jamie laughs with Three Moneyed Doctors. 
           Dr. Knight runs up. Winded. Uninvited.

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        Reidy. Hey. Viagra samples come in yet?

           4. VA HOSPITAL. Jamie leans against Dr. Clodfelter’s desk; 
           the MD ignores the violation of his personal space zone. 

                                 DR. CLODFELTER
                        How soon?

                                 JAMIE
                        Soon.

           5. RUBY TUESDAYS. Packed. Jamie's talking to three COEDS.

                                 COED ONE
                        Okay, let’s say a guy takes it and then, 
                        you know, “releases” inside of you. Will 
                        it burn? Down there?

                                 COED TWO
                        Or in your throat?

                                 COED THREE
                        Or in your eye?

           6. UROLOGIST’S RECEPTION AREA. Empty. A stunned DR. ELMER 
           (67) scans Jamie’s Viagra literature.

                                 DR. ELMER 
                        So patients can have sex until...?

                                 JAMIE
                        They die.

           7. VA HOSPITAL SAMPLE CLOSET. Jamie stocks it with brand 
           new Viagra packets. Veterans watch, ogling, reverent. 
           Someone hacks a cough, the others shush him with glowers.
           8. DR. ELMER’S HALLWAY. Jamie stocks his sample closet -- 
           there’s whole shelf for Viagra. Jamie can hear...

                                 DR. ELMER IN HIS OFFICE 
                        And you think you need Viagra?

                        MAN’S VOICE
                                                    WOMAN’S VOICE
           No.
                                             Yes.
                   (then)
                                                (then)
           No!
                                             Yes!

           A strained silence. Then...

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE 
                        Yes.

           9. LIVING ROOM. Jamie irons with spray starch. Watches 
           “Conan”. His apartment is now beautifully furnished. 

                                 CONAN O’BRIEN
                        By now, you’ve all heard about Viagra.
                                 (knowing chuckles)
                        That’s what women want to hear during 
                        sex: “Who’s your Grand-Daddy?!”

           The phone’s been ringing. The machine records a message. 

                                 JOSH (O.S.)
                        Bro! Where are my samples?! Saaaamples! I 
                        got you that job!

           10. APARTMENT COMPLEX PARKING LOT. Early. Jamie comes out 
           of his apartment. Rural Dr. Hancock (the wood chopper) is 
           waiting for him. The doctor smiles a sheepish smile.

           11. BMW DEALERSHIP. Jamie eyes the brand new SILVER X5. A 
           SALES WOMAN appears over his shoulder. 

                                 BMW SALES WOMAN
                        That one’s still available.

                                 JAMIE
                        Not any more.

           12. DR. ELMER’S RECEPTION. The Doc escorts Jamie from the 
           back, laughing. His waiting room is now full of Men.

                                 DR. ELMER
                        Gentlemen! This is our Viagra Rep!

           The Men applaud. Jamie Riedy beams. He’s made it. 

                                                                 OUT TO:
           INT. OLIVE GARDEN - DAY

           Bruce is stone-faced. Jamie sits, wary. Bruce tosses the 
           monthly Sales Report down in front of him.

           Then...he explodes with enthusiasm.

                                 BRUCE 
                        You’re the number five Viagra Rep! In the 
                        country! Ka-ching! Woo! Money Train!

           It’s better than Jamie had hoped. Bruce is so excited he 
           can’t speak in adult sentences.

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        And I told Phil, I said, I’ll get him to 
                        number one. And he said, casual, “Do that 
                        and I’ll give you Chicago.” Chicago! 

           Bruce holds up his hand for a high five. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Number one, Bruce? 

                                 BRUCE 
                        Hey. Hey. No stinkin’ thinkin’! You’ve got 
                        rapport my friend! Docs love you! 
                                 (lowers his voice)
                        Get them all to write it. Oncology. Derma. 
                        Gastro. Anybody with a scripts pad. 

           Bruce burns with missionary zeal.

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        You can do this, Jamie.
                                 (then)
                        You can do anything you want.

           INT. COUNTRY CLUB BAR - DAY

           Jamie nurses a beer and entertains a crowd of Doctors. 

                                 FRAT-ISH DOCTOR
                        Okay...Okay...How rigid?

           Jamie thumps his bottle with a finger. Ooohs. Laughs.

           He sees Shawna across the club, watching him entertain. 
           She shakes her head at him, playfully. He does a little 
           shuck and jive for her. She laughs. Their eyes hold. She 
           could well be the most alluring creature on the planet.
           Shawna pats the seat beside her.

           INT. JAMIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The phone RINGS. Jamie enters in SILK PAJAMAS, gargling 
           mouthwash. He checks the caller ID. Spits in the sink. 

           Answers the phone...

                                 JAMIE (ON THE PHONE)
                        I bought the silk ones...Oh. Sure...

           His eyes go to VIAGRA SAMPLE BOXES on his counter.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        ...Not a problem...I bet you will...Bye. 

           He hangs up, smiling. He takes two Viagra packets out of 
           their tiny boxes and puts them in his pocket.

           EXT. CONDO FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

           Party sounds. Jamie rings the doorbell. Shawna opens her 
           door with the mock surprise of all tipsy hostesses. 

                                 SHAWNA
                        Jamie! You came! Yea! 

           Her robe’s open to reveal pajamas somehow both corporate 
           and provocative. 

           INT. SHAWNA’S CONDO - NIGHT 

           A PAJAMA PARTY of heartland sales types. Buff bodies. Bad 
           hair. And beer. MUSIC blaring on a stereo is dated Top 40 
           pop [“Everybody (Backstreet’s Back)”]. 

           Jamie fields questions from a handful of inquisitors. 

                                 WOMAN ADULT-SIZED FOOTIES
                        Does Viagra work on women?

                                 JAMIE
                        Some. About twenty percent see increased 
                        lubrication and clitoral engorgement.

           Hoots. Snickers. Somebody yells, “Clitoral engorgement!”

           Shawna comes up, pulls Jamie off to a corner. She reaches 
           deep in his pajamas and fishes out the Viagra packet.
                                 SHAWNA
                        Okay. I’ll take one if you take one.

           Without waiting for an answer, she puts a blue tab on her 
           tongue and kisses him. She swallows her own with beer.

                                 JAMIE
                        You shouldn’t take that with alcohol.

           She giggles like he’s being droll. Grabs his hand.

                                 SHAWNA 
                        Come. Stay close to me.

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           Shawna and Jamie sip beers with a NICE PROFESSIONAL GUY.

                                 NICE PROFESSIONAL GUY
                        The company out there gave him stock 
                        options. He said they’re already worth 
                        two million. That’s Fuck-You Money.

                                 SHAWNA
                        Two million is not Fuck-You Money. Fuck-
                        You Money doesn’t start till like ten or 
                        fifteen. Two million. Please.

           Her beer is empty. She takes Jamie's. 

                                 SHAWNA (CONT’D)
                        Who isn’t worth two million these days?

           She does a cartoon smirk for Jamie. He nods awkwardly.

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           Shawna introduces Jamie to a busty ASIAN-AMERICAN WOMAN.

                                 SHAWNA (CONT’D)
                        This is my home girl, Khae. She’s Thai. 
                                 (grabs a fake boob)
                        And I’m Thai-Curious.

                                 KHAE & SHAWNA
                                 (in unison)
                        “You can’t rape the willing!”

           They drunk laugh. Loud. Jamie forces a chuckle. He’s not 
           having a great time. A Wasted Guy comes up.

                                 WASTED GUY
                        Jaaamieeee! I neeeeed Viaaaggggaaaa!
                                 SHAWNA 
                        God, Kyle! Give it a rest!

           Her fury is instantaneous and vehement. A strained beat. 
           Jamie realizes that Shawna’s a deeply unpleasant person, 
           and very mean drunk.

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           Jamie and Shawna hang at the bar. All across the room, 
           people in PJ’s stare at the Viagra Guy. 

           Shawna dances [Puff Daddy’s “Been Around the World”] with 
           more-or-less herself. He has to yell over the music...

                                 JAMIE
                        You don’t have to baby-sit me! If you 
                        need to talk to your friends!

                                 SHAWNA
                        These aren’t my friends! 

           She dances on. He considers her. Of course, Shawna has NO 
           friends. She’s a nightmare. Jamie's had enough of her and 
           the pajama party. He checks his watch. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Listen, I should really--

           She senses what’s coming and stops dancing.

                                 SHAWNA
                        What?! 

           Stares. A bass beat.

           The MUSIC STOPS COLD. Khae holds up a weathered GAME BOX. 

                                 KHAE
                        Okay, everybody! Time for Twister!

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           Irritated, Jamie is on all fours with contorted humans in 
           strange positions above him. A PETITE WOMAN squirms under 
           him, they’re very close, both a bit embarrassed.

           Suddenly, a look of HORROR comes over Jamie's face. He’s 
           getting an erection. Closer. He tries to wish it away. He 
           is actually starting to sweat a little when...

                                 THE PETITE WOMAN 
                        What...Oh, my God! What’s wrong with you!
           EXT. CONDO FRONT PORCH - DAY 

           The door opens.

           Jamie comes out, embarrassed. Shawna’s angry. Cold.

                                 JAMIE
                        Thanks.

           She does her tight, dismissive smile, and shuts the door. 

           INT. JAMIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           A closed shower curtain.

                                 JAMIE (O.S.)
                                 (freezing)
                        Shit. Shit. Shit.

           The water stops. The curtain flies open. Jamie’s just had 
           a very cold shower. Shivering, he towels himself dry. 

           But, inevitably, as he looks down,...

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                                 (puzzled)
                        Shit.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jamie reads the fine print on the Viagra Package Insert.

                                 JAMIE
                                 (worried)
                        Shit.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Dark. Jamie's awake in bed. A pup tent in the sheets.

                                 JAMIE
                                 (irritated)
                        Shit.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jamie quickly goes through his small collection of video 
           boxes: “Goodfellas”, “Wall Street”, “Rudy”. He takes a 
           second to consider “The English Patient” but tosses it.

           He’s holding the Vaseline jar. 

           He stands and goes to the TV cabinet, opens it to reveal 
           the infamous VIDEO CAMERA, the one he used with Maggie.

           He hooks the camera up to his TV. He goes and sits on the 
           couch. Presses PLAY on the camera’s tiny remote.

           ON THE TV: A few seconds of black, then Maggie comes into 
           view, naked under a sheet, facing the camera.

                                 JAMIE (O.S.)
                        Say something. This is your idea.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hello. My name’s Maggie Murtock. And I’m 
                        about to have reprobate sex with, what’s 
                        your name? Oh, right. Jamie. Reidy. And 
                        we’re taping it. So...so, if I don’t dump 
                        him, he can always remember how totally 
                        hot I am. Was. Kids, if you’re watching 
                        this, stop right now and put it back in 
                        Mommy’s hiding place! Or you’ll be sorry!

                                 JAMIE (O.S)
                        That’s for sure.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah, just that. So, we can remember. So, 
                        I’ll have this. Me. Today. 

           She can’t go further.

           Jamie watches himself enter the frame. He watches himself 
           lie beside Maggie. Kiss her. Touch her. 

           Suddenly, the screen goes BLACK. Jamie lowers the remote. 

                                 JAMIE
                                 (self-hating)
                        Shit.

           He sits a moment. And -- maybe for the first time in his 
           life -- Jamie Reidy’s forgotten about his penis.
           INT. MAGGIE’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Empty. Dark. Maggie’s phone rings. And rings.

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           A rainy day. The phone rings. 

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           A sunny day. The phone rings.

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           Dawn. Maggie crosses in jogging clothes. She’s in good 
           shape, break-up shape. 

           She ignores the ringing phone. 

           EXT. MEGA-CHURCH - NIGHT 

           Jamie leans against his new BMW, watching the last of the 
           Retirees leave the buses for their cars. He straightens.

           A figure approaches. Sandy. 

                                 SANDY
                        She’s not working this weekend.

           Skeptical, Jamie looks past him. Is he lying? Sandy won’t 
           budge. Jamie gives him a hard look. Leaves.

           EXT. KICKBALL FIELD ADJACENT TO MEMORIAL HOSPITAL  - DAY 

           A Woman in a Wet T-Shirt slides in water...to first base.

                                 FIRST BASE UMPIRE (O.S.)
                        Safe!

           The annual SQUIBB GIRLS VS. MEMORIAL DOCS KICKBALL GAME. 
           All the bases are slip-and-slides. Umpires at each base 
           hose down the long yellow strips of plastic. 

           Everyone’s soaking. The maroon rubber ball, so evocative 
           of childhood, slaps wet skin. It’s hard to imagine a more 
           offensive event. Naturally, the stands are packed. 

           We find Trey watching, way down the right field baseline. 
           A figure comes up beside him. Jamie. Their distance from 
           the action suggests the meeting was pre-arranged.
                                 TREY
                        I‘m sure some of the drugs we all sell do 
                        actually save lives. Problem is...who the 
                        hell would you ask? 

           They watch the spectacle, then get down to business.

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        What can I do for you, Pfizer?

                                 JAMIE
                        Maggie won’t talk to me.

                                 TREY
                        Yeah. I heard.

                                 JAMIE 
                        Help me. Get her to call me. Please. 

           This is hard for Jamie, and Trey knows it.

                                 TREY
                        You have a penis, Pfizer. Penises always 
                        want what they can’t have. 
                                 (simply)
                        Let’s not make a telenovela out of it. 

           A tense beat.

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        Go. Live your corporate life. Maggie’s a 
                        whole other career you don’t want. 

                                 JAMIE
                        You’re a coward, Trey. You want everybody 
                        else to be a coward, too. 
                                 (then)
                        You don’t know what I want.

                                 TREY
                        Do you? Really?

           The question’s a good one -- and it hits its mark. 

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        She’s moving. Back to Lansing. At the end 
                        of the Summer. She wants to live with her 
                        Mother, pay off her cards. Let her go.
                                 (direct)
                        If not, I’ll do whatever it takes to keep 
                        you away from her. 

           He looks back toward the game.
                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        She deserves better than a drug rep.

           Trey leaves Jamie at the fence, leaves him with a field 
           full of doctors chasing a woman with a rubber ball. 

           INT. UNITED CENTER - CHICAGO - DAY 

           A big erect penis on the JUMBOTRON. A medical drawing. On 
           the Bulls floor, far below, a Paid Speaker does a Viagra 
           presentation for Doctors, happily standing on the court. 

           Jamie’s in the back, gossiping with a few DERMATOLOGISTS.

                                 DERMATOLOGIST
                        The CEO’s 73. Last year, he celebrated 
                        his golden wedding anniversary, started 
                        preparing for retirement, sat around all 
                        day reading yacht brochures. Then...he 
                        starts on Viagra. Today, he’s divorced, 
                        married to the Corporate Giving Director 
                        and suing his kids for share control!  

           Then, to Jamie, blissfully free of any moral qualms,...

                                 DERMATOLOGIST (CONT’D)
                        Your drug’s terrific!

           Jamie nods politely, really uncomfortable.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Through a microwave window: a PFIZER MUG rotates on the 
           dolly...Pfizer...Pfizer...Pfizer....

           INT. JAMIE'S KITCHEN - DAY 

           Saturday. We can hear the TV in the Living Room [Clinton 
           admits an “inappropriate relationship” with Lewinsky].

           Jamie holds a tea bag and microwaves water. Looks around. 
           He’s surrounded by Pfizer give-aways. Wall clock. Plates. 
           Magnets. Note pads. Pens. Pencils. Coasters.

           This is his pathetic life. He’s living for Pfizer. 

           When the microwave beeps, he’s lost in unhappy thoughts. 
           He looks down at the tea bag. Drops it. Gets a beer. 
           EXT. JAMIE’S BALCONY - DAY 

           Windy. A row of five empty beer bottles rattles.

           Wrapped in a blanket on a patio chair, Jamie sips another 
           beer and holds a flapping STRIP OF PAPER -- we see faded 
           words: “...Life Goal...Canadian dollars...1984....”

           CLOSE on the old strip of paper. Shuttering angrily. 

           Jamie releases it. The wind takes it. Jamie watches his 
           old identity blow away, watches the strip rise off until 
           he loses it against the landscape suburban Michiana.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN PARKING LOT - DAY 

           Hot. Muggy.

           Jamie pulls a big box of lunches out of the Lumina. He 
           sets them on the hood a minute, so he can scratch some 
           caked food off his sleeve. 

           Something catches his eye. He turns to see a... 

           A MASSIVE APPLE COMPUTERS AD. It covers the side of a 
           building. It’s a b/w picture of Jim Henson and Kermit, 
           with the famous slogan: “Think Different.”

           Jamie smirks cynically and picks up the lunches. STOPS. 
           He puts the food down again. Walks closer to the ad. 

           A tiny figure below a giant bearded man and frog puppet. 

           CLOSE on Jamie. His mind is spinning. Plotting. He bites 
           his bottom lip in a way we haven’t seen in awhile.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           We see COLLEGE CHEERLEADERS through BINOCULARS.

                                 BRUCE (O.S.)
                        The redhead has very authentic pep.

           EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM STANDS - WEST LAFAYETTE - DAY 

           Bruce lowers binoculars. He and his ASSISTANT DM (39) -- 
           his female dopplegänger -- scout Purdue Cheerleaders.

                                 BRUCE 
                        See if she’s talked to a headhunter yet.
                                 ASSISTANT DM
                        Who’s that?

           A young man in a suit runs up the steps toward them. 

                                 BRUCE 
                        Jamie Reidy. Urology Rep in South Bend.
                                 (standing)
                        Reidy?! What the....Did somebody die?!

                                 JAMIE
                        Oh...No! 

                                 BRUCE
                        You scared us! What are you doing here?!

           Jamie stops down the steps. He holds up a finger as he 
           catches his breath.

           Then...

                                 JAMIE
                        I don’t want Chicago!

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY 

           Jamie sits on the bench. Bruce paces on the field.

                                 BRUCE
                        You wanna move to East Lansing, Michigan?

                                 JAMIE
                        No. Just regular Lansing.

                                 BRUCE
                        Lansing? Why?

           Jamie decides to be honest.

                                 JAMIE 
                        I met somebody.

           Bruce explodes.

                                 BRUCE 
                        You met somebody?! You met somebody?! I 
                        don’t wanna know your personal life! We 
                        had a deal! Chicago. Remember. I hired you 
                        to get me Chicago! So, get me Chicago! 
                                 (clear and cold)
                        You make number one on Viagra, then I’ll 
                        transfer you whereever the fuck you want.
           He marches off. Jamie stays seated, sincerely stunned. 

           EXT. VA HOSPITAL - DAY 

           The Abbott Labs Rep stands in pouring rain. 

           He watches an exposed Jamie carry a stack of SMOOTHIES up 
           the other sidewalk, quick, determined.

           INT. SAMPLE ROOM IN VA HOSPITAL - DAY 

           Jamie passes. Stops cold. 

           CLOSE on Jamie’s stunned face. REVERSE on a full shelf of 
           Viagra samples; they’ve barely been touched. 

           INT. ER EXAM ROOM IN VA HOSPITAL - DAY

           Jamie finds Dr. Clodfelter sniff testing a thermometer.

                                 JAMIE 
                        You guys aren’t giving out the Viagra?

                                 DR. CLODFELTER
                        Oh, hey. Yeah, well, it’s a new drug. We 
                        all need to see more side-effects data. 
                        Did you see that scary priapism study?

                                 JAMIE 
                        What study? Where did you see it?

           Dr. Clodfelter grows nervous. A beat. He simply leaves.

           INT. DR. ELMER’S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY

           Dr. Elmer, the Urologist, pulls Jamie in to complain.

                                 DR. UROLOGY
                        Why do you make the damn Viagra diamond- 
                        shaped? My patients are having a heck of 
                        time splitting their tabs.

           Jamie's not sure he’s serious.

                                 JAMIE
                        That’s why it’s diamond shaped. That way 
                        patients don’t order the higher dose and 
                        make two pills out of one.
                                 DR. ELMER
                        I was told you wanted them to split it. 
                                 (exasperated)
                        To reduce the over-heated demand?

                                 JAMIE
                        Who told you that?

           The doctor realizes he’s been duped.

           Then,...

                                 DR. ELMER
                        Why would Mr. Hillman care about Viagra?

           INT. BRUCE’S GARAGE - DUSK

           Saturday. Bruce packs away old Barbie stuff. A lot of it. 
           Loud rap plays from a boom box on the dryer. He raps out 
           a verse, does the gestures, Barbie’s hair flying.

           He FREEZES. Jamie's standing his open garage doorway.

                                 JAMIE
                        Did you tell Hillman I wanted Lansing?

           Bruce hesitates. 

                                 BRUCE 
                        I’ve been interviewing. 

           Jamie leaves. 

           Bruce calls after him...

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        The best way to poach a competing rep is 
                        with a blockbuster drug!

           EXT. RED LOBSTER - NIGHT

           Trey waves good-night to a couple of Doctors and walks to 
           his car, starts the vehicle, backs up, brakes.

           He gets out of the car to find he has a FLAT TIRE.

           Trey suspiciously scans the parking lot.
           INT. PIZZA HUT - NIGHT

           Doctors cluster for free family pizzas. Jamie watches Dr. 
           Knight make fake conversation with a small group.

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        I always say if they split their Viagra, 
                        it’s film coating is compromised. So the 
                        absorption rate is gonna be compromised.

           Other Doctors concur, anxious to seem in the know. Across 
           the room, Jamie gives Dr. Knight a covert thumbs up. 

           Jamie's handed a couple of pies.

                                 JAMIE
                        Okay...Dr. Morris? Pepperoni mushroom.

           A LANKY DOCTOR steps forward for the pizzas.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Compliments of Pfizer Pharmaceuticals.

           The LIGHTS GO OUT. Near Black.

                                 MANAGER’S VOICE
                        It’s okay! Nobody move! 

           Murmurs. Occasional car lights strobe the restaurant.

                                 SOMEBODY’S VOICE
                        Must be a black out.

                                 DR. KNIGHT’S VOICE
                        Lights are on across the street.

           Indeed, the businesses across street are brightly lit. In 
           passing headlights, we see Jamie's eyes narrow. 

                                 SOMEBODY’S VOICE
                        Well, that’s weird.

           EXT. ABANDONED AVENUE - NIGHT

           Green light. Jamie idles in his Lumina, not moving. It’s 
           the middle of the night. He wears a cap and sunglasses.
           When the light turns red, he drives carefully across the 
           Avenue. As he does so, a remote TRAFFIC CAMERA flashes -- 
           the car’s photo is taken for a moving violation.

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           Jamie again waits for a green light. It turns red, and he 
           crosses the Avenue. Again, he is caught by a photo FLASH.

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           FLASH. Jamie carefully runs another red light.

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           FLASH. And another.

                                                               JUMP CUT:

           Again. FLASH.

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT

           CLOSE on a minivan’s bumper sticker: “Big Pharma Sucks”. 

           We move over to find Jamie screwing license plates back 
           onto Trey’s identical Lumina. 

           EXT. OVERFLOW PARKING LOT AT MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY

           A shimmering, empty expanse of asphalt. 

           Jamie drags his bag to the car, scared. He parked way out 
           here to feel safe, but now just feels exposed. 

           A subtle, sudden whizz and a GOLF BALL slams the pavement 
           a few yards from him, bouncing high and away.

           Jamie spins. Freezes. Listens. Surely, this was a freak 
           accident. Sun glare off the hospital’s facade blinds him 
           to its many roofs. The ball pings on peacefully. 

           As he remembers to breathe, he hears a second whizz and 
           GRUNTS as the second golf ball lands TERRIFYINGLY CLOSE.

           Jamie drops his detail bag and runs. 

           He’s almost to the Lumina when the third golf ball lands 
           ahead, hits a pebble, jags across his path.
           I/E JAMIE'S LUMINA - DAY 

           Jamie fumbles with his keys as the fourth golf ball 
           bounces ten feet from the hood and sails safely over. He 
           can see the fifth fall...and land off to his left.

           He guns the engine, then he remembers the roller bag. 

           He zigzags through the empty lot to recover it; he pulls 
           up too close and runs over the handle. He opens his door, 
           grabs the bag, fights to get its bulk into the car. 

           A ball hits the back of the Lumina with a loud THUMP. 

                                 JAMIE 
                        Fuck!

           As Jamie races for the lot’s far exit, a final golf ball 
           bounces beside him like a music dot looking to play.

           EXT. PARKING LOT TO DR. KNIGHT’S BUILDING - DAY 

           The Lumina’s trunk pops wearily open.

           Jamie looks terrible. His usually neat trunk is in chaos. 
           His bag is beat to hell; he opens it and dumps give-aways 
           to force a box of Viagra inside (payment for Dr. Knight).

           Closing his trunk, Jamie sees Trey across the lot, headed 
           the same place. Eyes lock. Then distance to the door is 
           quickly calculated. Both start walking, calm, nonchalant. 

           They pick up speed. Faster.

           Power walks. Faster. Bags bounce wildly. Faster. 

           Two handsome men in suits start SPRINTING.

           EXT. DR. KNIGHT’S WAITING ROOM - DAY 

           Packed. Moms chat. Sick Kids play with toys on the floor. 
           A couple of nervous men have come in for Viagra.

           The door flies open. Trey and (then) Jamie enter, winded 
           from the run, trying to cover. Everyone’s a bit startled. 
           The air is suddenly flush with testosterone.

           A Small Boy looks up at them with x-ray specs.
           They smile salesmen smiles. Trey leads Jamie to the front 
           desk, where Janice hovers over the RECEPTIONIST.

                                 TREY
                        Ladies.

                                 JAMIE
                        Ladies.

                                 TREY 
                        We’re double teaming you today.

           Trey makes Jamie wait as he signs in, slowly. 

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Janice? Quick question. I can let 
                        Jamie here use my kids’ Lindane shampoo, 
                        right? That should work for him?

           She immediately reacts.

                                 JANICE
                                 (to Jamie)
                        You can’t bring head lice in here!

           Mothers instinctively reach for children. 

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        Out. Out! Seriously! Stand outside. I’ll 
                        come get the samples. Go!

           Jamie stares blankly at Trey.

                                 TREY
                        I’ll tell the doc you’ll see him Monday.

           Trey turns back to the desk.

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s hope it’s for his head.

           Jamie punches Trey in the back of his skull. The blow is 
           violent enough to throw him off balance, he crashes into 
           a planter on his way down. Children scream.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Oh my God! 

           Jamie tries to assume a fighting crouch but his hand is 
           in too much pain. Trey gets up and comes after him. 
           They tumble to the floor, a blur of awkward blows, their 
           suits restricting them. Over-large plastic toys fly at 
           terrified children. Mothers scream. Shield their young.

                                 JANICE
                        Rep Fight! We gotta a Rep Fight! 

           Trey gets Jamie beneath him, rabbit punches his stomach. 
           Jamie's trying to punch above, blindly. It’s a strange 
           sight. The Prozac and Zoloft detail men squirming and 
           punching and kicking among panicked sick kids. Janice and 
           Dr. Knight and a Big Father run out to separate them.

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        Stop this! Stop it! Now! Hillman! Stop!

           The Big Father gets Trey in a police hold. Dr. Knight 
           head locks Jamie. Janice bear hugs a flailing arm.

                                 JANICE 
                        Careful! He’s got head lice! 

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        Well, what do you want me to do?! 

           They get them separated. Only a few rhetorical kicks.

                                 DR. KNIGHT (CONT’D)
                        We cool?! Reidy?! We cool?! 

           Trey nods. Jamie nods. The Father lets Trey go. Jamie's 
           also freed. Everyone stands.

           Skittish seconds. We don’t know if the truce will hold. 

           Trey -- sick of the fight, sick of his life -- grabs his 
           bag and leaves.

           EXT. DR. KNIGHT’S BUILDING - DUSK

           Jamie sits on the curb, suit torn, face scratched, a few 
           major bruises but nothing he’ll brag about. 

           A rumpled and stressed Dr. Knight stands over him.

                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        What the hell were you thinking?! This is 
                        a doctor’s office! People come through 
                        the door looking to litigate! Good God, 
                        Reidy! My portfolio is 40% Pfizer! Four. 
                        Zero. What the hell?! What the hell?
           A jittery beat. 

           Finally,...

                                 DR. KNIGHT (CONT’D)
                        Tell you one thing, I’m gonna diversify.

           INT. JAMIE’S FOYER - NIGHT

           Dark. Late. Someone’s POUNDING on the front door.

           Jamie enters in his underwear, wielding a tennis racket. 
           He checks the peep hole, can’t believe it. 

           He cracks the door open. Josh pushes through, unhappy.

                                 JAMIE
                        No, I wasn’t asleep.

           INT. JAMIE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Josh has his face angled to a light as Jamie enters. 

                                 JAMIE 
                        What?

                                 JOSH 
                        Look! I took your fucking drug.

           Josh’s neck and face are bright red.

                                 JAMIE 
                        Flushing. It’s a common side effect. 
                        Temporary. Not a big deal.

                                 JOSH
                        It will be if Farrah sees it!

                                 JAMIE 
                        Then...why are you on Viagra?

           Josh hesitates. Jamie moans.

                                 JOSH
                        It’s not what you think. Fine. There’s 
                        this web site: Bad Cheerleader.

                                 JAMIE
                        You’re such an asshole.
                                 JOSH
                        What?

                                 JAMIE
                        I get up early! And you’re married!

                                 JOSH
                        So?!

                                 JAMIE
                        Look at your face!

           A beat. 

                                 JOSH
                        What happened to yours?

           Jamie throws his hands up. “Don’t ask!”

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        Dad wants you to send more samples. 

                                 JAMIE 
                        I just sent him a whole package. What, 
                        he’s fucking around, too?

           Josh slaps Jamie's head. Jamie slaps him back. A brief 
           shoving match ensues. Brotherly. Rhetorical.

           Josh goes into the Kitchen. Jamie sits on the sofa.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Great. Now, I’m stuck with a visual of 
                        Dad whacking off at his computer.
                                 (then)
                        Samples are supposed to be a sales tool!

           Josh re-enters sipping a beer.

                                 JOSH 
                        You’re acting like a suit.

                                 JAMIE
                        I am a suit! 

           Josh considers his Brother’s dejected form. 

                                 JOSH
                        Dad promised the guys in his department 
                        you’d get them all samples. 

                                 JAMIE 
                        Why?
                                 JOSH
                        To show off. To show his son’s a big deal. 
                                 (then)
                        He’s proud of you. Quitter. 

           Josh raises his beer to Jamie and heads for the door. It 
           opens and closes. Jamie remains seated. Unmoved.

           Then,...

                                 JAMIE
                        I’m not a quitter.

           INT. AISLE IN WALMART - NIGHT

           Jamie has a new haircut. A new suit. But he’s miserable. 
           He indifferently tosses groceries into a cart.

           Suddenly, he hears a weird, guttural LAUGH.

           INT. ADJACENT AISLE IN WALMART - NIGHT

           Maggie and Sandy hang around in the Magazine Area. She’s 
           leafing through an Elle Magazine.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Models always look like angry deer.

           Sandy taps her shoulder. Points down the aisle to where 
           Jamie stands. He offers a weak wave.

           Jamie watches Sandy and Maggie exchange inaudible words. 
           She seems to want to leave. Finally, Sandy gestures to 
           Jamie, some insider rap gesture, and goes the other way. 

           Maggie makes Jamie come to her, both extremely nervous.

                                 JAMIE 
                        Hi.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hi.

           A long, sad pause.

                       JAMIE (CONT’D)
                                                        MAGGIE
           So you’re moving?
                                             I’m seeing someone.

           She picks at the corner of rack label. He knows she’s 
           probably lying. And she knows he knows.
                                 JAMIE 
                        I tried to call you. 

           She shrugs.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        I fucked up. I got scared. It is a lot. I 
                        was honest. You wanted that. I’m sorry if 
                        I hurt you. No, Maggie...I’m just sorry.
                                 (then)
                        I’m a good guy. Almost. Basically.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Good guys don’t wanna hurt you in big 
                        ways so they torture in small ones. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Wow. Alright. Okay. 
                                 (then)
                        Do you have to do the glass-half-empty 
                        thing right now? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yes.

           She’s almost angry. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t trust you. I don’t trust I’m not 
                        just some goal for you. I don’t trust 
                        your ambition. I don’t trust your music. 
                        I don’t trust how you floss three times a 
                        day. I don’t trust how you remind me of 
                        this kid back home whose Mom sent him to 
                        social skills summer camp. I don’t trust 
                        that haircut! I don’t trust that suit!
                                 (a beat)
                        I don’t trust you’d stay with me. 
                                 (a beat)
                        In fact, I know you wouldn’t.

                                 JAMIE
                        How can you know--

                                 MAGGIE
                        I wouldn’t. I know you wouldn’t, because 
                        I wouldn’t. I wouldn’t.
                                 (then)
                        Not once you understand what it means.

           A Shopper passes. 

           They wait for her to move away.
                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Trey said you wanted to transfer. Don’t.

           She holds his eyes to show she’s absolutely serious. And 
           he can nothing but nod, sad, reluctant. 

           We hear HONKING TRAFFIC.

                                                                FADE TO:

           INT. CHAOTIC AVENUE - DAY 

           Traffic jam. Cars on the FOUR-LANE AVENUE creep forward a 
           few feet at a time. Back in the pack, a white Lumina.

           INT. LUMINA - DAY 

           Jamie in traffic. His misery has hardened into boredom. 

           Up ahead, Jamie sees a RED LUMINA in the opposing lanes, 
           stopped, trying cross traffic in front of him.

           Bruce is being driven by a young guy with a crew cut. An 
           ex-Marine. The new ZOLOFT REP, Jamie's replacement. Bruce 
           seems to be arguing for him force his way across.

           Jamie snickers to himself -- this was him 18 months ago.

           As he gets closer, Bruce spots him. Waves. The Zoloft Rep 
           waves, too, gestures that they want to cross.

           CLOSE on Jamie. This would be a very satisfying time NOT 
           to be a team player. He simply stares at them. 

           Jamie creeps forward. Bruce joins in the signaling. Jamie 
           keeps on staring without expression. 

           Bruce smells defiance. Yells. Gestures angrily. 

           Jamie just creeps slowly forward until...he’s parallel to 
           them. Jamie STOPS. Gestures grandly for the red Lumina to 
           cross. They do. Gunning it. Screeching. 

           Bruce eyes Jamie angrily as they pass, his face close in 
           passenger side window. 

                                 JAMIE
                        You’re wel--

           SMASH!
           A MASSIVE SUV slams the Red Lumina. No one saw it coming 
           up the far lane, hurrying to close the gap. It slams the 
           much smaller vehicle at Bruce’s door, pushing the Lumina 
           a good fifteen feet, crumbling the side like paper.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Shit!

           EXT. CHAOTIC AVENUE - DAY 

           The T-boned Red Lumina smokes and hisses. Jamie runs from 
           his car toward it. Bruce’s window is shattered. The SUV’s 
           alarm is going off. Waaa-Waaa. Ook-Ook. Eeenoooo.

                                 JAMIE
                        Bruce! 

           Jamie tries to climb past the trunk but the car’s right 
           door is blocked. All he sees is a bloody head inside.

           The Zoloft Rep staggers out cradling a wrist. Jamie dives 
           in the car from that side. The whole side of Bruce’s head 
           and face is cut from the window. He holds a slippery cell 
           phone, weak, dazed, barely conscious. He can’t dial. 

           Jamie grabs the phone. And calls for help 

           INT. CURTAINED CUBICLE - DAY 

           Bruce lies in the bed, conscious but subdued by shock and 
           pain. His head is wrapped in a fresh bandage. His face is 
           cleaned but full of cuts from shards of glass. 

           Jamie worries at his bedside, feeling horribly guilty. 

                                 BRUCE
                        ...I’m gonna...throw up....

           Blood trickles gently out of Bruce’s ear. Panicked, Jamie 
           yanks up a sheet corner to blot it away. 

                                 JAMIE 
                        Bruce, I’ll be right back. Okay? 

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM OF MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY 

           The STATION NURSE is at her computer, transposing medical 
           records from a doctor’s bad handwriting. Jamie approaches 
           with poorly disguised fear.
                                 JAMIE 
                        He’s bleeding a little from his ear.

                                 NURSE
                        Ummm. I’ll mention it to the doctor.

           She’s painfully polite, but keeps working. Jamie looks 
           around. No doctor. The ER is unnaturally quiet.

                                 JAMIE
                        It could mean a skull fracture.

           She nods, oh-so-empathetic. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, where the hell is he?

                                 NURSE
                        I’m sure he’ll be right back.

           Frustrated, Jamie hurries down the ER to find the doctor 
           himself. He peeks into cubicle curtains. A Cardio. A Leg 
           Cast. The Zoloft Rep, left wrist bandaged and elevated.

                                 NEW ZOLOFT REP
                        Jamie! How’s Bruce?!

           Jamie keeps moving.

           INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY 

           Jamie hurries from the ER. There’s only a Man Reading a 
           book, facing away. A giggle. Around the corner.

           By the vending machines, a male ER DOCTOR flirts with a 
           female DRUG REP. Jamie forces himself to wait just out of 
           ear shot. Giggles. This could so easily be him.

           When he can’t stand it any longer, he steps closer.

                                 JAMIE
                        Excuse me? Doctor?

           The Doctor holds up his palm. The Rep turns professional.

                                 DRUG REP
                        Okay. I won’t keep you. But I did want to 
                        offer you a 27% reduction in patients 
                        with GI issues related to antibiotic use.

                                 JAMIE 
                        I’m sorry, Doctor, but the--
                                 ER DOCTOR
                        Hold on, Buddy. 

           The Doctor nods for her to continue.

                                 DRUG REP
                        That means, next time I buy you dinner, a 
                        third less chance we’ll be interrupt--

                                 JAMIE
                        It’s your patient...

                                 ER DOCTOR
                        I’m having a conversation here!

                                 JAMIE 
                        No, you’re doing business!

           Jamie's said this VERY LOUDLY. Shocked quiet. The Reading 
           Man cocks his head, listening. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Look. I get it. Twelve years of school. 
                        Three-hundred thousand in debt. An HMO 
                        that treats you like a part-timer at Old 
                        Navy. Not to mention insurance companies 
                        with huge departments dedicated to not 
                        paying you. Big law firms betting you’ll 
                        make that one mistake...You’re angry, and 
                        if you’re not you should be. You’re ready 
                        for somebody to finally kiss your ass. 

                                 DRUG REP
                        Hey! I’m only doing my job!

                                 JAMIE
                        I know your job! I do your job! Twenty-
                        something. A B-minus student. This drug 
                        rep thing is a good gig. But just cause 
                        the company you work for is famous and 
                        rich and everybody is soooo fucking nice 
                        that doesn’t make them moral or wise. So 
                        stop! Let him do his job! It’s important! 
                                 (then)
                        And before us it used to be pretty noble. 

           Jamie’s breathing heavily. Exhilarated. Released. The 
           Drug Rep is near tears.

                                 DRUG REP 
                        I’m a good person.
                                 JAMIE 
                        Nobody said you’re a bad person. 
                                 (then)
                        Just...retail.

           Jamie emanates pure power. Confidence. Surety. He’s dirty 
           and bloody and doesn’t give a shit.

                                 DRUG REP
                        Freak.

           She walks to the exterior doors. Proud. The wheels of her 
           detail bag making an ignoble squeak.

           The Doctor now just wants to be rid of him.

                                 ER DOCTOR
                        What the hell do you want? 

                                 JAMIE 
                        The car wreck. He’s my boss. There’s blood 
                        coming out of his ear. 

           The Doctor watches Jamie a beat, haunted by professional 
           duty. He nods remotely and goes into the ER. 

           Alone, deflating, Jamie blows air through pursed lips.

           Sensing someone, he sees the Reading Man has turned to 
           watch him. It’s Trey Hillman. He’s been there the whole 
           time, waiting for the other Rep to finish. 

                                 TREY
                        Nice speech, Pfizer. 

           Suddenly, a Middle-Aged Woman in and Two Small Girls rush 
           past. Bruce’s family. They hurry into the ER in tears.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Jamie sits, wary, exhausted. Trey brings him a coffee. 
           Sugar. Cream. Sits quietly across the table. 

           As Jamie finishes stirring...

                                 JAMIE 
                        What did you do to my predecessor?

                                 TREY
                        Urinated in his coffee.

           Jamie was just about to sip. Does so anyway. 
                                 JAMIE
                        He saw you do it?

                                 TREY
                        Everybody else in the restaurant did.

           Trey breaks into a slow smile. He’s putting Jamie on. 

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        I can’t even remember. Probably yelled. 

           A long beat.

                                 JAMIE 
                                 (softly)
                        I’m going to quit.

           Jamie Reidy has exhausted his ambition. Trey considers 
           his dejected competitor. Makes a decision.

                                 TREY
                        It’s not what you do, it’s why you do it.
                                 (casual)
                        You can’t quit. Maggie needs your health 
                        care. You could transfer to Neuroscience. 
                        Work with doctors who can help her. 
                                 (then)
                        You might find some patients in Lansing 
                        who are actually sick. 

           It takes a moment for Trey’s comments to register. 

                                 JAMIE
                        What, you want to help me now?

                                 TREY
                        Nope. I want to help her. 

           Looks. Trey breeches some internal beachhead. He pushes 
           his coffee away. Leans closer.

                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        We had sex precisely once. Whatever Maggie 
                        feels for me isn’t complicated. I see her 
                        the way she sees herself. I see a sick 
                        girl. I couldn’t get past the Parkinson’s. 
                        You were right. I’d read the literature. 
                        I’d pitch movement disorder clinics. Bug 
                        Neurologists to track drug trials. I’d do 
                        anything to manage her condition. Anything 
                        to make it okay...okay to love her. 

           His face tells Jamie that it was never okay.
                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        I knew you’d run. I didn’t think you’d 
                        run back. I didn’t think you’d fight.
                                 (a small test)
                        Do you even see a sick girl? 

                                 JAMIE
                        Sometimes. I also see a girl full of 
                        life. I see a funny girl. I see a weird 
                        girl. A smart girl. A dumb girl. Brave. 
                        Weak. Strong. Scared. But...yeah, I see a 
                        sick girl sometimes. 

           The simple honesty of this is bittersweet for Trey. 

                                 TREY 
                        Well, Pfizer, that’s a big fucking thing. 
                                 (intense)
                        To see a woman whole.

           They sit a moment. Both understanding the truth of this 
           and how it will change their lives in different ways.

           We stay with them. Lost in thought. 

           They sip at their coffee and say nothing more.

           The ER Doctor enters... 

                                 ER DOCTOR 
                        Wasn’t a basilar fracture. He had some 
                        glass in his ear canal. I removed it. 

           He holds out his hands to Jamie. “You happy, Jerk?” 

                                 JAMIE 
                        Thank you.

           The ER Doctor shrugs. “Whatever.”

                                 ER DOCTOR
                        What are you doing here, Hillman?

                                 TREY
                        Me? I’m here to kiss your ass.

           The doctor moans and waves for Trey to come. Trey stands, 
           he considers Jamie, extends his hand.

           Since they never did so, they shake hands. 
                                 TREY (CONT’D)
                        You don’t need my help. My guess is 
                        you’re pretty good at what you do.

           Trey leaves Jamie. 

           Jamie sits with this after Trey’s gone. Sips his coffee. 
           The idea works at him. He bites his lip.

           EXT. MAGGIE’S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 

           Feet hit the pavement. Maggie jogs. 

           Out of nowhere, Jamie falls in behind her. He’s still in 
           his dress slacks, black shoes, dirty shirt. 

           She hears his footsteps, turns, shakes her head. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m not stopping!

           He stays about twenty paces back. 

           When it’s clear he’ll be there awhile...

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?!

                                 JAMIE
                        My job! 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Go home!

           Jamie keeps following. She tries to ignore him.

                                 JAMIE 
                        I’ll always be back here! Like those 
                        riders in “Butch Cassidy”! You run! You 
                        turn back! I’ll be here! You’ll be all, 
                        “Who is this guy?”  

           She’s not stopping.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Take as long as you need! Here! Lansing! 
                        I’ll be back here! I’m very ambitious!

           They run awhile without talking. He starts to fall back. 
                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, stop! You know I’m in lousy shape! 
                        C’mon! There’s blood on my shirt!

           Maggie stops. Jamie stops. 

           They catch their breath. She paces with her hands behind 
           her head. He rests his hands his knees. She comes closer, 
           peers to see the blood and make it isn’t his own.

           Finally, she walks off toward home.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        You need me, Maggie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        No, I don’t.

                                 JAMIE 
                        Yeah, you do.

           She comes back and looks him in the eye.

                                 MAGGIE 
                        No. I. Don’t.

           His eyes go to her shaking hand. She grabs it, as if to 
           stop the tremor by shame and anger.

                                 JAMIE 
                        Yeah. You do.

           There’s absolute conviction in his voice.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Stop it! Stop saying that! I don’t need 
                        you! I don’t need anybody!

                                 JAMIE
                        You need me.

                                 MAGGIE 
                        I don’t! I don’t.

           She’s suddenly trying not to cry.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck. Fuck! Fuck!
                                 (then)
                        ...fuck...

           And old hardness in her starts to melt.
                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t...I don’t deserve this... 

                                 JAMIE
                        Take a risk, Maggie. I will. 

           She lip trembles. She’s fighting it. 

                                 MAGGIE 
                        I had places to go.

                                 JAMIE
                        You’ll get there.
                                 (then)
                        I just may have to carry you.

           She winces, holding, holding. 

           When she can finally look at him,...

                                 MAGGIE
                        Why me?

                                 JAMIE 
                        Let’s say somewhere in an alternative 
                        universe there’s a couple just like us. 
                        But she’s healthy. And he’s successful. 
                        And their lives are about how much to 
                        spend on vacation or who’s in a bad mood 
                        or whether they should feel guilty cause 
                        they have a cleaning lady. I don’t want 
                        to be those people. I want us. You. This. 

           He means her tremor hand -- he takes it.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        This will take you places. It’ll take us 
                        places. C’mon, Maggie.
                                 (a half smile)
                        This is our shot at greatness.

           She nods as if this were nothing -- and then lets go. 

                                                          FADE TO BLACK:

                                 JAMIE V.O.
                        I won’t win a Nobel Prize. 

           INT. OB/GYN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Another new Zoloft Rep works the Tough Receptionist. And 
           Bruce is behind him in an arm sling, monitoring.

           INT. MEGA-CHURCH AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Sandy’s band rocks the Sunday service. He’s not a half- 
           bad front man. Church Members sway.

           INT. JOSH AND FARRAH’S BEDROOM - CHICAGO - DAY 

           The kids explode through the door. Farrah emerges from 
           linens, disheveled, surprised.

                                 JAMIE'S NEPHEW (O.S.)
                        Why is Daddy’s face all red?

                                 JAMIE V.O. 
                        I will never wear a Super-Bowl ring. 

           INT. OPULENT CONFERENCE ROOM - HOUSTON - DAY 

           Shawna sits at an oak table, all of Houston behind her.

                                 SHAWNA
                        Let me be honest, Gentlemen, you won’t 
                        meet a more ideal broker trainee? 

                                 JAMIE V.O.
                        I will not be CEO.

           Two Executives exchange a look. Above their heads we see 
           an infamous cube -- she’s interviewing at ENRON.

           INT. DR. KNIGHT’S EXAM ROOM - SOUTH BEND - DAY 

           A Young Mother rambles about antibiotics. Dr. Knight’s 
           not even looking her.

                                 JAMIE V.O. 
                        I will not be President. 
                                 DR. KNIGHT
                        Sure. Why not?

           INT. DANCE STUDIO - DAY

           moves with natural grace.

                                 JAMIE V.O.
                        What I’ll have in life is this...

           CLOSE on MAGGIE’S FACE. Happy. Her tremor hand comes into 
           frame as she wipes her forehead.

           EXT. MAGGIE’S TRIPLEX - DAY 

           Moving Day. Jamie loads boxes in a U-Haul truck. Maggie 
           has a new Moving Guy. He’s a very neat packer. 

                                 JAMIE V.O. 
                        A reason to get out of bed every morning. 

           She’s on the porch step, looking out at her street, ready 
           to say good-bye to it. Jamie stops to look at her.

                                 JAMIE V.O. (CONT’D)
                        It’s good work if you can get it.

           They don’t see, far down the block, a white Lumina slowly 
           turn the corner, hesitate a moment, then pull away.

           The screen goes WHITE. 

           Nothing but the people around us.

           White. We wait. And wait. Until we’re not sure if the we 
           should leave. And at some point the CREDITS start. 

           END.
