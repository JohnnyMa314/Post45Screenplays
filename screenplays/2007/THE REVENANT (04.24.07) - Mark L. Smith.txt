           FADE IN:

           EXT. UPPER MISSOURI RIVER/1820’S - EVENING

                            COTTONWOOD LEAF... brown and crisp... 
           ANGLE ON A SINGLE 
           clinging to its empty branch... the solitary sign of life on 
           an otherwise barren tree. 

           A gust of wind... the leaf breaks free... flutters down, 
           landing in the slow current of the Missouri.  The last leaf 
           of the fall, taking its final journey south.

           As it floats along the surface, rising and falling with the 
           current, all we can hear is the river’s gentle movement... 
           the trickle of water... the splash of timid rapids... until 
           DISTANT VOICES invade this world... soft at first, but 
           growing louder... LAUGHTER... SINGING.  

           And then our leaf CRASHES INTO A WOODEN BOARD... the BOW OF A 
           BOAT.  We hear the VOICES EVEN CLEARER... MEN’S VOICES, as we 
           rise up the bow... see it’s a FLATBOAT BEACHED ON A SANDBAR 
           at the center of the river.  

           Beyond the flatboat are the voices... TWENTY MEN of the Rocky 
           Mountain Fur Company, making camp along the shore... hauling 
           wood, building campfires, pitching squares of canvas for 
           makeshift rooftops.  And this camp is full of life because 
           these are some of the first men to ever see this untouched 
           wilderness... men with a whole new world just waiting for 
           them to claim their share.  

           EXT. CAMP - EVENING

           CAPTAIN ANDREW HENRY, (early 30’s), dressed in a buckskin 
           jacket with long fringe... thick belt pulled tightly around 
           his waist with two pistols and a knife hanging from it.  He 
           stands out among the others... like an imposter pretending to 
           be a member of some exclusive club.  He pulls off one of his 
           gloves... examines the BLOOD-FILLED BLISTERS lining his palm.  

           From across the camp, JOHN FITZGERALD, (40’s), solid and 
           thick... eyes of a thief, watches Henry.  He nudges MACE 
           BOONE, (40’s), made of leather and piss.

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Likely got a splinter.  Can’t 
                        figure what to do without Mama here 
                        to pull it out for him.    

           Boone chuckles... spits in Henry’s direction.  
                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                 BOONE
                        Need a doc, Captain?  

           Henry looks up... sees Fitzgerald and Boone grinning at him.  
           He slides his glove back on.

                                 HENRY
                        Gather more wood.  

           Fitzgerald waits for Henry to turn, then gives his back an 
           exaggerated salute.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                         (under his breath)
                        Shame my Pap was a broken down 
                        drunk.  Else he could’ve bought me 
                        a Captain’s job too.  

           Boone snickers.  Fitzgerald stomps his boot onto a branch, 
           easily snaps it into two easy-to-carry pieces.  

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        We got a plan for these fires, 
                        Captain, or are we roastin’ berries 
                        all the way up to Fort Union?  

                                 HENRY
                        Glass and the others will be back 
                        with some game, Fitzgerald.  Just 
                        make sure you have the fires ready.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        My supper’s in the hands of a 
                        hermit nigger, a kid and a dummy.  
                        Hell, my belly feels full already.  

           Fitzgerald’s boot CRACKS another branch... and when it does, 
           we hear the EXPLOSION OF A GUNSHOT.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. WILDERNESS - EVENING

           And a CLOUD OF SMOKE surrounding the LONG BARREL OF AN 
           ANSTADT RIFLE.  

                              40’s), African-American, one eye still 
           The smoke fades, and at the other end of the rifle we see the 
           face of HUGH GLASS, (
           closed, as the other calmly stares down that barrel.    

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Shit fire, you got him, Mr. Glass!    
                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)           Glass lowers the rifle, as JIM BRIDGER, (17), boyish face 
           that looks even younger, races past with PIG GILMORE, (30’s), 
           fat and filthy, shuffling right behind.  

                                 BRIDGER (CONT’D)
                        Got him square as a barn door.  

           Glass watches Bridger and Pig trot through the trees to a 
           fallen ELK.  Glass walks calmly after them, graceful in this 
           world... his rifle so comfortable in his hand it’s like he 
           was born with it there.  Pig crouches over the dead elk... 
           grins up at Glass. 

                                 PIG
                        Right where you said he’d be.  

                                 BRIDGER
                        But bigger than we figured.  Gonna 
                        be a load to haul back to camp.  

                                 PIG
                        Have to split it up I reckon.  

                                 GLASS
                        Yep.  Bridger’ll take the tail, and 
                        Pig you haul the rest.  

           And Fitzgerald was right about Pig being a little slow, 
           because he just nods... pulls out his knife to cut the tail 
           off for Bridger.  

           Bridger and Glass exchange a smile... until Glass notices 
           something... steps over the elk, his eyes locked on the 
           ground beside it.  He runs a finger over the dirt... touches 
           a broken twig.  

                                 BRIDGER 
                        Another one close by?  

           Glass doesn’t answer... studies the track... feels the nearby 
           brush... inhales the scent from his hand.  Bridger and Pig 
           watch him... exchange a confused glance.  And then in a flash 
           of movement, Glass is on his feet, racing away.     

                                 PIG
                        Hugh?  

           Glass just keeps running.  Pig and Bridger chase after him.  

                                                       CUT TO:

CAMP - EVENING

           The men building fires... laughing... enjoying themselves.  
           Boone on the outskirts, gathering branches.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           GLASS - TEARING THROUGH THE WOODS... 

           ...dodging trees... leaping over fallen logs... loading his 
           Anstadt as he runs.

           BRIDGER AND PIG - CHASING AFTER GLASS... 

           ...but not as gracefully.  Bridger trips... slams to the 
           ground... scrambles back to his feet to continue on.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           BOONE - CARRYING AN ARMLOAD OF WOOD INTO CAMP... 

           ...seeing other men playing cards.  He stops along the edge 
           of camp, drops the wood to the ground.  

                                 BOONE
                        No rule says I’m the only one 
                        that’s gotta gather this shit.  

           The other men don’t even notice.  Then an ARROW WHIZZES 
           THROUGH THE AIR from behind Boone... THWACK... it hits him in 
           the back of the neck... erupts out the front of his throat.  

           Boone stands frozen... confused... reaches up and grabs the 
           bloody arrow... finally drops to his knees.  And that’s when 
           a TRAPPER looks up... sees Boone on his knees, holding that 
           arrow, his mouth open like a dying fish. 

           AND BEYOND BOONE ARE THIRTY ARIKARA WARRIORS CHARGING THROUGH 
           THE TREES... FEATHERS RISING FROM THE MOHAWKS SPLITTING THEIR 
           SHAVED HEADS... FACES PAINTED FOR BATTLE.    

                                 TRAPPER
                        ‘REE!  

           WHOOSH... AN ARROW SAILS INTO THE TRAPPER’S CHEST, sending 
           him flying backward.   The camp explodes into chaos... men 
           YELLING... grabbing for weapons... stumbling over each other 
           as they duck behind trees.
                                                     (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)           HENRY - PULLING THE PISTOLS FROM HIS BELT... 

           ...taking nervous aim at the attacking figures.  

           The Arikara pour into camp, arrows flying... knives and 
           hatchets swinging.  And this is a massacre... the Arikara 
           wading through the trappers... stabbing... clubbing... 
           scalping. This once peaceful world is filled with a sickening 
           mix of war cries and screams of death.  

           Fitzgerald rises up from behind a log... aims his rifle... 
           BOOM... takes down one of the warriors.  He starts reloading 
           as ANOTHER WARRIOR charges him... draws back his knife.  
           Fitzgerald pours the powder, but knows he isn’t going to make 
           it in time... the warrior leaps toward him... 

           ...BOOM... it’s like the warrior hits an invisible wall... 
           flies back to the ground, very dead.  Fitzgerald spins... 
           sees Glass and his Anstadt right behind him.  

                                 GLASS
                        GET TO THE BOAT!  

           Fitzgerald takes off... flips his rifle around, swings it 
           like a club across a warrior’s head.

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                         (to Henry)
                        THE BOAT, CAPTAIN!  

           Henry shoves a TRAPPER toward the water.  An arrow drives 
           into the trapper’s leg... he goes down.  Henry lifts the man 
           to pull him into the river, but several more arrows bury in 
           the man’s back... he falls limp.  Henry SCREAMS OUT... FIRES 
           HIS PISTOLS, dropping the WARRIOR.  

           Bridger and Pig join Glass... splash into the river, SHOOTING 
           back at the attacking Arikara.   

           A WARRIOR LEAPS FROM THE SHADOWS... tackles Bridger to the 
           shallows.  The warrior pins Bridger underwater... raises his 
           hatchet high to slam down... just as Glass dives into him, 
           knocking the warrior off Bridger.  Glass and the warrior 
           wrestle in the surf, until Glass finally overpowers him... 
           stabs his knife deep into the warrior’s stomach.  

           Bridger kneels in the shallows, frozen in shock.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        GO!  
                                                     (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                             (cid:13)           Pig drags Bridger to his feet... they swim toward the boat.  
           ARROWS hiss into the water all around them.  Glass pulls his 
           pistol... BAM... shoots an oncoming warrior... spins after 
           the others... joins them as they near the flatboat.   

           A final TRAPPER charges down the shore after them.  SEVERAL 
           WARRIORS pursue him.  

                                 TRAPPER
                        WAIT!  

           He aims his pistol over his shoulder as he runs... pulls the 
           trigger... CLICK... pulls it again... CLICK.  But he’s too 
           scared to stop his finger... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... 
           THUD... as a hatchet buries in his back.  He crashes face 
           first into the shallows.  

           The Arikara leader, (ELK’S TONGUE), animal bones braided into 
           his mohawk, a NECKLACE OF HUMAN EARS around his neck, 
           straddles the dying man.  Elk’s Tongue grabs the Trapper by 
           the hair, and CUTS OFF HIS LEFT EAR, then holds it up to 
           Glass and the others, as he SCREAMS HIS WAR CRY.    

           Glass and the men shove the flatboat off the sandbar as 
           arrows dart past them... drive into the wooden boat.  They 
           scramble aboard, firing back at the Arikara, as the current 
           carries them away.  Pig reaches over the side, pulls the 
           frantic WILLIAM ANDERSON up onto the boat.  Fitzgerald and 
           Glass grab LONGPOLES... shove them against the river’s bottom 
           to pick up speed.  

           Henry stands on deck, watching as Elk’s Tongue yanks a DYING 
           TRAPPER’s head back by his hair to peel away his scalp.  

           Henry drops his eyes... can’t watch.  The TRAPPER’S SCREAM 
           ECHOES OVER HIM.  

           EXT. MISSOURI RIVER/FLATBOAT - LATER

           Quiet and dark... the battle long over.  The flatboat floats 
           with the gentle current.  The NINE SURVIVING TRAPPERS are 
           scattered around the deck... Glass digging an arrow out of 
           WALLACE MURPHY’S SHOULDER... Fitzgerald poling on one side 
           with Anderson on the other... STUBBY BILL VANCE and Pig 
           standing patrol with their rifles... Bridger doctoring a 
           badly WOUNDED TRAPPER... and Henry standing at the front of 
           the flatboat, staring off blankly.

                                 FITZGERALD
                        What’s the plan, Captain?  

           Henry’s still lost in those screams.    
                                                             (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                              (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        Captain!  What the hell do we do 
                        now?    

           Henry snaps out of his stare... turns to the men... obviously 
           doesn’t have an answer.  

                                 ANDERSON
                        We’re just floatin’ farther from 
                        Fort Union.

           Henry’s eyes instinctively look to Glass.   

                                 GLASS
                        The Missouri’s no good.  Not if the 
                        ‘Ree’s running it.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        So we just float the hell down to 
                        Mexico or wherever else this river 
                        takes us?  

                                 GLASS
                        We get ourselves safe outta range 
                        then track another course up.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Add weeks to the trip.  

                                 BRIDGER
                        Better that than endin’ up scalped 
                        on the side of the river.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Shut up, boy, you don’t get no say 
                        in this.  
                         (back to Henry)
                        And in case you hadn’t noticed, 
                        Captain, we’re twelve men short of 
                        what we were. 
                         (off the badly wounded 
                          trapper)
                        Thirteen before long.  

                                 HENRY
                        I understand our situation, Mr. 
                        Fitzgerald.  We do like Glass 
                        said... put some distance between 
                        us and the Arikara, then chart a 
                        course to Fort Union.   

           Fitzgerald MUMBLES UNDER HIS BREATH... rolls his eyes to 
           Anderson.  Glass gives Henry a nod.  
                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)           EXT. MISSOURI RIVER/FLATBOAT - NIGHT

           ANGLE ON THE BADLY WOUNDED TRAPPER... NOW DEAD...

           ...as hands push the body over the side of the boat.  It 
           splashes into the water... floats downstream.  

           We PULL BACK... see that the flatboat is beached along the 
           bank of the river.  Glass and Pig watch the body drift away.  

                                 PIG
                        Reckon it’s better ‘an lettin’ the 
                        ‘Ree find him... take his ears... 
                        slice what’s left all to shit.  

           Glass nods... steps down off the boat to Henry and the 
           others.  They’re gathered around a map spread out on the 
           ground.  Henry runs his finger along a THIN BLUE LINE.  

                                 HENRY
                        So we hike west to the Grand, then 
                        follow it up to Fort Union.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        On foot?  You got any idea how long 
                        that’s gonna take?  It’ll be winter 
                        before we get there.    

                                 ANDERSON
                        Unless we come across a post... 
                        trade for some horses.  

                                 GLASS
                        No posts that far over.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        So if we do this, we do every step 
                        with our own feet.    

                                 HENRY
                        We make camp here for the night, 
                        then load supplies and head out for 
                        the Grand at first light.  
                         (beat)
                        And gather extra blankets ‘cause 
                        there won’t be any fires.  

           More GRUMBLING from Fitzgerald and Anderson, as they move 
           toward the cover of trees.  Bridger walks up beside Glass.

                        Thank you... for what you done back 
                        there.  

                                 GLASS
                        You’d have done the same for me.  

                                 BRIDGER
                         (nods... hopes so)
                        Yessir.  

           Glass and Bridger walk off together. 

                                 HENRY
                        Bridger, you and Pig take first 
                        watch.  

           Bridger and Pig exchange nervous glances.  

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Bridger on watch... sitting at the base of a tree, rifle 
           across his lap, eyes wide, scanning the darkness.  All clear.  
           He peers back to camp... Fitzgerald, Anderson, Stubby Bill, 
           and Murphy wrapped in blankets... passing a bottle of whiskey 
           around.  Henry is off to one side, still studying that map.  
           Glass sits against a tree, cleaning his Anstadt rifle.  
           Fitzgerald notices.     

                                 FITZGERALD
                        You treat that Anstadt sweeter than 
                        any woman, Glass.  

                                 STUBBY BILL 
                        Never seen a woman that could stop 
                        a ‘Ree from three hundred feet.  

                                 ANDERSON
                        I knew a particular big-breasted 
                        redhead in Boston that might come 
                        close.  

           The others manage a small laugh.  Glass just keeps working on 
           that rifle.  Fitzgerald stands... wobbles just a bit... he’s 
           had more than his share of that whiskey.  He walks to Glass 
           with the whiskey bottle in one hand... reaches down with the 
           other, and grabs the barrel of the Anstadt.     

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Lemme see what’s so special ‘bout 
                        this shooter of yours.  
                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)
                                 (cid:13)           Glass holds firm... shakes his head.    

                                 GLASS
                        Middle of workin’ on it. 

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Well you can stop workin’ on it, 
                        boy, and let me have a look like I 
                        said.  

           Fitzgerald gives another tug, but Glass’ grip only grows 
           tighter.  His eyes roll up to Fitzgerald... make it clear he 
           isn’t giving up his rifle.  And they hold that stare just as 
           hard as they’re holding Glass’ rifle.  

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        You forget your place, boy?  

                                 GLASS
                        Best I can tell, my place is right 
                        where I want it... on the smart end 
                        of my rifle.  

           Fitzgerald realizes the barrel he’s holding is aimed right at 
           his stomach, while Glass’ hand seems suddenly very close to 
           the trigger.  But Fitzgerald’s pride and that whiskey won’t 
           let him lose this tug of war... not until... 

                                 HENRY
                        That’s enough, Fitzgerald.  Go 
                        sober up and get to sleep.  If 
                        you’re passed out when we break 
                        camp tomorrow, I leave you here.  

           Fitzgerald holds his glare on Glass.  

                                 MURPHY
                        Leave his rifle alone, Fitz.  Hell, 
                        you shoulda got a good enough look 
                        when he saved your ass with it.  

           Fitzgerald throws a hard glance to Murphy.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        I didn’t need savin’ by him or 
                        nobody else.   

           The others don’t respond... know to leave Fitzgerald alone 
           when he’s drunk.  Fitzgerald hesitates another beat, then 
           releases the rifle, shoving it back at Glass.  He glances to 
           Henry, and throws back a big gulp from the bottle just for 
           spite, before staggering back to the others.    
                                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        That’s the trouble with this part 
                        of the world.  No mirrors.  Niggers 
                        forget what color they are.   

           Glass ignores Fitzgerald... goes back to his rifle.  
           Fitzgerald tosses the bottle back at Anderson, then jerks his 
           blanket up... walks off to sleep by himself.  

           EXT. CAMP - LATER

           Fitzgerald sleeping off that whiskey.  The others snoring in 
           a cluster at the center of the camp.  Henry lies there 
           awake... looks across to Glass, still sitting against the 
           tree, a HANDRAWN MAP in his lap, as his eyes pierce the 
           darkness.  Henry eases over to Glass.  

                                 HENRY
                        Can’t sleep either?  

                                 GLASS
                        Never like closin’ my eyes when I’m 
                        not sure who’ll be standin’ over me 
                        when I open ‘em.  

                                 HENRY
                        I keep thinking about Boone and the 
                        others... how maybe I should’ve had 
                        us make camp further up river.  

                                 GLASS
                        The tracks I saw... those ‘Ree had 
                        been tailin’ us for a while. They’d 
                        have gone as far north as it took.  

           Henry nods... hopes that’s true.    

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        You’re a good man, Captain.  Soon 
                        as you realize that, these others 
                        will too.  

           Henry likes hearing that... still isn’t sure it’s true.  

                                 HENRY
                        Your years trappin’ and guidin’ out 
                        here... have you had much 
                        experience with the Arikara?  

                                 GLASS
                        Enough to know to stay outta their 
                        way.     
                                                  (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                 HENRY
                         (motions to Glass’ map)
                        But you know this country well 
                        enough to get us past them... up to 
                        Fort Union?  

                                 GLASS
                        I been here a long while.  Whether 
                        that gets us to Union or not...   

           Henry waits for more... doesn’t get it.  So he just nods and 
           starts back to his blanket.... stops.  

                                 HENRY 
                        What Fitzgerald said earlier... he 
                        doesn’t speak for the rest.  

                                 GLASS
                        He wasn’t wrong.  Truth is that’s 
                        what I prefer about this country... 
                        it’s got no eye for the color of a 
                        man’s skin.   

                                 HENRY
                         (beat)
                        Try to get some sleep, Hugh.  

           Henry climbs back under his blanket.  Glass just sits there 
           looking at the map.  

           ANGLE ON GLASS’ MAP...

           ...primitive at best.  Sketched mountains... winding blue 
           lines for rivers... small dots are scattered about with names 
           beside them... “Brazeau”, “Talbot”, “Union”.  And DOZENS OF 
           TRIANGLE PINE TREES have been drawn, representing the endless 
           wilderness.  

           We TIGHTEN ON THOSE TRIANGLES until we’re lost in them.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY

           Thick with trees.  Henry leads the men single file through 
           the woods.  They each have a canvas sack of supplies over one 
           shoulder, and their rifle in their hands.   

           The only sound is their feet crunching the dried leaves, and 
           even that seems too loud as their eyes dart about, searching 
           for any sign of attack.  
                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)

                        Shouldn’t we have hit the Grand by 
                        now?  

                                 HENRY
                        We’ll reach it soon enough.  Glass 
                        said to keep this course.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Glass said.  So why is it I don’t 
                        see him ‘round nowheres then?  

                                 PIG
                        On account he’s up ahead makin’ 
                        sure it’s clear, and you get to 
                        keep your ears.  

           Fitzgerald throws Pig an angry glance.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Or he’s run off and left us.  

                                 BRIDGER
                        Mr. Glass wouldn’t do that.  

           Fitzgerald GRUNTS... he’s not so sure.  

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Glass moves slowly through the brush, almost gliding... 
           subtle twists and turns to avoid branches and leaves... 
           careful not to leave his scent behind.  And his eyes cut 
           through the trees as he moves... digging for any sign of 
           movement. 

           He spots something at his feet... crouches down, running his 
           finger over the SMALL ANIMAL TRACK in the dirt.    

           O.S. RUSTLING snaps his head up... to the TREMBLING OF 
           BUSHES... growing harder... whatever’s in there is coming 
           toward Glass.  He calmly raises his rifle... presses the 
           stock firmly against his shoulder... closes one eye as he 
           takes steady aim down the long barrel...

           ...to the shapes rumbling out of the brush... TWO BEAR CUBS 
           playfully wrestling.   

           Glass lowers the Anstadt... looks past the cubs for something 
           else... but the woods are empty.  A SUDDEN FEAR FILLS GLASS’ 
           EYES...
                                           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                             (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                      (cid:13)           ...he spins... right into the GIANT GRIZZLY SWINGING ITS PAW 
           AT HIM... hitting him across the side of the neck.  The 
           animal’s razor claws tear into Glass’ throat, as the force 
           sends him flying through the air.  

           Glass sails into a thick tree... the CRACK OF HIS LEG 
           SNAPPING against the trunk.  The rifle falls from his hand.  
           The Grizzly lets out a massive ROAR... charges Glass.  Glass 
           crawls to the Anstadt... grabs it... has just enough time to 
           tilt the rifle toward the bear... BOOM.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           HENRY - HEARING THE BLAST.

                                 HENRY
                        UP AHEAD!  

           Henry takes off at full sprint.  The other men follow.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           GLASS - AS THE BEAR LEAPS ON TOP OF HIM... 

           ...tosses Glass aside with a powerful swing.  Glass hits the 
           ground with a PAINFUL THUD.  He starts CRAWLING AWAY, pulling 
           the KNIFE from his belt as the bear rises up like a giant 
           behind him... swings... tears its claws across Glass’s back, 
           shredding deep into his flesh.

           Glass is fighting for his life now... flailing with the 
           knife... slicing it across the bear’s paw as it whips past 
           him.  The wound slows the bear enough for Glass to start 
           crawling again. 

           But the Grizzly doesn’t give Glass the chance... ROARS... is 
           on him in a flash, a BLUR OF CLAWS AND FANGS... tearing 
           across Glass’ head... ripping into his face... his chest.  

           Glass drives his knife into the bear again... deep... trying 
           to tear through the layers of flesh to something more vital.   

                                                       CUT TO:

           HENRY - LEADING THE CHARGE THROUGH THE FOREST.

                                                       CUT TO:
                                             (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)           GLASS AND THE GRIZZLY - FIGHTING THIS EPIC BATTLE...

           ...locked in a death grip... tumbling along the ground... 
           trading violent blows... Glass’ blade versus the Grizzly’s 
           claws and fangs... snapping small trees as they roll over 
           them... toward the edge of a steep embankment...

           ... and ROLL DOWN... spinning over and over... each ROARING 
           AT THE OTHER... Glass pounding the knife into the bear again 
           and again as they fall... neither willing to surrender as 
           they careen down the slope at a dizzying pace, then SLAM TO 
           THE BOTTOM WITH A CRUNCH.  And the forest falls still... 
           Glass hidden somewhere beneath the massive animal... both 
           deathly motionless.     

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Bridger’s the first to reach the battleground... sees the TWO 
           FRIGHTENED BEAR CUBS SCURRY AWAY.  He follows the bloody 
           ground and crushed underbrush to the top of the slope... 
           looks down to the mass of flesh at the bottom. 

                                 BRIDGER
                        Christ Almighty.  

           Henry, Pig, and the others reach the edge.  

                                 HENRY
                        Glass!  

           No answer.  And all they can see is the bear, so they scan 
           the trees.  

                                 PIG
                        HUGH!  

           Still nothing.  So Bridger takes off down the slope... losing 
           his balance but rolling back to his feet.  He reaches the 
           bear... sees GLASS’ MANGLED ARM STICKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT.  

                                 BRIDGER
                        He’s down here!  

           Bridger uses all his strength to push the bear off, as the 
           other men scramble down.  But Bridger can’t budge the massive 
           carcass... not until Stubby Bill and Pig join in... shove the 
           animal over, revealing the bloody mass that is Hugh Glass...   

           ...his throat is torn wide open... scalp peeled back from 
           just above his eyebrows, hanging off the skull... 
                                                        (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)           stomach and chest a gruesome design of gashes and cuts.   His 
           right leg is snapped, the jagged bone jutting out through the 
           skin.    

           Bridger’s legs give out... he drops to a knee and vomits.  

                                 MURPHY
                        Oh, Jesus.     

                                 STUBBY BILL 
                        He’s tore to pieces.    

           The men stare down at Glass’ corpse.  

                                 ANDERSON
                        Least he took that Grizz down with 
                        him.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Wished he’da done it without firing 
                        his rifle. If there wasn’t no ‘Ree 
                        around before, there will be now.  

           And that’s all Pig can stand... he TACKLES FITZGERALD... they 
           roll to the ground.  And it isn’t long before Fitzgerald is 
           on top, raining punches down on Pig.  Henry and Anderson grab 
           Fitzgerald... drag him off.

                                 HENRY
                        THAT’S ENOUGH!  

           Then somehow, GLASS GASPS... this horrible, GUTTURAL MOAN.  

                                 BRIDGER
                        Holy Christ, he’s alive.  

           Henry and Bridger fall to their knees beside Glass.  Glass 
           looks up at the men, tries to focus through the blood and 
           pain.  His breathing is just a GURGLING WHEEZE... bubbles 
           forming along the deep gashes in his throat with each gasp.  

                                 HENRY
                        Get me some water.  

           Stubby Bill tosses Henry his canteen.  Henry empties it over 
           Glass’ throat... his face and scalp.  The water hits the 
           wounds and immediately transforms to blood.  

                                 BRIDGER
                        Oh, Jesus... Jesus.  

           Glass lifts a trembling hand to his throat... feels the 
           gaping wound.  His eyes widen in horror.  He COUGHS... the 
           air splashes blood up from the open wounds in his throat.   
           (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                 HENRY
                        It’s okay, Hugh.  
                         (pushing Glass’ hand away)
                        You’re going to be fine.  

           Henry spins his head away from Glass.  

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                         (whispers)
                        I need some rags before he bleeds 
                        out.  

           Pig whips a shirt from his bag... shreds it.  

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        And your whiskey.  

           Pig tosses a bottle to Henry.  Henry pours it over the 
           gashes.  The BURNING PAIN arches Glass... he CRIES OUT in 
           that same horrific moan.  

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        Hold him down, Bridger, goddammit.  

           Bridger throws his weight against Glass’ shoulders.  

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        The rest of you spread out... scout 
                        a circle around us.  Fitzgerald, 
                        you and Anderson take west and 
                        north.  Murphy and Mike south and 
                        east.  Watch for anyone that 
                        might’ve heard that shot.  

           And for the first time, Henry seems like a leader of men... 
           firm... in complete control... just as Glass said he would 
           be.  So the men hurry off to their positions.   

                                 PIG
                        What about me, Cap?

                                 HENRY
                        Get down here and help me tie off 
                        these wounds best we can.  

           Pig shakily joins Henry in wrapping the wounds.  The blood 
           keeps seeping out, soaking the rags.  

                                 PIG

                        Shut up, Pig.  
                         (to Glass)
                        We’re fixing you up, Hugh.  

           Glass is like a shredded rag doll... dazed eyes staring up at 
           them as they work on his wounds... wrapping the rags around 
           his throat... laying his scalp back over his skull, and tying 
           another rag around it and under his jaw to hold it in place.  
           Bridger stares down at Glass with tears in his eyes... wipes 
           the blood from Glass’ face.    

                                 BRIDGER
                        I’m sorry, Mr. Glass.  I’m sorry.    

           Henry glances down to the PUDDLE OF BLOOD spilling out over 
           his knees... oozing out from beneath Glass.  

                                 HENRY
                        Roll him over... easy.  

           They gently push Glass onto one side, revealing DEEP, JAGGED, 
           GASHES running across the width of Glass’ back.  Henry stares 
           at the open flesh, ready to panic again... but he doesn’t.  
           Instead he looks to Pig.  

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        Get me the kit.  We need to stitch 
                        his back up. 

                                 BRIDGER
                        What about the rest of him?  

                                 HENRY
                        He’s losing more blood back here.  
                         (off the throat)
                        And I don’t know what to do with 
                        that yet.  

           Pig digs out a thick needle and spool of black thread... 
           hands it to Henry.  Henry grabs the whiskey bottle.  

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        I’m sorry for how this is about to 
                        burn, Hugh.  

           Henry pours the whiskey over Glass’ back.  And the pain must 
           be excruciating, because Glass lets out a HORRIBLE WAIL.  

                                                       CUT TO:

WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           Fitzgerald and Anderson standing watch together in the trees.  
           Glass’ scream erupts through the trees, and they both 
           immediately crouch down to a knee... out of sight to anyone 
           out there that might have heard that.  

                                 ANDERSON
                        They’re torturin’ the poor bastard.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        And riskin’ gettin’ us killed in 
                        the process.  Proper thing would be 
                        to end it for him quick.       

                                 ANDERSON
                        ‘Less he could pull through.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        You seen what that grizz did to 
                        him.  Shit, Glass’ll be dead inside 
                        a hour.  We all will be if he keeps 
                        screamin’ like that.    

           EXT. WOODS - LATER

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           HENRY, BRIDGER AND PIG WORKING OVER GLASS... Bridger and Pig 
           pressing Glass’ scalp down, as Henry slides the needle and 
           thread through the skin, suturing the wound.  

           HENRY CLEANING GLASS’ SHREDDED THROAT.

           BRIDGER AND PIG HOLDING THE SCREAMING GLASS DOWN AS HENRY 
           SNAPS GLASS’ LEG BACK IN PLACE.  

           FITZGERALD PEERING BACK THROUGH THE TREES... to Henry 
           doctoring Glass.  Fitzgerald shakes his head in anger... 
           turns back to the darkening forest.  

           EXT. WOODS - EVENING

           Glass rests unconscious on the ground.  Two branches act as a 
           splint on his leg.  A blanket covers his body... his face is 
           like a swollen, disfigured, Frankenstein’s monster... 
           stitches of black thread holding it in place.  

           Henry crouches a short distance away from him, rinsing his 
           hands under a canteen.  Bridger and Pig stand beside him.  
                                   (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                               (cid:13)

                        What now?  

                                 HENRY
                        We wait.  Does he have any kin you 
                        know of?

                                 PIG
                        Never mentioned none.   

                                 HENRY
                        Go get the others.  Tell ‘em we’re 
                        making camp here for the night. 

           Pig starts hustling away.  

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        And gather some wood, but make sure 
                        it’s dry.  We don’t want much smoke 
                        when we cook that grizzly.  

           ANGLE ON THE MASSIVE BEAR...

           ...lying dead on the ground, its claws and fangs soaked with 
           blood... Glass’ blood. 

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           And what’s left of the grizzly... its fur cut away... slabs 
           of flesh butchered from its skeleton.  

           A fire burns at the center of camp... a chunk of meat roasts 
           above the flame.  The men sit around the fire... Murphy 
           reaches up... tears a strip of meat from the roast, tossing 
           it in his mouth.  The men are silent... the pall of Glass’ 
           attack still hanging over them.  

           Bridger rises... walks to the Grizzly... crouches down over 
           it, grabbing the animal’s enormous paw.  It dwarfs his own 
           hand, as he examines the claws.  Bridger pulls out his 
           knife... stretches the claw out to its full length, and CUTS 
           IT OFF AT ITS BASE.  Bridger stares at it, amazed at its 
           size... longer than his own finger.   

                                 FITZGERALD (O.S.)
                        What makes you think you earned a 
                        claw, boy?  
                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)           Bridger turns with a start... sees Fitzgerald standing over 
           him, meat in his hand... his lips shiny with the grease.  

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        You didn’t take that grizz down.  

                                 BRIDGER
                        It ain’t for me.  

           Bridger stands... walks over to the sleeping Glass.  Pig’s 
           already crouched beside him.  Bridger lifts Glass’ small 
           leather POSSIBLES BAG from beside the Anstadt rifle... drops 
           the claw inside... throws a look back to Fitzgerald.    

           Pig holds his palm out just above Glass’ mouth.  

                                 PIG 
                        I can feel some air outta his 
                        mouth.  Maybe Captain sealed up his 
                        throat proper, huh?   
                         (off Bridger’s silence)
                        Whatta you figure his odds are, 
                        Jim?  

           Bridger stares down at what’s left of Glass. 

                                 BRIDGER 
                        Long.  

           EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING

           The sun peeks over the horizon, sending an orange glow across 
           the treetops.  

           EXT. CAMP - MORNING

           ANGLE ON GLASS...

           ...unconscious but alive... his raspy breaths are weak and 
           staggered.  The SHADOWS OF MEN hover over him...

           ...because Henry and the others surround Glass, staring down 
           at him.  

                                 MURPHY
                        What that bear did to him... I 
                        didn’t expect he’d last this long.  
                                                                (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                 ANDERSON
                        I seen a fella go a week once after 
                        a lion jumped him.  Fever finally 
                        finished him off. 

                                 STUBBY BILL 
                        Whatta we do, Cap?  

           A long beat, then...

                                 HENRY
                        We give him his chance.  

           Henry turns and walks away.  

           EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

           The fire has burned down to nothing.  The men sleep scattered 
           about.  Murphy stands just outside of camp, rifle ready, 
           keeping watch.    

           Glass lies there awake... eyes wide open... a living corpse.  
           And his breathing is just as labored as before... raspy, 
           blood-soaked strains. 

           Fitzgerald tosses and turns, listening to Glass’ gurgling.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        You ain’t doin’ him or us no 
                        favors, Captain, lettin’ him suffer 
                        that way.  

           Henry’s awake, but doesn’t answer.  He’s holding his pistol 
           in his hand, as he stares at Glass... thinking the same thing 
           Fitzgerald just said.  But he doesn’t move... not yet.  

           Fitzgerald angrily wraps a blanket around his head, muffling 
           the sound.  Bridger sits beyond him... smiles at Fitzgerald’s 
           misery, as he attaches the BEAR CLAW TO A THIN LEATHER 
           STRAP... a necklace. 

           EXT. CAMP - MORNING

           Bridger kneels over a SHIVERING GLASS, holding wet rags on 
           his head.   Pig and Henry stand over them, watching.  

           Fitzgerald, Anderson, Murphy and Stubby Bill sit huddled 
           across camp.  

                                 ANDERSON
                        Fever’s hit.  Won’t be long now.  
                                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                 FITZGERALD
                        I seen a bad one drag on days.  
                         (to Henry)
                        We keep sittin’ here, just gives 
                        the ‘Ree more chance to find us.  

           Henry doesn’t answer... just keeps staring down at Glass.  

                                 BRIDGER
                        He’s burnin’, Cap.  Water turns to 
                        boil as soon as it touches him.  

           Henry considers this, then... 

                                 HENRY
                        Pig, take Anderson and scout ahead.  
                        Grand should be just west of here.  
                        Find us the best route.   

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Tryin’ to buy Glass time don’t make 
                        sense for the rest of us, Captain.  

                                 HENRY
                         (to Pig)
                        Get movin’.  

           Pig nods... grabs his gear.  He and Anderson take off out of 
           camp.  Henry turns... walks out of range of Glass.  

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        Fitzgerald, you and Bill can start 
                        digging a grave.   

           Fitzgerald rolls his eyes as he stands.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Hell, least it’s a step in the 
                        right direction.  

           EXT. CAMP - LATER

           Fitzgerald is covered in dirt and sweat, standing knee deep 
           in Glass’ grave.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Should do the trick.   

           He takes Stubby Bill’s hand... pulls himself out.  

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        Coyotes won’t dig that deep.  
                                                   (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)           Pig and Anderson walk back into camp.  

                                 PIG
                        Found it, Cap.  Right where Glass 
                        had us headed.  

                                 ANDERSON
                        No more than a mile or so out.

           Henry looks to Bridger, still doctoring Glass.  

                                 HENRY
                        We could build a litter.  Haul him 
                        with us.  

                                 ANDERSON
                        It’s a rocky and steep goin’. 

           Henry looks to Pig for an honest answer.  

                                 PIG
                        Marshy and thick on the other side.  
                        We could try it, but...

           Pig shakes his head.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        I signed on as a trapper, not a 
                        goddamn mule.  

                                 BRIDGER
                         (to Henry)
                        Shape he’s in... I don’t see no way 
                        he’d make bein’ drug.   

           Henry nods, his mind racing for a solution.  And before long, 
           his hand is back on that pistol.  He pulls it from his belt.  

           The other men all drop their heads... except for 
           Fitzgerald... he’s ready to see this end.  Henry stares down 
           at Glass, his gun hand suddenly trembling.  

                                 HENRY
                        Lay that rag over his eyes, Mr. 
                        Bridger.

                                 BRIDGER
                        But, Captain.  

                                 HENRY
                        Do it.
                                                (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)           Bridger hesitates, then reaches to fold the wet rag down over 
           Glass’ wide open eyes.  And Glass must know what’s happening, 
           because his eyes roll up to Bridger’s... his lips try to form 
           a word... his hand digs its fingers into the dirt beside him.

                                                       CUT TO:

           GLASS’ POV - ON BRIDGER... 

           ...the boy looking away as he pulls the rag over our eyes... 
           everything goes black.  

                                 HENRY (O.S.)
                        Step clear, Mr. Bridger.  

           A LONG BEAT in the dark, waiting for that gunshot, then...

           BACK TO SCENE

           Henry standing over Glass... pistol aimed down.  His hand 
           shakes violently.  

           Pig turns away... presses his hands over his ears.  

           Henry struggles to steady his aim, until finally it calms... 
           because he’s thought of something else.    

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        There’s a seventy dollar bonus from 
                        the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to 
                        the two men that stay with Glass... 
                        see this through.  Then give him a 
                        proper burial.    

                                 BRIDGER
                        I’ll stay with him... money or not.  

                                 PIG
                        Same here.  

                                 HENRY
                        I can’t let you stay back, Pig.  
                        Without Glass, I’ll need you to 
                        scout.  

           Henry looks to the others... they all drop their eyes... not 
           interested.  

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        Just need one more.  
                                                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                 FITZGERALD
                        Two won’t stand much chance against 
                        a party of ‘Ree, Captain, and 
                        seventy dollars won’t buy me a new 
                        setta ears.    

                                 HENRY
                        A hundred then.    

           Still nothing from the others.  

                                 BRIDGER
                        They can have my share too.  Shit, 
                        I’d be dead on the Missouri if it 
                        weren’t for Mr. Glass.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        That case I’ll hang back with the 
                        boy.  I don’t mind fallin’ a day or 
                        so behind for two hundred.  

                                 HENRY
                        But Glass is to be cared for until.  
                        Understood?  

                                 FITZGERALD
                         (motions to Bridger)
                        I’ll let the young doctor do his 
                        job.  

           Henry hesitates... doesn’t like this, but knows it’s the best 
           option left.  

                                 HENRY
                        The rest gather your gear.  

           Bridger reaches down... lifts the rag from Glass’ face.  
           Their eyes meet... Bridger gives Glass a nod.  

           EXT. CAMP - LATER

           Henry and the others are loaded and ready to leave.  Pig 
           bends down over Glass.  

                                 PIG
                        I’ll see ya at Fort Union, Hugh.  

           Glass’s glazed eyes focus on Pig.  He moves the only thing he 
           can... BLINKS a “yes” back at him.

                         (to Fitzgerald and 
                          Bridger)
                        As long as necessary.  

                                 BRIDGER
                        Yessir.  I’ll look after him.  

           Henry turns... leads the men into the trees... toward the 
           Grand... toward Fort Union.  

           EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

           What’s left of a small fire is nothing but smoldering ash.  
           Bridger crouches beside Glass, pouring a thin stream of broth 
           between his lips.  Fitzgerald reaches in... grabs Glass’ 
           Anstadt leaning against the tree.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        I’ll take first watch.  

                                 BRIDGER
                        You shouldn’t use that.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Trust me, kid, he ain’t gonna be 
                        needin’ it tonight.  

           Fitzgerald disappears into the trees.  

           EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY

           Pig stands on a ridge, scouting a course.  He waves back to 
           Henry and the others.  They start toward him.  

           EXT. CAMP - EVENING

           Glass conscious on the ground... that same labored breathing.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           GLASS’ POV - ON FITZGERALD... 

           ...smiling down at Glass as he grabs the Anstadt, holds it 
           for Glass to see... as comfortable as if it were his own.  
           Then he winks, and disappears... 
                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)           and we’re left alone, staring up at the branches above us... 
           the evening sky... accompanied by Glass’ deathly breaths.  

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. WILDERNESS/CREEK - DAY

           Bridger kneels beside the stream, filling canteens.  

           EXT. CAMP - DAY

           Fitzgerald sits bored against a tree, twisting a knife in his 
           hands... flipping it point first into the dirt... grabbing... 
           repeating... twist... flip... thwack.  And as he does, his 
           eyes are locked on Glass.      

           Finally, Fitzgerald snaps the knife from the dirt, stands, 
           and walks over to Glass.  Glass is asleep.  Fitzgerald 
           crouches down over him... eyes his red, infected wounds.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                         (whispers)
                        When are you gonna die, boy?  

           Fitzgerald reaches out with the blade... gently touches one 
           of the threads holding Glass’ throat together.  And when he 
           does, GLASS’ EYES FLY OPEN... focus on Fitzgerald.  

           Fitzgerald doesn’t even flinch... just holds that knife tip 
           there against Glass’ throat.   

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        I’m nearly a week behind Henry’s 
                        bunch on accounta havin’ to tend to 
                        you.  Be easier on us all if you’d 
                        take that last breath.      

           The two men hold a stare... until Fitzgerald pulls back the 
           knife... grabs a bloodstained rag from beside them... balls 
           it up in his fist.  

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        I could help ya with that if you’d 
                        like.  Muzzle ya right now... end 
                        all this sufferin’ quick and easy.  
                        Nobody’d ever know you give up.    

           Fitzgerald moves the rag over Glass’ nose and mouth... holds 
           it there, just inches above.  
                                                                 (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        You just gimme a blink if you want 
                        me to do it.  

           Glass locks his eyes on Fitzgerald’s... both men unblinking.  

           A DROP OF BLOOD hangs from the rag... finally falls... lands 
           on Glass’ lips.  

           Fitzgerald almost smiles, waiting for the inevitable... as 
           Glass stares back, fighting the urge to blink.  

           Suddenly Bridger’s hand clamps down on Fitzgerald’s shoulder.  
           Fitzgerald spins... startled.  

                                 BRIDGER (O.S.)
                        Whatta you doin’?  

           Fitzgerald jumps with a start, sees it’s Bridger, and is 
           pissed that Bridger scared him... and interrupted his 
           business.  He rises quickly, planting his meaty hand in 
           Bridger’s chest, and SLAMMING HIM BACK AGAINST A TREE.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Don’t you ever question me, you 
                        little piss-ant.  

           Fitzgerald holds Bridger pressed against the tree.  

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        I’d just as soon leave both you and 
                        your nigger here to rot. ‘Cept 
                        killin’ you ain’t worth givin’ up 
                        your share.     
                         (leans closer)
                        But that don’t mean I can’t be 
                        coaxed into changin’ my mind.  

           Bridger’s scared... his eyes well up.  Fitzgerald shoves him 
           away... the young man stumbles and falls.  Fitzgerald tosses 
           the bloody rag at him.  

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        And I was just doin’ your job... 
                        cleanin’ him up.   

           Fitzgerald grabs Glass’ Anstadt, almost daring Bridger to say 
           something.  Of course Bridger doesn’t.  Fitzgerald walks 
           toward the trees.   

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        Why don’t ya pour some more broth 
                        down his throat...

                        keep him alive another week so we 
                        can fall farther back.  End up 
                        walkin’ all the way to Fort Union 
                        on our own.  ‘Ree would love to 
                        poach on just two.   
                         (turns to Bridger)
                        I promise ya, you’ll look a helluva 
                        lot worse than Glass when they’re 
                        done with you.  

           Bridger watches him disappear into the trees... wipes a tear 
           from his cheek with a trembling hand.  

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT

           From high above the trees. The world is silent... peaceful... 
           until SEVERAL STARTLED CROWS shoot up from the treetops.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           BLACK...

           ...the sound of FRENZIED BREATHING.  

                                 FITZGERALD (V.O.)
                         (panicked whisper)
                        Bridger!  Get your ass up!  

           Dim light fills the frame... then FITZGERALD’S FACE right in 
           front of us.  

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        ‘Ree.  

           BRIDGER - SCRAMBLES UP FROM UNDER HIS BLANKET, WIPING THE

                                 BRIDGER
                        What?

                                 FITZGERALD 
                        Keep quiet.  I was down at the 
                        creek... there’s twenty of ‘em at 
                        least, comin’ this way.  

                                 BRIDGER

                        We run.  Now.  

           Fitzgerald gathers his bag, starts throwing in food and 
           supplies.  Bridger is scared out of his mind... does the 
           same... grabs for his rifle, resting near Glass.    

           Bridger freezes... in his panic, he’d forgotten all about 
           Glass.  And now the wounded man’s eyes stare up at him... 
           understanding perfectly what’s happening around him.    

                                 BRIDGER
                        What about Glass?

                                 FITZGERALD
                        He’s on his own, same as us.  

                                 BRIDGER
                        I can’t leave him.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Then I’m talkin’ to a dead man.  

           Glass gives Bridger the slightest of nods... go.  But 
           Bridger’s frozen... doesn’t know what to do... until 
           Fitzgerald shoves him back to life.  

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        Move.  

           Glass reaches out a weak hand out for his Anstadt... clawing 
           for his weapon.  Bridger starts to hand it to Glass, but 
           Fitzgerald grabs it first.      

                                 BRIDGER 
                        What’re you doin’?  He needs that.    

                                 FITZGERALD 
                        He couldn’t hold it if you tarred 
                        it to his hands.    

           Glass strains to hold out his trembling hand for his gun.

                                 BRIDGER
                             goddamn
                                    rifle!  That’s all 
                        It’s his 
                        he’s got!

                                 FITZGERALD
                        And more than he’ll need.  

           Fitzgerald scoops up Glass’ knife as well.  
                                       (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                 BRIDGER
                        We can’t leave him with 
                                         nothin’.

           But Fitzgerald is already sprinting away... disappearing into 
           the trees.  Glass stares after him, his once-calm eyes 
           suddenly filled with a rage.  And Bridger’s frozen again, 
           lost between duty and fear... until...

                                 BRIDGER 
                                    (cont’d
                                          )
                         (to Glass)
                        I’m sorry.  

           ...and Bridger takes off into the trees.  

           Glass’s empty hand falls back to the ground... he tries to 
           yell out in anger, but his throat EXPLODES IN PAIN.  His hand 
           digs into the dirt... pulls him over onto his side.  He flops 
           over to his stomach... GASPS IN PAIN... then using his one 
           good arm, drags himself over the dirt, his healthy leg 
           pushing weakly at the ground, trying to propel him forward... 
           a futile chase after Fitzgerald and Bridger...    

           ...inch by inch... farther than he’s been in days.  But it’s 
           still only a few yards, and now he lies in the open... a 
           clear target for the Arikara.  

           Then he spots that hole... the grave Fitzgerald dug for him. 
           He grunts into action... grabs SEVERAL, THIN BROKEN BRANCHES 
           from the ground, then claws forward, each movement 
           excruciating... until finally, he reaches the hole, and ROLLS 
           INTO IT... lands with a PAINFUL CRUNCH.   

           He rests there a moment, trying to regain any ounce of 
           strength.  Finally he fights through the pain... shoves the 
           branches back up... spreading them across the hole as 
           camouflage... a thin veil, but all that Glass has.  

           He lies there defenseless... INSIDE HIS OWN GRAVE.  Hiding... 
           listening for the Arikara’s arrival... waiting to die.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           GLASS’ POV - OUT OF THE GRAVE... TIGHT AND CLAUSTROPHOBIC... 
           JUST THE NIGHT SKY THROUGH THOSE BRANCHES... AND THE SOUND OF 
           HIS PAINFUL BREATHS.  

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:
                                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)           EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING

           Cold and grey.  Fitzgerald crouches beside a small fire, 
           warming his hands.  WHISPS OF SMOKE rise into the sky.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        We ran the better part of six 
                        hours.  Had to gain some ground on 
                        Henry and them others.  

           Bridger sits at the base of a tree, not listening... 
           staring... his mind replaying the desertion of Glass over and 
           over.  He notices the smoke.     

                                 BRIDGER
                        Best douse that smoke before them 
                        ‘Ree spot it.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        We put enough distance between us 
                        and them.  And it’s too damn cold 
                        to go without one.  

                                 BRIDGER
                        All we know, they hoofed it through 
                        the night same as us.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                         (shakes his head)
                        A dozen ‘Ree can’t make the time us 
                        two did.  

           Bridger looks back to the trees.

                                 BRIDGER
                        We shouldn’t a left him back there.  

           Fitzgerald doesn’t respond.  And then Bridger considers 
           something, stares at Fitzgerald a beat, before...

                                 BRIDGER (cont’d)
                        It was twenty earlier.

                                 FITZGERALD
                        What?

                                 BRIDGER
                        When you woke me... you said you’d 
                        spotted twenty ‘Ree.
                                            (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                 FITZGERALD
                        A dozen... twenty.  I was a little 
                        too spooked to start countin’ 
                        feathers.  Hell, one ‘Ree woulda 
                        been too many.  

           Fitzgerald empties his canteen over the fire, killing the 
           flames.  Bridger stares at the water pouring out.  

                                 BRIDGER
                        What was you even doin’ down at the 
                        creak in the middle of the night?  
                         (beat)
                        I’d already brought plenty a water.  

           Fitzgerald doesn’t answer.  Bridger tightens his grip on his 
           rifle... slowly rises.  

                                 BRIDGER (cont’d)
                        Answer me.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Don’t start questionin’ me on 
                        accounta you feelin’ guilty ‘bout 
                        leavin’ your nigger buddy behind.  

           Bridger musters up all the courage he can... aims his rifle 
           at Fitzgerald.  

                                 BRIDGER
                        ANSWER ME OR I BLOW YOUR DAMN HEAD 
                        OFF!  

           Fitzgerald stares back at Bridger and his rifle... eyes 
           taking in everything... a snake sizing up its prey.  Then 
           Fitzgerald stands... takes a step toward the boy.    

                                 FITZGERALD
                        What’re you askin’?  Why it was you 
                        turned your back on Glass?  Why you 
                        let him die to save your own sorry 
                        skin?        
                         (beat)
                        ‘Cause you was scared shitless, 
                        that’s why.  

                                 BRIDGER
                        The ‘Ree... did you see ‘em?   
                         (off Fitzgerald’s silence)
                        DID YOU SEE ‘EM?
                                                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                 FITZGERALD
                         (moving closer)
                        Not a one.  

           Bridger CRIES OUT... starts to pull the trigger, when 
           Fitzgerald’s hand flashes out, grabbing the barrel, and 
           shoving the butt back into Bridger’s face... THWACK.  

           The force of the blow knocks Bridger back to the ground, but 
           Fitzgerald holds his grip on the rifle barrel... flips it 
           around to aim it at the boy.  Blood drips down Bridger’s head 
           as he stares up at his rifle pointed down. 

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        I just needed to spur you on.  
                        Glass was dead either way.  There 
                        weren’t no point in us dyin’ too.  
                        And you know that.

           Fitzgerald lines the barrel up at Bridger’s head... his 
           finger tightens on the trigger.

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        So that there is the answer to your 
                        question.   

           And Fitzgerald PULLS THE TRIGGER... AND BRIDGER SQUEEZES HIS 
           EYES SHUT IN FEAR... THEN CLICK.  Bridger opens his eyes... 
           sees Fitzgerald grinning down at him.  

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        And the next time you aim to kill 
                        somebody, kid, best remember your 
                        gun won’t fire without a flint. 

           Fitzgerald tosses the rifle back at Bridger, and turns away.  
           Bridger’s face flushes with rage and humiliation.    

                                 BRIDGER
                        I’m goin’ back for him.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Far as we ran all night, you 
                        couldn’t find Glass with dogs and a 
                        map.  And I don’t believe you 
                        really want to. ‘Cause after 
                        leavin’ him to die the first time, 
                        I doubt he’d be too happy to see 
                        you now.    

           Fitzgerald pulls a knife from his belt, digging up dirt to 
           cover the fire’s remains.  
                                         (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        And just so we’re clear.  If you 
                        try to backtrack without me 
                        knowin’, or ever get so guilty you 
                        feel the need to tell somebody.  

           Fitzgerald looks at Bridger... hard... evil.  

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        I’ll have no choice but to gut you 
                        from nuts to nose.  

           Fitzgerald stares his point home, then shoves the blade into 
           his belt, and stands.  

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        Now let’s go.  

           Bridger wipes the blood from his face, then throws one last 
           glance behind him before following Fitzgerald.  

           EXT. CAMP - MORNING

           Empty and quiet... no sign of life... until GLASS’ HAND RISES 
           BETWEEN THE BRANCHES.  His fingers dig into the earth, 
           pulling himself up from the hole... a dead man climbing out 
           of his own grave.    

           He rolls out to the ground... arches in pain when his back 
           hits the cold, hard surface.  Glass lies there shivering, 
           regaining what little strength he has, then rolls over... 
           starts dragging himself again with that one good arm.  He 
           makes it to the blanket... wraps it around him.    

           Glass rests there in the center of camp... unable to move... 
           his eyes scanning the surroundings... no food... no water... 
           and he’s wide open in this clearing... an easy target for any 
           predator.  So he grabs his Possibles bag and GUNPOWDER HORN, 
           and drags himself toward the cover of brush.    

           And every movement takes all the will Glass has... a push 
           with his good leg followed by a pull with his healthy arm... 
           inch by inch... foot by foot... sweat pouring down his face 
           as he finally reaches the cover of the trees... continues 
           on... dragging himself across the forest floor in a 
           desperate, hopeless crawl for survival.  

           But finally it’s too much for Glass... the fever and pain 
           overwhelm him.  He collapses... falls unconscious.   
                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)           EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY

           ANGLE ON A SMALL BIRD...

           ...hopping across the ground, pecking for food.  Suddenly 
           Glass’ hand shoots into frame, grabbing for the bird.  But 
           he’s too slow... the tiny bird flutters out of reach.  

           Glass lies in the dirt, watching helplessly as it flies to a 
           low branch.  But to Glass, that bird is a world away.  He’s 
           weak... dehydrated... starving.  He looks at his hands... 
           scratched and bloody from clawing his weight.  

           He unwraps his small, leather Possibles bag... dumps it to 
           the ground, revealing it contents... flints, a straight 
           razor, his map, and a LEATHER NECKLACE WITH THE SIX-INCH BEAR 
           CLAW attached.  Glass grabs the razor... cuts SEVERAL THIN 
           STRIPS FROM THE BLANKET, and wraps them around his hands.

           He shoves the rest back in the bag, and does the only thing 
           he can do... start crawling again... push with his healthy 
           leg... pull with his good arm.     

           EXT. WILDERNESS - LATER

           Glass dragging himself up a steep slope... over rocks... the 
           jagged edges catching the wounds... tearing the primitive 
           stitching.  The gashes rip wider... blood oozes down, leaving 
           a crimson trail dripping down the rock behind him.  

           EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT

           The wind is howling through the trees.  Glass lies beneath a 
           cluster of brush... shivering... bleeding.  Every aching 
           breath creates a puff of smoke in the cold, night air.  He 
           stares into the darkness, and we...  

                                                     FLASHCUT:

           TO BRIDGER STARING BACK AT HIM...

                                 BRIDGER
                        I’m sorry.

           ...then disappearing into the night with Fitzgerald.  

           BACK TO SCENE
                                                               (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                           (cid:13)           Glass closes his eyes... wraps the blanket tighter around his 
           shivering body.  

           EXT. MARSH - DAY

           Thick with a sea of four-foot high Cattails... like miniature 
           cornstalks.  Looking down from above the marsh we see a two-
           foot wide path of crushed plants that reaches the center of 
           the marsh, and stops.  

           We tighten on the end of the path, until we see Glass lying 
           among the Cattails.  He’s sawing off one of the stalks with 
           the straight razor... peeling away the husk, and eating the 
           tender flesh beneath.  

           Mosquitoes move in clouds around him... over his face... 
           arms.  But Glass’ injured body only allows him one action at 
           a time, so the mosquitoes have their fill of him, as he gnaws 
           on the Cattail.  

           EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY

           Glass pulling himself along the ground... stopping to tear a 
           FEW BERRIES from a plant, and shove them in his mouth.  He 
           flinches as he swallows.  He starts to move again, but 
           freezes... listens... RUSHING WATER.  

           Glass digs his fingers into the ground with new energy... 
           pulls himself toward the sound... up over a ridge... and 
           there it is at the bottom of the ridge...

           ...THE GRAND RIVER... WATER.  Glass crawls down toward it.  

           EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY

           Glass drags himself to the river’s edge, cupping handfuls of 
           water and rubbing it over his parched lips... withstanding 
           the pain to gulp it down.  

           As he does, Glass notices a FISH hovering in the shallows 
           beside him.  He makes a desperate grab for the fish, but it 
           darts easily away.

           Glass cups more water to his mouth, but with each drink, he 
           feels the water leak from a hole in his throat... run down 
           his neck.  He leans out over the surface to check his 
           reflection... barely recognizes the swollen, stitched-
           together, disfigured face staring back at him.  He fights off 
           the urge to vomit... 
                             (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                               (cid:13)           pulls the razor from the leather bag, and cuts more strips of 
           blanket, soaking them in the river, then cleaning his wounds.  

           He runs a finger up to his shredded throat... around the 
           open, wet hole.  He cups another handful of water to his 
           mouth... strains to swallow, then feels the liquid GURGLE OUT 
           OF THE HOLE.  

           Glass shoves the cloth against the wound... tries to press 
           the flesh together... no good.  He dumps out his Possibles 
           bag... stares at the meager contents.  He picks up one of the 
           flints... looks to the powderhorn.    

           EXT. GRAND RIVER - LATER

           ANGLE ON A SMALL CLUMP OF DRIED GRASS...

           ...as Glass SPARKS one of the flints... ignites the grass.  
           As the fire grows, Glass pours a handful of GUNPOWDER from 
           the horn, and RUBS IT ALL OVER THE HOLE IN HIS THROAT.  

           He lifts several small blades of burning grass... a miniature 
           torch.  And only then do we realize what he’s about to do... 
           because he stares at the flame a beat, then raises it toward 
           his gunpowder-covered throat.  

           The flame nears the black powder, and LEAPS OFF THE GRASS, 
           igniting the powder, and SETTING GLASS’S NECK ON FIRE.  

           Glass falls back to the ground in agony... TRIES TO SCREAM, 
           but his burning, shredded vocal chords won’t allow him.  

           The gunpowder sizzles and burns... the flame spreads... 
           Glass’ flesh sears... melts.  And the pain is too much for 
           Glass... he passes out.  

           The smoke from his neck rises up into the blue sky... 
           fades... 

           ...and then the clouds begin to drift... fast... too fast... 
           racing across the sky... day becoming night.  The sun glides 
           over the blue... dipping into the horizon... darkening, until 
           the moon takes its place high above.   

           EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT

           ANGLE ON GLASS... looking dead beside the river, but we know 
           he’s alive because we can hear those same painful, raspy 
           breaths.     
                            (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                        (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                           (cid:13)           And then we hear something else... an O.S. RATTLING, growing 
           LOUDER... FASTER... BUZZING... until Glass’ eyes flash open.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           GLASS’ POV - ON A RATTLESNAKE COILED INCHES FROM HIS FACE.

           Glass stares back in horror... has time to throw up his arm 
           in protection as the snake STRIKES... SINKS ITS FANGS INTO 
           HIS FOREARM.  He shakes it free, but can’t escape the snake’s 
           next strike... locking its jaws onto Glass’ burned throat.  
           Glass opens his mouth to scream.

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY

           And Glass’ eyes flying open in the glaring sun, as he awakens 
           from his nightmare... looks to his arm... no snake.  His hand 
           instinctively jumps to his melted throat.  No bites.      

           But that’s when he hears it... we all do... that same 
           RATTLING FROM HIS DREAM.  Glass slowly turns his head toward 
           the sound...

           ...and there’s a RATTLESNAKE COILED just a few feet away.  
           Only it isn’t poised to attack Glass.  It’s facing the other 
           way, its target a FIELD MOUSE, trapped against a rock.  

           The snake attacks, sinking its fangs into the mouse.  The 
           field mouse tumbles over... quivers as the poison runs 
           through its body, then dies.  

           As Glass watches the snake begin to make a meal of the mouse, 
           his hand grips a rock.  He drags himself toward the occupied 
           snake... raises the rock high, then SMASHES IT DOWN ON THE 
           SNAKE’S HEAD.    

           Glass immediately pulls the razor from his bag, and slices 
           off the rattlesnake’s head, the field mouse still lodged 
           halfway inside.  Glass then drags the razor down the length 
           of the snake... digs his fingers under the fresh seam, then 
           peels the outer layer down off the rattler.  

           With the skin still hanging off the round tube of flesh, 
           Glass BITES INTO THE SNAKE, tearing off a chunk of meat.  He 
           gobbles it down, slowing only to painfully swallow the food 
           past his injured throat.
                                                                    (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)           EXT. GRAND RIVER - LATER

           ANGLE ON THE REMAINS OF THE SNAKE...

           ...the head, skin, and not much else.  

           GLASS - at the water’s edge, drinking... touching his 
           charred, melted throat... no leaks.  He opens his Possibles 
           bag... pulls out the GRIZZLY CLAW NECKLACE... stares at it a 
           beat, then slips it over his head.  He drags out the map... 
           spreads it on the ground, then throws a glance around him... 
           fingers the point on the blue line... a rough guess of his 
           location.  

           ANGLE ON THE MAP... 

           ...Fort Union at the top... hundreds of miles north.  Fort 
           Brazeau south... but not nearly as far away.  

           Glass gazes north up the Grand, as if he can see Fitzgerald 
           and Bridger just ahead of him.  Then he looks back down to 
           his reflection in the water... battered and scarred.  He 
           looks to his leg... all but worthless for now... his one good 
           arm.  It’s clear he’s not ready to take revenge on anyone.  

           So Glass shoves the map back into the bag... ties it around 
           his arm with the powderhorn and blanket, then grabs a THICK, 
           FALLEN LOG, and rolls it into the river.  Glass crawls in 
           behind it... deeper, until the current grows strong enough to 
           carry the weight of his mangled body downstream.  

           Glass drapes his healthy arm over the log, and starts 
           floating... letting the river do the work.  He watches the 
           land move past him faster than it has in days... and without 
           all the agony of every move.  

           EXT. GRAND RIVER - EVENING

           The sinking sun casts an orange glow over the water.  Glass 
           floats downstream... past a HERD OF ELK grazing along the 
           riverbank.  The animals don’t even notice him.    

           EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT

           Dark... the moon hidden behind clouds.  A heavy mist hangs 
           over the river.  Glass is draped across the log, eyes 
           closed... letting the slow current carry him south.  But then 
           his eyes open... because he hears something... a LOW RUMBLE.    
                                              (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)           Glass looks to the river banks... too foggy to see anything 
           clearly.  The RUMBLE GROWS LOUDER.  He peers ahead... too 
           dark to see much... just ANOTHER SPLINTERED LOG floating in 
           front of him, its one jagged branch rising up in the air.  

           But then THE LOG VANISHES.  Glass squints through the fog, 
           scanning the surface.  But it’s gone... the water’s empty... 
           that LOW RUMBLE GROWS EVEN LOUDER.  

           Glass looks to the water beside him... a BRANCH GLIDES PAST 
           AT A HIGHER SPEED.  And now Glass knows what’s coming, but 
           it’s too late... because the world suddenly turns upside 
           down, as Glass tumbles over the edge of a TWENTY FOOT 
           WATERFALL.  

           He spirals downward... crashes into the rushing current.  
           He’s washed forward with the suddenly violent rapids.  They 
           pull him under the surface, then toss him GASPING back out. 

                     SLAMMING HIM INTO A HUGE BOULDER... CRACK... he 
           The river carries him blindly through the mist... tossing... 
           turning...
           spins off, swept away headfirst... the foaming water sucking 
           him down the rocky gauntlet.    

           He tumbles over more boulders... his Possibles bag snaps 
           loose... is lost in the raging river.  Glass flips down 
           another set of falls... sinks beneath the surface, then 
           floats back up, as the rapids calm... spit Glass to the 
           gentle shallows.  His body drifts face-down toward shore.  

           And just when we’re sure Glass has to finally be dead, his 
           arm reaches up from the water... he digs his fingers into the 
           muddy bank, and drags himself out of the river. 

           Glass collapses unconscious to the ground, his body shrouded 
           in that mist.    

           EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY

           TIGHT ON THE LEFT SIDE OF GLASS’ FACE... the right still 
           pressed into the muddy bank.  The sun beats down... then 
           SHADOWS APPEAR... BOUNCE ACROSS HIM... something is standing 
           over Glass.   

           And then a VULTURE’S HEAD DROPS INTO FRAME...

           ...latches its beak onto Glass’ cheek... tugs at it... 
           stretches it.  Glass’ eyes pop open... we PULL BACK to see 
           THREE VULTURES surrounding Glass’ body, pecking and clawing 
           at his battered wounds.    
                                                                 (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)           Glass swings his good arm, knocking one of the vultures away.  
           He tries to cry out, but only that PRIMITIVE HISS ERUPTS from 
           his throat.  

           The vultures dance away from his flailing... aren’t willing 
           to give up their meal so easily... dart in for quick attacks 
           on his flesh.  

           Glass grasps a branch... swings at the birds, beating them 
           back.  The vultures give up the battle... fly away.  

           Glass crumbles back to the ground... squints up into the 
           sun... the SILHOUETTES OF THE VULTURES CIRCLING ABOVE HIM... 
           waiting for him to die.    

           Glass looks down to his wounds, again oozing blood.  He 
           reaches for his Possibles bag... gone.  Glass glances 
           around... sees a ridge just a few hundred yards away.  

           At the base of the ridge, a GIANT BOULDER has broken free, 
           creating a partial cave.  Glass starts crawling toward it.  
           And if it’s possible, he looks even closer to death now than 
           when he started this journey.    

           EXT. CAVE - DAY

           No more than ten feet deep, but enough to hide from 
           predators.  Glass drags himself as far back in the recess as 
           he can... collapses against the rock wall.   

           INT. CAVE - DAY

           Glass gathers loose sticks and grass into a small pile... 
           begins sparking rocks together to build a fire.  

           INT. CAVE - LATER

           The fire burns beside Glass, as he TEARS A SINGLE THREAD of 
           cloth from the tattered blanket, then feeds it through a tiny 
           hole in a JAGGED, NEEDLE-SIZED SLIVER OF SHARPENED ROCK... a 
           man-made needle and thread.    

           Glass goes to work on the open wounds of his chest... 
           piercing his skin with the rock... wincing with pain as he 
           tugs the thread through the fresh hole in his skin... pierces 
           the other side of the wound, then pulls the flesh tightly 
           together... before repeating the excruciating process all 
           over again... pierce... pull... pierce... tighten.

GRAND RIVER - NIGHT

           The moon’s glow reflects off the water.  

           INT. CAVE - NIGHT

           ANGLE ON GLASS’ HAND... 

           ...holding a small sharp stone, and SCRATCHING LETTERS INTO 
           THE CAVE’S ROCK WALL.  

           WE PAN DOWN TO THE GROUND... still listening to the 
           SCRATCHING OF THE ROCK as we glide across the dirt... reach 
           the fire... its flame warm and strong.  We TIGHTEN ON THE 
           FIRE, until WE’RE INSIDE IT... and then WE PULL BACK...

           ...and we see the fire has long died away... just black ash.  
           The O.S. SCRATCHING has silenced.  We glide back across the 
           cave floor... to Glass unconscious on the ground.  And above 
           him on the wall, we see what he had been scratching...

           “Robbed and left to die by Fitzgerald and Bridger.  If find 
           eether kill for Hugh Glass”  

           We hold on those words a beat, then...

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY

           DROPS OF RAIN dot the surface.  THUNDER RUMBLES... the rain 
           grows heavier.  

           EXT. CAVE - NIGHT

           Rain pouring... gullies of water run down the ridge, spewing 
           over the mouth of the cave.  But inside, Glass doesn’t 
           stir... lying there just as we last saw him.  

           EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY

           Rain coming down in buckets.  The river’s swollen and 
           flooded... raging.  

           EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT

           Clouds drift across the moon... the storm has ended.
                                                  (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)           EXT. CAVE - DAY

           Sunny and clear.  A rabbit hops along... stops for a moment 
           outside the cave.  Beyond it, Glass is still sprawled on the 
           cave floor... he must be dead.  The rabbit continues on past.  

           INT. CAVE - DAY

           TIGHT ON GLASS’ FACE... as his eyes flutter open.  He stares 
           straight ahead, unmoving.

           EXT. CAVE - DAY

           Glass crawls out of the crevice... shields his eyes from the 
           sun, as he takes in the scene.  

           The river has sunk back to normal, leaving the banks battered 
           and muddy.  The water is thick and brown with all the flooded 
           earth it pulled up.  

           Glass uses all his strength to rise up to his knees, then 
           higher... onto his healthy leg.  He braces himself against a 
           tree.  He’s still crooked and hunched over, but for the first 
           time since the Grizzly attack, he looks more like a man than 
           an animal.  He bends down... picks up a BROKEN TREE BRANCH.  

           EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY

           Glass limps along the bank, TWO BRANCHES ARE SECURED ON EACH 
           SIDE OF HIS LEG WITH LENGTHS OF BLANKET.  A homemade splint.  
           He moves beside the BROWN WATER... along the washed-out area, 
           searching for food.  He grabs some plants... tears them from 
           the ground to chew on the roots.  

           He continues on... spots a DEAD SNAPPING TURTLE drowned in 
           the flood, frozen on its back.  Glass kneels down to pick up 
           the turtle... sniffs it.  As he does, he spots something 
           across the river... a DEER, staring back at him.  

           Glass slowly raises his IMAGINARY RIFLE... takes careful aim 
           at the deer... pulls the trigger. If only he had his Anstadt.  

           But then the deer’s head snaps... to something beyond Glass.  
           Glass follows the animal’s eyes... turns to the ridge... and 
           the FIVE ARIKARA WARRIORS STANDING AT GLASS’ CAVE.  

           Glass drops flat to the ground behind a tree uprooted in the 
           flood.  He looks back across the river... THE DEER IS LONG 
           GONE.  
           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                      (cid:13)           Glass inches his head up over the tree... to the warriors now 
           crouched outside the cave... studying the tracks.  

           Glass’ eyes jump to the soft dirt along the river... HIS 
           FOOTPRINTS CLEAR... an obvious trail leading right to him.  
           He throws a glance around... nowhere to run even if he could.  
           So he starts backing into the river on his stomach... feet-
           first... dragging a small branch over the tracks around him, 
           wiping them away as he moves.  And his eyes are locked on the 
           Arikara... watching to see if they spot him.   

           But they haven’t yet, and Glass keeps sliding backward... 
           five feet off shore... only three feet deep in the murky 
           water and sludge.  But if he goes any further, the current 
           will catch him... pull him into the next set of violent 
           rapids... and make him a clear target.  

           The Arikara follow the tracks down from the cave.

           Glass sinks neck-deep into the water... the Arikara keep 
           coming... near the river. So Glass drops beneath the surface.

                                                       CUT TO:

           UNDERWATER - 

           And Glass’ eyes spread wide... searching the muddy water.  He 
           grabs a LARGE ROCK... rolls onto his back, and places the 
           rock on his stomach, its weight holding him firmly to the 
           river bottom.  

           EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY

           ANGLE ON THE ARIKARA WARRIORS... following Glass’ tracks to 
           the edge of the river... looking out over the brown river.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           UNDERWATER - 

           Glass pressing his head back against the bottom... staring up 
           through the cloudy water... to the FIVE SHADOWS STANDING ONLY 
           A FEW FEET AWAY.    

           EXT. GRAND RIVER - CONTINUOUS

           The Arikara... unknowingly standing just above Glass... 
           looking back to the tracks... scanning the water.  But the 
           surface is empty, and the river’s too thick with mud to see 
           anything below.  
           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)           But they keep looking... and we’re waiting for Glass to 
           explode from the river, gasping for air.  But he doesn’t... 
           and they keep scanning for what seems an eternity, until 
           finally, the warriors turn... start walking back up the path.

           Behind them, Glass’ face inches to the surface... pulls in 
           some oxygen... watches as they fade into the trees.  

           Then Glass rolls the rock away... starts moving deeper into 
           the river... fighting the current to grab rocks and 
           boulders... pulling himself to the other side.  

           EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY

           Glass limps through the trees, still dripping with the muddy 
           water of the Grand.   

           EXT. WILDERNESS - LATER

           Glass is on his knees, desperately grabbing for a TINY FIELD 
           MOUSE.  The rodent escapes into a hole.  Glass claws at the 
           ground after it.  He’s starving to death.  

           EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT

           The rain beating down through the trees.  Glass huddles in a 
           cluster of bushes, trying to stay dry... shivering in the 
           cold.  He reaches out from the cover, grabbing his moccasin 
           boot standing in the rain.  He pulls it in... slurps back the 
           rainfall that it’s caught.   

           EXT. PRAIRIE - EVENING

           Glass limps slowly across the rolling prairie.  He’s weak... 
           starving... isn’t going to make it much further.  He drops to 
           his hands and knees.    

           And then he feels something... the ground almost trembling 
           under his hands.  He watches his hands quiver with vibration.  
           A RUMBLE BUILDS.  Glass strains to hear... looks to the crest 
           of a hill... labors up the gentle slope toward the sound.  

           EXT. PRAIRIE/HILL - EVENING

           Glass reaches the crest... looks over the other side to a 
           HERD OF BUFFALO THUNDERING ACROSS THE PRAIRIE.  
                                                            (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)           An incredible site... hundreds of massive creatures... their 
           hooves tearing up the earth, leaving a cloud of dust behind 
           them.  The animals are galloping back and forth... and then 
           we see why.  A PACK OF FIVE WOLVES are hunting among them.  

           Glass watches the wolves race among the massive animals... 
           ducking and dodging, until they surround a lone buffalo, and 
           drive it from the others.  

           The buffalo twists and turns, trying to get back to its herd, 
           but the wolves close in... attack with power and speed... one 
           wolf leaping onto the buffalo’s back... others going after 
           its legs... taking the mighty animal down.  And then it’s a 
           frenzy, as the wolves swarm in for the kill.  

           Glass lies in the high grass, watching the wolves SNARL AND 
           SNAP over the remains.  And he eyes that buffalo... the 
           closest he’s been to food in days.  

           EXT. PLAINS - NIGHT

           The five wolves rest around the downed buffalo, their snouts 
           bloody from the meal.  Suddenly, one of the wolves’ heads 
           snaps up... bares its teeth... SNARLS.       

           And then we see what the wolf is growling at... Glass... 
           limping out of the shadows toward the animals, holding a 
           BURNING SAGE BUSH IN EACH HAND... like giant FLAMING HANDS 
           clawing in the night.   

           The wolves jump to their feet, unsure of what’s approaching.  
           They growl at Glass.  But Glass keeps coming... doing his 
           best to YELL... more like GROWL back at the wolves.  He 
           swings the flaming brush, tossing glowing sparks through the 
           air.      

           The wolves spread out, instinctively surrounding Glass.  But 
           Glass singles out each one... charges, waving the flames... 
           driving each wolf back.  

           Four of the wolves back away, but the leader holds its 
           ground... even moves toward Glass... only a few feet away... 
           SNARLING... bloody jaws ready to attack, but still not sure 
           what its up against.  

           Glass shakes the flames at the wolf... it SNAPS AT GLASS’ 
           ARM.  Glass swings the other... slams the fiery plant across 
           the wolf’s head.  

           The wolf YELPS... leaps back... starts to run away, but turns 
           back... makes another charge at Glass.  But Glass is ready... 
                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                               (cid:13)           throws the flaming ball of sage at the wolf, then clubs it 
           with the other.  The animal’s fur begins to burn.  

           The frightened wolf has had enough... rolls on the ground, 
           then spins to join the rest of its pack.  They run a safe 
           distance, then stop... keeping a watch on Glass.  

           Glass drags the burning sage bushes along the ground, 
           igniting the grass and brush... creating a foot-high flaming 
           wall between him and the wolves.  

           He stretches the flame into a circle, a fiery ring surrounds 
           the fallen buffalo.  

           The wolves have seen enough... turn... race away from the 
           flames.  

           As the grass around him burns, Glass drops the sage plants... 
           attacks the buffalo remains, tearing away bloody chunks of 
           flesh from the carcass, and shoving them into his mouth... a 
           starving animal that’s finally found food.    

           EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

           From high above the prairie... Glass and the buffalo at the 
           center of that glowing ring of fire.  

           EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

           The wind’s gusting... bending the high golden grass over on 
           its side.  Glass moves slowly across, pulling his collar up 
           to shield his face from the cold winds.  He spots something 
           in the distant sky ahead... a THIN LINE OF BLACK SMOKE.  
           Glass picks up his pace... hope spurring him on.  

           EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - DAY

           The charred, skeletal remains of a tribe’s village... just 
           black posts where tee-pees once stood... a half-burned log 
           lodge still smokes, sending that black line into the sky.

           Glass limps through the graveyard of structures... all signs 
           of life in this village long gone.  He searches a basket... 
           pulls out a BLANKET... wraps it around his shoulders.  

           INT. LODGE - DAY

           Glass steps into the smoky warmth of the lodge... black and 
           empty.  He slides down to the floor... unwraps strips of 
           roasted buffalo from what’s left of his blanket. 
                                                          (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                             (cid:13)           He starts to take a bite, when SOMETHING DARTS PAST THE 
           DOORWAY TO THE BACK ROOM.  The O.S. SHUFFLING OF FEET.       

           Glass freezes... he isn’t alone.  He rises... grabs a 
           splintered post like a spear... eases toward the doorway... 
           raises the post to swing...  

           ...and sees the SMALL PUPPY standing in the back room.  The 
           dog takes off around a crumbled wall.  Glass follows it.

           INT. LODGE/BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Glass limps across the room... turns the corner of the 
           crumbled wall... and sees the dog slide to a stop beside an 
           ANCIENT ARIKARA SQUAW, huddled in the corner, her bony arms 
           outstretched in front of her in weak defense.  And her eyes 
           are SOLID WHITE... the old woman is blind.  She CRIES OUT A 
           CHANT over and over... her death chant, as she waits for this 
           stranger to kill her.  

           Glass stands frozen... confused.  He tries to speak, but his 
           throat still won’t let him.  He crouches down in front of the 
           old woman... reaches for her hand, but she flails him away.  
           He grabs her again... gently... just holds it until she 
           calms... studying the woman... her hollow face all skin and 
           bones... she’s obviously dying.  

           He pulls the strip of buffalo meat from his pocket... pushes 
           it into the squaw’s hand.  She immediately jerks it to her 
           mouth... and that’s when Glass sees the WOMAN HAS NO TEETH... 
           she can’t eat.      

           Glass turns to an old pot tipped over on the floor.  

           EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - DAY

           Glass carries the pot toward a nearby stream.  The dog 
           scurries out behind him... follows Glass to the water.   

           INT. LODGE/BACK ROOM - DAY

           The pot boils over burning logs.  Glass dips a cup in, 
           pulling out a warm broth.  He carries it to the squaw, still 
           sitting in the corner... takes her hand, placing the cup in 
           it for her.  She gulps the liquid back.    

           Glass goes back to refill the cup.  The old woman MUMBLES 
           SOMETHING we can’t understand... over and over, as Glass 
           brings the cup back to her.  He tries to ease it into her 
           hand, but the woman pushes it away... 
           (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)           slides her hand up Glass’ arm to his face... patting it... 
           MUMBLING THOSE SAME WORDS... thanking Glass.   

           EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - EVENING

           Glass carries several blankets toward the lodge.  The puppy 
           trails behind him, biting at one of the corners... hanging on 
           as Glass pulls him across the dirt.  

           INT. LODGE - EVENING

           Glass enters the back room with the blankets... stops when he 
           sees the old woman slumped over to the floor, her white eyes 
           frozen open in a lifeless stare.  

           EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - NIGHT

           Glass has stacked several burned posts into a crude pyre at 
           the edge of the village.  The squaw lies atop the pyre, 
           covered in the blankets he gathered for her.  Glass stands 
           beside the pyre, a FLAMING TORCH in his hand.  The puppy 
           rests at his feet.  

           EXT. DISTANT RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           THREE INDIANS sit on horseback, watching Glass light the 
           pyre... the flames rise into the night.

           EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - NIGHT

           Glass crouches... pets the dog, as he watches the flames 
           spread... engulf the woman.  

           ANGLE ON THE GLOWING EMBERS...

           ...floating into the night.  Beyond the sparks, we see 
           something else... THOSE THREE INDIANS GALLOPING TOWARD THE 
           VILLAGE... FAST.    

           And now Glass sees them too... knows it’s too late to run, so 
           he just stands there.  But the dog’s seen enough... darts 
           away.  

           Glass watches the Indians ride into the village... their 
           braided hair and dress is different than the Arikara we’ve 
           seen earlier, because these are SIOUX WARRIORS, and Glass 
           knows it.  
           (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                      (cid:13)                         (cid:13)           The Sioux surround Glass on horseback... stare down at Glass.  
           The lead warrior (YELLOW HORSE), (30’s), poised and strong, 
           points to the flaming pyre... says something to Glass.     

           Glass tries to answer... can’t... touches his scarred throat.  
           Yellow Horse slides gracefully off his horse.  The other two 
           warriors, (THREE FEATHERS and RUNNING FOX) do the same... 
           close in on Glass.  

           Glass stands firm.  Yellow Horse says something else to him.  
           Again, Glass touches his throat... holds his jacket out from 
           his sides... no weapons.  Yellow Horse studies Glass hard... 
           reaches out, wiping his finger down Glass’ cheek, almost 
           testing to see if the color comes off.  

           One of the other warriors pats Glass’ hair... smiles... says 
           something to the others.  Yellow Horse and the other warrior 
           join him, each touching Glass’ hair.     

           Then Yellow Horse spots Glass’ necklace... the grizzly claw 
           hanging from it.  He examines the enormous claw, then nods to 
           Glass’ stitching and scars.  

                                 YELLOW HORSE
                        Griz-lee.  

           Glass hears the familiar word... nods.  Three Feathers pulls 
           a WHITE SPECK from the back of Glass’ neck... holds it up to 
           Yellow Horse.   

           Yellow Horse jerks out his knife.  Glass is confused... holds 
           up his hand, as he takes a step back.  But Three Feathers and 
           Running Fox grab Glass... secure him... pull his jacket down 
           off his shoulders, exposing his shirt, as Yellow Horse walks 
           around behind Glass... raises the knife... Glass GROWLS A 
           PLEA... but Yellow Horse slices the knife down Glass’ back... 
           just cutting open his shirt... and revealing a MASS OF WHITE 
           WORMS... MAGGOTS... COVERING THE DEEP GASHES ON GLASS’ BACK.     

           The three warriors exchange glances... they’ve obviously 
           never seen anything like this.  Glass sees their reaction... 
           throws a nervous glance... what?  

           Three Feathers runs his hand across Glass’ back, dragging a 
           HANDFUL OF WORMS for Glass to see.   As Glass’ eyes widen in 
           panic, Yellow Horse SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS KNIFE against 
           Glass’ head.

           The world goes dark.  
                                                                 (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)           EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - NIGHT

           Dozens of glowing campfires dot the prairie, along with a sea 
           of tee-pees, their willow poles fanning against the night 
           sky.  Animal hides and painted designs decorate the various 
           tee-pees and lodges.  SIOUX CHILDREN laugh and play about the 
           village... freeze when they hear Yellow Horse and the other 
           riders splash across the stream.    

           The warriors ride into the village, Glass’ body tossed over 
           the back of Three Feather’s horse. The children race to them.    

           ANGLE ON GLASS... regaining consciousness... eyes blinking... 
           trying to focus.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           GLASS’ POV - FROM THE BACK OF THE HORSE...

           ...to the children’s eager faces swarming around him... 
           studying this strange face.

           YELLOW HORSE - YELLING SOMETHING at the children... they back 
           away from Glass... fall into line behind the riders.  

           Sioux MEN and WOMEN watch as the procession moves past... to 
           a tee-pee set away from the rest... its hide walls decorated 
           with wild lightning bolts and buffalo and vaguely human 
           figures circling the sun.  

           An OLD MEDICINE MAN, gnarled and leathery, a DEAD RAVEN tied 
           in his long hair, his naked chest painted with red and black 
           stripes, steps out of the tee-pee.  He eyes Glass, as Three 
           Feathers and Running Fox carry him inside.   

           Suddenly, the Medicine Man begins CHANTING.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           A FLURRY OF IMAGES ACCOMPANIED BY THE MEDICINE MAN’S V.O. 
           CHANTING...

           LEATHER STRAPS SNAPPING AROUND GLASS’ WRISTS AND ANKLES... 
           stretched tight.

           Glass, naked, on his stomach at the center of the tee-pee, 
           his arms and legs outstretched, secured to wooden stakes in 
           the ground.  The white worms cover his back.  
                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                             (cid:13)           The Medicine Man... CHANTING... waving burning sticks in the 
           air.

           A THICK LIQUID BOILING IN A POT... the Medicine Man’s twisted 
           hand reaching a gourd container in... filling it with the 
           steaming mixture.  

           The liquid POURING OVER GLASS’ BACK.

           GLASS’ FACE... arched to the sky... twisted in horrible pain.  
           He SCREAMS THAT HORRIBLE GROWLING CRY.

           MORE IMAGES... even faster... the CHANTING more frantic...

           A SIOUX WOMAN,(WAKI), staring down.

           HANDS wiping a GREEN SLUDGE over Glass’ neck... chest.  

           The Medicine Man dancing... chanting... shaking sticks lined 
           with RATTLESNAKE TAILS. 

           The moonlight shining through the tee-pee, illuminating the 
           images of the buffalo and dancing shapes.   

           Waki gently pouring fluid into Glass’ mouth. 

           The Medicine Man holding the SEVERED HEAD OF A SNAKE... 
           lightly sinking the fangs around the wounds on Glass’ throat.  

           GLASS’ EYES... wide open... rolling up white into his head.

           AND THE CHANTING STOPS... the world goes dark.

           EXT. YELLOWSTONE RIVER - DAY

           Cutting through the open prairie.  Snow-covered peaks touch 
           the sky in the distance.  

           Fitzgerald and Bridger trudge their way across the prairie, 
           dressed in furs.  They rise up a steep slope... reach the 
           top, and spot the cluster of log buildings inside a massive 
           thirty-foot tall wooden fence.  Fort Union.  

           Bridger smiles... relieved.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        ‘Bout goddamn time.  

           They start down the slope.  Fitzgerald grabs Bridger’s arm... 
           firmly.  
                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        And we’re understood on 
                        everything... Glass’ dyin’ in his 
                        sleep... us buryin’ him like was 
                        agreed.  

           Bridger doesn’t respond.  Fitzgerald doesn’t like that.  

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        You’re as guilty as me in leavin’ 
                        him.  Don’t you forget that.  You 
                        got a future up here.  No sense 
                        tossin’ it away when he was as good 
                        as dead already.  Shit, all we did 
                        was skip the funeral.  

           Bridger pulls his arm free... continues on.  

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        I won’t take to givin’ up that two-
                        hundred on accounta you gettin’ 
                        weak-kneed.   

           Bridger keeps walking.  Fitzgerald follows behind.  

           INT. FORT UNION - DAY

           Like a small town surrounded by a log wall.  The main TRADING 
           POST BUILDING is busy... TRAPPERS, SIOUX, all with things to 
           trade.  But most of the life is in the FORT UNION SALOON next 
           door... crowded with customers downstairs, and just as busy 
           in the whores’ rooms upstairs.    

           A small village of tents rests off to the side of the 
           buildings, holding the overflow of traffic.  

           INT. SALOON - DAY

           Fitzgerald and Bridger enter the crowded room... squeeze 
           their way to the bar.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Twice the folks here than when we 
                        left.    

                                 BRIDGER
                        We should go see Captain Henry.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Far as we hiked... we got time for 
                        a drink on the company’s tab.  
                                (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                 PIG (O.S.)
                        Jim!  

           They spin... see Pig, Murphy and Stubby Bill sitting at a 
           table.  Pig scrambles up... rushes to Bridger, locking him in 
           a big bear hug.  

                                 PIG (cont’d)
                        You made it!  I was scared the ‘Ree 
                        mighta caught up to ya.     

                                 FITZGERALD
                        If your fat ass could get through, 
                        we didn’t have no worries.  

           Pig glares at Fitzgerald... watches him walk to the table, 
           joining the others.  

                                 PIG
                         (off Fitzgerald, to 
                          Bridger)
                        Had to be a helluva long walk for 
                        you.  

           Bridger nods... Pig has no idea.  

                                 PIG (cont’d)
                        Hugh?  

           Bridger hesitates a beat, then just shakes his head.  

                                 PIG (cont’d)
                        Guess we all knowed how it would 
                        turn out.  Did he suffer much more?  

           Another long beat, then...

                                 BRIDGER
                        I hope not.  

           A PROSTITUTE walks down the stairs... stops on the landing,  
           waiting for her next customer.  Fitzgerald spots her... 
           grins.    

                                 FITZGERALD 
                         (to Bridger)
                        Maybe we best go see Henry, kid.  I 
                        just got a itch to spend the first 
                        of my two-hundred.

           The other men laugh.  Not Bridger.  
                                           (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)           INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - DAY

           Henry sits at his desk.  Fitzgerald and Bridger stand across 
           from him.  The others... Pig, Anderson, Murphy, and Stubby 
           Bill crowd the room behind them.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        I won’t pretend to been his friend, 
                        but I respect any man that fights 
                        the way he done. 

                                 HENRY
                        And the grave?  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        We had those extra days so we went 
                        deeper... covered it in rocks.  To 
                        keep the scavengers off him.    

                                 HENRY
                        Any sign of hostiles?  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Not a one.  

           The words are like a punch in the gut to Bridger.  He can’t 
           take the pain... opens his mouth to speak, but Fitzgerald 
           beats him to it.  

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        Truth is, I was worried ‘bout ‘Ree, 
                        and ready to get movin’, but 
                        Bridger here argued to stay and 
                        make a cross for the grave.  

           Bridger’s head snaps to Fitzgerald... don’t make this worse.  

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        So that’s what we did.  

           Pig reaches up... gives Bridger a pat on the back.  But to 
           Bridger, it feels like a red-hot blade.  

                                 HENRY
                        Glad to hear you pulled your 
                        weight, Mr. Bridger.  I knew you 
                        would.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        More than his share, Captain.  
                                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)           And now Fitzgerald has snared Bridger into his lie.  Bridger 
           drops his eyes to his feet.  

                                 HENRY
                        Speaking of shares.  

           Henry turns to a SAFE resting against the wall.  Fitzgerald 
           watches as Henry spins the dial... locks in the combination, 
           then pulls the latch.  The safe door swings open...  

           ...revealing STACKS OF CASH.  

           Fitzgerald’s eyes lock on all that money.  Henry pulls out a 
           handful... starts counting them out onto the desk.  

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        Am I to assume the agreed 
                        arrangement didn’t change?  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Fortunate for me, it did not.  

                                 HENRY
                        Well thank you both for your 
                        courage and honor.  You have done 
                        yourselves proud.  

           Fitzgerald swipes up his pile of bills.  Henry drops a couple 
           bills in front of Bridger.  

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        You’re owed something for what you 
                        did.  

           Bridger stares down at the bills a beat, then turns... pushes 
           his way out of the office.  Henry looks to Fitzgerald.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        He’s beat hisself up most of the 
                        trip... wishin’ he’da done more.  

                                 HENRY
                        We all saw the shape Glass was in.  
                        There was no more to be done.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        That’s what I been tellin’ him.  
                                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)           INT. BUNKHOUSE - DAY

           Empty, except for Bridger curled up on his cot, sobbing.  

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. TEE-PEE - DAY

           Glass sleeps under a buffalo robe.  His eyes flicker open.  

                                                       CUT TO:(cid:13)

           GLASS’ POV - ON THE BUFFALO AND DANCING FIGURE DESIGNS 
           SHADOWED THROUGH THE TEE-PEE.  

           GLASS - His hand reaching up to his throat.  It looks much 
           better than we last saw.  And the stitches are gone from his 
           face, now just long, pink scars.  He stiffly raises himself 
           up... remembers his back...  struggles to reach behind him... 
           scarred but clean... no maggots.     

           He looks beside him... sees BUCKSKIN PANTS AND SHIRT resting 
           on the ground... waiting for him.   

           EXT. TEE-PEE - DAY

           ANGLE ON GLASS... dressed... pushing his way out through the 
           flap of the tee-pee... limping out into the midday sun, and 
           shielding his eyes.  He looks like a man that hasn’t seen the 
           light of day for weeks.  

           Glass adjusts to the brightness... stares in wonder at the 
           scene.    

           And then we see what Glass is looking at, and understand his 
           reaction... the entire village is blanketed in snow.  The 
           Sioux VILLAGERS move about, wearing heavy skins and furs.  

           A WOMEN’S O.S. VOICE turns Glass... 

           ...to WAKI, the woman from the images, walking toward him, 
           bundled in fur. She says something else we can’t 
           understand... points to Glass’ feet.  Glass looks down... to 
           his BARE FEET BURIED DEEP IN THE SNOW.  He hadn’t noticed.    

           And then Waki smiles... a sweet, pretty smile.  She takes his 
           hand... leads him back into the tee-pee.  
                                 (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)           INT. TEE-PEE - CONTINUOUS

           Glass and Waki enter.  She pulls a pair of moccasins from a 
           basket... hands them to Glass.  

           He slips them on, then presses his fingers against his 
           throat... almost trying to hold it all inside to make it 
           work, then...  

                                 GLASS
                         (scratching and rough)
                        Thank you.  

           Waki doesn’t understand... just raises a cup of liquid... 
           says something, then touches his throat... motions for him to 
           drink.  Glass sips the drink... grimaces... shakes his head, 
           trying to give the cup back, but Waki refuses... points at 
           his throat, and motions for him to drink.  Glass stares in 
           the cup a beat, then gulps it back... shakes his head.

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        Bad medicine.  

           Waki smiles... hands him his BEAR CLAW NECKLACE.  Glass nods 
           in thanks, then achingly lifts his arms up to slip it over 
           his head.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        How long have I been here?  

           Waki just stares back... no idea what Glass said.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        You’re Sioux.  I only know a bit a 
                        Pawnee.  

           Glass stumbles through a sentence of Pawnee.  Waki shakes her 
           head... throws a jumble of Sioux back at him.       

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        The snow... my healin’.  
                         (points to himself)
                        Me.  
                         (points to the ground)
                        Here.  How long?  

           Waki shakes her head again.  Glass leads her outside.  
                                           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)

SIOUX VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Glass points to the sun overhead, then raises both hands, 
           fingers outstretched.  

                                 GLASS 
                        How many suns?  Ten?  

           Waki studies Glass... the sun... begins to understand.  She 
           nods... SAYS A WORD... holds up all ten of her fingers.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        Ten suns?

           Then Waki closes her hands into fists... opens them again... 
           closes them again... SAYS A DIFFERENT WORD.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        Christ.     

           Glass glances around... for the first time, notices Sioux MEN 
           and WOMEN staring at him.  Children freeze in the middle of 
           their play... all eyes locked on Glass.  TWO SMALL BOYS, (NEW 
           MOON and LITTLE ONE), repeat the same TWO WORDS to each 
           other... 

                                 BOYS
                        Tatanka Wicasa. 

           ...over and over.   

           Glass stares back, unsure.  Then...

                                 YELLOW HORSE (O.S.)
                        Buff-A-lo Man.  

           Glass turns... sees Yellow Horse stepping out of a tee-pee.  

                                 YELLOW HORSE (cont’d)
                         (very broken english)
                        What call you.
                         (points to Glass’ hair)
                        Fur of Buff-A-lo.  

           Glass touches his hair... nods... smiles.  The children smile 
           and laugh now too... repeat the words LOUDER.  

                                 GLASS
                        You speak English.  

                                 YELLOW HORSE

                        Well I’m grateful for you bringing 
                        me here... havin’ them care for me.   
                         (off Yellow Horse’s nod)
                        Now if you could point me which way 
                        it is you do your tradin’... with 
                        the whites. 

                                 YELLOW HORSE
                         (points)
                        Whites.  Bra-zo.  

                                 GLASS
                        Fort Brazeau?  That’s where I’m 
                        tryin’ to get. Is it far from here?  

           Yellow Horse doesn’t understand.  Glass motions into the 
           distance.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        Far?  Long way?  

           Yellow Horse points to a horse, then holds up three fingers.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        Three days on horse?  

           Yellow Horse nods... looks to Glass’ leg, and shakes his 
           head.  

                                 YELLOW HORSE
                        No walk.  Hides soon.    

           Glass doesn’t understand... until Yellow Horse points to a 
           ROW OF BUFFALO HIDES hanging from a line.  

                                 YELLOW HORSE (cont’d)
                        We trade Bra-zo.      

           Glass stares at the tanning hides, then down at his leg.  
           Finally, he nods.  Yellow Horse starts walking... waves for 
           Glass to follow.    

                                 YELLOW HORSE (cont’d)
                        Come. Eat.  

           Yellow Horse pantomimes putting food into his mouth.  Glass 
           follows after him.  The children sneak in behind them, 
           giggling as they tail Glass across camp.    

           Glass glances back... New Moon and Little One duck behind a 
           tee-pee... wait for him to continue before they scoot back 
           out after him.

CHIEF’S LODGE - NIGHT

           Glass, Yellow Horse, Three Feathers, Running Fox and OTHER 
           WARRIORS sit around a fire, eating with CHIEF RED HAWK, the 
           Medicine Man, and several other TRIBAL ELDERS.     

                                 GLASS
                        The men stole my rifle.    

           The Sioux don’t understand.  Glass reaches over, taking 
           Yellow Horse’s plate.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        They took.  They took...

           Glass aims an imaginary rifle.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        ...my rifle.  My gear.  

           Now Yellow Horse understands... translates for the others.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        They left me to die.  So I mean to 
                        find ‘em both.  Get my rifle back.     

           Yellow Horse translates again.  Red Hawk nods, studying 
           Glass.  

           Red Hawk SAYS SOMETHING to Glass... motions to the BEAR CLAW 
           NECKLACE.  Glass looks to Yellow Horse.  

                                 YELLOW HORSE
                        Red Hawk ask who kill griz-lee.  

           Glass touches his chest.  Red Hawk nods, impressed.  Glass 
           points to the JAGGED SCARS running up Red Hawk’s neck to a 
           MISSING RIGHT EAR.  

                                 GLASS
                        Grizzly?  

           Red Hawk smiles... shakes his head.

                                 RED HAWK
                        Arikara.  

           That word, Glass understands.  Red Hawk rambles a long 
           sentence in Sioux.  The other members LAUGH.          
                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                 YELLOW HORSE 
                        He say Arikara take right ear of 
                        Sioux.  Left ear of whites.  Not 
                        know what they take from you.  

           Glass smiles along with the others. They continue their meal.  

           INT. TEE-PEE - NIGHT

           Glass enters... sees Waki sitting on the ground, waiting for 
           him.  A BOWL OF GREEN OINTMENT rests in her lap.  

                                 GLASS
                        Hello.  

           Waki nods... stands... motions from the bowl to Glass’ shirt.  
           It takes a moment for Glass to understand, but then he 
           nods... removes his shirt. 

           Waki pushes Glass down to his knees... moves behind him, 
           gently rubbing the ointment over the scars on his back.  
           Glass looks to the tee-pee flap... the adorable faces of New 
           Moon and Little One peering inside at him.    

           Glass smiles... waves them in.  The little boys exchange a 
           glance, then slide into the tee-pee.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        I’m Glass.  

           The boys just stare at him.  Glass taps his chest.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        Glass.  

           Glass points to the boys, his eyes asking them their names.  

                                 NEW MOON
                        Mimiteh.  

                                 GLASS
                        Mi-mi-ta.

           New Moon nods.  Glass looks to the nervous, silent Little 
           One.  New Moon nudges him.

                                 LITTLE ONE
                        Ayasha.  

                                 GLASS
                        Hello, A-ya-sha.    
                                            (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)           Waki smiles at the boys nervousness... moves around Glass... 
           crouches down to apply the ointment to his throat.  Glass 
           points to her.   

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        You?  Name?  

                                 WAKI
                        Waki.  

                                 GLASS
                         (nods)
                        Waki.  Nice name.    

           The little boys watch intently, as Waki covers Glass’ scars 
           with the ointment.  Then she hands him another cup of liquid.  
           Glass frowns... shakes his head.  Waki forces the cup into 
           his hand.  Glass holds it out for the little boys, but they 
           both just grin and shake their heads, as they step away from 
           the cup... both know better.  

           Then Glass offers the drink back to Waki.  She laughs... 
           shoves it away.  Glass rolls his eyes to the boys, then gulps 
           the drink down... makes a horrible face, as if he’s going to 
           throw up... maybe even die.    

           New Moon and Little One burst into laughter.  Even Waki joins 
           in, as she goes back to tending to Glass’ scars.  While she 
           does, New Moon reaches up... squeezes Glass’ hair.   

                                 NEW MOON
                        Tatanka Wicasa.  

           Little One joins in.  Glass just smiles along.  

                                 GLASS
                        Tatanka Wicasa.

           EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - DAY

           Snow falls over Glass, as he stands outside the tee-pee, 
           flexing his once-broken leg... putting more weight on it... 
           testing its recovered strength. 

           Suddenly, a SPEAR PLANTS INTO THE GROUND BETWEEN THEM.  Glass 
           turns, startled... sees Yellow Bear, Three Feathers, Running 
           Fox, and several OTHER WARRIORS staring down at them.    

           Glass’ eyes jump from the spear to the warriors, unsure.  And 
           then a smile spreads across Yellow Horse’s face... he tosses 
           a HEAVY BUFFALO HIDE to Glass.    
                                             (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                 YELLOW HORSE
                        Buff-A-lo Man hunt?  

           Glass relaxes... nods... pulls the spear from the snow.  

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           A world of silent white... like we’re inside a giant snow-
           globe.  The sky is emptying all the snow it has over us... 
           pouring down... the only sound comes from the flakes hitting 
           the already fallen snow.  The pale trunks of Cottonwoods rise 
           up from the white ground.  

           Then out of the white... a SHAPE APPEARS... a GIANT WOLF 
           WALKING ON ITS HIND LEGS.  But as the wolf comes closer, we 
           see it’s not a wolf at all... it’s THREE FEATHERS, wearing 
           his WOLF SKIN.  He CRIES OUT... HOWLING WILDLY.    

           A few yards beside him, another WARRIOR is doing the same... 
           CHANTING... beating his spear against the Cottonwoods as he 
           walks.  

           GLASS - WEARING THE BUFFALO HIDE... 

           ...walking slowly through the trees, carrying the spear.  
           Yellow Bear is beside him... motions for Glass to spread out.

           FROM ABOVE THE TREES...

           ...we see the fur-covered warriors are formed into a wide 
           circle... and slowly converging... YELLING... pounding their 
           spears... making as much noise as possible, as they tighten 
           their ring.  

           POV FROM THE BRUSH...

           ...watching DISTANT CHANTING WARRIORS pushing through the 
           trees.  V.O. SNORTING... our POV darts sideways... charges 
           through the brush... slides to a stop when we see Running Fox 
           moving toward us... spins back another direction.     

           GLASS - MOVING THROUGH THE FOREST...

           ...the falling snow clinging to his face... covering the 
           buffalo hide.  

           And then a MASSIVE SHAPE BLASTS through the trees ahead of 
           him.  Glass freezes, his grip tightening on the spear.  
                                           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)           He looks to Yellow Horse, who nods... YELLS OUT, beating his 
           spear against the trees, and motioning for Glass to do the 
           same. 

           Glass is apprehensive at first... just lightly tapping his 
           spear.  But as the other warriors’ chants grow, Glass gets 
           caught up in the hunt... begins beating the trees... YELLING 
           as loud as his throat will allow.  

           THE WARRIORS - EYES PIERCING THROUGH THE SNOW... CHANTING... 
           BEATING THE BUSHES.  

           OUR LOW POV AGAIN - RACING CHAOTICALLY THROUGH THE BRUSH... 

           ...to Yellow Horse waving his spear... back over the snow... 
           to Three Feathers SCREAMING... we spin again... crash through 
           bushes, then suddenly TUMBLE... DROP THROUGH THE SNOW.  

           GLASS - HEARING THE ANIMAL’S WAIL...

           ...seeing Yellow Horse pick up his pace... start trotting 
           forward.  Glass does the same... all the hunters converging 
           around a LARGE BLACK HOLE IN THE SNOW... 

           ...and the ELK trapped at the bottom.  

           The warriors cry out victoriously... begin DRIVING THEIR 
           SPEARS INTO THE TRAP, killing the animal.  

           EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - EVENING

           The elk roasts over a fire at the center of the village.  
           Glass sits alone outside the tee-pee, using the sharp tip of 
           the spear to carve into a small chunk of wood.  

           As he carves, New Moon and Little One sneak around the tee-
           pee behind him... watch Glass work.  Glass hears them 
           GIGGLING... doesn’t react... just keeps carving... tilts the 
           long handle of the spear as he works, tapping the side of the 
           tee-pee, and SHAKING LOOSE A CLUMP OF SNOW DOWN ONTO THE 
           BOYS.  

           The shocked boys freeze in the cold... wipe the snow from 
           their faces to see Glass grinning at them.  The little boys 
           charge Glass, leaping onto him.  
                                             (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                      (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                 *(cid:13)

           EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - NIGHT

           Glass stands at the edge of the village, carving at the wood 
           with the spear tip, and watching the Sioux from a distance.  
           Yellow Bear sees him... approaches, carrying his SON on his 
           shoulders.  The little boy gnaws on a strip of meat.  

           Yellow Horse holds out a bowl of food to Glass.  

                                 GLASS
                        Thank you.  

                                 YELLOW HORSE
                        Good hunt.  

                                 GLASS
                        Yes.  

           Glass smiles up at Yellow Horse’s son.  

                                 YELLOW HORSE
                        You.  Fam-i-lee?  

                                 GLASS
                         (shakes his head)
                        No.  

                                 YELLOW HORSE
                        No wom-an?  
                         (pointing to son)
                        Wakayaja?

           A long beat, then...

                                 GLASS
                        No.  Not for a long time. 

           Glass continues eating... watches Yellow Horse bounce the 
           giggling little boy on his shoulders.   

           EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - DAY

           Glass steps out of his tee-pee, whittling with the spear tip.
           He glances up... freezes because he sees several Sioux 
           pulling the hides from the line... rolling them to carry.  

                                 YELLOW HORSE
                                         (O.S.)

           Bra-zo.  
                                      (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                          (cid:13)           Glass turns to Yellow Horse, pointing to the hides.  Glass 
           nods... looks back to the last of the hides being pulled 
           down... doesn’t seem as excited as he once might have been.  

           EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - LATER

           Yellow Horse and Three Feathers sit atop their horses.  Three 
           Feathers holds the reins to another horse packed with hides.  
           An empty horse stands beside them... waiting for Glass.  

           Glass is leaning over to New Moon and Little One... handing 
           them the CRUDE BUFFALO CARVING he made from the wood.  

                                 GLASS
                         (taps his chest)
                        Tatanka Wicasa.

           The little boys smile.  Glass nods to Waki.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        Thank you.  

                 nods... gives Glass a gentle hug he wasn’t expecting.  
           Waki
           It takes a moment for his arms to return it.  Then Glass 
           waves to Red Hawk and the Medicine Man. They wave back... 
           watch Glass climb onto his horse.   

           Glass, Yellow Horse and Three Feathers ride out of the 
           village.  

           EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY

           Glass, Yellow Horse and Three Feathers ride along a high 
           ridge, surrounded by empty snow-covered wilderness.  They 
           have the world to themselves.   

           EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

           Glass crouches over a shallow, five-foot long hole surrounded 
           by deep snow.  The hole is filled with small fires and rocks.  
           And he’s watching Yellow Horse and Three Feathers tossing 
           rocks into their own matching holes, then dragging the dirt 
           back into them.  Yellow Horse throws a glance back to Glass, 
           making sure he understands.  

           Glass nods... pulls the dirt back in, covering the flames.  
           He watches Yellow Horse spread a blanket over the warm 
           ground, then does the same.  He sits on the mound of dirt... 
           leans back against a tree... feels the warmth rise up from 
           beneath him.  
           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)           He nods to Yellow Horse, who is already resting under his 
           blanket.  

                                 GLASS
                        Nice.  

                                 YELLOW HORSE
                         (nods)
                        Nice.  

           Glass pulls the buffalo hide around himself... keeping watch. 

                                 YELLOW HORSE (cont’d)
                        Sleep.  No Arikara.  

           Glass nods... but still doesn’t close his eyes.  Yellow Horse 
           tosses his knife over beside Glass.  Glass takes it... nods 
           to Yellow Horse.    

                                 YELLOW HORSE (cont’d)
                        Me sleep.  

           Yellow Horse rolls over, turning his back on Glass... 
           trusting him with the knife.  Three Feathers does the same. 

           Glass just stares out into the night.  

           INT. FORT UNION/BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT

           Dark and quiet... except for the SNORING of a few men.  
           Fitzgerald sleeps on his cot.  A shadow glides across him... 
           hovers over his face.  

           Fitzgerald’s eyes blink open.

                                                       CUT TO:

           FITZGERALD’S POV...

           ...on GLASS STANDING OVER HIM... his scarred face calm and 
           deadly... raising a knife to drive down into Fitzgerald’s 
           chest.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        No... please.  

           But Glass swings the blade.  

                                                       CUT TO:

WILDERNESS - MORNING

           And Yellow Horse shaking Glass awake from his dream.  Glass’ 
           hand flies up, the knife gripped.  But Yellow Horse grabs his 
           arm... stops it in mid-swing... holds it until Glass realizes 
           it was a dream... relaxes.   

                                 YELLOW HORSE
                        We go.  

           Glass calms... nods.

           EXT. FORT BRAZEAU - DAY

           Just a small cluster of log buildings sitting along the banks 
           of the Missouri.  Dozens of tee-pees and tents are set up 
           outside the complex.  

           Glass follows Yellow Horse and Three Feathers into the camp.  
           BEGGING INDIANS and DRUNK TRAPPERS paw at the men as they 
           ride past, pleading for handouts.   

           One of the Indians grabs for the hides.  Three Feathers 
           plants his foot in the Indian’s chest... shoves him back into 
           the snow.    

           They continue on... climb off their horses outside the 
           TRADING POST.  Three Feathers stays to guard the hides, as 
           Yellow Horse and Glass enter.  

           INT. TRADING POST - DAY

           A small, dingy room lined with shelves, all stacked high with 
           pots, pans, dry goods, whiskey, blankets, weapons... anything 
           that can be traded.  KIOWA BRAZEAU, (60’s), French-Canadian, 
           stands behind the counter... looks up when the BELL over the 
           door RINGS... sees Yellow Horse with Glass behind.      

                                 BRAZEAU
                         (thick French accent)
                        Bon jour, Yellow Horse.  You come 
                        with many hides I hope.    
                         (off Yellow Horse’s nod)
                        We make good trades then.  

           Brazeau’s eyes lock on Glass... stares at him, unsure.    

                                 BRAZEAU (cont’d)
                        Monsieur Glass?

                        Good to see you again, Mr. Brazeau.

                                 BRAZEAU 
                        Jesus Christ, what happened to your 
                        goddamned face?  

                                 GLASS
                        Had a tussle with a grizzly.  

           Glass shakes Brazeau’s hand.  Brazeau studies his face... 
           notices the Bear Claw Necklace... smiles.  

                                 BRAZEAU
                        And now the grizzly, he don’t look 
                        so good either, eh?  

           Glass shakes his head.    

                                 BRAZEAU (cont’d)
                         (off Yellow Horse)
                        You run with the Sioux these days?  

                                 GLASS
                        They looked after me for a spell.  
                        I’m on my way to catch back up with 
                        Captain Henry... at Fort Union.  
                        Needed to trade for some supplies 
                        on the Company’s credit if I could.   

                                 BRAZEAU
                        Oui, of course.  Anything you like.  

           Glass pulls down a KENTUCKY LONG RIFLE.

                                 GLASS
                        We can start with this.

           INT. TRADING POST - LATER

           Glass is loaded with gear.  He signs a ticket for Brazeau.  

                                 BRAZEAU
                        You can pick up the horse at the 
                        livery in the morning.  
                         (off Glass’ nod)
                        I wish I could give you a room for 
                        the night, but...

           Brazeau looks to SEVERAL TRAPPERS standing across the room, 
           glaring at Glass.  
                                     (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 BRAZEAU (cont’d)
                        I cannot risk the trouble of 
                        letting a colored stay inside.   

           Glass glances to the trappers... one of them spits in Glass’ 
           direction... makes some MONKEY SOUNDS... daring Glass to 
           respond.  Glass just turns away.  

                                 GLASS
                        Won’t be the last night I sleep on 
                        the ground.  

           Glass nods to Brazeau, then walks out.  

                                 BRAZEAU
                        Take care of that face, Glass.  

           EXT. TRADING POST - DAY

           Yellow Horse and Three Feathers sit on their horses.  The 
           other horses are now packed with new goods.  Glass 
           approaches.  

                                 GLASS
                         (points to the tents)
                        You stay here tonight?

           Yellow Horse shakes his head... motions to the trading 
           post... the TRAPPERS.  

                                 YELLOW HORSE
                        Your people?  

           Glass looks back to all the white faces... trappers, drunks, 
           prostitutes.  He shakes his head.  

                                 GLASS
                        No.  

                                 YELLOW HORSE
                        You come then.  

           Yellow Horse taps his own chest... points back the way they 
           came.  Glass hesitates, almost like he’s considering it... 
           then he shakes his head again... points the opposite way.  

                                 GLASS
                        Fort Union.  

           Yellow Horse stares at Glass a long beat, then...

                        You spend life hunting enemy.  
                        Enemy wins.  

                                 GLASS
                        It will be over soon.  

           Then Glass pulls the Bear Claw Necklace off... hands it to 
           Yellow Horse.  Yellow Horse holds it... then proudly slides 
           it over his head.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        Thank you.  

           Yellow Horse raises his hand in goodbye, then spins his horse 
           and starts away.  Three Feathers does the same.  Glass 
           returns it... watches them ride off.  

           EXT. FORT BRAZEAU - NIGHT

           Glass is in the trees beyond the tents and tee-pees... 
           crouched on the ground... dragging the dirt back over the 
           fire and rocks.  He slides up onto the mound... feels the 
           warmth, and smiles... just a little.    

           EXT. FORT BRAZEAU/LIVERY STABLE - MORNING

           Glass cinches up the saddle on his PAINT MARE... straps his 
           gear onto the back.  

                                 BRAZEAU (O.S.)
                        Glass!  

           Glass peers over his horse... to Brazeau trotting toward him. 

                                 BRAZEAU (cont’d)
                        You are in luck, my friend.  How 
                        would you like to get paid for your 
                        trip north?    

           EXT. FORT BRAZEAU - MORNING

           Glass and Brazeau stand with FOUR FRENCH TRAPPERS, 
           (CHARBONNEAU, (40’s) TOUSSAINT, (40’s) and the brothers, 
           DOMINIQUE and LOUIS CATTOIRE, (both 20’s), all dressed in 
           BRIGHT RED SHIRTS with THICK SASHES and KNITTED CAPS.  
           There’s also a Scotsman, PROFESSUER, (40’s), the Scottish 
           flag painted over his eye-patch.    
                                           (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 BRAZEAU
                         (to Charbonneau)
                        This is Hugh Glass.  The man I told 
                        you about.  He knows the land 
                        better than the natives.  

                                 CHARBONNEAU
                        An African.  Très bon.  

                                 BRAZEAU
                         (to Glass)
                        They need a guide to the Big Horn.  
                        That puts you just west of Fort 
                        Union.  

                                 CHARBONNEAU
                        We hear the water there’s thick 
                        with Beaver.  
                         (off Glass’ nod)
                        Fifty dollars once we arrive.  

                                 PROFESSEUR
                        Minus ten for each that doesn’t 
                        survive the trip.  Twenty for me.  

                                 TOUSSAINT
                        Scotsmen should be worth half.  

           Glass watches the men laugh.  

                                 BRAZEAU
                        Safer travel with numbers, and 
                        fifty dollars in your pocket.  

           The men wait for Glass’ answer, then...

                                 GLASS
                        When do we leave?  

           Charbonneau pats Glass on the back.  

                                 CHARBONNEAU
                        Excellent.

           EXT. FORT BRAZEAU - LATER

           The men are packed and ready... climbing onto their horses.   

                                 DOMINIQUE
                        If I may ask, Monsieur... your 
                        face?  
                                              (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                              (cid:13)           Louis SCOLDS DOMINIQUE IN FRENCH.  Dominique yells right back 
           at his brother.  

                                 GLASS
                        Grizzly female protecting her 
                        young.  

                                 CHARBONNEAU
                         (smiling)
                        We will try to avoid those this 
                        trip, yes?  

           Glass nods.  Louis spews more FRENCH INSULTS at Dominique, 
           who CURSES LOUIS, then spits at him.  In a flash, Louis 
           tackles Dominique, and they roll around the feet of the 
           horses, trading punches.   

           The other Frenchmen just shrug... climb onto their horses.  

                                 TOUSSAINT
                        Brothers.  

           Glass climbs onto his paint mare... leads the riders out of 
           camp, as Dominique and Louis continue their battle behind... 
           finally realize they’ve been left, and scramble up... swing 
           onto their horses, and chase after the group.  

           EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY

           Snowy and cold.  Glass leads the line of riders through the 
           snow.  

           EXT. FORT UNION - EVENING

           But you can’t tell if it’s day or night through the blizzard.  
           Fitzgerald, Pig, Anderson, Bridger, Murphy and Stubby Joe 
           trudge through the snow in their snowshoes... finally reach 
           the bunkhouse.  

           INT. BUNKHOUSE - EVENING

           Anderson shoves the door closed against the wind... latches 
           it.  The men look worn and battered... wind-burnt faces, 
           icicles in their beards.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        I had enough of this cold as hell 
                        shit.  
                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                      (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                 ANDERSON
                        What’d you figure when ya signed on 
                        outta that St. Louis whorehouse you 
                        was workin’?  That you was headin’ 
                        off to paradise?  

           Pig snorts a laugh at Fitzgerald’s expense.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        I tell ya what I figured, I figured 
                        I’d be somewhere the piss wouldn’t 
                        freeze before I got it outta my 
                        pecker.  

                                 BRIDGER
                        Figured wrong.  

           Fitzgerald throws Bridger a glare... wants to throw more, but 
           Bridger’s returning the stare... hard... so Fitzgerald 
           decides he’d better not push it.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Wasn’t no reason to check traps in 
                        this weather.  Waste a time... 
                        while Henry sits warmin’ his ass on 
                        the stove in his office.  

                                 STUBBY BILL
                        Why don’t you go tell him that, 
                        Fitz?  Then start your hike back to 
                        St. Louie.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Shit, I walked up here, I got no 
                        problem walkin’ back.  

                                 MURPHY
                        Contracted for twelve months.  We 
                        all did.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Henry can shove that contract up 
                        his toasty warm ass, or I’ll do it 
                        for him.  

           The others laugh at Fitzgerald’s rambling.  

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        You don’t think I will?  

           The men shake their heads.  Fitzgerald grabs his gloves... 
           starts strapping his snowshoes back on.    
                                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                 ANDERSON
                        Just give that fat little whore 
                        you’re so sweet on a couple extra 
                        bits... she’ll have you thinkin’ 
                        it’s Spring already. 

           The men laugh as Fitzgerald walks out... leaves the door wide 
           open for the cold wind to pour over the others.  Pig scurries 
           over, shoving it closed.  

           INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - EVENING

           Fitzgerald enters... looks around the empty office.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Hello?  Captain?  

           The place is empty.  Fitzgerald eyes Henry’s desk... then 
           past his desk... to the SAFE... its door CRACKED OPEN... 
           STACKS OF MONEY visible inside. 

           Fitzgerald glances around... looks back to that safe.  

           INT. BUNKHOUSE - EVENING

           Bridger lies on his cot, WRITING IN A JOURNAL.  The other men 
           sit around a table playing poker.  The door blows open... in 
           stomps Fitzgerald.  

           Bridger shifts his body, protecting his words from 
           Fitzgerald’s eyes.  

                                 STUBBY BILL
                        Back from St. Louie already?  

           Fitzgerald pulls off his gear... warms his hands over the 
           stove.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Henry wasn’t in.  

                                 ANDERSON
                        Did you look in that fat whore of 
                        yours?  Cap mighta been in there.  

           Laughter from the others.  Fitzgerald ignores them... lies 
           down on his cot... lays his fur jacket over himself.  Bridger 
           glances at him... goes back to writing.   
                                        (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)           EXT. FORT UNION - NIGHT

           Dark and quiet.  The snow has stopped.  

           INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT

           Fitzgerald eases up from his cot... looks around at the 
           sleeping men.  

           EXT. FORT UNION - NIGHT

           Fitzgerald slips out of the bunkhouse door... across the 
           compound... toward the front gate.   

                                 MURPHY (O.S.)
                        Where’re you headed?  

           Fitzgerald looks up... sees Murphy in the Blockhouse on 
           sentry duty.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        To the river, Murphy.  

           Murphy squints down into the shadows.  

                                 MURPHY
                        Fitzgerald?  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        I left my rifle down there... don’t 
                        want it out all night.  

           Murphy laughs... he likes it when Fitzgerald suffers.  He 
           waves Fitzgerald out.  

           EXT. MISSOURI RIVER - NIGHT

           Out of sight from the fort.  Fitzgerald slides the ANSTADT 
           RIFLE FROM UNDER HIS COAT... hurries down the bank... 
           searches under the brush and snow... pulls out an OVERTURNED 
           CANOE.  

           He drags it to the icy edge... slides it across the ice 
           toward the middle of the river, where the water still hasn’t 
           frozen over.  The ice CRACKS UNDER HIS FEET.  Fitzgerald 
           climbs in the canoe... pounds the ice with the oar, breaking 
           it loose.
                                   (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)
           (cid:13)           The current seeps through the cracks... catches the canoe, 
           pulling it to the center of the wide river... sends 
           Fitzgerald shooting south.  He throws a glance back at the 
           shadow of Fort Union in the distance... growing smaller.  

           EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY

           Clear blue sky.  The sun glistening off the snow-covered 
           ground.  Glass and the Frenchmen are bundled under furs, as 
           they ride through the snowy trees. 

           EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT

           Tucked under the rooftop of trees.  A small fire burns.  
           Glass is sitting on his fire-bed, looking over a map.  

           The four Frenchmen are digging their own shallow holes... a 
           lesson learned from Glass.  Toussaint GROANS... tries to 
           stretch.   

                                 TOUSSAINT
                        I thought we would be there by now.

                        Two... maybe three.  

                                 TOUSSAINT
                        And then I hope to never see a 
                        horse again.

           GLASS - STARING AT THE MAP...

           ...then hearing Professeur’s O.S. SUDDEN MOAN.  His head 
           flies up... he peers into the dark trees.  

                                 DOMINIQUE
                         (laughing)
                        That is a tough foe, eh, 
                        Professeur?  

           Then, SWISH... SWISH... SWISH... THREE ARROWS shoot through 
           the silent night... plant into Dominique’s chest and stomach.  
           He stares at them a beat, then looks to Louis.

                                 DOMINIQUE (cont’d)
                        Louis?  

           Dominique drops to his knees.  

                                 LOUIS
                        Dominique!

           In a flash of movement, Glass shoves his knife into his belt 
           and grabs his rifle.  

                                 CHARBONNEAU
                        SAVAGES!  

           A HATCHET SPINS THROUGH THE AIR... slams into Charbonneau’s 
           chest.  

                                 GLASS
                        Find cover!  

           The world goes quiet again.  Toussaint pulls his pistols... 
           desperately searches for a target... but the woods appear 
           empty.  
                                                                (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                 TOUSSAINT
                        I don’t see them.  

           Glass peers through the brush... sees the nervous horses 
           pulling at the ropes securing them to the trees.  

                                 GLASS
                        We gotta get to the horses.  

           But Louis isn’t interested in escaping... not without 
           Dominique.  He drags his brother over beside Glass... 
           rambling in French for Glass to help his brother.    

           Toussaint is still frantically looking for the attackers, but 
           it’s like they’re invisible.  

                                 TOUSSAINT
                        I don’t see them!  

                                 GLASS
                         (whispers)
                        Quiet.

           But it’s too late... THREE ARIKARA WARRIORS pounce on 
           Toussaint... begin beating and stabbing him.  

           Glass FIRES... sends one of the warriors flying into the 
           bushes.  Glass grabs Louis.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        We gotta go now!  

                                 LOUIS
                        NO!  Dominique!  

                                 GLASS
                        Your brother’s dead.  C’mon.  

           Glass starts crawling through the brush toward the horses.  
           He looks back... Louis is still huddled over Dominique.  
           Another Arikara leaps from the shadows... Glass spins in time 
           to shove his knife deep into the warrior’s belly... drop him 
           to the ground. 

           Glass rushes back to Louis... pulls him off Dominique.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        C’mon!  

           Dominique MOANS, and Louis can’t leave him... crawls back 
           crying to his brother.  Glass looks up... to SEVERAL ARIKARA 
           POURING THROUGH THE TREES TOWARD THEM... led by ELK’S 
           TONGUE... the necklace of ears hanging around his neck.

           remembers him.    

           And this is it... Glass runs or he dies... so Glass spins... 
           charges into the trees, leaving Louis kneeling over 
           Dominique’s corpse.  

           Glass reaches his horse... yanks the rope free, as LOUIS’ 
           SCREAMS RAIN OVER HIM.  Glass swings up onto the horse... 
           takes off through the forest.  

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           Glass hanging onto the paint mare, as she gallops through the 
           trees... the animal’s nostrils spread wide, pulling in all 
           the oxygen it can.  

           Glass glances back... sees SHAPES BEHIND HIM... HORSES... the 
           Frenchmen’s horses... now being ridden by Elk’s Tongue and 
           four other warriors.  

           Glass digs his heels into the horse, squeezing every ounce of 
           speed from her legs... pushing her toward the clearing up 
           ahead... throwing another glance back... then looking in 
           front of him, and realizing it isn’t a clearing at all...

           ...it’s the edge of the world.  

           The paint mare explodes from the trees, then runs out of 
           ground... because she’s just galloped off the side of a 
           cliff. 

           A WATERFALL tumbles down eighty feet into a frozen pool of 
           water below... only the center of the pool is thawed.     

           The horse sails downward, its legs flailing for something to 
           stand on.    

           Glass grips the horse’s mane with one hand, just hanging on 
           for what seems an endless fall.

           The mare SLAMS LEG-FIRST INTO THE ICY SURFACE with Glass 
           still on her back.  The ice shatters... the mare SQUEALS... 
           then sinks beneath the surface, carrying Glass with her.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           UNDERWATER - AND GLASS FALLING AWAY FROM THE HORSE... A 
           CRIMSON CLOUD SPREADING IN THE WATER.  

           Glass loses his rifle... it floats to the bottom.

           ...gasping for air... seeing the crippled mare squirming in 
           the water.  Glass drags himself out of the water and ice... 
           unhurt, just shivering in the cold.  He looks up...  

           ...to Elk’s Tongue and the others staring down at him from 
           the top of the cliff... with no way to get to Glass.  

           Glass and the horse float down the melted, flowing center of 
           the river... disappear around a bend.  

           EXT. RIVER - NIGHT

           The frantic mare flails in the water... finally pulls herself 
           through the splintering ice... up onto the shore... gushing 
           blood... drags her BROKEN BACK LEG to shore... standing... 
           falling... standing again, limping into the trees, then 
           collapsing.  

           Glass crawls after her, his entire body soaked... convulsing 
           from the cold.  He reaches the fallen horse... cuts the 
           saddle free with his knife, and shakily pulls the blanket 
           off... wraps it around himself.  His wet clothes are already 
           starting to stiffen in the freezing air.  Glass is going to 
           freeze to death.  

           He stares at the dead horse a beat, then pulls the knife 
           back, and SLAMS IT INTO THE HORSE’S STOMACH... begins slicing 
           the mare’s belly open.  His hands shake so much he can barely 
           control the knife.  

           Blood and organs spill out, staining the snow.  Steam rises 
           from the remains.  Glass keeps on cutting... turning his head 
           from the smell, as he pulls out whatever doesn’t ooze out on 
           its own... emptying the carcass.   

           Glass peels off his wet furs, then does what we didn’t think 
           was possible... he begins crawling feet-first into the 
           horse’s hollow belly... holding its ribs up so he can slip 
           inside... curling up... SQUISHING IN... deeper... deeper... 
           until only his head remains outside of the horse.       

           Glass wraps the blanket around his face and head, then pulls 
           the upper side of the horse’s stomach down... sealing the 
           warmth inside... doing everything he can to survive.

           The dead horse... its fur white and icy... Glass’ blanket-
           wrapped head still protruding from the seam in its stomach.  
           And nothing’s moving... the whole world looks frozen stiff...

           ...until Glass’ head shifts... the CRACKING OF FROZEN FLESH, 
           as he lifts the upper half of the belly.  It’s like a cocoon 
           tearing open.  He rolls out of the carcass, hitting the 
           ground, and squinting up into the warmth of the sun.  

           The horse’s blood covers his clothes.  He slides the frozen 
           fur back over himself, then looks around, taking in the 
           situation... there’s not much to see... his rifle gone... 
           supplies gone... just the knife.

           Glass shoves the knife into his belt, unties the snowshoes 
           from the back of the saddle, and straps them on.  He gazes up 
           at the sun for direction, then starts walking over the snow.  
           Alone... in the middle of nowhere... again.  

           EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY

           From high above... the small shape of Glass making his way 
           over the snowy ground... heading toward TWO DISTANT SHACKS. 

           EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY

           A makeshift town on the banks of the Missouri.  Two 
           ramshackle structures... the General Store and a tattered 
           livery stable filled with horses.  

           INT. FORT TALBOT/GENERAL STORE - DAY

           More like a saloon that sells a few supplies.  A gang of 
           TRAPPERS drink and play cards.  A RUNTY MAN stands behind the 
           counter, watching them...

           ...until the door blows open, and in steps Glass.  He pulls 
           the fur hat away from his face, and what a sight he is... 
           scarred face stiff from the cold... pants stained with the 
           mare’s blood... ice frozen in his beard.    

           The room falls silent... everyone staring at Glass. Until 
           TRAPPER #1 snorts a laugh.  Glass limps to the counter.  All 
           eyes follow him.    
                                                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)

                         (struggling to make his 
                          frozen lips move)

           Glass stares at the Runty Man a beat, then...

                        supplies to...

                        ...to get me to Fort Union.  I can 
                        sign a draft made good by Captain 
                        Henry.  

           The Runty Man just stares at Glass... grins a TOOTHLESS GRIN.    

                                 RUNTY MAN
                        What the fuck happened to your 
                        face, boy?  You try to slice all 
                        the black off?  

                                 TRAPPER #2
                        Maybe we oughta help him do it 
                        right.

                        Best get on your way, boy.  

           Glass stares back at the men for a long beat, then...

                         (to the trappers)
                        Do you believe this shit?  

           Trapper #1 and Trapper #2 pull the SKINNING KNIVES from their 
           belts... start toward Glass.  

                                 FAT TRAPPER
                        Hell, I warned ya.  

                                 GLASS
                        All I need...

           And that’s when Trapper #1 grabs for Glass, but in a flash of 
           movement that catches them all off-guard, Glass has is own 
           knife pulled and JAMMED UNDER TRAPPER #1’s CHIN.    

           Everyone freezes.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        ...is a horse and enough supplies 
                        to get me to Fort Union.  

           Then Glass slides Trapper #1’s PISTOL from his belt... aims 
           it at the other men.    

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        And this shooter here.  All made 
                        good by Captain Henry and The Rocky 
                        Mountain Fur Company.   

           EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY

           The snow pours down on the Runty Man and the trappers, as 
           they stand outside, rifles aimed into the distance.  

                                 RUNTY MAN
                        Shoot him, goddammit!  

                                 TRAPPER #2
                        I can’t get a clear look.

           GLASS - GALLOPING AWAY ON HORSEBACK...

           ...with Trapper #1 sitting backward on the horse behind him.  
           Glass has the pistol jammed into his ribs, and keeps glancing 
           back to the men growing smaller behind him.    
                                         (cid:13)

           Trapper #1 tumbles into the snow.  

           The RUMBLE OF DISTANT GUNSHOTS... too far away to reach 
           Glass, who just keeps racing north.  

                                                       CUT TO:

                        Get after the son of a bitch!  

           The trappers exchange glances... don’t move.  

                                 TRAPPER #2
                        It’s cold as hell, Cees.  

                                 FAT TRAPPER
                        And he did say to put it all on the 
                        Rocky Mountain tab.  

           The Runty Man glares at the trappers.  

           EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - EVENING

           Glass riding the horse at a trot through the snow.  

           EXT. FORT UNION - NIGHT

           Thick with fog, and silent as death.  The moon fights its way 
           through the mist, sending an eerie glow over the fort.  

           EXT. FORT UNION/BLOCKHOUSE - NIGHT

           Stubby Bill sits dozing in a chair, his rifle across his lap.  
           O.S. CRUNCHING... getting louder... loud enough to nudge 
           Stubby Bill awake.  He sits up... peers over the wall, but 
           can’t see anything in the fog... just hears the CRUNCHING 
           MOVING CLOSER... FOOTSTEPS IN THE CRISP SNOW.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           STUBBY BILL’S POV...

           ...on the blanket of fog hanging in the air... that same 
           CRUNCHING, as a SHADOW APPEARS... growing clearer... 
                                             (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)

           out of the mist like a ghost... GLASS.  

           STUBBY BILL - STARES DOWN IN SHOCK...

           ...sure his eyes are betraying him.  But then Glass looks 
           straight up at Stubby Bill, and there’s no doubt.  

                                 STUBBY BILL
                        Jesus Christ.  

           INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT

           Dark and quiet... just Pig’s snoring rattling the silence.  
           Suddenly the door kicks open... SLAMS into the wall... and 
           there’s GLASS’ SILHOUETTE FILLING THE DOORWAY.   

           GROANS from the awakened men... hands moving through the dark 
           for oil lamps... turning them bright... until the room’s 
           fully lit... and they all see Glass standing there... eyes 
           floating across the room, searching for a target.  The men 
           just stare back at him, like they’re all part of the same 
           dream.  

           Except for Bridger, who’s propped up in his cot like he’s 
           been waiting all night... waiting every night... for Glass to 
           appear in that doorway.  A tear slips down his young face.  

                                 BRIDGER
                        I’m sorry.  

           Glass raises the stolen pistol... aims it at Bridger.  And 
           the young man doesn’t flinch... almost as if he wants to make 
           sure Glass doesn’t miss.  

           The other men just watch in silence, not sure what the hell’s 
           going on.  

           Glass holds his aim on Bridger’s face... a face that’s 
           haunted him... kept him alive.  

                                 GLASS
                        You took everything I had... left 
                        me to die.  

           Glass walks toward Bridger, the gun still raised... each step 
           of his feet on the wood floor is like the thud of an 
           executioner’s drum.    

           Mumbling from the other men, as they watch this ghost reach 
           Bridger... stand over him, the pistol aimed down.  
                                                 (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                         (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)           Suddenly, Henry hustles in, half-dressed from where Stubby 
           Bill awoke him.  

                                 HENRY
                        Hugh.  Wait.    

           But Glass isn’t listening... he’s locked on his target.  

                                 GLASS
                         (to Bridger)
                        Why?

           Bridger’s too frightened to answer.  

                                 GLASS
                                   (cont’d
                                         )
                        WHY!

           Bridger flinches at the burst of Glass’ voice. Then...

                                 BRIDGER
                        I was scared of 
                                   dyin’.
                         (beat)
                        But every day since, I’ve wished I 
                        had.  

           Glass’ finger tightens on the trigger, ready to make 
           Bridger’s wish come true.  

           The rest of the bunkhouse watches this execution in wide-
           eyed, stone silence, afraid to move.  

                                       that night, 
                                 GLASS
                        There wasn’t no 
                                   ‘Ree
                        was there?  

                                 BRIDGER
                         (shakes his head)
                        But I didn’t know that til later.  

           ANGLE ON GLASS’ EYES... frozen on Bridger.  

                                                   FLASHCUT TO:

           BRIDGER... IN THE CAMP THAT LAST NIGHT... STARING BACK AT THE 
           HELPLESS GLASS. 

                                 BRIDGER
                        I’m sorry.  

           Then taking off into the trees.  

                                                   FLASHCUT TO:
                                     (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)           GLASS... STANDING OVER LOUIS AND DOMINIQUE... PULLING FOR 
           LOUIS TO LEAVE HIS DYING BROTHER.  

                                 GLASS
                        C’MON! 

           Then Glass seeing the charging Arikara... spinning to the 
           trees... hearing LOUIS’ SCREAMS behind him.   

           BACK TO GLASS...

           ...still holding his aim on Bridger, as LOUIS’ SCREAMS fade 
           over him.  But then Glass’ arm sinks... he lowers his aim... 
           throws a glance around the bunkhouse.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        Where’s Fitzgerald and my rifle?  

                                 HENRY 
                        Deserted two days ago.  Along with 
                        about five hundred dollars of 
                        company money.  

           Glass turns to Henry.  

                                 HENRY (cont’d)
                        Helluva nice surprise, seein’ you, 
                        Hugh.  Let’s get some coffee to 
                        warm you up.    
                         (to Glass, but looking at 
                          Bridger)
                        I wanna hear what happened.  

           Glass looks back to Bridger... they hold a long stare, until 
           Glass walks out.   

                                 BRIDGER
                        Wait.  Please!

           But Glass and Henry disappear, leaving Bridger alone with all 
           those eyes burning into him.  Bridger looks to Pig, but Pig 
           just lowers his eyes... can’t even look at the boy.    

           Bridger leaps off his cot... runs out the door.  

           EXT. FORT UNION/BUNKHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Bridger runs barefoot through the snow, chasing after Glass.

                                 BRIDGER
                        WAIT!
                                             (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                             (cid:13)           Bridger grabs Glass by the arm.  

                                 BRIDGER (cont’d)
                        You gotta kill me for what I done 
                        to you!  Please.

                                 GLASS
                        You kept me alive for days.  Only 
                        let me die for a second.  That’s 
                        better than most men would do. 

                                 BRIDGER
                        But you saved me.  You saved me, 
                        and figured I’d do the same.

                                 GLASS 
                        Fear pushes us into doin’ things we 
                        never thought we could.  And we all 
                        gotta lay down at night with that 
                        screamin’ in our heads.  

           Glass continues on.  Bridger watches him move across the 
           grounds.  The other men are all dressed now... walking past 
           Bridger to go hear Glass’ story.  And it’s Bridger’s turn to 
           look at the ground in shame as they pass him.

           INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - NIGHT

           Glass sits by the warmth of the stove, sipping coffee.  
           Henry’s behind he desk, with the other men scattered around.  

                                 GLASS
                        Spent the night inside that dead 
                        mare, then hiked over to Fort 
                        Talbot.  

                                 STUBBY BILL
                        Christ almighty.  

                                 GLASS
                        And you may hear from the fella 
                        there about a stoled horse and 
                        supplies charged to you.  

                                 HENRY
                        We’ll take care of it.  You should 
                        go settle in.  

                                 MURPHY
                        There’s a couple fair whores next 
                        door that’ll ease the miles on ya, 
                        scars or not.  
                                     (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)           Stubby Bill gives Murphy an elbow.  

                                 ANDERSON
                        Jesus, Murph.  

                                 MURPHY
                        I just meant I’d go roust one of 
                        ‘em for ya if you wanted.   

                                 GLASS
                        She can take the night off, but I 
                        wouldn’t mind the use of her bed.  

                                 HENRY
                         (to Murphy)
                        Go clear out a room.  The rest head 
                        on back to bunk.  

           Murphy hustles out.  The others move toward the door, each 
           stopping to shake Glass’ hand, or give him a pat on the back.  

                                 PIG
                        I told ya I’d see ya up here.  You 
                        remember that, Hugh?  

                                 GLASS
                        I do, Pig.  You must have a little 
                        gypsy in ya.  

           Pig grins and nods.   

                                 PIG
                        I’ll see ya in the mornin’.  

           Pig exits, leaving just Glass and Henry, sitting in a beat of 
           silence, until...

                                 HENRY
                        Can I talk you outta what you’re 
                        planning? 

           Glass doesn’t answer... just stands, placing the coffee cup 
           on the table.  

                                 GLASS
                        Thank you for what you done for 
                        me... stitchin’ me back together... 
                        givin’ me a chance.  

                                 HENRY
                        I’m offerin’ you another right 
                        now... to stay here... let this 
                        thing go.  
                                              (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                 GLASS
                         (beat)
                        He thinks he let me die.  But he 
                        don’t know that he’s the one that’s 
                        kept me alive... for the chance of 
                        findin’ him... makin’ him pay for 
                        what he done.    

                                 HENRY
                        The law will make Fitzgerald pay.  

           Glass stares out the window... his SCARRED REFLECTION stares 
           back at him.  

                                 GLASS
                        You told me once that other men 
                        didn’t think like him.  
                         (beat)

                        accounta
                               no white doctor would 
                        But the truth is, most do.  I seen 
                        it my whole life... the looks folks 
                        give... the 
                                          I watched 
                               whisperin’.
                        my wife and son die from the fever 
                        on 
                        care for ‘em.  Wasn’t no different 
                        to them than if their neighbor’s 
                        dog was sick. 
                         (beat)
                        So I don’t figure nobody’s gonna 
                        care much that Fitzgerald took some 
                        dyin’ nigger’s rifle, and left him 
                        in the middle of nowhere.  
                         (turns to Henry)
                        Do you, Captain?  

           Henry doesn’t answer... because he knows Glass is right.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        I thank you for the coffee.  

           Glass walks out.  Henry just sits there.  

           EXT. FORT UNION - DAY

           Glass, Henry and Murphy stand by Glass’ horse, as he ties off 
           his supplies.  

                                 MURPHY
                        He said he was goin’ to get his 
                        rifle...

           And then Murphy catches himself... shrugs.  
                                     (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                 MURPHY (cont’d)
                        Your rifle.  But he never showed 
                        back up.  The next day I figured 
                        him mighta fell in, but then Pig 
                        seen the canoe was missin’.  

                                 HENRY
                        And the money was gone.  

                                 GLASS
                        I’ll make my way down river.  See 
                        what turns up.  

           Glass pulls the cinch tight around the horse.  Stubby Bill 
           comes waddling toward them.   

                                 STUBBY BILL
                        The kid’s gone... gear and all.  
                        Musta slipped out before light.    

           Stubby Bill waves Bridger’s journal at them.  

                                 STUBBY BILL (cont’d)
                        Just left this on his bunk.  

           Henry takes the journal... flips it open.  

                                 HENRY
                         (reading)
                        “Every day I think about what I 
                        done.  I want to tell Pig and the 
                        others the truth but am afraid what 
                        they’ll think of me.  I look at 
                        Fitzgerald and want to kill him but 
                        am afraid to try.  I am a coward 
                        and wish he hadn’t been lyin about 
                        the Ree that night.  I wish they 
                        had come and kilt us both.”  

           Glass considers the words a beat, then swings onto his horse.

                                 GLASS
                        If I run across the boy, I’ll send 
                        him back your way.  

           Glass sees Pig on horseback, trotting toward them, a big grin 
           covering his face.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        Where’re you headed?  

                                 PIG
                        With you.  
                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                 HENRY
                        Fitzgerald stole five hundred 
                        dollars from us.  Rocky Mountain 
                        Fur Company wants him too.  

           Glass sees what they’re doing... shakes his head.  

                                 GLASS
                        I can do this on my own.  

                                 HENRY
                        I know you can.  

                                 PIG
                        I’m just comin’ along for 
                        conversation.  

           Glass stares at the smiling Pig a beat, then allows the 
           smallest of smiles himself.  He pulls his horse around... 
           heads for the river.  Pig follows him, waving over his 
           shoulder to Henry and the others.  

                                 STUBBY BILL
                        You figure they’ll find him, Cap?  

           A beat, then...

                                 HENRY
                        I’m afraid they will.  

           EXT. ROCK LEDGE - DAY

           From above Fort Union.  Our POV on Glass and Pig riding south 
           along the icy river.  

           And then we see our POV is Bridger’s... standing along the 
           ledge, loaded with all his gear.  He watches the riders 
           another moment, then turns... hikes the opposite direction... 
           leaving Fort Union behind forever.  

           EXT. FORT TALBOT/GENERAL STORE - DAY

           The Runty Man behind the counter.  A few of the same Trappers 
           drinking... playing cards.  Just another day at Fort Talbot.

           The door swings open, and a FUR-COVERED FIGURE enters.   

                                 RUNTY MAN
                        We ain’t got no food to spare, 
                        friend, if that’s what you’re 
                        lookin’ for.  
                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)           The figure pulls back his furs, and we see it’s Fitzgerald... 
           cold and miserable.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Then what the hell have ya got?  

                                 RUNTY MAN
                        Whiskey and blankets mostly.  
                        Weather’s held back deliveries.  

           Fitzgerald throws a glance to the Trappers.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Gimme a couple bottles then.  
                        Goddamn ice shredded my boat.  Been 
                        walkin’ for two days.   

           The Runty Man hands Fitzgerald the bottles.  Fitzgerald pops 
           one... gulps some down.  

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        How much for one of them horses out 
                        there?  

                                 RUNTY MAN
                        Horses ain’t cheap this time a 
                        year.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Whatever the price, Rocky Mountain 
                        Fur Company’s good for it.  

           And those words stop everything.  The Trappers all turn from 
           their game.  The Runty Man glares at Fitzgerald.  

                                 RUNTY MAN
                        You’re the second son of a bitch 
                        come in here makin’ that claim.  
                        And the first one left a bad taste.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        That right?  Well I don’t know 
                        nothin’ about that.  Just that I 
                        need a horse.  

                                 RUNTY MAN
                        So did this other fella.  So he 
                        stole one... along with Lange’s 
                        pistola.  

           Trapper #1 nods to Fitzgerald.  
                                         (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                 FITZGERALD
                        Fine then, I’ll pay cash for the 
                        horse.  How much?  

                                 RUNTY MAN
                        How ‘bout you pay for your friend’s 
                        too.  

                                 TRAPPER #1
                        And my shooter.    

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Wasn’t my friend.   

           Trapper #1 stands up.  

                                 TRAPPER #1
                        Then from where I stand, you don’t 
                        got no friends at all.    

           The other Trappers glare at Fitzgerald.  The Runty Man just 
           grins that toothless smile of his.  Fitzgerald’s in a bind, 
           and he knows it.    

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Yeah, okay.  I’ll collect from him.  
                        How much?    

                                 RUNTY MAN
                        How ‘bout we say eighty...
                         (sees Fitzgerald doesn’t 
                          argue)
                        ...five.  

           Fitzgerald starts digging into his pocket.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        You boys are leavin’ me with 
                        nothin’.  Better be a helluva 
                        horse.   

                                 RUNTY MAN
                        Pick of the litter.  

           The Runty Man snatches the cash.

                        And when you see that scarred-up 
                        nigger, you tell him he’d best not 
                        show up here again.  

           Fitzgerald freezes... not sure he heard correctly.

                        When I see who?  

                                 RUNTY MAN
                        The black son of a bitch that 
                        robbed me.  You tell him that.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        What kinda scars did this fella 
                        have?  

                                 RUNTY MAN
                        All over his face.  Like he’d been 
                        took apart then pieced back 
                        together.  
                         (off Fitzgerald’s look)
                        What, you don’t know him?  

           A long beat, then...

                                 FITZGERALD
                        I know him.  You say he was headed 
                        up to Union?  

                                 RUNTY MAN
                        That’s what he told us.  Seemed 
                        real anxious to get there too.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                         (nods)
                        I’ll make sure to give him the 
                        message when I find him.  

           EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY

           Fitzgerald sits on the horse, staring back over the ground... 
           his LINE OF TRACKS LEADING THROUGH THE SNOW.  He turns... 
           looks south, then back to the tracks.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        You ain’t gonna ever stop trackin’ 
                        me.    

           Fitzgerald digs his heels into the horse.

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        So I’ll find you first.  

           The horse takes off, right along Fitzgerald’s tracks in the 
           snow.

MISSOURI RIVER - DAY

           Thick ice along the edges, tapering to a narrow stream of 
           flowing water at the very center.  

           Glass and Pig ride along the snow-covered bank.  

                                 PIG
                        Hugh.  

           Pig points.  Glass follows his finger along the river... to a 
           CANOE resting on the bank ahead.  They dismount... examine 
           the canoe... the letters “RMFC” painted on the side.  

                                 PIG (cont’d)
                        That’s it.  

           Glass runs his mittened hand along the gashes in the wood.  

                                 GLASS
                        Ice tore it up.  

           Glass looks to the FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW, leading deep into 
           the trees.  He glances up to the sky... clear and blue.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        If the snow holds off, we’ll have a 
                        good trail to track.    

                                 PIG
                        What’s out that direction?

                                 GLASS
                        Talbot and the Missouri.  Doubt 
                        he’d risk the river with the ‘Ree.  
                        Likely grab a horse, and cross over 
                        high... take his chances goin’ 
                        east.  When’d you say he skipped 
                        out?

                                 PIG
                        ‘Bout three days ago now.  

                                 GLASS
                        We best pick up our pace.  

           They climb back onto their horses... trot into the trees.

           (cid:13)           EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY

           Glass and Pig gallop across, their path dead on Fitzgerald’s 
           tracks.  

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           The snow is shallow here, the ground protected by the trees.  
           There’s a black spot where a fire once burned, and footprints 
           all over the place.  Glass is off his horse, crouched, 
           studying the site... lifting the charred chunks of wood.    

                                 PIG
                        You figure it was Fitzgerald camped 
                        here? 

                                 GLASS
                        Couple nights back.  But these 
                        tracks aren’t all his.  

                                 PIG
                        He’s travelin’ with somebody?  

                                 GLASS
                         (shakes his head)
                        Came in after.  Prints are smooth.  
                        Mocassins.  

           A little bit of panic washes over Pig’s face.  

                                 PIG
                        Oh, hell, ‘Ree?  

                                 GLASS
                        Can’t be sure.  

                                 PIG
                        Mocassins.  Could be Sioux... 
                        Blackfoot even.  

                                 GLASS
                        Could be.  

                                 PIG
                        But you figure they’re ‘Ree, don’t 
                        ya?  

                                 GLASS
                        I don’t know, Pig.  But whoever it 
                        is, they’re a good day behind 
                        Fitzgerald.  
                                   (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)           Glass walks, leading his horse, as he follows the tracks away 
           from camp.  Pig rides after him.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        And they’re on his trail too, so we 
                        should keep it quiet... don’t let 
                        ‘em know we’re back here.  

                                 PIG
                        Maybe we oughta think on this some, 
                        Hugh.  If it’s ‘Ree... we might be 
                        gettin’ more ‘an we bargained on.  

           Glass swings up onto his horse.  

                                 GLASS
                        But like you said, it could be 
                        Sioux or Blackfoot.  

                                 PIG
                        ‘Cept you figure it’s ‘Ree.  

           Glass just trots off.  Pig watches him a beat, then throws a 
           nervous glance into the trees... hurries after Glass. 

           EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT

           Glass kneels on the ground, building a fire-bed... dragging 
           the dirt over the fire and rocks.  

                                 PIG
                         (whispers)
                        What is that?  

                                 GLASS
                        A trick I picked up.  Helps keep 
                        the chill off.      

           Pig lays his hand on the mound of dirt... feels the warmth, 
           and grins.  

           EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - LATER

           ANGLE ON A MOUND OF DIRT... 

           ...with Pig sitting on top of it, a blanket wrapped around 
           him, holding a rifle.  His eyes dart around, searching the 
           night for any movement.  

           Glass sleeps nearby.  
                                             (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)           O.S. RUSTLING in the bushes straight across from Pig.  He 
           sits frozen... staring.  He eases the hammer back... waits... 
           waits... but everything is silent...

           ...until MORE RUSTLING... LOUDER... and Pig panics... 
           scrambles up to his knees, but DROPS HIS RIFLE.  It hits the 
           ground... BOOM... the shot explodes into the trees.

           Glass shoots up, rifle already drawn... and sees the DEER 
           leaping away.  Glass throws a look to the embarrassed Pig, 
           who shrugs.  

                                 PIG
                         (still whispering)
                        Hammer slipped.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           FITZGERALD - SQUATTING BESIDE A SMALL FIRE...

           ...staring out into the darkness, as the GUNSHOT ECHOES OVER 
           HIM.  Fitzgerald immediately throws dirt over the flames.  

           EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT

           Glass and Pig are loaded up, back on their horses.  

                                 PIG
                        So much for stayin’ quiet.  I sure 
                        am sorry.  

                                 GLASS
                        We needed to pick up some time 
                        anyways.  
                         (beat)
                        Just don’t aim that shooter of 
                        yours in my direction.  

           Pig snorts a chuckle.  

                                 PIG
                        I’d never do that, Hugh.  

           The two riders disappear into the dark trees.  

           EXT. WILDERNESS/CLEARING - NIGHT

           Glass and Pig riding across a meadow.  And Pig’s horse is 
           limping badly.  
                                              (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                 PIG
                        I need to hold up.  

           Glass stops.  Pig climbs down... lifts his horse’s front left 
           hoof... digs out the snow and ice.  

                                 PIG (cont’d)
                        Hope she didn’t bust nothin’.  
                        ‘Else I might have to hop up with 
                        you for a spell.  

           But Glass isn’t listening... he’s got his head tilted back, 
           sniffing the air.     

                                 PIG (cont’d)
                        Whatta ya got?  

                                 GLASS
                        Smoke.  

           Glass pulls off his mitten... licks his finger, sticking it 
           up in the air... feeling the wind’s direction.  He turns his 
           horse into the breeze... squints out into the night.     

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        Fix her up while I go take a look.  

                                 PIG
                        Just gimme a minute, and I’ll go 
                        too.  Don’t know what you’ll find.  

                                 GLASS
                        Probably nothin’.  

           Glass trots off.  Pig watches him ride away, then goes back 
           to the horse’s hoof.  

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           Splinters of moonlight shoot through the pines.  Glass on 
           horseback, walking through the trees... appearing and 
           disappearing.    

           He spots something in the distance... the slightest of glows.  
           Glass eases off his horse... wraps the reins around a branch.    

           EXT. WILDERNESS/CLEARING - NIGHT

           Pig’s bent over, the horse’s left front foot across one knee, 
           as he digs at the hoof with his knife blade. The horse jumps.  
                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                 PIG
                        Easy now.  

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           Glass moves silently through the darkness... rifle poised to 
           aim and fire... just like the first time we saw him, 
           perfectly comfortable in this world.  

           His eyes shine in the darkness, drifting back and forth... 
           picking up everything.  

           He reaches the glow... the remains of a campfire.  The 
           slightest bit of dying smoke rises into the air.  Glass 
           crouches down, studying the surround ground... HOOF-PRINTS 
           blended in with the other tracks.

           EXT. WILDERNESS/CLEARING - NIGHT

           Pig still hunched over, working on the horse’s raised leg.  

           Then beyond Pig... under the horse’s stomach, we see TWO FEET 
           walk up on the other side of the horse... take another step 
           closer...

           ...and then Pig sees them too... drops the leg, and shoots 
           upright... sees Fitzgerald standing on the other side, 
           leading his horse with the reins in one hand, and Glass’ 
           Anstadt in the other, ready to fire.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Helluva cold night to be out, huh, 
                        Pig?    

           Pig just stares back at Fitzgerald and that rifle.  His eyes 
           drift to his own rifle, strapped onto his saddle.    

           Fitzgerald starts easing around the horse toward Pig.  

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        Whatcha huntin’? 

           Pig makes a grab for the rifle.  

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           Glass running his fingers across the tracks.  Suddenly an 
           O.S. GUNSHOT EXPLODES IN THE DISTANCE.  Glass spins to it... 
           races back through the trees toward his horse.   
                                    (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)           EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT

           Glass at full gallop through the woods... veering between 
           trees... ducking branches.  

           EXT. WILDERNESS/CLEARING - NIGHT

           Glass charges from the forest... tears through the snow 
           toward Pig’s horse.  He gallops around it, and there is PIG’S 
           BODY face-up in the snow.  

                                 GLASS
                        Pig!  

           Glass hops off, rifle in hand, searching the darkness as he 
           kneels beside Pig.    

           And Pig is a bloody mess... a GUNSHOT WOUND in his chest 
           leaking out onto the snow... HIS HEAD SCALPED... LEFT EAR 
           SLICED OFF. 

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        Jesus, no... no.  

           Glass stands back up, turning in a circle, as he peers into 
           the distance around him.  But there’s nothing out there.  
           Glass SCREAMS in rage.  

           He turns back to Pig... crouches down over him.  

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        I’m sorry I made you a part of 
                        this.  

           As Glass looks at Pig, he notices something... takes Pig by 
           the chin, and tilts his head.  And PIG’S RIGHT EAR HAS BEEN 
           CUT OFF AS WELL.  

           Glass stares at it.

                                 YELLOW HORSE (V.O.)
                        He say Arikara take right ear of 
                        Sioux.  Left ear of whites.  Not 
                        know what they take from you.  

           Glass looks back across the clearing.  
                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                               (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)           EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT

           Glass on horseback, leading Pig’s horse behind him.  Pig’s 
           fur-covered body is draped over the saddle.  

           EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT

           A thick layer of ice covers the narrow river, thinning just a 
           bit at the center.  Glass kneels near the middle, chopping at 
           the thick ice to get to the water beneath.  He makes a 
           hole... dips his canteen down into it, glancing around into 
           the darkness.  Then he turns... starts up a slope.  

           EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT

           Glass rises up the slope to the horses tied in the trees... 
           Pig still laying across the saddle of his horse in his bloody 
           furs.   

           He moves to a SMALL FIRE flickering in the night... sits 
           beside it, and warms his hands. 

           EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - LATER

           Glass digs at the ground with his knife, building a fire-bed.  

           EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - LATER

           The world is silent.  The fire has burned down to nothing.  
           Glass is wrapped in his furs, sitting on the firebed, and 
           propped up against a tree, the rifle across his lap.  

           And Glass’ head has slumped forward enough that all we can 
           see is the top of his fur cap... HE’S FALLEN ASLEEP.  

           ANGLE ON GLASS’ HORSE... it’s ears suddenly perking up... 
           reacting to something.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           POV FROM OUTSIDE THE CAMP...

           ...behind Glass... drifting slowly closer.

           ...not moving... still asleep.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           PIG’S HORSE...

           ...sensing the invader... SNORTING... pulling at its rope to 
           get a better view... shifting Pig’s body on its back.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           FITZGERALD...

           ...creeping through the brush toward Glass... closer... 
           closer... re-gripping the knife in his hand for the best 
           feel, as he eases up behind the tree... behind Glass... 
           stretches the knife around toward Glass’ throat, then PRESSES 
           THE TIP INTO THE FURS.  

                                 FITZGERALD
                        Howdy, Glass.  

           Fitzgerald grabs Glass by the fur hat, snapping his head 
           back.  

                                 FITZGERALD (cont’d)
                        Look at me when I gut you, boy.  

           And the eyes do look at Fitzgerald... but they aren’t Glass’ 
           eyes... they’re Pig’s. 

           Fitzgerald stares at Pig’s lifeless face, shocked... 
           confused.  

           ANGLE ON PIG’S HORSE...

           ...and what we thought was Pig... MOVING... the bloody fur-
           covered arm reaching for the rifle on the saddle... the head 
           raising up... it’s GLASS... taking aim...  

           ...as Fitzgerald realizes what’s happened... drops the knife 
           and SWINGS THE ANSTADT over his shoulder... spins...

           ...to Glass laying across the horse... rifle dead set on 
           Fitzgerald... BOOM... BOOM... both rifles explode...

           ...Fitzgerald goes flying backward into the brush.

           tossing Glass to the ground.  

           But Glass is on his feet in a flash... racing across camp... 
           grabbing his rifle from Pig’s lap... charging into the 
           brush...

           ...but FITZGERALD IS GONE.  

           Until the flash of movement behind Glass... he turns... as 
           the butt of the Anstadt whips through the air... WHACK... 
           clubs him across the head, sending him tumbling down the 
           slope to the frozen river.  

           Fitzgerald swings the Anstadt back over his BLOODY SHOULDER, 
           snatches up his knife, and charges down the slope to finish 
           Glass off.   

           EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT

           Glass lies on the ice, barely conscious.  Blood oozes down 
           his head... over his eyes.  He wipes it away to see 
           Fitzgerald barreling down toward him.  

           Fitzgerald dives in attack, but Glass kicks up his leg, 
           sending Fitzgerald flying over... SLAMMING into the frozen 
           river, his head CRACKING THE ICE.    

           Glass rips the knife from his belt... moves after Fitzgerald, 
           his feet slipping and sliding under him.      

           Fitzgerald rises to his feet... the men charge like two wild 
           animals... crash into each other... knives flailing.

           They roll along the ice, blades glistening... slicing through 
           furs... across flesh.  

           Fitzgerald thrusts his knife down... plants it through the 
           back of Glass’ hand, pinning it to the ice.  Glass CRIES 
           OUT... drops his own knife to pull Fitzgerald’s out.  As he 
           does, Fitzgerald kicks Glass in the face, sending him sailing 
           back... sliding to the center of the river.    

           The thin ice around him splinters... cracks.  Glass looks 
           up... sees Fitzgerald stalking toward him, HOLDING BOTH 
           KNIVES now.  Glass is trapped...

           ...until he pounds his elbow down on the weakened ice... it 
           begins to give... he pounds it again and again... Fitzgerald 
           speeds up to get to Glass in time... raises one of the 
           knives, as Glass shatters the ice... drops beneath the 
           surface.    
                                         (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)           Fitzgerald rushes after him, but the ice cracks under his 
           feet, forcing him back.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           UNDERWATER...

           ...and Glass just under the ice, floating with the current.  
           His fingers search for a hole, but there’s nothing.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           FITZGERALD...

           ...making his way down the river, peering through the ice, 
           searching for Glass.  He spots something... stops... leans 
           close to make out the shape... it’s GLASS’ FEET.    

           Then suddenly, GLASS’ FIST EXPLODES THROUGH THE ICE AT 
           FITZGERALD’S FEET... grab Fitzgerald’s leg, pulling him down.  

           Fitzgerald crashes to the ice... it splinters around him... 
           gives away, and he sinks into the icy water... but the 
           ANSTADT STRAPPED AROUND HIM CATCHES ON THE ICE... holds him 
           against the current.    

           Glass drags himself from the water... stands... stares down 
           at Fitzgerald trapped in the hole... his face looking up at 
           Glass through the ice.  Glass lifts one of the fallen 
           knives... stands over Fitzgerald. 

                                 FITZGERALD
                         (through the water and 
                          ice)
                        Help me!  
                         (off Glass’ stare)
                        Glass... please!   

           Glass hesitates a beat, staring at him, just as he did with 
           Bridger that night in the bunkhouse.  And then Glass leans 
           down... grabs the Anstadt to pull Fitzgerald up.  

           Except Glass SLICES THE STRAP OF THE ANSTADT, sending 
           Fitzgerald floating away under the ice, as Glass holds on to 
           the Anstadt.

           ...floating under the surface... pounding at the ice as he 
           drifts, until his swinging slows... stops... his body drifts 
           away.  

           EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT

           Glass stands on the ice, blood dripping down his face, 
           holding his Anstadt.  He begins to tremble... not from the 
           cold, but from finally reaching the end of this journey.  His 
           eyes begin to fill with tears...

           ...and then he sees ELK’S TONGUE, and SEVERAL OTHER ARIKARA 
           WARRIORS watching him from the other side of the river.  

           Glass and Elk’s Tongue exchange a long stare, until finally 
           Glass SCREAMS OUT.  

                                 GLASS
                        I am Tatanka Wicasa!  I have killed 
                        whites and I have killed Arikara 
                        and I have killed grizzly!  AND I 
                        WILL KILL YOU!  

           Elk’s Tongue doesn’t move... just stares back at Glass... 
           soaked in blood and water.  Then Glass CRIES OUT at the 
           warriors again.    

                                 GLASS (cont’d)
                        COME ON!

           But the Arikara don’t attack... don’t move at all... until 
           Elk’s Tongue gives Glass the SLIGHTEST OF NODS, then turns... 
           they disappear back into the trees.  

           Glass watches them fade away, then collapses to his knees on 
           the icy river... exhausted in every possible way.  He begins 
           to cry.  

           EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - DAY

           Yellow Horse sits outside his tee-pee, whittling on a chunk 
           of wood... just the way Glass once had.  The BEAR-CLAW 
           NECKLACE dangles around his neck.  New Moon and Little One 
           play in the snow with other children.  

           As they play, New Moon stops... squints into the distance, 
           then smiles.

                                                , stepping out of 
           Yellow Horse looks up... sees Glass riding toward the 
           village.  He smiles... looks across to 
           a tee-pee to see Glass approaching.  

           Yellow Horse stands... they start walking to Glass, as the 
           children race through the snow after him, calling out his 
           name.  

           Glass slides down off his horse, leads it toward them.  The 
           children bounce around Glass, tugging on his sleeves.  Yellow 
           Bear spots the ANSTADT RIFLE strapped to the saddle... he and 
           Glass exchange a nod... it’s finished.        

           Then they walk together toward the village... Glass has 
           finally found a place he belongs... a place to go on living.  

                                                     FADE OUT.

                                     THE END
